conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>, combined with a worsening global shortage of healthcare professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, necessitates new approaches to expand access to care, lessen the burden on individuals living with these conditions, improve efficiencies and reduce unsustainable medical costs.</s><s xml:id="_m2UYJsy">Diabetes is a condition that heavily relies on self-management on the part of individuals, requiring them to perform and track multiple daily tasks as outlined in the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists' self-care behaviors framework (ADCES7 Self-Care Behaviors ® ).</s><s xml:id="_VZjSbDt">These behaviors include the management of medications, glucose, activity, diet, coping, risk, and problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7dFxpyJ">As such, diabetes self-management can be complex and challenging; only about half of individuals diagnosed with diabetes meet the American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EuuGJ2S">Each person may have unique physical characteristics, emotional concerns and environmental circumstances that could impact their ability and sometimes willingness to self-manage their condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MmRhrkf">Digital innovations provide novel opportunities to individualize a person's care to best match their lifestyle needs and circumstances and to support them as they live their daily lives with diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_7vY9VVb">These innovations also serve to provide actionable data and insights for the care team giving them a view into their individual self-management journey, allowing them to see what otherwise cannot be seen during infrequent and limited office visits, thereby facilitating collaboration and communication to optimize the care plan on a timely basis.</s></p><p xml:id="_w3EuRCy"><s xml:id="_ptCqwTJ">Digital advancements enable going beyond the current and traditional glycemic-centric approach to diabetes care to address an expanded set of risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, sleep, cardiac function), which are collectively referred to as cardiometabolic health management.</s><s xml:id="_NSPaPaA">Digital health capabilities lend themselves well to the free-living, behavioral aspects of selfcare as many of the challenges of managing complex cardiometabolic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity occur in daily life, not when the individual is with their clinical team.</s><s xml:id="_rSf3274">Having a common, ubiquitous personal device on hand, which also doubles as a coach for helping manage diabetes, and to track, measure, advise, connect to others, and to nudge toward better health behaviors just-in-time and right when needed, can better support individuals between healthcare encounters.</s></p><p xml:id="_pTwg8vt"><s xml:id="_9MMUZHV">2 What is digital health?</s></p><p xml:id="_9FhXvYf"><s xml:id="_ja9fxn9">The Food and Drug Administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> defines the broad scope of digital health including categories such as mobile health, health information technology, wearable devices, telehealth and telemedicine, and personalized medicine.</s><s xml:id="_QjAcsw3">This includes mobile medical apps, clinical decision support software, and artificial intelligence (AI).</s><s xml:id="_5dygHcK">Digital technology has led to a revolution in health care and has the potential to help clinicians more accurately diagnose and treat disease and improve the health care experience for the individual.</s><s xml:id="_QPWvNmw">Digital health technologies use mobile computing platforms, connectivity, software, and health care sensors spanning a wide range of uses, from general wellness applications to technologies intended for use as a medical product, in a medical product, as companion diagnostics, or as an adjunct to other medical products [devices, drugs, and biologics] (8).</s><s xml:id="_PJKVQ8F">A digital therapeutic is health software intended to treat or alleviate a disease, disorder, condition, or injury by generating and delivering a medical intervention that has a demonstrable positive therapeutic impact on a patient's health.</s><s xml:id="_DFwRsdQ">Digital therapeutics meet the following criteria: Incorporate design, manufacturing, and quality best practices; engage end users in product development and usability processes; incorporate patient privacy and security protections; apply product deployment, management, and maintenance best practices; publish trial results inclusive of clinically meaningful outcomes in peer-reviewed journals; are reviewed and cleared or certified by regulatory bodies as required to support product claims of risk, efficacy, and intended use; make claims appropriate to clinical evaluation and regulatory status; collect, analyze, and apply real-world evidence and/or product performance data (9).</s></p><p xml:id="_qJYRdxX"><s xml:id="_ytuDnFP">3 How is healthcare evolving with connected technologies and digital health?</s></p><p xml:id="_xV52adz"><s xml:id="_F69y84P">The availability of a growing variety of connected technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs), blood pressure monitors, smart scales, digital stethoscopes, automated insulin delivery, connected insulin pens, and other digital health devices including consumer-facing fitness trackers are enabling individuals with diabetes to measure and self-manage their health directly using the data collected as they live their daily lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9bUH7wq">Data aggregators such as Tidepool (Palo Alto, California, USA) and Glooko (Palo Alto, California, USA) can be used to integrate data from various sources for people with diabetes and their care team.</s><s xml:id="_edDBEFs">The goal of AI-powered digital healthcare is to collect and analyze the various data generated by an individual person and to support them by providing software-driven personalized coaching and insights, but to implement this "n=1 solution" at scale and across diverse populations and geographies.</s></p><p xml:id="_qV56CvM"><s xml:id="_5ppZT78">A vital element of success with digital health tools is strengthening the individual digital health user connection to their clinical care team.</s><s xml:id="_SJQjb6c">Digital health tools generate populationand person-level data, enabling healthcare teams to remotely monitor the health of populations more efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mQR67cE">With the increasing use of text messaging, regulated digital health apps, patient portals, digital social networks and video telehealth, it has become easier for clinicians to interact remotely with patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7EcGye3">A population health management approach that informs more effective and timely touchpoints with the clinical team when needed has the potential to help address health disparities and improve outcomes for individuals and populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pd6wuEH">AIpowered digital health technology can be harnessed to realize practice efficiencies and to improve access to and effectiveness of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref> as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_tyzW7ge"><s xml:id="_Fu2AwPU">A public-private-industry partnership in the frontier state of Montana illustrated this concept.</s><s xml:id="_k6beWNf">As part of a collaborative agreement between the Montana Diabetes Program (MDP) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the MDP sought to identify opportunities to expand access and participation in diabetes selfmanagement and education services (DSMES) across the large, mostly rural state.</s><s xml:id="_EX8bpSr">The goal was to explore and test innovative digital tools to eliminate barriers to participation and retention in underutilized DSMES services.</s><s xml:id="_aaSwb2N">The Montana Diabetes Digital Health Learning Network was formed as a collaborative project among the Montana public health department, Montana Coordinating Body of the ADCES, and Welldoc, a cardiometabolic digital health company.</s><s xml:id="_67Uvfwe">Eleven diabetes care and education specialists (DCESs) enrolled 198 patients with T1D or T2D in using the BlueStar ® digital health solution per its associated indications for use.</s><s xml:id="_PedRyTX">Engaged participants achieved improvements in glycemia, blood pressure and weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bFkwHfR">The DCESs were able to extend their DSMES services remotely including automated digital self-management support and iteratively develop best practices for remote physiological monitoring and population management.</s></p><p xml:id="_jueGjzn"><s xml:id="_VXsCmvg">An umbrella review sought to identify the active ingredients and mechanisms of action of technology enabled solutions for diabetes care <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YyUjPNf">Here we list the mechanisms of action for digital health and digital therapeutic solutions:</s></p><p xml:id="_ertdqhX"><s xml:id="_vmBzrjU">• Lifestyle or behavioral modification, particularly for diabetes and obesity but also with associated comorbidities in mind (hypertension and hyperlipidemia) and/or smoking cessation and physical activity recommendations.</s><s xml:id="_NcRfX7x">• Therapeutics, both insulin-based therapies (basal and basal/ bolus) and non-insulin agents • Biometrics, either to monitor vital information and to track progress with an intervention (glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, etc.) • Safety, addressing hypoglycemia, side effects with incretin therapies, sick day management, diabetes ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, etc.</s></p><p xml:id="_C4VWPup"><s xml:id="_8fCg32V">Diabetes care is transitioning from episodic, synchronous, primarily in-person care to include synchronous virtual care options and to continuous, on-demand, data-informed, asynchronous digital care better matching the demands of living with a relentless 24/7 chronic condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UDdQWzk">Many digital health solutions for diabetes provide live coaching on-demand for example, MySugr (Vienna, Austria) integrated with the Roche Diabetes Care Platform, Livongo by Teladoc Health (Purchase, New York, USA), Virta Health (San Francisco, California, USA) and Verily Onduo (San Francisco, California, USA).</s><s xml:id="_qmJYaVx">Others, such as the Welldoc application (Columbia, Maryland, USA) don't rely on live human-based coaching but rather, provide automated, scalable AI-powered coaching in real-time for individuals with integrated population-level and person-level data available to the care team, thus enabling remote monitoring and establishing criteria for clinical team intervention as needed.</s><s xml:id="_TF7b9SC">It is important to establish clear roles and responsibilities for clinical team members regarding who will receive, review and respond to population and person level data as digital-powered care models evolve.</s></p><p xml:id="_RNnM5JN"><s xml:id="_jedF6Gp">Numerous challenges will need to be addressed as digital health advances.</s><s xml:id="_tVZgBQv">Expanding access to technology will require publicprivate partnerships to address the digital divide and technology literacy limitations.</s><s xml:id="_He7sPRG">Additional clinical and economic evidence is needed to continue to demonstrate the value of digital health.</s><s xml:id="_ddG4ezH">Making digital health a mainstream aspect of care delivery requires significant buy-in from care teams and other healthcare stakeholders.</s><s xml:id="_yMrgQEa">To help build the case, leaders must outline digital health's benefits for all stakeholders, describe how to attain those benefits, and back up the claims with clinical and realworld evidence.</s></p><p xml:id="_xnNYJCQ"><s xml:id="_hfDXe34">Workflow integration best practices are essential.</s><s xml:id="_HTnMGKB">Digital solutions must be seamless components of care delivery, and solutions should be incorporated into the workflow, so they don't create additional work or cause inefficiencies.</s><s xml:id="_fWMEBKb">The goal is to integrate digital health into mainstream care delivery, so it becomes as routine as in-person visits.</s><s xml:id="_xm2QXxT">Person-generated health data should be incorporated into the data view that care managers have access to so that they can address gaps in care, care transitions, and readmission and gain deeper insights into the health of their population.</s><s xml:id="_NbjY7Vr">Engaging and activating individuals in their own health journeys demands a coordinated effort across extended-care teams, all of them working with the same data and understanding of a person's health status.</s><s xml:id="_xQ7dcnA">Through digital health, people become more empowered to self-manage their health and wellness when they have more meaningful interactions with their own personal care team.</s><s xml:id="_HRCZeeF">For individuals reluctant to engage, healthcare organizations should establish and implement support programs that walk people through their initial experiences, offer clear assurances that data is adequately encrypted, and make clear that they own their own data.</s><s xml:id="_pP6kEtt">Optimal engagement starts with clear support from a person's own care team-through either a provider including a digital solution as part of the treatment plan or through a strong recommendation from a health plan care manager, a coach, a technology champion within the practice or a physician.</s><s xml:id="_BYWyjE8">Providing initial and ongoing support in use of the digital tool configured to the user's care plan is essential as discussed later.</s></p><p xml:id="_uQv4grR"><s xml:id="_6nVWC7D">Building AI-enabled digital health capabilities is complex, requiring diligence in operationalizing extensive and diverse data sets, clinical evidence, data governance, interoperability and the use of a robust data intelligence platform that ensures privacy, security and scalable application in real-world settings.</s><s xml:id="_UEyfmFW">Good data governance ensures the mitigation of potential harm and helps to build and maintain public trust.</s><s xml:id="_gVcNzgs">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was instituted in 2018 providing comprehensive and robust data protection regulation across the globe.</s><s xml:id="_pNb3WSH">While GDPR addresses general personal data, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) enacted in the United States in 1996, focuses specifically on protecting medical information.</s><s xml:id="_jBqVyga">HIPAA sets standards for the protection of health information and requires healthcare providers, insurers, and their business associates to implement strict data security measures.</s><s xml:id="_mFYhNfS">HIPAA compliance is critical for healthcare organizations to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).</s></p><p xml:id="_khX4YSr"><s xml:id="_uJbe2KP">Additionally, payment models will need to be redesigned to accommodate digital health.</s><s xml:id="_M992Kxc">This will require digital health companies to quantify how digital solutions can lower costs and improve efficacy compared with other modes of care delivery or in combination with other modalities.</s></p><p xml:id="_SX2X5wW"><s xml:id="_z5uA9SS">4 Does digital health require regulatory oversight and need to be prescribed?</s></p><p xml:id="_4cf5Xnk"><s xml:id="_7JqpNVq">As noted above, the FDA acknowledges the wide span of digital health uses from general wellness applications to technologies intended for use as, in or as an adjunct to a medical product or therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7Mevm2c">Diabetes digital health solutions offering basal insulin dose titration such as the Tempo system by Lilly (Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) require regulation and are prescribed.</s><s xml:id="_GJfxyDz">Digital health applications such as Dreamed insulin decision support system (Petah Tikva, Israel) are provider facing and require both regulatory oversight and a prescription.</s><s xml:id="_z5CtgBs">In some cases digital health tools include functions requiring regulation and prescriptions as well as general health and wellness functions not requiring regulation or prescriptions.</s><s xml:id="_cX4rTRN">For example, in smart insulin pens, such as the InPen system by Medtronic (Northridge, CA, USA) and the Tempo system by Lilly (Indianapolis, Indiana, USA), the insulin dose calculator is regulated while dose reminders and dose tracking functions are not regulated.</s><s xml:id="_JFdb8RB">Other digital health solutions, such as the Welldoc application for cardiometabolic conditions (Columbia, Maryland, USA) include specific features that require a prescription and regulatory oversight, such as the rapid and basal insulin dose titration functionality, while other features, such as food and activity tracking and coaching, do not require either a prescription or regulatory review.</s><s xml:id="_cNwNZye">Both are critical for success.</s></p><p xml:id="_8AR7aEg"><s xml:id="_J8Q58bE">The product code used by the FDA for CGM-informed insulin bolus calculators has additional FDA requirements such as data simulation and clinical safety trials.</s><s xml:id="_vQ3myjE">A study to demonstrate the safety of a CGM-informed insulin bolus calculator that applies trend arrow and exercise adjustments to bolus insulin dose recommendations and provides real-time coaching found that use of the CGM-informed insulin bolus calculator by individuals with diabetes was associated with significant improvement in time-inrange (TIR; 70-180 mg/dL) without an increase in hypoglycemia or diabetes distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zw7PzRY">Recently over-the-counter CGMs have been approved by the FDA offering sensor
