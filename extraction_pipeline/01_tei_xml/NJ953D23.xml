type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wuDgRGv">For the world's poorest countries, the scarcity of human resources is a crisis fueled by the migration of qualified health workers to richer countries, inadequate investment in national health systems, and devastation of major epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DruU5DZ">Meanwhile, global health donors and advocates, ministries of health, and local leaders have higher demands and more ambitious hopes for health systems in resource-constrained settings than ever before <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GHkHhkp">To achieve the Millennium Development Goals and other global aims, several health policy organizations are leading campaigns to further engage community health workers (CHWs) through task shifting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, decentralized distribution of health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and other mechanisms to galvanize local communities to provide health services.</s></p><p xml:id="_deWkuy3"><s xml:id="_VJezwum">In low resource settings, CHWs build bridges between formal health systems and communities, working to improve the relevance, acceptability, and accessibility of health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SgJgK2c">CHWs serve many functions, including conducting home visits, assessment and treatment of disease, data collection, education and counseling and referrals for further care.</s><s xml:id="_zuNAfHe">By directly visiting households, CHWs can increase access to care for groups who are particularly difficult to reach, such as secluded women, the extremely poor, or the lowest classes of society.</s><s xml:id="_CY9N9nv">With their links to the health system, CHWs can also offer an entry point for and at times directly provide health services, such as contraceptive methods, home-based care for people living with AIDS, directly observed therapy of tuberculosis, and community-integrated management of childhood illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_nYBdmCX"><s xml:id="_qkjvzXR">Proponents argue engaging CHWs expands the pool of human resources for health, improves the productivity of health systems, and lowers the cost of providing services by shifting tasks from highly trained physicians and nurses to less specialized community members <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AAdt2RB">The evidence for the effectiveness of CHW programs varies.</s><s xml:id="_pWw39Xd">Much research demonstrates that health interventions integrating CHWs can lead to positive behavior changes and lower morbidity and mortality rates, while moving services closer to the communities where they are actually needed.</s><s xml:id="_jeFAsPe">Further, some CHW programs report equally high quality of care at lower cost when compared to traditional approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zxFBA94">Among other programs, however, data show that quality of health services delivered by CHWs may be compromised without proper investments in supportive organizational policies, adequate supervision and mentorship, quality trainings, and sufficient program resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_mKHGkfw"><s xml:id="_x6Xg6nZ">Increasingly, new mobile information technologies are being developed, tested, and piloted with CHWs.</s><s xml:id="_AyBtKaK">The use of mobile technology by CHWs to improve healthcare services has intuitive appeal.</s><s xml:id="_beUEsu6">mHealth tools enable CHWs to provide health services far from the clinical setting, in remote areas, and among hard to reach communities.</s><s xml:id="_cF753xt">Under this decentralized approach to service provision, health care can become more accessible to patients due to reduced time and expense of travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and due to the ability to seek out patients who are the targets of stigma and discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5kcJW7M">These tools may help CHWs overcome many of the barriers they face in the field, including balancing multiple priorities, lacking appropriate tools to provide services and collect data, and limited access to training and supervision.</s><s xml:id="_cRFCgfn">As CHWs are generally the most frequent connectors of communities to formal health systems, the use of mobile tools to enhance CHW performance warrants further study.</s><s xml:id="_hNWTrQW">The explosive innovation in technology has led to a proliferation of pilot initiatives and heterogeneity of research designs and outcome measures.</s><s xml:id="_xjeZfwd">Thus we systematically reviewed the literature to provide a critical assessment of the evidence to date on the use of mobile technology to help improve the services delivered by CHWs and the health of the communities they serve.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_aqndtbT">Strategies for Strengthening Health Organizations &amp; Systems</head><p xml:id="_ceG6VmA"><s xml:id="_cNdc2cf">There were four key strategies to improving the delivery of health services by CHWs through use of mHealth tools: (1) process improvement and technology development, (2) standards and guidelines, (3) education and training, and (4) leadership and management.</s><s xml:id="_MWek4gB">First, we found that process improvement through technology development was inherent to almost all studies (n = 27, 96%) and the literature supported the aim of developing interventions that are more efficient and less susceptible to human error through the creation of better tools and workflow systems.</s><s xml:id="_sFCGNDS">The most typical task for CHWs is the collection of field-based data, whether for client care, program monitoring, or health research.</s><s xml:id="_GWvVa8k">According to the literature, when equipped with mobile devices, CHWs became capable collectors of complete, high quality, and timely data from the field.</s><s xml:id="_F2YB5ka">More specifically, as compared to paper-based data collection, data collected by CHWs using mHealth tools had fewer errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and less data loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AuXj3YQ">Further, these mobile tools can enable real-time quality review and analysis for decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, as well as rapid response to cited health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_r6HS9JD"><s xml:id="_eyAGq74">Second, a third of studies (n = 9, 32%) used mHealth tools to ensure CHW compliance to standards and guidelines for health services in the field, most prominently through decision support, and alert and reminder tools.</s><s xml:id="_k2mhmUz">For example, a study using text messaging to improve outpatient malaria care in 107 government health facilities in Kenya led to improvements in drug management both immediately after the intervention, and six months post-intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vx4jD8d">Qualitative interviews demonstrated high levels of satisfaction with all aspects of the intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_R9cyeKF"><s xml:id="_qdY6ckR">Third, 28% (n = 8) of studies described the use of mHealth tools to support education and training for CHWs.</s><s xml:id="_yR9yKmC">Studies assessed the use of mHealth tools to reach geographically dispersed CHWs with accurate and timely clinical information, shared through multimedia formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AW6pWCh">mHealth tools were also used to facilitate the creation of professional networks, both among CHWs and between CHWs and their supervisors, providing real-time advice, information, and support for frontline health workers.</s><s xml:id="_KxHs7ua">In the Aceh-Behar midwives study in Indonesia, the use of mobile phones was positively associated with access to institutional and peer information resources, which was in turn positively associated with an increase in knowledge about best practices for providing obstetric care <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rJgMYdh">Similarly, the k4Health project in Malawi recently introduced an SMS text-messaging network to improve the exchange and use of reproductive health and HIV/AIDS information among CHWs.</s><s xml:id="_MmvZcCf">After an 18-month pilot period, the authors found that CHWs who used the text-message network were more likely to contact supervisors for clinical support from the field.</s><s xml:id="_gY7aMWw">The authors argue that timely exchange of information led to improved quality of care, particularly in cases of obstetric emergency <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_FJf6FVb"><s xml:id="_ceHF3Yy">Fourth, a quarter (n = 7, 25%) of the studies suggest that mHealth tools can be used to facilitate better practices in leadership and management, particularly in terms of providing remote supervision to CHWs.</s><s xml:id="_dsRBvBa">A salient example, the Tanzania CommCare project, used an automated text-message system to remotely monitor real-time job performance of midwives and to provide workers with alerts and reminders to their mobile phone about past-due patient visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_f3mPjFZ">Compared to a group of midwives who did not receive alerts and reminders, midwives who received these messages improved the number of timely visits to expectant mothers.</s><s xml:id="_w7VYNza">In further studies, researchers found the comparative effect of adding a phone call from supervisors to alert midwives about missed and late visits was associated with an 86% reduction in the number of days that CHWs were overdue in visiting their clients.</s><s xml:id="_uGmh9Da">Finally, in-depth interviews with CHWs and supervisors revealed high
