effectiveness of a smoking cessation program based on SDT for smokers in various workplace settings.</s><s xml:id="_6m4QYMP">Given that the prevalence of smoking in workers is higher than the smoking rate of adults, tailored smoking cessation program for workers should be implemented.</s><s xml:id="_z8c8Q5d">Therefore, this study aimed to develop a workplace smoking cessation program based on SDT using individual counseling and tailored text messages and then to examine its effectiveness on autonomous regulation, perceived competence, nicotine dependence, and tobacco abstinence.</s></p></div>

smoking cessation program using individual counseling and tailored text messages led to 96.7% smoking cessation rate among workers.</s><s xml:id="_rwyAuJb">Given that the prevalence of smoking in workers is higher than the smoking rate of adults and that combining tobacco use with occupational hazards could enhance the possibility of smoking-related occupational disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, development and implementation of the tailored smoking cessation program for workers is very important.</s><s xml:id="_epcmASS">Our findings indicated that autonomous regulation of the intervention group significantly increased at 6 weeks and increasing autonomous regulation maintained at 12 weeks, whereas were no significant differences in the control group before

type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4jHT5Fq">The reason for a significant increase of autonomous regulation in this study is that our program includes a variety of strategies for supporting autonomous regulation that allowed workers to choose effective smoking cessation options to enhance autonomy.</s><s xml:id="_xk7XVwZ">For example, workers are asked to identify several important life goals and indicate how smoking may hinder these aspirations.</s><s xml:id="_4fGtxvv">Our intervention is intended to help workers how quitting tobacco fits into their life and how best to make this change.</s><s xml:id="_T6TYGe7">Through such exploration of values between participants and occupational health nurses, autonomous regulation could be facilitated.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZHWEX68"><s xml:id="_asQWHAX">An encouraging finding was that the perceived competence of the intervention group significantly increased at 6 weeks and was still maintained at 12 weeks in this study, contrary to results about no differences in that of the control group.</s><s xml:id="_xKNYyBw">This result is consistent with those of previous studies that the intervention group's perceived competence has been significantly higher than that of the control group [16e18].</s><s xml:id="_h2cfEZw">The reason why perceived competence increased in this study is that several components of the interventions are designed to support competence of quitting smoking.</s><s xml:id="_RfydU2t">The Smoker's Health Project has shown that ways to support competence include helping to establish a behavior change plan and offering relevant feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YE64rE5">For example, workers in our study voluntarily established coping strategies for a strong temptation to smoke using their workbook, and tailored text messages were sent to them during 12 weeks.</s><s xml:id="_rgh3FX9">The study by Williams et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> has shown that the most important factor affecting the competence of quitting smoking is the ability to cope with situations causing smoking.</s><s xml:id="_Fybe6tW">To overcome smoking temptations, tailored messages are more likely to be remembered and perceived as more personally relevant than nontailored messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_p6AQQRU">Moreover, we supported the ability of the participants to quit smoking by providing tailored feedback on how to continue a smoke-free status and gave positive encouragements.</s><s xml:id="_STtPs5a">Before the beginning of the program, we identified who would be the happiest if the worker succeeded in quitting smoking, and letters or video clips from smoking cessation supporters were obtained to give positive support and encouragement to the workers by delivering the letters or video clips to the workers in the middle stage of the program.</s><s xml:id="_B4f24bw">Through these diverse perceived competence support strategies, workers could feel confident that they could succeed in quitting smoking, and this, in turn, increased their perceived competence.</s></p><p xml:id="_YTh6ph4"><s xml:id="_CrzB8kM">When nicotine dependence, self-reported tobacco abstinence, and exhaled carbon monoxide concentration to evaluate whether or not the participant succeeded in quitting smoking were measured, this study has demonstrated that the nicotine dependence, self-reported tobacco abstinence, and exhaled carbon monoxide concentration of the intervention group were similar to those of nonsmokers at 6 weeks and 12 weeks, whereas there were no significant differences for the control group in nicotine dependence before and after 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</s><s

to 43.7% was not high <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BTeWXxU">The large variation in the success rate of smoking cessation programs underlines that it is necessary to develop an effective smoking cessation program to fit workers' characteristics and to facilitate the smoking cessation of workers.</s><s xml:id="_cJ4TZrC">Considering the previous studies, the tobacco abstinence rate in this study is considerably high.</s><s xml:id="_seJdqWE">High rate of smoking abstinence in this study was explained by two concepts such as high level of autonomous regulation and competence.</s><s xml:id="_32AAw9E">For example, workers could continue their smoke-free status due to improvement of autonomous regulation, in which workers perceive that they are the main agents of smoking cessation behavior and choose diverse methods to continue smoke-free status or behavior on their own.</s><s xml:id="_JM77jWY">Moreover, text messages continuously have been sent to workers to motivate them to maintain smoking cessation status, when the workers had the highest craving to smoke, based on the content of individual face-to-face and phone counseling.</s></p><p xml:id="_pKVJXS8"><s xml:id="_hsYfRDe">The strength of this present study is that the workplace smoking cessation program for oil refining workers could be a sound investment to both workers and employers.</s><s xml:id="_bPKTShn">Given that SDT-based smoking cessation program resulted in 96.7% smoking cessation rate of workers, it would provide an attractive and cost-effective intervention to increase smoking abstinence rates of smokers in various workplaces.</s><s xml:id="_JDmyhVw">Furthermore, additional motivational strategies such as tailored text messaging and individual counseling are highly effective to quit smoking in workers.</s><s xml:id="_4BqkkFb">Thus, SDT-based smoking cessation program using tailored text messaging and individual counseling is possible to be disseminated across workplaces.</s><s xml:id="_sdSmBgn">Another strength of this study is that the dropout rate is low and attrition does not appear to introduce a bias.</s></p><p xml:id="_xWhNdry"><s xml:id="_JxMmvWP">Despite the significance of this research, some limitations should be considered.</s><s xml:id="_35TuS3b">Owing to a small sample of a relatively homogenous group of workers from one oil refining company, findings of main outcomes may not be generalizable to all types of workers with tobacco use.</s><s xml:id="_bzeDaxT">Another limitation is that there may have been a selection bias as participation were voluntary and participants were more likely to be motivated to quit tobacco use.</s><s xml:id="_QVnU2m6">In addition, assessing only the short-term effects of the workplace smoking cessation program is another limitation.</s><s xml:id="_VKk2tbc">Owing to the durability of our successful findings being unclear, long-term follow-up should be considered.</s><s xml:id="_zWF98jf">Finally, it should be noted that our results may not be generalizable to both higher and lower socioeconomic status smokers because blue-collar workers are more likely to smoke and have less success in quitting than whitecollar workers, which might increase their smoking-related health risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p></div>
