recent study  found that integrating SBAR with the electronic medical record decreased time to clinician notification and frequency of notes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KvJBcMC">Use of SBAR may also reduce nurse time spent documenting shift reports and conducting interdisciplinary rounds by enabling more focused communication; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> it may also help nurses in schema development that allows rapid decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Tp9dcRw">As communication systems

xml:id="_Um2XVky">In an ideal state, the nurse would provide more context, an assessment that included vital signs and recommendations, and an insistence of an urgent reply from the physician.</s><s xml:id="_zDpT2pS">Ideally, the physician would not just acknowledge a message but would respond promptly and indicate their plan.</s><s xml:id="_UKSs6WK">By responding with their understanding of the situation, this would let the nurse know whether their situational awareness was congruent.</s></p><p xml:id="_T2uax9y"><s xml:id="_rBKzukq">Our results are also consistent with literature that report frequent and lengthy delays in RRT activation.</s><s xml:id="_5KkNHtz">Downey et al. found that delayed MET activation occurred in 35% of patients with an acute change in conscious state and in 24% of arrhythmia patients with a median delay of 16 and 13 h, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9QGmNPg">In a large retrospective study of all RRT activations in 2012, <ref type="bibr">Barwise et al.</ref> found that 57% of all RRT activations had more than 1 h pass between the first appearance in the record of an abnormal vital sign meeting RRT criteria and RRT activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vEk9p69">The above studies found that delays in RRT activation were independently associated with increased risk of in-hospital death.</s><s xml:id="_MNkMSYR">While we did not find a similar association, key methodological differences (chart review of abnormal vital signs and use of lower threshold values for definition of delay) and patient populations between our study and the Downey and Barwise studies may account for these differences.</s></p><p xml:id="_7A7RNPS"><s xml:id="_vf4ZkGc">Improving communication of

the delay in escalation of care.</s><s xml:id="_kT9awJD">System level improvements could include communication systems that ensure closed loop communication.</s><s xml:id="_zMwUAvw">Communication tools could also suggest or enforce the use of SBAR in communication of deteriorating patients.</s><s xml:id="_BpKgKDJ">Decision support could also highlight the option for RRT activation.</s><s xml:id="_B55wUsE">Finally, increased use of secure text messaging and associated analysis of message content can be a powerful tool for identifying gaps in communication as well as providing feedback to clinicians.</s><s xml:id="_SB8PzWx">Advanced smart systems that incorporate both vital signs and electronic communication as well as predictive analytics could intelligently alert providers about patients who are likely to deteriorate and who may require escalation of care including the activation of rapid response teams.</s><s xml:id="_fKjeArb">For example, the EarlySense monitoring system has trend-tracking abilities that alert clinicians to vital sign trends, rather than just threshold parameters, which may increase its predictive ability to detect deterioration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DENAERr">Additionally, recent predictive modeling studies of cardiac arrest and ICU transfer based on vital sign, demographic, location and laboratory data

studied communication for patients whose deterioration led to ICU transfer.</s><s xml:id="_K39aAdJ">No communication between nurses and physicians about deteriorating patients in whom RRT was activated but did not lead to ICU transfer were included.</s><s xml:id="_peNdy2p">This limited our ability to compare our results to communication for patients whose health improved on the ward.</s><s xml:id="_9AwPjxw">Another limitation of this study is that communication between nurses and physicians about deteriorating patients was characterized solely via text message analysis.</s><s xml:id="_sGxSP7S">We had no information on the nature of information contained in phone calls or face-to-face communication.</s><s xml:id="_JmMrJCd">Therefore, it is likely that some messages did not accurately represent the full nature and extent of conversations between healthcare professions with respect to a deteriorating patient.</s><s xml:id="_P59fnjv">Furthermore, the use of text messages may be associated with lower RRT activation rates, as it is difficult to convey urgency or concern using a text message.</s><s xml:id="_EeDQSYe">There are limitations in the amount of emotion that can be conveyed through text messages and the way in which a text message is interpreted may vary depending on the recipient of the message.</s><s xml:id="_ydMEc8F">As technology use in healthcare systems increase in popularity, the amount of messaging within healthcare teams will increase.</s><s xml:id="_RyxTJVh">Therefore, it is important to design and develop a system in which urgency or concern is
