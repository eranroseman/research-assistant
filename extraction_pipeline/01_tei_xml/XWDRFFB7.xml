<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_E6xP69X">Typology of individual exposure to intervention and control conditions and measurement</head><p xml:id="_qQ32phq"><s xml:id="_T9P9vPg">Like other cluster randomised trials (CRTs), SWTs are generally designed to study the effects of a new intervention, such as a policy or staff training programme which is implemented at the cluster level, but experienced and measured by its impact on individuals.</s><s xml:id="_d7KZhqK">For example, in a situation where hospital staff implement a new patient management policy, the SWT is designed to establish whether this leads to better outcomes for patients who are treated at the hospital.</s></p><p xml:id="_TUMeQnY"><s xml:id="_CEqdm8N">Whilst the clusters in an SWT normally participate throughout the trial, experiencing control and intervention conditions at different times according to the allocation strategy, the ways in which individuals are exposed and participate vary greatly between trials.</s><s xml:id="_rbfTKUM">For example, in some SWTs, all individuals participate in the trial from start to end and experience both control and intervention conditions.</s><s xml:id="_FYETBY8">In other SWTs, all individuals who participate experience either the control or intervention for only a brief exposure period (for example, a hospital appointment), and the outcome may be measured after a followup period, that is, a period in which individuals are no longer exposed to the control or intervention condition but are still required to participate in order to measure the effect of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_uMTRkUU">These features of how individuals participate normally reflect how such individuals experience treatments and/or policies in the wider population outside the trial, and how they become eligible and cease being eligible in the population, for example how they first attend hospital and how they are discharged from care.</s><s xml:id="_WWGUnC9">These features are often outside the control of the trialists, but influence how SWTs are designed.</s><s xml:id="_kTEMnWh">In some SWTs, all participating individuals contribute one or more outcome measurements.</s><s xml:id="_rZg2rYm">In other SWTs where large clusters (such as cities) are randomised, then only a small fraction of the participants may be invited to provide outcome measurements, for example by a questionnaire survey.</s></p><p xml:id="_e8tdqHS"><s xml:id="_DSJuWYM">In order for SWT designs to be fully reported and to enable readers to judge their strengths and weaknesses, it is important to describe how individuals participate in a trial, how they are exposed to control and/or intervention conditions, and how measurements are obtained.</s><s xml:id="_cAPzdmz">In a recent article, Hemming et al. described three SWT designs, but these mainly considered how measurements are obtained from individuals, and not features of participation or exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_C8s2YZE">We first describe three common designs for SWTs identified in our review of 37 trials, then briefly outline characteristics by which the individual participation exposure and measurement can be identified and reported in an SWT.</s><s xml:id="_aEFt3by">In the supplementary table of our review <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, each SWT is assigned to one of these three designs, aside from two trials following non-standard designs described later.</s><s xml:id="_2HaNcdt">For each design we offer one detailed example from the review.</s></p><p xml:id="_wcYwB7c"><s xml:id="_D9X2fxq">Three main stepped wedge cluster randomised trial designs: individual exposure and measurement Continuous recruitment with short exposure Thirteen of the trials included in our review used this design.</s><s xml:id="_sN4q5nJ">Few (or even no) individuals participate as the trial begins, but more become eligible and participate over time, and are then exposed for a short period.</s><s xml:id="_fsvuTbd">The outcome is often measured after a follow-up period.</s><s xml:id="_EQHnukC">Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> illustrates exposure and measurement for the design.</s><s xml:id="_qkgRggv">The middle participant is exposed only to the control condition, although the outcome is recorded after the cluster has crossed over to the intervention condition.</s><s xml:id="_3gD8mrV">Single measurement, repeated measurements or time-to-event from the start of the individual's exposure may be chosen to assess outcomes, depending on the research question.</s></p><p xml:id="_K74hzYH"><s xml:id="_HXvmqQz">Case study one Poldervaart et al. are conducting a trial to investigate the effect of introducing a policy promoting the use of a scoring system to guide clinical decisions for patients with acute chest pain on arrival at hospital emergency departments <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uv37gak">Ten hospitals were randomised, and one additional hospital implemented the intervention in each of 10 consecutive months (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_BKJEV4k">Besides data collection during the rollout period, data were collected in the control condition from all hospitals for the first month of the trial, and from all hospitals once in the intervention condition in the final month.</s><s xml:id="_nAbFZjv">The primary outcome measured is the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event within six weeks from presentation at hospital.</s><s xml:id="_xbPHYUn">The published protocol does not state whether patients may participate more than once in the trial, nor exactly what might happen to patients presenting just before a hospital changes to the intervention condition.</s><s xml:id="_ujtnUNK">However, as the exposure of the patient primarily relates to their management within the first few hours of arrival at hospital, it would seem that nearly all participants will be exposed to the control or intervention condition, and not both.</s></p></div>

participants have been exposed to the control condition for a long time before the trial, they are likely to be stable in relation to the primary outcome.</s><s xml:id="_dtnWTTE">In this case it is unlikely that exposure to the control condition or duration on response to intervention will be an issue, so the standard analysis methods and interpretation will apply.</s><s xml:id="_JbF6NFw">Even if participants are stable at the start of the SWT, if the primary outcome is time-to-event (or rate of detection of a condition) then designs such as the closed cohort will always be susceptible to survivor bias.</s><s xml:id="_SDNn4cP">SWT designs where individuals experience both conditions may be a good choice, given constraints and the research question.</s><s xml:id="_vmUZVv4">In our opinion however, researchers should consider the possibility of carry-over effects and other bias a priori, and report these considerations when publishing the results of the trial.</s></p><p xml:id="_FnUxbfE"><s xml:id="_GZNVfHE">Importantly, we have noted that in some SWTs outcome data are collected a long time before or after rollout, and then included in the primary analysis, such as in case study three.</s><s xml:id="_TBWn2kw">We think that this is generally inadvisable <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and recommend collecting such data only if this does not reduce the data collected during the rollout period.</s><s xml:id="_hVdyRc3">Furthermore we suggest these data should be used only in an informal assessment of how the intervention changed the time trend of the outcome seen before rollout, or of whether the intervention effect is sustained beyond the rollout period.</s></p><p xml:id="_Fhsjayz"><s xml:id="_Znq5Ehw">Incomplete designs have been proposed in which data are not collected from all clusters at all times.</s><s xml:id="_CeAv48G">These designs may be chosen to reduce cost and measurement burden or to reduce step length when there is a lag period between when a cluster crosses over and when the intervention can affect the outcome in individuals, so as to facilitate more steps in the trial or even a shorter overall trial length (whilst possibly increasing the number of clusters in the trial).</s><s xml:id="_k2fvwuy">Further work in this area might address other approaches to restricting the burden of measurement, for example collecting data from all clusters at all measurement times but varying the proportions of participants measured, so that measurement is unbalanced across clusters.</s><s xml:id="_qECQHuU">One appealing option worthy of consideration could be to take measurements from a low proportion of participants from clusters in the exposure condition that is predominant at the time, that is, the proportion in intervention clusters would be high at the start, low at the end, and the same proportion as control clusters in the middle of rollout.</s><s xml:id="_utSfp2Z">This sampling option would increase the power from a 'vertical' analysis of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_KQ68Jzw"><s xml:id="_eqxmpRU">We believe that a well-conducted SWT, in which participants experience only one condition and analysis appropriately takes account of period effects, provides strong evidence concerning the effectiveness of an intervention, and that this evidence will be far stronger than that from a non-randomised rollout.</s><s xml:id="_NdCbc56">In our view, such a carefully designed and analysed SWT can in principle be as rigorous as a standard CRT, and deserves to be viewed as an experimental design rather than quasiexperimental.</s><s xml:id="_K3NB6Bh">The quality of evidence provided by an SWT is a controversial topic, but we hope that this debate will become more nuanced, recognising that the SWT is a family of different designs which each have strengths and weaknesses.</s></p></div>
