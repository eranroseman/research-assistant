Gebhardt, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Little, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Little, , 1999;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Emmons, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Emmons, , 1999) )</ref> provide the opportunity to unpack the personal goal structure of the individual at various levels of the goal hierarchy.</s><s xml:id="_Jt6Dmrv">The advantage of these measures is that they start from the perspective of the individual, rather than from the health care provider's.</s><s xml:id="_kwup6ws">They permit the identification of meaningful personal goals as well as allowing for the assessment of how other important life goals can facilitate or compete with the attainment of this personal goal.</s><s xml:id="_P9zzqtp">In other words, these forms of goal-based measurement reflect how a disease incident may have affected a patient's life perspective and how the patient envisions his or her future or recovery.</s><s xml:id="_UGQfzVR">Too many interventions for patients with chronic disease set recovery or disease management goals for the patient without considering what the patient perceives or desires.</s><s xml:id="_kY7gTmR">However, as documented in this review, research in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Deci and Ryan (2000)</ref> tradition has repeatedly demonstrated that "autonomous regulation" produces notable effects in terms of life-style changes, medication adherence, and disease management outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_e7h66NC">Unfortunately, we cannot simply ask a patient what his or her recovery goals are.</s><s xml:id="_Wva3WJk">Rather, a supportive goal elicitation procedure is required that gives structure to the assessment and helps the patient to reflect systematically about his or her aspirations.</s><s xml:id="_7fSKCwN">Likewise, we cannot simply decide what is in our patients' "best interests".</s><s xml:id="_JBGepTD">We need their active cooperation for such judgments to be maximally useful.</s><s xml:id="_TUuEDU7">Adopting medical advice regarding disease management requires an internalisation process through which the patient transforms external advice into a personal value or goal.</s><s xml:id="_aBcEG4v">Among other things, this implies that the advice ultimately gets linked to personal goals and that there is a supportive atmosphere provided by health care providers and significant others.</s><s xml:id="_bWkkSFS">Strengthening the linkage between support systems and personal goals may be achieved by using motivational interviewing, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bellg (2003)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_khGuCTQ">Supportive action brings us to the issue that, although some existing SR measures do measure goal support <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Little, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Little, , 1999;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Maes et al., 2001)</ref>, most do not.</s><s xml:id="_VhP48HY">Nonetheless, our review clearly highlights the fact that goal and autonomy support (by health care providers and significant others) are important predictors of goal attainment.</s></p><p xml:id="_JhxYxzK"><s xml:id="_cewrWQr">With respect to self-regulation process measures, two important issues can be raised.</s><s xml:id="_YkBnXEZ">First, with the exception of the GSAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Karoly, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Karoly &amp;
