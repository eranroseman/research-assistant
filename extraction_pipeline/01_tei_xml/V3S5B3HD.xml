<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Rh8HQ6P">Background</head><p xml:id="_F6Z3yMu"><s xml:id="_PdapCEn">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition characterized by elevated levels of blood sugar, which can lead to long-term health problems such as cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and neuropathy.</s><s xml:id="_aNRmJn9">According to the World Health Organization, the global prevalence of diabetes in 2014 was 8.5% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3jtxBPj">In the United Kingdom, the number of people living with diabetes reached 5 million for the first time in 2023 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, with approximately 90% living with a diagnosis of T2D.</s><s xml:id="_XSwnwGb">While lifestyle changes can help control T2D, many people will require medication to lower their glucose levels.</s><s xml:id="_tvfr2UH">Medication adherence is important to help lower the long-term risks of developing complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and even small improvements in glycemic control are associated with a significant reduction in potentially debilitating long-term health complications.</s><s xml:id="_6ZhENum">However, engagement with self-management is crucial for good glycemic control; people do not always take their medication as intended, and it has been reported that people who are prescribed self-administered medications typically take only approximately half their prescribed doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NeF9rbA">Authors of a Cochrane review of interventions aimed at improving medication adherence concluded that they were "mostly complex and not very effective" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VRDXymV">In addition, many trials in this area do not use an established theoretical base, which means that they may be missing content with evidence of effectiveness in changing people's behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x3gJwaq">As such, there is growing interest in harnessing simple and ubiquitous technologies to deliver evidence-based interventions to address this challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_fTXmx6H"><s xml:id="_XPQW2Xt">A potential low-cost approach to support patients with medication adherence and lifestyle management is the receipt of brief digital messages.</s><s xml:id="_2BpWEXX">Mobile health initiatives have the potential to deliver simple, accessible, scalable, and sustainable support.</s><s xml:id="_RSkRqF6">SMS text messages are often perceived by users as a familiar and user-friendly technology requiring limited digital literacy and operating on any kind of mobile telephone.</s><s xml:id="_PGPwkp3">From a health perspective, SMS text messages have a low per-person cost and are routinely used in primary care services in the United Kingdom.</s><s xml:id="_BRfx6bX">Studies have demonstrated that SMS text messages can remind people about their condition and motivate self-management, and favorable outcomes have long been documented in a variety of contexts, such as short-term weight loss, smoking cessation, hypertension, and chronic illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bvP7M9h">Furthermore, interventions that use SMS text messages to target behaviors such as medication adherence, diet, and exercise have been found to be effective in lowering blood glucose levels in people with T2D-a systematic review of 111 eligible randomized controlled trials evaluated the effectiveness of telemedicine on glycated hemoglobin in diabetes and found that telemedicine achieved significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin during all 3 follow-up periods (&lt;3 months, 4-12 months, and &gt;12 months) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ptyy4ZK"><s xml:id="_HspbBwJ">Nonetheless, SMS text messaging systems used to deliver health information and support are complex digital health interventions, and using SMS text messaging as a vehicle to support self-management requires clear theoretical underpinning and thoughtful message design to be clinically effective and acceptable to users <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and understand and explain how such a system may exert its effects.</s><s xml:id="_HqNj6k6">Although SMS text messages are generally reported to be acceptable to the user as an intervention format, aspects such as scheduling; tone; and evidence-based, tailored content are important considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gr6CqEP">Similarly, the effectiveness of complex interventions is critically influenced by the context of their implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uQy2pZF">Demystifying the assumed complexity associated with contextual variation is vital for understanding the potential strengths and limitations of the intervention in question.</s><s xml:id="_Q8uRzk6">Crucially, the chronic nature of T2D and significant health complications associated with poor glucose control point to the need for understanding whether, how, and why self-management interventions work in the long term.</s><s xml:id="_RzGBBTk">To date, there are few studies that explore the interplay between appraisal of receipt of such messages and user context over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p></div>
