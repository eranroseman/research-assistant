culture and careful selection of relevant cultural aspects that are essential to include in a DHI.</s><s xml:id="_zXP6UqT">With over 100 definitions, culture is undeniably a multi-dimensional construct that goes well beyond ethnicity and race <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_xVp33VE">Culture, as defined by Castro et al., is the shared "worldviews and lifeways of a group of people" 8 .</s><s xml:id="_qNThf4S">In the medical context, it includes cultural norms around therapies, the roles of healthcare professionals, carerelated family traditions, the acceptance of medical technology, and many other context-specific variables.</s><s xml:id="_tFHHKWc">Each definition of culture has different adaptation implications.</s><s xml:id="_JM3exjY">For example, defining culture with an emphasis on religious and spiritual norms may mean that the target group has deeply rooted and negative attitudes toward specific uses of technology (e.g., using smartphones to exchange pictures with healthcare providers of the opposite sex) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_QUrkrR5">On the other hand, defining culture focusing on community and family values might mean that it is essential to address social hierarchies and involve community leaders or family members to reach and engage people <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Zy6T72X">Understanding these concepts and then choosing which parts are essential for an adaptation are challenges that require cultural awareness, time, and close involvement of the targeted cultural group <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_3vgwbPh">Ultimately, the adaptation team should include members (e.g., community advisory board) that know, fully understand, and live that culture, also understanding its views on health and technology.</s><s xml:id="_jRsghX2">sub-cultural nuances.</s><s xml:id="_aJutAFX">Seemingly homogeneous cultural groups consist of multiple subgroups with various degrees of cultural differences (sub-cultures), and thus, different understandings of health and technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_7xHNxRJ">Wainwright et al. used survey data to assess smoking and tobacco use among young Hispanic populations in the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_37PYenU">Their findings revealed that, compared to other Latino subgroups (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_SWMX2BX">Mexican and Dominican American), Cuban American respondents maintained more positive beliefs about smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_HeTUhz8">These were linked to cultural norms around social interactions, with Cuban Americans voicing stronger concerns about the negative social consequences of being a nonsmoker <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_66buMq8">Considering that tobacco, mainly in the form of cigars, is one of Cuba's main exports, strongly linked to its cultural heritage and national identity, these findings make sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_AG5Xd3j">If such differences exist, successful adaptations must disentangle and integrate these sub-cultural nuances.</s><s xml:id="_HABbr66">That includes knowing how to segment and engage these groups without drifting into impractical, overly-long, complicated, and costly adaptations.</s><s xml:id="_yNmmN4H">The adaptation team needs to be aware and sensitized to such nuances and how they might impact how a DHI is perceived.</s><s xml:id="_xRNMPtZ">Engaging citizen scientists across these subgroups at the earliest adaptation stages may be one way to achieve that.</s></p><p xml:id="_x9y2kpF"><s xml:id="_QQGYJP3">Challenge 3: Justifying an adaptation.</s><s xml:id="_Q49SQ4U">Cultural adaptations come with risks and require money and time.</s><s xml:id="_7qSCdxq">An alternative to adaptations is the design of entirely new, culturally sensitive DHIs, which, however, comes with considerable cost demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_DCG9V38">Instead, adaptations aim for efficiency and adjust existing interventions.</s><s xml:id="_aqVAHFC">Yet, they come with risks because if not conducted properly, they might impose irrelevant concepts, leading to ineffective adaptations and wasted resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_3FJA8ng">It is therefore key to justify an adaptation.</s><s xml:id="_9BhSrwp">Castro et al. suggest that before adapting, one of the following conditions should be met: (a) an intervention fails to engage specific cultural subgroups, (b) an intervention shows decreased efficacy for specific cultural groups, or (c) some cultural groups of interest have unique characteristics (such as risk factors, resilience factors, symptoms) linked to the intervention's outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_j47E96y">While these are logical conditions, proceeding with an adaptation only after having enough evidence that an intervention is less efficacious for specific cultural groups is not always feasible.</s><s xml:id="_W4pNm7J">Most efficacy trials fail to include adequate cultural groups for this to be compared <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_DCw92dZ">That leads to follow-up questions, such as: can one justify an adaptation without robust evidence that it is less efficacious for certain groups?</s><s xml:id="_eHZeyXd">And is an adaptation justified based only on efficacy or should there also be enough evidence of other differences in effectiveness (e.g., acceptability, feasibility) across cultural groups? <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s xml:id="_7wBczUy">Ideally, these questions should be answered before an adaptation is conducted, considering several contextual factors such as the need for and urgency of a DHI, the feasibility of an adaptation and the availability of resources.</s></p><p xml:id="_jYCRt2h"><s xml:id="_db8vD24">Challenge 4: Balancing planning, iteration, and stakeholder interests.</s><s xml:id="_np8wVXd">Implementing a cultural adaptation requires a careful balance between planning, iterating, and collaborating.</s><s xml:id="_h54skNC">It also requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders, such as health experts, technology developers, community leaders, and members of the target group <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_6Teqf8A">Bringing those stakeholders together and balancing their views and interests is a delicate yet essential task <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_ZCce8yB">Those who conduct adaptations need to be culturally competent and attuned to how a DHI should be introduced into a community, as well as what impact it might have on its members <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Ayf8USs">They must also maintain awareness of their personal beliefs, values, and biases, as well as being mindful and open to learning about other cultures that differ from their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_azJpbUs">Successful adaptations often involve multiple stages of stakeholder involvement (e.g., through interviews, focus groups, workshops), following iterative rounds of feedback and adaptations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_7UZgtjU">An example of this was the adaptation of the WHO's E-Mental Health Program for overseas Filipino workers where the first set of adaptations were based on feedback from Filipino psychologists.</s><s xml:id="_WVPjeQz">They suggested changes, such as removing images of doctors to avoid pathologizing mental health, known to be associated with stigma in Filipino culture.</s><s xml:id="_v2hMwd4">They then involved Filipino workers, followed by further iterative adaptation rounds <ref type="bibr">26,30 .</ref></s><s xml:id="_hFRgfm3">Step-wise adaptation and feedback loops are important because correcting mistakes is inherently more expensive and time-consuming when technology is already set in place.</s></p><p xml:id="_ypjbykf"><s xml:id="_tge28Ct">Challenge 5: Ensuring intervention fidelity.</s><s xml:id="_8MwbZcF">Maintaining the fidelity of a DHI, i.e., delivering the core intervention components as originally intended, is another implementation challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_9gtUPvk">Adapting too far or inappropriately (e.g., adding culturally unacceptable content) could reduce the efficacy of a DHI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_3KnTfAd">Cardemil considers this concern misplaced and argues that adaptations that target core components stop being adaptations and should be considered as entirely novel interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_nCv8aPd">The core components of a DHI often are the underlying behavior change techniques, the main messages that are delivered, and the technology used to deliver those <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_nwqfnnz">Non-core and, therefore, adjustable elements often include its content language, tone, and layout (e.g., illustrations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_bgpSsvD">It is vital to understand which digital elements of a DHI are considered core and which are not.</s><s xml:id="_tdHadcA">Adjusting (e.g., changing the illustrations in a web platform) is costly and time-consuming and should be avoided if it alters a DHI's fidelity.</s><s xml:id="_7pf79Ky">The adaptation team should carefully consult previous publications, and those who implemented the original DHI, and, if available, follow existing protocols.</s></p><p xml:id="_XDDyVXU"><s xml:id="_h6C2hnJ">Challenge 6: Understanding the interaction between health, technology, and culture.</s><s xml:id="_TKtmbDw">Understanding how technology, health, and culture interact, as well as the target group's relationship with technology is an adaptation challenge unique to DHI.</s><s xml:id="_EBVJu3e">The links between health, technology, and cultural factors are bi-directional and inherently complicated.</s><s xml:id="_uExH4Bb">An essential part of understanding these links is a cultural group's relationship to technology, which includes beliefs, attitudes, and skills.</s><s xml:id="_WVmqVca">A large-scale online survey by Lee et al. suggests that cultural elements related to uncertainty, individualism, contextuality, and time perception all impact that relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_eeb2AHh">At the same time, culture influences health perception and communication, determining how appropriate a technology is for a specific cultural group <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_ZN9dWCb">For example, a DHI for physical activity promotion based on a wearable without peersharing options might not be as effective in collectivist communities that value peer support and social validation.</s><s xml:id="_PxrmAsv">Similarly, a mobile health app with lenient data-sharing processes might not be appropriate
