orthopaedic residents, and discrete elements of a typical visit were identified.</s><s xml:id="_ZCu2CTR">These elements included (1) postoperative dressing removal, (2) postoperative suture removal, (3) documentation of wound appearance, (4) evaluation of median nerve symptoms and (5) documentation of a physical exam including motor exam and range of motion.</s><s xml:id="_HYQaf7a">We developed a web-based application that allowed patients using Apple iOS and Android operating systems to complete online modules corresponding to each of these elements (see Figure <ref type="figure"

rates consistent with those reported in the literature.</s><s xml:id="_mKjCVmP">With widespread adoption of these technologies, combined with the increasing geographic centralization of specialty care, there is great potential for the integration and augmentation of existing healthcare practices with digital communication.</s></p><p xml:id="_uAKUkxB"><s xml:id="_cdaGXxA">Several studies have investigated innovative means to improve perioperative care.</s><s xml:id="_JJXEKAM">Ball et al. implemented a single visit clinical service for CTR that completed both diagnostics and treatment in

target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref></s><s xml:id="_BmEU9rG">]<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> Our group successfully implemented a software platform to accomplish remotely and asynchronously the elements of a typical postoperative CTR visit.</s><s xml:id="_nn6fwGW">While several software modalities were considered during the development phase, a text-message-link-to-webapplication was ultimately chosen for a number of strategic reasons.</s><s xml:id="_zQAK9jn">Text-message-link-to-web-application does not require platform-specific development, and recent additions to Hypertext Markup Language Version 5 (HTML5) facilitate access to native smartphone photo and video cameras through the mobile browser without additional software support.</s><s xml:id="_krmC7mr">Text-message-link-to-webapplications do not require the patient to perform any tasks prior to study involvement (for example, to download and install a specific software application) and can be initiated on-the-fly via a single message with knowledge only of a patient's mobile phone number.</s><s xml:id="_Drj8xy4">Additionally, a web application with rich content including video and audio can be altered by software engineers sequentially in form or structure without requiring a user to update a locally-installed application.</s></p><p xml:id="_geX7xFF"><s xml:id="_sRQYtzR">During the eight-patient pilot, several modifications were made to the study protocol and to the software application.</s><s xml:id="_tSUCeX5">Due to reported difficulties with patients removing horizontal mattress sutures, the protocol was altered for subsequent patients to receive figure-ofeight sutures, which were substantially easier for them to remove.</s><s xml:id="_NsZmJNG">The software instructions were modified to include more detail and clarified to alleviate confusion based upon informal patient feedback.</s><s xml:id="_TfznMYR">The interface was modified to alert patients to the possibility of delays between steps if large media files were being uploaded over slow wireless connections.</s><s xml:id="_hBJfbHe">The protocol and interface did not require additional changes for the subsequent eight patients.</s></p><p xml:id="_2WMgfy5"><s xml:id="_U93PjFb">This study seeks to identify whether a softwarebased 'virtual visit' is a safe and satisfactory substitute for an in-person clinical interaction with a care provider.</s><s xml:id="_P5gggfe">We acknowledge that there are intangible aspects of an in-person clinical visit that cannot be replicated via a virtual software experience.</s><s xml:id="_TMXCXwu">However, when a clinical visit is distilled to a finite collection of elements deemed critical for clinical progression and decision-making, it is evident that these goals can be accomplished via software communication.</s><s xml:id="_CyM4x48">Based upon our preliminary results in a small cohort of patients, it seems that these tasks can be safely and reliably accomplished by certain subset of patients.</s><s xml:id="_HjJWWrD">Multiple patients were able to remove their postoperative dressings, remove their sutures with or without the assistance of a friend or family member, capture a photo of their surgical wound adequate for clinical decision-making by a healthcare provider, answer a question addressing their postoperative median nerve symptoms, and capture a clinically adequate video of physical exam manoeuvres sufficient for motor and range-of-motion examination.</s><s xml:id="_6Zb3h9B">Additionally, the data obtained from the application for wound, symptom, and physical exam assessment agreed strongly with the clinical documentation from in-person visits.</s></p><p xml:id="_EtHr59J"><s xml:id="_P2mAuJV">Based upon these results, however, it remains difficult to predict which patients will fail to satisfactorily complete all the elements of a digital visit.</s><s xml:id="_tM43cq8">No studied characteristics of patients were predictive of successful study completion.</s><s xml:id="_AvPc7zV">Anecdotally, patients who expressed confidence in their ability to accomplish the goals of the study at the time of enrolment could often reliably do so.</s><s xml:id="_hVSTbYK">Patients amenable to following up via this modality are likely those with significant distances to travel in order to access care, those with friends or family with a background in healthcare, or young patients who are accustomed to using technology for communication.</s><s xml:id="_YurwJMd">Further research with larger numbers of participants is necessary to investigate patient factors predictive of success.</s></p><p xml:id="_phyaKpr"><s xml:id="_hmNwsGg">All of the patients who submitted a wound photo and physical exam video provided photos and videos of sufficient quality for clinical assessment, except for one photo deemed too blurry for analysis.</s><s xml:id="_3CVHNnf">The wounds were clearly visible in the photos, and the physical exam videos mirrored the instructed motions precisely and kept the patient's hand in the viewing frame.</s><s xml:id="_R6Nvus2">Surgery on the dominant side did not negatively impact the ability of the patients to complete the modules, including suture removal.</s><s xml:id="_H5gBTe4">One patient was able to expediently remove his horizontal mattress sutures with his non-dominant hand, unassisted.</s></p><p xml:id="_TWfWfGz"><s xml:id="_P342J27">At least one patient began but did not finish the software modules.</s><s xml:id="_gSHZg5y">Five of the initial eight patients were unsuccessful in removing horizontal mattress sutures.</s><s xml:id="_eP8jHuM">Of the subsequent eight patients, seven were successful and one patient declined to remove the sutures.</s><s xml:id="_2TtYzyp">While this study is not powered to detect a significant difference, these data would suggest that horizontal mattress sutures should be avoided in favour of figure-of-eight or simple sutures for patients attempting autonomous removal.</s></p><p xml:id="_UJPZjYt"><s xml:id="_djdn3VJ">Despite only 50% of patients completing fully all software modules without omissions, most omissions were of a single module step or were due to difficulty with horizontal mattress suture removal.</s><s xml:id="_CCTUq2P">Further refinements to the interface design of the modules, more careful selection of patients capable of suture removal, and the exclusive use of figure-of-eight sutures could alleviate many of these failures.</s></p><p xml:id="_GjkBPuM"><s xml:id="_RSb9jAt">Finally, the implementation of a software visit did not seem to discourage patients from contacting healthcare providers directly if concern for complications arose during the initial postoperative period.</s><s xml:id="_znSwTj6">On multiple occasions, patients involved in the study called or arranged in-person evaluation of their surgical extremity.</s><s xml:id="_AKvsdwD">The only documented wound complication (a partial superficial dehiscence) unfortunately did not have a corresponding wound photo available for comparison.</s></p><p xml:id="_6E7eMx5"><s xml:id="_9uPNWkb">There are several limitations to the study.</s><s xml:id="_QjyfVzN">The number of participants is small.</s><s xml:id="_UYaNccY">The study protocol and software application was altered during the pilot phase of the study.</s><s xml:id="_xV6GcXq">Software malfunction potentially interfered with the ability of some patients to successfully complete all steps of the postoperative module.</s><s xml:id="_FPZC87u">The analysis of corresponding in-person clinical visits relied upon the documentation of those visits, which may have incompletely portrayed the extent of clinical elements accomplished during the visit.</s></p><p xml:id="_Bn2QGv7"><s xml:id="_aUXX7dF">Our group successfully implemented a software application that facilitated a virtual postoperative clinical visit and enabled nearly all participants to respond to a question about their symptoms, provide clinical assessment of their wound via a photo, and record a video of their range of motion following endoscopic or open CTR.</s><s xml:id="_bMV65Fw">Patients struggled most with performing suture removal.</s><s xml:id="_TPbFZU6">Further well-powered studies are needed to describe patient characteristics that predispose participants to a successful 'virtual visit'.</s></p></div><figure
