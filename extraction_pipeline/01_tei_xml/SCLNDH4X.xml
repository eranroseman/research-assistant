that the majority of self-researchers we talked to express enjoyment and involvement in research-related activities, like data gathering or using digital tools, as well as in other stages of personal inquiry, providing a reinforcing motivation to engage in personal science.</s><s xml:id="_Pn7KQfR">Enjoying data and "tech-related" activities (like customizing tools, combining data sources or plotting results), which imply practical knowledge needed for working with self-tracking technology, seems to be a relevant source of motivation for several interviewees, understood as a form of non compliant, creative agency.</s><s xml:id="_S5UrdHH">An example is expressed by Participant #04, who explores the use of new wearable technologies and other domestic sensors, and is interested in how these tools can be combined for new personal data visualizations.</s><s xml:id="_A7aT4qk">In this case the enjoyment is connected to several questions the participant is trying to solve about personal mood, attention and mental focus (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Result 5).</s></p><p xml:id="_29qgE6q"><s xml:id="_eMNw6Tk">As "early-adopters", the acquisition of technical-related knowledge is a recurrent motivation for interviewees who have technological skills, and express their continuous engagement as a sort of "hacker attitude" unfolding iteratively.</s><s xml:id="_r9rjdms">Participant #08 referred to this attitude in relation to a preference for passive tracking instead of actively logging data via apps or other tools, in this case practicing self-research for preventing hay fever and pollen allergy (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Result 6).</s><s xml:id="_MBumZ7X">Similarly, participants frequently mention their discovery of insights from data, usually through inductive approaches by looking for patterns and correlations rather than trying to solve specific research questions or hypotheses (Table 2, Result 7), as another motivation that reinforces their practice.</s><s xml:id="_7EJfF3g">Participant #16 expresses this type of motivation that is driven by "tech-related" enjoyment, in relation to open collaboration and re-use of other self-researcher's innovations, pointing to the limitations of "one-size-fits-all" tools (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Result 8).</s><s xml:id="_m4uGDKT">This key motivation of exploring new technologies leads some self-researchers who are non-patients to appropriate open source tools developed for medical use, like continuous glucose monitoring devices, blood test kits or electroencephalography sensors.</s><s xml:id="_pU7bpD8">This type of intrinsic motivation that is connected to immersive and focused activity is mentioned by the majority of interviewees that are active in the studied community, based on an experience accumulated over time when sharing their approaches or results with other self-researchers.</s><s xml:id="_rg2Hvhn">In a wider sense, this motivation also relates to the background, personal history or mindsets of participants, which in different cases can be traced back to early research-related curiosity in previous periods of life (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, <ref type="table">Result 9</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_asjQuHf">Importantly, for some researchers such early interest in science and research does not relate to current wearable technologies or sophisticated datagathering tools, as they adopt techniques like journaling on paper or the use of simple spreadsheets.</s></p><p xml:id="_WNvTKzD"><s xml:id="_d3kq3Pf">Overall, the engagement in self-research activities driven by enjoyment and curiosity relate significantly to additional transversal motivations for a better understanding of oneself's body, behavior or activity, and in this sense to questions of personal agency and reflexivity.</s><s xml:id="_dkWJNV4">As expressed by Participant #02, who combines different sources of data for personal questions on wellbeing and quality of life, regarding the importance of curiosity and self-discovery, as well as a "growth mindset" (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Result 10).</s><s xml:id="_hMs3V3y">The continuous engagement in self-research to satisfy research curiosity about oneself is another key aspect in how participants enjoy research-related activities, learning by practice about ways to generate and integrate self-knowledge.</s><s xml:id="_YkZXTk3">Starting from personal interests and questions connected to the motivations described above, several interviewees mention joyfulness and playfulness in connection to being involved in researchrelated activity.</s><s xml:id="_Swq8rbg">As we will see later in more detail, this points to a general observation that personal science practitioners, when engaged in community activities for sharing and discussing experiences, tend to be more intentional, focused on specific questions and ways to obtain research results than the usual perception about quantified-selfers as mere technology users, here moved by a need to identify research focuses or questions, and possible interventions to answer them.</s></p><p xml:id="_m4nNxNd"><s xml:id="_k8CaJSW">The minor role of extrinsic motivations for doing selfresearch While some participants show an overlap of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations that relate to their professional activity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Result 11), we find relatively few examples of interviewees influenced by the possibility of advancing on their academic or professional careers, pointing to a relatively minor role of extrinsic motivations in personal science.</s><s xml:id="_PurMPWm">Some participants who are developing their PhDs in parallel to self-research on related topics mention this type of motivation as a relevant factor in their engagement with self-research, in order to obtain or apply new skills connecting their academic work with their self-research activity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Result 12).</s><s

<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gimpel et al., 2013)</ref> or to improve well-being for "self-optimization" <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ruckenstein, 2014)</ref>, leading to systematic approaches

limited to metrics and interpretations provided by third parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajana, 2021)</ref>; instead self-researchers seek to go beyond "passive" use of tools, to rigorously investigate their questions or concerns.</s><s xml:id="_3es9Utv">This process of investigating one question or problem tends to spark new, related research questions for participants, leading to the mentioned on-going motivations and to additional systematic attempts to generate empirical knowledge about themselves.</s></p><p xml:id="_jWDQqhg"><s xml:id="_FPPMAZ5">These motivations are supplemented by additional intrinsic ones that reinforce interest and engagement over time through involvement in scientific-related activities, which is also critical in the domain of citizen science

target="#b66">Sharon and Zandbergen, 2017)</ref> which also resembles extreme citizen science <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Haklay, 2013)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w4zyfz8">This motivation of appropriating tools by non-patients can be understood as an emergent "ecology of testing" <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Marres and Stark, 2020)</ref>, bringing opportunities for scaling up participant-led research like in the case of continuous glucose monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grant et al. 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dMNxhJR">Our interviews also point to previous STS

represent an additional challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Groot et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_S7qpF5v">However, for a few individuals there is also a significant motivation in being

N-of-1 approaches by data aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nafus, 2019)</ref> is another common aspiration identified throughout the interviews, where selfresearchers in patient-led contexts report integrating additional participants more effectively.</s><s xml:id="_XcCGrd7">Relating to learning and sharing their personal science advancements, some interviewees reflected on the time-demanding challenges and limitations of self-tracking in parallel to their professional activity and personal circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Neff and Nafus, 2016)</ref>, as well as communication issues when sharing advances with experts and doctors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Piras, 2019)</ref>, highlighting an epistemic challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fricker,

findings, openness regarding peer's reuse of selfgenerated data, tools or protocols, and a commitment to collectively discuss self-research approaches.</s><s xml:id="_ZeKsSAV">A key value of sociality, as identified also in citizen science <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(West et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jennett et al. 2016)</ref>, seems present in the majority of interviews, where we observe a recurrence of the desire to meet and discuss with likeminded people.</s><s xml:id="_QkVQ5bj">Furthermore, we identify that community values have a relevant connection with the Mertonian norms or ethos for shared and ethical scientific practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Merton, 1973)</ref>, as previously suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heyen (2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gjYXNhz">These values align to a significant extent with traditional scientific principles of communality and organized skepticism, while less so with disinterestedness and universalism.</s><s xml:id="_JjV3bWh">This coincidentally aligns with the sharing culture observed in other peer production domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Benkler, 2004;</ref><ref
