<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_KSfePZE">Ingredients of Self-Regulation</head><p xml:id="_KRhUGzF"><s xml:id="_qwkUhDX">Previous analyses of self-regulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baumeister et al., 1994)</ref> emphasized three main ingredients of the self-regulation process, but we are now convinced that a fourth needs to be included.</s><s xml:id="_Y6z3FHU">The fourth ingredient is motivation.</s><s xml:id="_U64KQjw">Next we detail the four component parts, in order to appreciate the proper role of motivation.</s></p><p xml:id="_YEk6rSX"><s xml:id="_bmCtJV3">The first ingredient is standards.</s><s xml:id="_x3qGvsp">As the definition indicated, regulation means change so as to bring into line with some standard, and hence effective self-regulation requires a clear and well-defined standard.</s><s xml:id="_bW9cz6H">Ambiguous, uncertain, inconsistent, or conflicting standards make self-regulation difficult.</s><s xml:id="_VSPBYCM">Research such as by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Higgins (1987)</ref> has emphasized how different standards can alter emotional reactions and behavioral processes.</s></p><p xml:id="_mAstCeC"><s xml:id="_qgZUKd6">Second, self-regulation requires monitoring.</s><s xml:id="_tqxn98u">It is difficult if not impossible to regulate a behavior without keeping track of it.</s><s xml:id="_rkH7DRZ">Self-regulation theory has been hugely influenced by the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carver and Scheier (1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, 1982</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1998)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_z4YnCQn">One major aspect of their contribution was to adapt feedback-loop theory to human self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_V67W3ce">The person performs a test by comparing the self (or the relevant aspect of self ) to the standard.</s><s xml:id="_RSpdjjE">If the self falls short, then self-regulation requires initiating some operation to change the self in order to bring it up to what it should be.</s><s xml:id="_nGWtUtV">Further tests evaluate progress toward meeting the goal and eventually confirm that the self has now been brought into line with the standard, whereupon no further operations are required, and so the operations can cease.</s></p><p xml:id="_BjARCr3"><s xml:id="_YHkRXcu">The third ingredient is self-regulatory strength, colloquially known as willpower.</s><s xml:id="_BwAzjtE">Operations aimed at changing the self are difficult and therefore require some power.</s><s xml:id="_eaKVf3P">Regulating the self appears to depend on a limited resource that operates like a strength or energy and becomes temporarily depleted afterward (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, &amp; Tice, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vohs &amp; Heatherton, 2000)</ref>, thus creating the state of ego depletion.</s><s xml:id="_hdAgPTx">Recent work has indicated that blood glucose, which is the brain's principal source of fuel, is an important component of this resource: Acts of self-control consume substantial quantities of glucose, resulting in lower levels of it in the bloodstream <ref type="bibr">(Gailliot et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6EMugYY"><s xml:id="_ytAPVwt">The fourth ingredient is motivation -specifically, motivation to achieve the goal or meet the standard, which in practice amounts to motivation to regulate the self.</s><s xml:id="_UhtDf4A">Even if the standards are clear, monitoring is fully effective, and the person's resources are abundant, he or she may still fail to self-regulate due to not caring about reaching the goal.</s></p><p xml:id="_Jx8FNNP"><s xml:id="_J7EFqSf">Thus, the proper way to understand the role of motivation in selfregulation is as one of four ingredients.</s><s xml:id="_uEEhuXW">As the term ingredients implies, some of each is necessary for effective self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_fS3zfw5">However, it is possible that the four can compensate or substitute for each other to some degree.</s><s xml:id="_NXBpzn5">If motivation is high, such as if the person really and strongly wants to measure up to some standard, this may compensate for a somewhat lower than usual level of willpower or a greater difficulty of monitoring.</s><s xml:id="_BdSyKDW">For example, alcohol impairs self-regulation, in large part by impairing the monitoring of one's behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hull, 1981)</ref>, and so an intoxicated person may be prone to say or do the wrong thing.</s><s xml:id="_7kY4cqy">But if motivation is high -perhaps the person's boss or father-in-law unexpectedly enters the scene -then the person may still manage to speak carefully and properly, despite the greater difficulty.</s><s xml:id="_PEvUd6e">Such compensation will only work up to a point, but it does suggest one potentially important role of motivation.</s></p><p xml:id="_qSBUn48"><s xml:id="_9vdNdt6">Motivation may be especially effective at substituting for willpower.</s><s xml:id="_3jWWv7m">Even if willpower (i.e., self-regulatory strength) has been depleted by prior acts, the person may be able to self-regulate effectively if motivation is high, as we shall see.</s><s xml:id="_Cb2kuxm">In contrast, motivation may not be enough to substitute for the lack of a clear standard.</s><s xml:id="_pQDmMdA">That combination would mean someone wanting to self-regulate but not knowing what were desirable responses to enact.</s><s xml:id="_htdE5hD">As for monitoring, we have suggested that motivation may sometimes be able to offset impaired capacity to self-monitor, but this effect may be limited (which is why people should avoid being drunk at job interviews).</s><s xml:id="_fXRpmWq">To be sure, there may be degrees of depleted willpower beyond which no amount of motivation can compensate, although this notion remains to be shown empirically.</s></p><p xml:id="_T6pw8TD"><s xml:id="_rznHENA">Motivation is subject to change in response to a variety of circumstances.</s><s xml:id="_tb5NQrp">Up until now, self-regulation theory has paid little attention to the issues of whether and how strongly people are motivated to regulate themselves.</s><s xml:id="_bcbHtc2">But it seems plausible that, like other motivations, the motivation to self-regulate would fluctuate according to anticipated satisfactions, expected utility, efficacy expectations, and other factors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_SvNXyAV">Self-Regulation and Motivation: Friends or Enemies?</head><p xml:id="_CUEJx9m"><s xml:id="_SNwFh5n">Why do animals (and especially human animals) have self-regulation in the first place?</s><s xml:id="_4wrRQNG">Without motivation, there would be little need for it.</s><s xml:id="_jD3pYtT">Self-regulation is first and foremost useful to prevent some impulses, which are based in motivations, from being enacted in behaviors that would be costly to the individual, even if they promise short-term benefits in terms of satisfying current needs and wants.</s><s xml:id="_HGmhKrM">Thus, some basic uses of self-regulation are inimical to motivation.</s></p><p xml:id="_nFdfdVv"><s xml:id="_H3ZaDJw">While conducting an early review of the self-regulation literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baumeister et al., 1994)</ref>, one of us noticed the pattern that the most common function of self-regulation is to stop impulses from producing behavior (also <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Polivy, 1998)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D8ywYPn">Most, although not all, self-regulation can be understood as self-stopping: The dieter refrains from eating, the recovering addict refrains from drinking, smoking, or drug use, the anger-manager holds his or her tongue and refrains from doing something that will be regretted later, and so forth.</s><s xml:id="_uMvCsKG">Essentially, the majority of self-regulation functions to thwart and prevent motivated behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZgacKVE"><s xml:id="_46txuTw">Then again, we must ask, why do people want to restrain their motivations?</s><s xml:id="_dakgaP2">After all, motivations exist for beneficial -even adaptivereasons.</s><s xml:id="_TDhZDuW">The motivation to find and eat food is based on the body's need for nutrients in order to survive.</s><s xml:id="_6W97JQR">Sexual motivation reflects the importance of engaging in reproductive activities, and animals without sexual motivation may well fail to pass on their genes.</s><s xml:id="_bsA33Pt">Motivations to seek affiliation, intimacy, and power reflect the fact that social and cultural life are the principal biological strategies of human beings, insofar as success at interpersonal and group life are the main ways that people achieve survival and reproduction.</s></p><p xml:id="_KGuqTqS"><s xml:id="_sEkzAmn">Why, then, would nature give humans the capability to restrain their motivations, when it has instilled those same motivations via natural selection?</s><s xml:id="_3bTQsMU">Motivational conflict is the crucial answer and provides the essential context for understanding self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_TsqYNS5">When a person wants something and wants it without question or conflict, such as when one's canoe is sinking and one needs to swim to shore so as not to drown, there is no motivational conflict and hence no need for self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_N7BkKHH">But when motivations clash, self-regulation becomes needed and may be the key to success.</s><s xml:id="_FxkSC5Y">For example, humans evolved to find, eat, and store as many calories as possible, but the success of culture has changed the environment from one of chronic famine to one of chronic abundance.</s><s xml:id="_qs8s9kF">Modern Westerners who eat everything they want to eat eventually grow fat, which is detrimental to their health and their social standing.</s><s xml:id="_XwnKZxW">A motivational conflict therefore ensues: The desire to eat delicious food conflicts with the desire to be healthy (and fashionably slender!).</s><s xml:id="_ADKkfjj">Self-regulation is needed in order to resist the natural desire to eat good-tasting and easily available food.</s></p><p xml:id="_8W9Ak5w"><s xml:id="_fheyVQ8">Perhaps the most important motivational conflict arises from the clashing demands of nature and culture.</s><s xml:id="_NBzNkmh"><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baumeister (2005)</ref> has proposed to view nature and culture as operating largely together, insofar as evolution selected humans for traits that made them competent to create and function in the complex social systems that became culture.</s><s xml:id="_ka7ybQ9">However, short-term self-interest remains a chronic nexus of conflict.</s><s xml:id="_EDzxWWb">Selfishness is natural: Brains and a great many psychological traits evolved, after all, to enable the organisms that housed them to survive and reproduce successfully.</s><s xml:id="_FnyHafm">Animals that failed to do what was best for themselves and their immediate kin were most likely supplanted by rivals who did.</s><s xml:id="_5Ekd9Nq">Culture, meanwhile, is a group system, and sometimes what is best for the group is not what is best for the individual.</s><s xml:id="_ydaJqgs">Waiting one's turn, respecting the property of others, paying taxes, and risking one's life in battle are examples of behaviors that are beneficial for the group but that come at cost to individuals.</s><s xml:id="_hMgSd7m">None of those behaviors comes naturally, and in fact it may be natural to have impulses to do the opposite.</s><s xml:id="_fjzFGwK">Self-regulation is therefore helpful and perhaps vital for culture to succeed.</s></p><p xml:id="_asvWbng"><s xml:id="_fj9E5hE">The crucial motivational conflict in these clashes between natural impulses and cultural demands lies in the desire for social acceptance.</s><s xml:id="_ZEn6UzF">The need to belong is one of the most basic and pervasive human drives.</s><s xml:id="_5bmk7y8"><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baumeister and Leary (1995)</ref> reviewed considerable evidence that this need is strong among people generally and that it underlies a broad range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses.</s><s xml:id="_beVXfaT">In a similar vein, self-determination theorists <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref> have concluded that the desire for social connection is one of the three most basic and powerful human motives.</s><s xml:id="_p2EPhtQ">That motive is ultimately what comes into conflict with selfish impulses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heatherton &amp; Vohs, 1998)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UBkYPKP">In the moment, perhaps, selfish people may be more likely than others to get what they want, but others quickly begin to avoid them (for good reason!).</s><s xml:id="_stYGwT7">Hence, people learn that restraining selfishness is helpful and even necessary in order to gain social acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heatherton &amp; Vohs, 1998)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_UUBMcWZ"><s xml:id="_jYGdkSh">One might ask why people care so much about social acceptance.</s><s xml:id="_k59XeVa">In our view, this reflects basic biological strategies of human life.</s><s xml:id="_HfJurWE">Both survival and reproduction are far easier to achieve via social acceptance than in social isolation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bowlby, 1969)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_m6xru2w">More broadly, culture is a biological strategy for humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baumeister, 2005)</ref>, and humans get what they need for survival more often from their social group than directly from nature, unlike most other social animals.</s><s xml:id="_CUUgnAM">Social acceptance is not a whim or luxury but rather a central drive tied to the most basic needs for survival and reproduction.</s><s xml:id="_9DRKtGd">Indeed, this has been one of the critiques of Maslow's much-beloved theory of the hierarchy of needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wahba &amp; Bridwell, 1976)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_M6GHy4y">According to Maslow's hierarchy, the drive for belongingness emerges only after the more basic needs for food, shelter, and safety and security are satisfied.</s><s xml:id="_2mJStg2">Only when the belly is full and the predators and other dangers thwarted does the human psyche begin to care about forming and affirming social bonds.</s><s xml:id="_qzGNJFj">Observations suggest, however, that hunger and danger often stimulate the desire to affiliate with others, or at least to seek out trusted relationship partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schachter, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taylor et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tpaVKme">Perhaps most notably, people will risk life and limb for the sake of belongingness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Leary, Tchividjian, &amp; Kraxberger, 1994)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_wpB4PBS"><s xml:id="_KWSUNEP">To return to our theme of the roots of self-regulation, we conclude that much of self-regulation is used for the purpose of restraining selfish motivations in order to serve the goal of being accepted by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heatherton &amp; Vohs, 1998)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EXupTvP">In an important sense, this is a matter of pursuing enlightened self-interest
