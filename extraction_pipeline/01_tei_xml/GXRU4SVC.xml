brain regions, specifically dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), frontal cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus. <ref type="bibr"

target="#b30">30</ref></s><s xml:id="_DzyuQwN">This may account for the heterogeneous symptomatic presentation observed in patients with OCD.</s><s xml:id="_HzbQcXY">Neuropsychological functioning
