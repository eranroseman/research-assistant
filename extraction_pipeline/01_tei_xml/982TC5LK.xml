is the quality of the reviews included, with a majority (57.4%) having a critically low AMSTAR-2 score, which may impact the overall trustworthiness of the findings.</s><s xml:id="_qASJVMN">Additionally, the meta-analysis, by its nature, could obscure heterogeneity in individual studies or mask specific nuances that might be of significance.</s><s xml:id="_j7wNxcP">For example, interventions focusing on populations with lower initial levels of physical activity or fruit/vegetable consumption, such as individuals with obesity, may have greater effects in promoting these behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_4YMebyr">However, our ability to investigate baseline differences between subgroups is constrained due to the synthesis of aggregate effect estimates from systematic reviews.</s><s xml:id="_NJMNmSy">The finding that the included reviews relied on largely distinct sets of RCTs suggests there is heterogeneity in the literature and potential subgroup differences between studies that we were unable to assess.</s><s xml:id="_qZKtdHJ">Moving forward, we suggest further examination of potential clinical and methodological subgroups that may account for differences between reviews.</s><s xml:id="_zExf38c">Carefully delineating patient populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes in included trials may reveal explanations for the lack of

effectiveness across different populations and intervention types from the subgroup analyses can be interpreted in several ways.</s><s xml:id="_kUKzJDV">The lack of significant differences in many

use may vary across populations and should be considered when interpreting these findings.</s><s xml:id="_Tetjtg7">While this review provides evidence that digital health interventions can be broadly effective, it does not explore potential differences in impacts for specific cultural or demographic groups with differing technology access or tech usage patterns.</s><s xml:id="_V8zVwSb">Further research into population and cultural differences would provide valuable context about whether effectiveness may differ based on the population or region.</s><s xml:id="_cwSGQYN">Future research
