<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fCb9ekH">. Introduction</head><p xml:id="_DN7sded"><s xml:id="_29TfM4z">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric disorder that can negatively affect school performance, strain family relations and friendships, and shorten life expectancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cRXFWDa">OCD occurs in up to 3% of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wfR3b9d">The first defining symptom of OCD, obsessions, are intrusive, persistent thoughts about topics such as contamination, symmetry, morality and committing aggressive acts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XAzxpZ5">The second characteristic symptom of OCD, compulsions, refers to ritualized or repetitive acts that the individual with OCD feels compelled to do, such as checking, cleaning, ordering, counting and hoarding <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wn7MHb2">Obsessions and compulsions are associated with distress in the form of negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, fear, disgust, sadness, embarrassment, feelings of incompleteness, and anger) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> and cognitive effort (associated with monitoring, uncertainty and suppression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_BaJEEPm"><s xml:id="_3CgWese">Assessing distress levels in OCD is important for determining symptom severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, which informs treatment choice and planning.</s><s xml:id="_hA2yQdD">Monitoring of OCD distress is critical to delivering and studying the first line treatment for OCD, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_T6H7my4">ERP involves approaching distress provoking stimuli (exposure) and refraining from performing rituals or safety behaviors (response prevention).</s><s xml:id="_mTCDQqq">Currently, monitoring OCD distress occurs via self-report and is not continuous but intermittent.</s><s xml:id="_xmwG7cx">Actual continuous, automatic, objective measures of distress would enable more frequent and precise observations and, in turn, just-in-time interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_xBe6mVC"><s xml:id="_KqDN43K">The distress, negative emotions, and cognitive effort evoked by OCD are reflected in autonomic nervous system activity (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6FphcZz">Biofeedback of physiological markers may have a direct therapeutic effect.</s><s xml:id="_cHcR54F">For example, one study found that providing heart rate feedback to 54 university students (mean age nearly 18 years) with symptoms of claustrophobia during exposure sessions showed significantly more habituation between exposure sessions and reduced fear at the end of six 5-min exposures compared to controls who did not receive heart-rate feedback (instead heard paced tone or nothing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_XtGhrhK"><s xml:id="_wktXRVG">Wearable biosensors are available that can monitor autonomic nervous system activity, but research on the application of these biosensors for continuous monitoring within mental health care is still in its infancy.</s><s xml:id="_7Qq9Ej6">Most studies have focused on stress and depression in adults.</s><s xml:id="_kTXsjMh">Using measures of autonomic nervous system activity from a wrist worn biosensor (Empatica's E4) as input, machine learning models classified no stress, low stress and high stress under controlled stress or no stress conditions (e.g., a stressful timed and evaluated arithmetic task) with 72% accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_nDHkUZQ"><s xml:id="_ckfZ3YA">Another study used physiological stress information (measured with the E4) from lab experiments and contextual information to detect stress-events (with a minimum duration of 1 h) every 20 min with 92% accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xmZpbUX">An early study demonstrated lower heart rate variability (measured with biosensors built into a vest) in adults with OCD, panic, social, and generalized anxiety disorders than healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HHasFhj">One study focused on OCD symptoms in a convenience sample of 21 adults and found that machine learning models could correctly distinguish enacted compulsive hand washing from routine hand washing with a sensitivity rate of 84% and a specificity rate of 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_EXb8x9V"><s xml:id="_6knCUUC">Fewer studies have applied wearable biosensors to the field of child psychiatry.</s><s xml:id="_fHFj9AR">Here, the focus has been on children with autism, to a lesser extent, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and one study examined internalizing disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WTFrKeV">More than half of these studies employed biosensors worn on the chest or multiple sites on the body.</s><s xml:id="_XhqFPFA">The sample sizes of most studies were quite small, with an average of 27 participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ef622Vw">One study was able to classify emotion dysregulation in five 8-12-year-old children using signals from the E4 with 68-85% accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fERRXxs">Another study of children and adolescents (ages 6-17 years; N = 20) with autism, predicted aggressive events 1 min before the episode using 3 min of physiological and motion signals measured with the E4 (area under the curve: 0.71-0.84)</s><s xml:id="_K33NN5W"><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NbEkxRR">We know of only one study that has tested the use of biosensors to detect OCD events in youth.</s><s xml:id="_WaaNgbv">A pilot study placed a chest belt with an electrocardiograph, inertial sensors worn on both wrists and a head mounted eye tracker on five adolescents (ages 13-17 years) with OCD while performing regular daily activities, exposure preparation, exposure, and compulsions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EvrNvEC">No machine learning models were trained or tested to classify OCD events.</s><s xml:id="_8D8Skd4">However, the study provides a protocol and preliminary support for distinct physiological stress patterns (increased HR and decreased heart rate variability) in exposure situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_jMBCbU2"><s xml:id="_8asshxf">To our knowledge, no previous study has attempted to detect OCD events outside of controlled conditions.</s><s xml:id="_NDyJ9hB">Thus, we tested the feasibility of capturing OCD events using an unobtrusive wrist worn biosensor, E4, and machine learning models in a sample of adolescents with an OCD diagnosis.</s><s xml:id="_wuTYXDp">To succeed in continuous monitoring of OCD symptoms, adolescents would need to adhere to wearing the E4 and tag enough OCD events to amass enough data for analysis.</s><s xml:id="_PubjNDc">We characterized the biosensor wearing behavior per day and over the entire observation period, as well as explored the relationships between OCD symptoms, wearing behavior and how often the adolescents tagged OCD events.</s><s xml:id="_da32gyz">We used these observations to generate hypotheses about OCD symptoms that can be monitored using physiological signals and the characteristics of adolescents with OCD who would benefit from OCD symptom monitoring with a biosensor.</s><s xml:id="_ApJSQPu">We also took a preliminary step toward developing and testing generalized and personal models for detecting OCD events in the everyday lives of adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_u5QSzZF">Finally, we compared the physiological signals collected outside of the lab to those collected during OCD-activating tasks in the lab.</s></p></div>
