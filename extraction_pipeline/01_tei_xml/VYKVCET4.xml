efforts to improve public health because health risk behaviours are as strongly associated as risk biomarkers with the onset of chronic disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">90</ref></s><s xml:id="_tM5sCwd">A comprehensive approach to healthy lifestyle intervention should include both primordial prevention, to deter risk behaviours and risk biomarkers from emerging, and primary prevention, to control existing risk factors and prevent the onset of clinical disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67</ref></s><s xml:id="_2hRSUFc">Desired outcomes are the prevention of early death, compression of morbidity until the end of life and enhancement of productivity and quality of life.</s></p><p xml:id="_QuBwVXk"><s xml:id="_wpXhABt">The optimal balance between targeted high-risk versus broader population preventive strategies is often debated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81</ref></s><s xml:id="_yManPcY">Our view is that the two strategies act synergistically and are both necessary.</s><s xml:id="_9F7582T">The high-risk approach entails identifying the most disease-susceptible population subgroup, traditionally via biomarker screening (e.g. for high cholesterol, hyperglycemia, etc.) and offering them preventive treatment, traditionally via medications.</s><s xml:id="_fGbKMSg">In contrast, the 'population strategy' seeks to control the determinants of illness in the entire population, by intervening broadly, usually against environmental factors that make a disease prevalent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81</ref></s><s xml:id="_CUNk5jQ">The merits of a combined approach are discernable from the observation that targeted medical treatment of high-risk individuals and population-wide improvements in health behaviours accounted almost equally for the decline in the US coronary artery disease mortality between 1980 and 2000. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_5G9jDja">ne critique of the high-risk approach has been that the untargeted majority of the population without risk factors actually gives rise to most cases of disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81</ref></s><s xml:id="_E8NEJQg">Another is that screening inevitably results in false-positive cases that receive unnecessary, usually chronic and expensive medical treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81</ref></s><s xml:id="_KKdzuQH">To our minds, these critiques are largely irrelevant to behavioural high-risk approaches because behavioural risks actually characterize the majority rather than a subgroup of the population.</s><s xml:id="_pMeHpP9">Additionally, behavioural risk factors usually can be treated effectively by time-limited, rather than lifelong behavioural or pharmacologic treatment.</s><s xml:id="_wrBHyzR">In contrast to the high-risk approach, the population strategy seeks to produce small population-wide improvements, traditionally in biomedical risk factors, by means of universal environmental changes and policies (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_Hd37rvv">taxes, subsidies and laws) that aim to make healthy behaviours the default choice.</s><s xml:id="_tufn5HG">By virtue of their broad reach and community penetration, policy interventions can achieve considerable impact.</s><s xml:id="_2cYjgPR">For example, if the National Sodium Reduction Initiative could induce food companies to reduce the amount of salt in the US food supply to the 1500 mg/day or less level that the Institute of Medicine recommends, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> there would be a 25.6% overall decrease in high blood pressure and $26.2 billion in healthcare savings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_UREy3UF">ften overlooked, however, is that the small biomarker improvements targeted by population-level intervention can require quite large changes in behaviour to achieve.</s><s xml:id="_SNwcpfV">Intensive, multi-session behavioural interventions are vastly more effective than less intensive approaches at producing the 5 -7% weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> or smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> needed to improve risk biomarkers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_xENKx2d">Because public health impact is the product of treatment effectiveness multiplied by population reach, both policy level (superior reach) and intensive behavioural change interventions (superior effectiveness) are cost-effective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52</ref> and a combined strategy is optimal.</s><s xml:id="_733F7PJ">For example, Levy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> recently demonstrated that reducing the prevalence of US tobacco use to 12% by 2012 requires not only environmental changes that prompt more quit attempts, but also ensuring greater uptake and adherence to effective smoking cessation treatments.</s></p><p xml:id="_AHt4HZd"><s xml:id="_3uhrCWu">At this juncture, it is probably accurate to state that more remains unknown than known about how to optimize multiple health behaviour change at the individual or the population level.</s><s xml:id="_vA62MWh">Important, unresolved policy-and practice-relevant questions that need investigation include: (1) the optimal number of behaviours to intervene upon; (2) best practices to select which behaviours to target for change (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_p3h9H8f">greatest health impact; patient preference or greatest positive carryover effects on bundled behaviours); (3) whether to increase healthy or decrease unhealthy behaviours; (4) whether to intervene on health behaviours simultaneously or sequentially <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">89</ref> and (5) how to achieve positive synergies across individual-, group-and population-level interventions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">84</ref></s><s xml:id="_wFJbHGg">aving the capacity to prevent the onset of risk behaviour clusters or intervene synergistically to improve many health behaviours would have substantial public health impact.</s><s xml:id="_gx5yywS">There is a pressing need for a body of basic, translational and applied science to help tackle the co-occurring health risk behaviours that characterize most adults.</s></p></div>		</body>
