biggest change in information acquisition that the modern world has ever seen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_P9y66EY">Less than three decades later, statistics show that 3.2 billion people, over half of the population, can access the Internet with ease <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CSJDp4c">During any given second, there are estimated to be over 8 billion devices simultaneously connected to the World Wide Web, using mobile phones as a medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nSnhkqg">In modern day society, the ubiquity of mobile phones has become the norm.</s><s xml:id="_aBj7TQs">In 2012, it was estimated that 91% of the population were in possession of a mobile phone <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z9pBcxE">Due to the abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic.</s></p><p xml:id="_YAs4wTS"><s xml:id="_aAsByqj">mHealth is the practice in, and support of, public health interests, which is reinforced and sustained by mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5HU6gNU">It has become an extensive platform for the promotion and patient-led continuity of self-care <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, improving patient-centered care (PCC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and prompting the progression of health literacy to positively skew societal view of diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_gZEr6Rb"><s xml:id="_Eb9CFh2">As of June 2016, Android users and those with access to Google Play had access to the download of 2.2 million apps, and Apple's app store offered 2 million apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SPxT359">However, it is salient to take into consideration that this is not a precise quantifier of relevant apps due to duplicate, nonfunctional, and alternatively topical apps.</s><s xml:id="_YkAhYjh">Studies have found that 31% of mobile phone owners use them to access health information; 19% have also installed a mobile app that relates to a current medical condition or to manage their health and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SpaCSYT">Another study has also found that over 56% of health care proviso settings inclusively use mHealth to aid clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Cxg5Cuc"><s xml:id="_wAYDnvr">A substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily available to download concerning a wide range of health issues.</s><s xml:id="_husWnS7">There are informative fitness apps to tackle obesity; journal type apps that can help when managing a chronic illness such as diabetes; tracking apps for menstruation, ovulation, and fertility; and even apps that have introduced touch sensitive methods, which when used, provide detailed analytics of an individual's pulse and heart rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_vx62ct4"><s xml:id="_FxPPCv9">The physical outcomes for the mHealth apps largely focus on weight management and physical activity, smoking cessation, and medication adherence.</s><s xml:id="_X2YSCPf">Although it is apparent that each of these issues causes pejorative symptoms, the apps aim to reduce or avoid these via the medium of behavior modification.</s><s xml:id="_AMteKB3">Psychoeducation within these apps, such as the disadvantages of obesity, monetary loss due to smoking, and the side effects of missed medication convey presumed consequences to amplify desirable behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_fyAa749">Behavior modification apps have proven effective in reducing the risk of obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, treating eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and reducing anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_jmrG7JZ"><s xml:id="_huRUTNV">An emergent number of these available apps focus on supporting individuals with mental health issues.</s><s xml:id="_DkecR8u">This is inclusive of, but not exclusive to, disorders such as stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</s><s xml:id="_hsSthgH">In 2014 alone, surveys suggested that 1 in 10 individuals in the United Kingdom waited longer than 12 months for a mental health assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and it is projected that by 2030, the United Kingdom will see an additional surplus of over 2 million people experiencing mental health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AsUpu2g">mHealth has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments and eradicate the need to meet in person with a clinician.</s><s xml:id="_4cVzEAw">Consequently, mHealth interventions have the potential to diminish the workload of mental health professionals, be more cost effective to practices, and encourage self-care tactics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_m4ffGGf"><s xml:id="_s9kD8J9">One previous study was carried out by Bakker et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AHuDCk3">This was a review that focused upon the development and validation of mental health apps (MHapps).</s><s xml:id="_U5bAEAH">It aimed to review current MHapps to guide future development and provide recommendations to MHapp developers for optimization of features.</s><s xml:id="_kYQW6Ee">The study aided the authors to formulate sixteen recommendations for development, such as the inclusion of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), automated tailoring of the app, and coping skills training.</s><s xml:id="_27ZbGRW">Donker et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> have meticulously reviewed the efficacy of mobile phone apps for the management of mental health.</s><s xml:id="_DDxUd6s">This comprehensive review performed qualitative synthesis on 8 trials that studied the effects of mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_6FxEUDj">Each study had a pre-and posttest design, or the app was administered alongside a control group.</s><s xml:id="_PU5qndJ">The results of this review showed the efficacy of the apps in reducing symptoms of stress, depression, and substance abuse.</s><s xml:id="_8a25syW">Within-group and between-group intention-to-treat effect sizes oscillated from 0.29-2.28</s><s xml:id="_p3Paku8">and 0.01-0.48 at the posttest and follow-ups.</s><s xml:id="_ZEtxWkV">This was a stringent and precise review that excluded any other mHealth methods to allow for a rigorous review of apps.</s><s xml:id="_BPnC37Q">This literature review builds upon and varies from previous research by being inclusive of SMS text messaging (short message service, SMS) as a mHealth intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_M2eyFrB"><s xml:id="_TZGcwB4">Previous research and empirical studies has given valid evidence of the effectiveness of mental health interventions using mobile apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZhadJzu">Alongside apps, there is evidence to show that receiving SMS messages that entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a patient's mental and physical well-being.</s><s xml:id="_gVbQDJg">As SMS messages can be sent directly to a patient's mobile phone, they are deemed just as convenient and as easy to use as an app <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Be9ywx3"><s xml:id="_jTXte9Y">SMS services have shown positive results, when used as mHealth interventions, for both physical and mental health issues.</s><s xml:id="_jmFS2uR">Studies have shown that SMS services, when used as reminders, are highly effective in increasing adherence to prescription medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nNQREaD">This is also true for SMS services that prompt patients to attend their health care appointments by acting as a reminder, consisting of time and location <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2rPUASq">Interactive SMS services have been found to reduce the likelihood of binge drinking in young adults and also had sustainable reductions up to 6 months after the interaction with the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CjsFK2E">One of the most salient applications for SMS as an intervention is the dispersion of psychoeducation for mental health ailments.</s><s xml:id="_5WEyeUB">There are services that provide information on mental illnesses such as schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, bipolar <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, and other common mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bRAN4Xx">SMS are sent to primary, private inboxes of the participant and can easily be received and disposed of; this could be one such reason for their efficacy as mHealth interventions.</s><s xml:id="_JtZVPJJ">SMS mHealth interventions are also deemed to be more anonymous and therefore, break down certain barriers to accessing health care and eradicate stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Fwb3wpf"><s xml:id="_SfJcmYB">The inclusion of such an expansive assemblage of health issues can appear complicated due to their incongruent symptomology and treatment.</s><s xml:id="_96nHrmP">However, this review aims to focus upon the general efficacy, usability, and feasibility of an mHealth intervention, as opposed to focusing upon specific health issues.</s></p><p xml:id="_FUwSq6P"><s xml:id="_TkGvuhb">With the ever increasing use and pervasiveness of mobile phones comes an even larger market place for apps and SMS services.</s><s xml:id="_y3N8BDc">To our knowledge, there is no monitoring of, or stringent guidelines, which these mHealth interventions must adhere to, so effectiveness is yet to be confirmed by repeated replicability of studies.</s><s xml:id="_gvvmYsg">However, this area is still deemed to be in its early stages.</s><s xml:id="_2UKSzwy">Available mHealth apps and SMS services and their ever improving quality necessitate a systematic review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence to intervention, and usability.</s><s xml:id="_c5ZABhj">The aim of this paper was to systematically review the existing empirical studies and mHealth literature, focusing on the efficacy, feasibility, and usability of apps as mHealth tools for physical and mental health.</s></p></div>
