with agreed recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, is complex, multifaceted, and not fully understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FTDTX87">As such, designing interventions to promote exercise adherence is challenging.</s><s xml:id="_9Buw3w9">To aid

target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9Uh2rCx">The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) is a synthesis of 19 models of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_W8FefdF">When applying the BCW, the first step of intervention design is to use the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation model of behavior (COM-B) to analyze the desired behavior and identify key barriers to and facilitators of the behavior that the intervention is intended to change.</s><s xml:id="_vSyuNPS">The COM-B model describes three interacting categories that influence behavior: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> capability that includes physical capability (eg, physical skill) and psychological capability (eg, knowledge and psychological skill); <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> opportunity that includes physical opportunity (eg, the environment such as time and resources) and social opportunity (eg, social cues, norms, and interpersonal influences); and (3) motivation including reflective motivation (eg, self-conscious intentions and beliefs) and automatic motivation (eg, emotional reactions, desires, and impulses).</s><s xml:id="_aBaRzed">These categories can be further divided into the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), 14 additional domains of behavior if greater detail is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5dg8AWw">Once the behavior has been analyzed using the COM-B model, the BCW then provides recommendations about the functions that interventions could serve to bring about change (eg, education or training) and guides the selection of potential behavior change techniques (BCTs-active ingredients designed to bring about change) that could deliver selected intervention functions.</s><s xml:id="_Jf44Vrt">SMS or mobile phone text messaging programs are becoming an increasingly popular delivery method for health behavior change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref

and the many benefits of using SMS technology.</s><s xml:id="_rSbpTsS">These include instantaneous communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, convenience, cost-effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and, most importantly, high user acceptability <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cKGBTe7">Reviews do, however, suggest the need for caution when drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of SMS health behavior change interventions owing to the overall low quality of individual studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> and the absence of interventions that are rigorously informed by behavior change theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref

evaluated 12 video messages (multimedia messaging service [MMS]), delivered every second day to provide visual prompts to exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_u56tQsd">Over the 6-week intervention, there was no change in functional outcomes or exercise adherence.</s><s xml:id="_Tqff2rP">Participants who received the MMS messages did, however, highly value them as reminders.</s><s xml:id="_XZEwaMf">Second, a feasibility study on 27 participants assessed the effects of an educational booklet about knee osteoarthritis and exercise (delivered by mail) plus 4 weekly activity-promoting text messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GmRsUQ9">Message content was informed by the social cognitive theory, although how exactly the theory informed the intervention design was not described.</s><s xml:id="_N7NFVQ5">Significant improvements in pain and exercise self-efficacy were reported.</s><s xml:id="_JWyNwDA">In total, 96% of participants enjoyed receiving the messages and 88% found them useful.</s><s xml:id="_ECM2znw">Collectively, the limited research to date suggests that people with knee osteoarthritis find SMS technology an acceptable method to support home exercise.</s></p><p xml:id="_HKhnNN9"><s xml:id="_6GN27rj">The ability of automated SMS programs to improve adherence to home-based exercise has been demonstrated in healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and adults with frozen shoulder <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wh2Pcyf">A randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed the effect of a 12-week automated SMS program to promote adherence to weekly home-based strengthening exercise in nonexercising healthy adults (aged 50-70 years) from an upper-middle-income country <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sYwQRvE">Participants in the intervention and control received exercise prescription via a booklet.</s><s xml:id="_D9GQmuY">In addition to the exercise booklet, participants in the SMS intervention also received 60 SMS text messages (1 per weekday) containing BCTs aimed to provide encouragement and exercise reminders.</s><s xml:id="_e27EQKa">BCT selection was informed by the literature.</s><s xml:id="_M2V3AvB">Messages came from a standard set and were not tailored.</s><s xml:id="_eCW63kf">At 12 weeks, participants receiving the SMS exercised significantly more than participants who received the exercise booklet only.</s><s xml:id="_jrjU4sM">These benefits were not sustained once SMS contact ceased and had diminished by a 24-week follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_Fa8Sg8X">A second RCT, which assessed the additive effect of a 2-week automated SMS intervention to therapist-prescribed shoulder exercise for people with frozen shoulder, found significantly higher exercise adherence and improved shoulder range of movement in the SMS group compared with the control group who received exercise instruction only <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SsYFcEE">Messages in this study included reminders, encouragement, and education.</s></p><p xml:id="_YnxcyjZ"><s xml:id="_h7T9exY">To explore if SMS interventions are effective in promoting exercise adherence in knee osteoarthritis, specifically, theory informed and systematically designed interventions that are clearly reported and rigorously assessed are needed.</s><s xml:id="_3B9cj7Z">Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the development of, and rationale for, an SMS behavior change intervention designed by applying the BCW for people with knee osteoarthritis to support exercise adherence.</s></p></div>
