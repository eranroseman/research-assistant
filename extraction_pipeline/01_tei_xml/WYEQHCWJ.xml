worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and approximately 38% (15.2 million) of these deaths occur prematurely, affecting people aged 30 to 70 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Sx9NeEv">The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 69% of all deaths in the Southeast Asian region are due to NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which roughly translates to 9 million of the regional population dying each year from NCDs, with 52% of deaths occurring prematurely in those younger than 70 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NQ2nZeS">In Indonesia, NCDs are estimated to account for 76% of all deaths in the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes accounting for an estimated 35% and 6% of proportional mortality, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JMHkZzc">Indonesia's rapid urbanization over the past decade has not only led to higher individual life expectancy but also higher rates of modifiable NCD risk factors such as unhealthy diet choices and sedentary lifestyles, ultimately contributing to the rise of an aging population at risk of developing NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_WTs7rNw"><s xml:id="_hKVFUwX">Largely due to stretched and overburdened health care systems, low-and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by the burden of NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wFJkwvX">The COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted essential health service provision for NCDs in the region, further burdening health care systems and creating long-term impacts on health and mortality in the region <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rQEy9HM">Similarly, although Indonesia has been shifting its health care disease burden from communicable diseases to NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the COVID-19 pandemic has largely disrupted the nation's NCDs services in primary health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, highlighting the need for a multi-stakeholder, multi-component, and preventative approach to managing NCDs in the nation.</s><s xml:id="_CEAqddj">As health care systems worldwide continue to tackle the downstream impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing body of evidence sheds light on the potential of digital health as a resource-efficient solution for health care systems and health care payers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, making their real-world uptake more relevant for NCD prevention as traditional health care systems in the region continue to be overburdened.</s></p><p xml:id="_umT7qzt"><s xml:id="_RB8AxKN">Beyond health care, workplace-level interventions have a high magnitude of impact in addressing and managing chronic disease risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eptCubX">Working adults spend more than a third of their lives in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which makes them increasingly vulnerable to work-related risk factors such as sedentary work, work stress, and easy access to unhealthy food <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SU6Phkx">For this reason, the WHO recommends workplace health promotion programs as an effective avenue to target physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary habits-two important modifiable risk factors for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QS8VUnr">Although workplace health improvement initiatives have traditionally been physical and face-to-face in nature, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for digital offerings that provide more accessible, personalized, and diverse offerings, that are becoming increasingly more relevant as offices become more dispersed in a post-COVID-19 world.</s><s xml:id="_FQJW8Wn">Given that unmanaged NCDs adversely affect employers through increased health care costs, rising premiums, and increased work absenteeism and presenteeism <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, there is a rising need for employers to effectively use the workplace as an avenue for health promotion and NCD prevention.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZgwpTTq"><s xml:id="_NTdGk4x">Major modifiable risk factors for NCDs are often behavioral in nature, such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kKwXBrQ">For this reason, interventions that aim to prevent or self-manage chronic disease risk factors often rely on behavioral change frameworks to create long-term and sustainable behavioral changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tNYrYMp">Digital behavioral health coaching is a scalable and accessible method of delivering patient-centered health coaching, which is defined by an individual's interpersonal relationship with a certified coach that allows individuals to develop intrinsic motivation, create sustainable change, and increase accountability through the use of behavioral change theory, motivational strategies, and communication techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mypFW6p">Concurrently, there is growing evidence to support the effectiveness of digital workplace behavioral coaching interventions in improving various chronic disease risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, such as weight and BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref

interventions are based in Western or high-income countries.</s><s xml:id="_WrPbKTR">Different health system capacities, income levels, health literacy levels, and health-seeking cultures necessitate more studies that are localized within the region to more accurately evaluate the impact of digital workplace interventions in the Southeast Asian population <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JccNy3W">This study leverages a retrospective analysis of secondary employee health data to fill in the current gap in digital workplace health interventions in the region, by exploring year-to-year changes in employee physical health status associated with different levels of coaching delivered by Naluri, a Southeast Asian digital therapeutics platform, as part of a workplace health improvement program implemented in an Indonesian mining company.</s><s xml:id="_DNCyt9E">We focus on changes in BMI, waistline circumference, lipoprotein and total
