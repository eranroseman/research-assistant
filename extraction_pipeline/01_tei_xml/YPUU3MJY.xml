it may foster frustration and emotional desensitization when it appears that nothing can be done, or that the victims' own behavior is to blame for their situations.</s><s xml:id="_MU5Zt4R">For others, it may increase emotional sensitivity toward the issue in an optimal way that encourages empathy with victims.</s><s xml:id="_Rfrc9mR">And for a final group of those who are initially sensitive to the issue, pervasive media coverage of some social problems may contribute to empathic distress at a level sufficient to motivate avoidance of topics which are emotionally draining.</s><s xml:id="_eRpdZFG">Each of these outcomes is identifiable in the openended responses of survey participants.</s><s xml:id="_RveYXmF">It is plausible that desensitization may be the final outcome for those who experience hypersensitization, as it would serve as a defense against emotional distress.</s></p><p xml:id="_9MhaUhy"><s xml:id="_ZHaSUkP">(3) The mass media play a primary role in the development of compassion futigue.</s><s xml:id="_Qdny62U">The media contribute to compassion fatigue toward social problems in two primary ways: by providing content that serves as aversive stimuli, prompting avoidance strategies; and by fostering desensitization to social problems through redundant and predominately negative messages which reach the point of saturation.</s><s xml:id="_4PrDtR7">Respondents blamed their desensitization and avoidance strategies on the nature and content of television news reports, and local news in particular.</s></p><p xml:id="_rYu9UvA"><s xml:id="_74TTaDd">These findings underscore perceptions of media negativity that were found to be a primary cause of hostility toward the media?*</s><s xml:id="_MArpw7X">Level of media consumption and print versus broadcast dependence do not appear to be as influential in the development of compassion fatigue as individual tolerances for exposure to disturbing media content and perceptions of the victims' "deservingness" of compassion.</s></p><p xml:id="_cFAtjKu"><s xml:id="_2NGYfHs">Interpersonal communication appears to mediate compassion fatigue toward AIDS and child abuse, suggesting that interpersonal communication may be one key to preventing or reducing desensitization toward issues which deal with societal taboos.</s></p><p xml:id="_c2vm2WS"><s xml:id="_UPMUETz">The compassion fatigue concept offers an alternative model to the press agentry approach to communication about social problems.</s><s xml:id="_M79qyz7">It expands our knowledge of the influence of message repetition to the arena of communication about social problems.</s><s xml:id="_UER5e2U">Most important, it suggests that burnout need not be the result of direct personal contact with those in need, but that it may also be a vicarious response, associated with exposure to human problems through the window of the mass media.</s></p><p xml:id="_YEejyEr"><s xml:id="_qhjSaFv">Over theyears, social cause organizations have factored their audience's limited time and financial resources into their fund-raising strategies.</s><s xml:id="_Wh6Zy9e">However, the public's capacity for emotional arousal has often been treated as an infinite, undepletable commodity.</s><s xml:id="_QfUq9Dk">This study suggests that social cause organizations in fact are competing for three limited resources: the public's time, money, and capacity to care.</s><s xml:id="_EBETrJY">Communication strategists must be increasingly sensitive to the prospect of an informationally-overloaded and emotionally-overwhelmed public.</s></p><p xml:id="_jpedJZk"><s xml:id="_8Y7zHBj">While news coverage of social problems may initially serve a facilitating role in attracting attention and resources to problem amelioration, pervasive coverage which emphasizes problems without solutions may actually backfire and create a numbing of concern toward social problems and their victims.</s></p><p xml:id="_Q7BH454"><s xml:id="_TPHSeCx">The nature of contemporary mass media is integral to the compassion fatigue problem.</s><s xml:id="_xWgkrPd">Acknowledging compassion fatigue as part of the potential fallout from current news values and practices is an important first step for media gate-keepers who are interested in playing a helpful rather than hindering role in addressing social problems.</s><s xml:id="_uxQPpef">42.</s><s xml:id="_VvHHnRe">Self-generation of issues proved to be unwieldy because it yielded issues which did not fit the criteria for social problems and required interviewers to adapt question phraseology to suit the issues identified.</s><s xml:id="_kpSpNXC">In addition, the wider range of issues that were identified through this process meant that each had a smaller n than would be obtained through focusing on a discrete number of researcher-provided issues, a consideration when statistical analysis will be employed.</s></p><p xml:id="_FXuWwx8"><s xml:id="_Bea3vjg">43.</s><s xml:id="_MAWtmxT">This item was worded as follows: "Some people might say that the amount of media coverage they see about these issues has sensitized them toward the issues;
