<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tSxxAyp">Discussion</head><p xml:id="_TMtA2vY"><s xml:id="_Nar8mje">The results of this trial show that in patients prescribed blood pressure and/or lipid-lowering medication for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, text messages improved the use of prescribed medication at 6 months compared with the use in patients who were not sent text messages.</s><s xml:id="_sBEXU2C">Stopping medication completely and taking less than 80% of the prescribed regimen were both reduced, by 9% and 7% respectively -an overall improvement in medication adherence of 16%.</s></p><p xml:id="_TexDyJ9"><s xml:id="_dQkYv7W">The 80% cut-off (.22 of the last 28 days medication was taken) that classified a person as adhering to their medication was arbitrary, but has been used in previous publications.</s><s xml:id="_7nKC5sg"><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> Had we adopted a lower or higher cut-off, say 75% or 85%, the difference in adherence between the text and no text groups would have been 15% or 20% respectively.</s><s xml:id="_NGkcAAP">The estimate is therefore reasonably robust.</s></p><p xml:id="_Vu38s7g"><s xml:id="_PV5nr9E">The software used in this trial automated the sending of texts and recording of replies in a way that reminded patients to take their medication (about two-thirds of patients) and identified those who did not (1 in 6 patients), so the reason for not doing so could be determined and advice provided.</s><s xml:id="_9rYG4AG">This approach differs from previous trials which used one-way text messages to encourage the use of sunscreen <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, malaria prophylaxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, antibiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and blood pressure drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and did not show statistically significant improvements in adherence.</s><s xml:id="_gzu2sC5">Two randomised trials that, like ours, sent a text message and required a response, did show statistically significant improvements in adherence in the use of antiretroviral treatment among HIV patients, in one trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and vitamin C in healthy people in another <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WwV6pfg">Bidirectional texting may be an important factor in achieving a benefit.</s></p><p xml:id="_TTmRu79"><s xml:id="_vquzSqY">The text messages were customized to the time of day that patients took their medication but the frequency that texts were sent was not automatically adjusted in the light of the response.</s><s xml:id="_EBqnaR8">Future versions of the software could be made more ''intelligent'' to enhance the customisation.</s><s xml:id="_eFGM9hA">The method was simple, is scalable and could be extended to other disorders for which drugs are taken long-term, such as asthma, epilepsy, HIV infection and multiple sclerosis.</s></p><p xml:id="_CBJdE9m"><s xml:id="_WpYpmqG">In this trial, medication use was high because the main method of recruitment involved responding to a text invitation (response rate of 9%).</s><s xml:id="_37FW5Sb">The patient sample was likely to be a particularly conscientious group that was likely to adhere to their medication more than patients in general.</s><s xml:id="_PwxCdqD">This limited the trial's power to show statistically significant differences in cholesterol and blood pressure between the randomised groups.</s><s xml:id="_RU5zwzB">Such selection is probably inevitable in trials such as this, which require the consent and cooperation of the participants involved.</s><s xml:id="_Uzj5Cpd">As a consequence the results of this trial may underestimate the routine use of texting as a means of improving adherence to medication.</s></p><p xml:id="_FXBHJyE"><s xml:id="_jptQDtz">Several questions remain.</s><s xml:id="_C4abyrz">For example, would the benefit of text messaging be improved or diminished in patients who were starting drug treatment, compared to patients who had been taking medication for some years already, as we studied here?</s><s xml:id="_XbF6VAX">Would the text intervention provide similar benefits in patients taking medication for other chronic disorders, such as tuberculosis or HIV infection?</s><s xml:id="_nEbP35v">Would the improvement in medication adherence, observed at 6 months, be sustained if the text intervention stopped?</s><s xml:id="_CB2hHuk">Further research would be needed to answer these questions.</s></p><p xml:id="_w3gzwKK"><s xml:id="_pu6VafP">In conclusion, in this randomised trial, we found that among patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid-lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease events, text messaging, improved the extent to which patients took their prescribed medication.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_mHfPCAY"><s xml:id="_DR4S6YP">Figure 1.</s><s
