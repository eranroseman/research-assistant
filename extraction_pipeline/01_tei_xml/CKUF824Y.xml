<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_TRgXghY">IntroduCtIon</head><p xml:id="_94FDKEf"><s xml:id="_Zvp6gt4">The United Nations has described climate change as 'the single greatest threat to a sustainable future', with impacts on agriculture and food security, human health, water supplies and land and sea ecosystems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Climate change is brought about by the 'greenhouse effect'.</s><s xml:id="_qNNKnhG">Human activities are increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that trap energy and heat inside the Earth's atmosphere and change the climate.</s><s xml:id="_uzJFRWC">The Paris Agreement on global climate change aims to limit emissions of GHGs to specified targets to restrict 'the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2Â°C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5Â°C above preindustrial levels'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Where an increase in temperature of 1.5Â°C is likely to have negative effects on the Open access environment, achievement of the Paris Agreement has the potential to reduce the magnitude of climate change and its impact on the Earth and its population.</s></p><p xml:id="_Vm8n5H7"><s xml:id="_tP2xw6S">Extreme weather events are already part of the Australian landscape and Australia is particularly susceptible to a changing climate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_xD3rbHx">Climate change is predicted to adversely impact the health of Australians through the physical (eg, heat stroke, asthma, injury or death) and mental health consequences (eg, depression) of the increasing strength and frequency of storms, floods, heatwaves and droughts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_AqXYbsG">Climate change may also lead to changes in crop yields impacting on food availability, the distribution of infectious diseases, and will increase population displacement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_AGhmJTq">Given the significant impact climate change is likely to have on population health, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> healthcare professionals and institutions have an important opportunity to lead actions to reduce their impact on the climate.</s><s xml:id="_VCgBReY">The actions and interventions made today to limit climate change in the future are referred to as 'environmental sustainability'.</s><s xml:id="_KAmwRvr">As an example of the impact healthcare has on carbon emissions, in Australia, healthcare services alone are responsible for 7% of total carbon emissions, or 35 772 kt per annum.</s><s xml:id="_EdBtdJR">Of those emissions, 44% is attributed to public and private hospitals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_bDE7G6N">ietitians work in a range of settings to promote health and prevent and treat illness 'by optimising the nutrition of populations, communities and individuals'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_TnkZYm6">The profession, therefore, is well placed in mitigating climate change by reducing hospital carbon emissions, and the area of foodservice is likely to have the greatest impact.</s><s xml:id="_N68VeQM">Foodservice dietitians work with the kitchen staff and develop menus for hospitals.</s><s xml:id="_cyPTNq6">Foodservice dietitians can make an impact on carbon emissions through the reduction of food waste, limiting food miles by purchasing locally produced food, reducing the frequency of 'high carbon emissions' foods on the menu such as meat, maximising the efficiency of resources in the kitchen such as refrigeration, heating, and cooking processes and reducing the need for single-use plastics.</s></p><p xml:id="_2Pa77Ts"><s xml:id="_grytbMe">Despite these opportunities and potential impacts, Australian dietitians are not required to learn about environmental sustainability during their tertiary education.</s><s xml:id="_M8NeUxb">Foodservice dietitians can learn about environmental sustainability throughout their degree, or after graduation through professional development.</s><s xml:id="_p6KhxNd">Carino et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> found that only nine Australian nutrition and or dietetics degrees (from a total of 130) contained modules on sustainable food systems.</s><s xml:id="_9ZpSXA6">This may be explained by the removal of environmental sustainability criterion from the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) competency standards. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_Trgs73W">As Australian university dietetics curricula must comply with the DAA competency standards, there is currently no mandate by the accrediting authority for dietetics students, that is, dietitians of the future, to develop the capabilities required to contribute to environmental sustainability.</s><s xml:id="_6zQkxA3">Australian universities, however, recognise the need to improve environmental sustainability, 10-12 yet its inclusion into health curricula is minimal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_YexDxRS">The Australian and New Zealand Council of Medical Deans is an exception, having recently introduced systematic changes to medical curricula that will build a medical workforce which understands the impact of climate change on health and health services. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_dD5DK6B">The preparedness of other health graduates, such as dietitians, to drive environmentally sustainable practices is therefore questionable.</s></p><p xml:id="_AYF5AUM"><s xml:id="_y32uHc2">Given the important contributions dietitians could make to improve environmental sustainability practices in a hospital kitchen and through advocacy, and the lack of guidance from policy and competency standards, this research team aims to ascertain the current practices which support dietitians learning about this important topic.</s><s xml:id="_mCcWkAF">This paper, therefore, reports a protocol for a scoping review to identify literature reporting on the pedagogical frameworks employed by educational institutions and providers of continuous professional development, to describe how foodservice dietitians and dietetic students are developing environmental sustainability capabilities.</s></p></div>
