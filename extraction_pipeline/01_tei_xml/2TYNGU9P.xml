<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1." xml:id="_nNUKZRt">Background</head><p xml:id="_ZexC2yg"><s xml:id="_wmqJVnM">The use of video for patient information and education purposes is widespread and growing.</s><s xml:id="_CPhVnVs">The National Health Service website NHS Choices alone offers 423 publicly accessible videos covering a wide range of topics, from 'how to wash your hands' through to dealing with death and bereavement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xf7VyRZ">The ease of filming and a sense of the value of visual learning make the use of video an attractive alternative to patient information leaflets.</s><s xml:id="_KmWySf8">Intuitively, making a video seems like a good idea.</s><s xml:id="_yKDqV2D">Whether a patient is about to undergo surgery, or needs guidance regarding rehabilitation, or advice about incontinence or any other aspect of healthcare, the provision of a video offers information in a form of media with which the vast majority of the population are comfortable.</s><s xml:id="_pW5EGcZ">But little is known about the effectiveness of video interventions or of what is considered an effective intervention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2." xml:id="_pUVxRHt">Rationale</head><p xml:id="_KgCdUHD"><s xml:id="_m6bWx3V">Some previous reviews have examined video interventions for health.</s><s xml:id="_b5yCqEu">Bieri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> systematically reviewed the impact of health education videos aimed at schoolchildren, dealing specifically with infectious diseases.</s><s xml:id="_XcDwKhC">Studies reviewed incorporated a range of measures including knowledge, attitude/compliance, behaviour and prevalence/incidence. Their conclusion offers guidelines for the development of future studies of the effectiveness of video for teaching children about infectious diseases.</s><s xml:id="_NeWKXdQ">Tuong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> carried out a systematic review of the impact of video on health behaviours, with instructive results.</s><s xml:id="_Jx4wNNX">Behavioural change was observed in some contexts, but not all.</s><s xml:id="_KEQZhVC">The authors conclude that the content and style of video can determine its effectiveness within context.</s><s xml:id="_2eFfrm2">Of note is the recommendation that gain-framing is likely to prove a more successful strategy than loss-framing.</s><s xml:id="_JXdwMnx">A similarly targeted review by Abed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> concluded that whilst there is a lack of clear evidence that video is effective in modifying behaviour, success is more likely if the format of the video is centred upon real people enacting real scenes, rather than simple didactic delivery of information.</s><s xml:id="_jjt2yjJ">However, each of these reviews is in its own way context-specific.</s><s xml:id="_ymkTspx">There is a need for a scoping review that reviews and compares studies which sought to measure patient response to video interventions, with no restrictions on the type or definition of patient response.</s></p></div>
