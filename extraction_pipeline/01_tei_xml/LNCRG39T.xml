caloric intake recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PNjh7kA">Alternatively, acceptance-based treatment (ABT) teaches skills, such as distress tolerance, that may

since PCMs can be expensive and difficult to fit into a person's lifestyle, and ABT requires specialized training <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fGUEUMr">PCMs are effective because they are pre-planned and pre-packaged, however, this is accompanied by a level of inflexibility that may not easily fit into a person's lifestyle (e.g., family meals, parental responsibilities, work commitments, etc.) and may not be feasible over the long-term.</s><s xml:id="_vZBeeKa">Although treatment accompanying PCMs should help people develop other tools and strategies to support weight loss and maintenance, reliance on PCMs may impede the development of important behavioral strategies.</s><s xml:id="_68VVq8N">In contrast, switching the therapeutic approach to ABT theoretically addresses the root problem of many weight loss challenges and boosts long-term capacity for self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_DpaAD8Q">Because ABT directly addresses the underlying causes of overeating, it may take longer to develop this skill set.</s><s xml:id="_YYAPybJ">Thus, these treatments may have differential short-and long-term effects, with PCMs being more effective shortterm, and ABT skill development accelerating over time.</s><s xml:id="_3qJJ5Hu">Different individuals also may vary in their responsiveness to different treatment sequences.</s><s xml:id="_nyCMJKm">For example, suboptimal responders who experience greater food-specific self-regulation challenges such as binge eaters may respond differently to PCMs and ABT <ref type="bibr"
