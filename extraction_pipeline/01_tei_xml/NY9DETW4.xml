<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_nAu2ENB">Autonomy</head><p xml:id="_kwA422c"><s xml:id="_Wt78Qnc">The need for autonomy refers to the individual's need for regulating their behaviors based on their own values, interests, or satisfaction for a behavior itself, not by external influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3JS5n6G">SDT research has proposed that social environmental factors, such as autonomy support, play an important role in inducing autonomous motivation by satisfying one's need for autonomy.</s><s xml:id="_MyH8G5h">The effects of autonomy support are evidenced in smoking-related research.</s><s xml:id="_vWGVVAu">According to studies by Williams et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, an autonomy-supportive communication style induced more autonomous motivation for smoking cessation than a non-autonomy-supportive one.</s><s xml:id="_EGQ97Bk">This effect is not only for the short term, but also is likely to last for long-term smoking cessation.</s></p><p xml:id="_Sqq37he"><s xml:id="_AqEa7Gs">Autonomy support is characterized by the following: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> providing meaningful reasons for a behavior, (2) providing choices and alternatives for a behavior, (3) supporting individuals' initiatives, and (4) acknowledging individuals' perspectives (eg, negative affect regarding difficult behaviors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q3hR3E7">To this regard, we can expect that smoking cessation apps with such characteristics would bear greater effect on smoking cessation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_v2jbvmG">Relatedness</head><p xml:id="_U5qS2k8"><s xml:id="_BUAqpxC">The need for relatedness concerns feelings connected to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_67QZ6tr">According to SDT, relatedness is important for autonomous motivation because it promotes the internalization of extrinsic causes; individuals may voluntarily engage in behavioral change because of someone else who means a lot to them, even though the behavior by itself is not interesting.</s><s xml:id="_A3nQRJb">In fact, the importance of relatedness, noted as "social support," has been evidenced in various domains of health behaviors, such as breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SaBD3aH">The positive effect of social support on smoking cessation has also been reported in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_hyxg9nE"><s xml:id="_vKgsDEZ">Social support is now available in cyberspace owing to advancements in information technology.</s><s xml:id="_y7bVBTf">For example, various forms of online communities, such as chat rooms, weblogs, or bulletin board systems, can provide social support related to health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_h6NTcth">The up-and-coming social media is also expected to contribute to social capital formation by enabling individuals to connect with one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_M6gy2PD">Smartphone apps are often developed in conjunction with social media or offer functions to access communities online.</s><s xml:id="_EyYnwTG">By taking advantage of these characteristics, smoking cessation apps are expected to satisfy relatedness.</s><s xml:id="_JfFyuG2">In summary, autonomy, competence, and relatedness are important factors to induce intrinsic motivation for long-term behavioral changes.</s><s xml:id="_TQXUdZ2">Smoking cessation apps addressing these basic needs are expected to have greater effects on changing smoking behavior.</s><s xml:id="_b49EgCq">To this regard, this study proposes the first research question: To what extent do smoking cessation apps have features that contribute to the satisfaction of the basic needs (ie, autonomy, relatedness, and competence)?</s></p></div>
