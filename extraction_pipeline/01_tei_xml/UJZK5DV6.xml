target="#b4">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KyNzdCp">The source of data from randomized control trials or a rigorous prospective cohort study are considered high quality while expert opinion is of low quality due to risk of bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dZZMZcK">How outcomes are measured is another quality consideration.</s><s xml:id="_JdxWTp2">High quality outcomes use reliable and validated instruments and/or clinical endpoints (e.g., disease specific) and state how they were calculated and ideally sample people affected by condition or from a general community population <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mfFBDdV">Research designs, sample sizes, and economic reporting quality varied.</s><s xml:id="_hCnYaFd">Three of the studies were pilot study designs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> and had small sample size which lack economies of scale (which would indicate the intervention may be even more cost saving) or lack volume (which would indicate more utilization that may increase costs).</s><s xml:id="_vQPtBqD">Some of these studies did not selfreport as formal cost-effectiveness studies and instead, for example, reported methods of cost outcome analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SVD4F8q">Additionally, others reported outcomes of effectiveness and difference in costs compared with other interventions or modeled multiple scenarios.</s><s xml:id="_68r7yD3">Various assumptions about modeling may introduce risk such as using poor quality studies or data that does not reflect current practice that may favor one intervention over the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bdTA5DF">For example, Moore et al., assessed effectiveness of a technology supported intervention to support management of hypertension and compared costs between intervention and standard care, identifying cost savings <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2TJWqKc">Similarly, O'Leary et al., evaluated text messaging to increase vaccination outcomes and reported cost scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rBvg7dE">However, neither calculated a summary measure such as an incremental cost-effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_S3cF48s">In another example, Chang et al., calculated costs per outcome averted (e.g., virologic failure and patient lost to follow-up averted) of a peer health worker intervention compared with mHealth supported peer health workers intervention to report patient clinical data to centralized staff.</s><s xml:id="_W4rxEMQ">Their findings were based on threshold analyses to identify costs to avert an unwanted outcome and the associated cost savings <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RmPEJPQ">Costs and savings were also calculated for implementation at large-scale based on pilot study findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_T5r4yeP">Efficiency was used as a measure of cost-effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_CDyhAfn">For example, Bingna et al., defined efficiency as improvements in the primary efficacy outcome relative to the staff working time used and the direct financial costs of the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_V9MD6Bb">Cost-effectiveness evaluations were often secondary outcomes or reported in results.</s><s xml:id="_Bc6hrsz">Koshy <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and Perron et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> reported the cost-effectiveness methods within results and discussion sections.</s><s xml:id="_rh6nJhF">Similarly, Loranzo-Fuentes et al., reported cost-effectiveness as a primary study aim, but briefly described the cost analysis methods in the result section <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_thzfbRR">Downer et al., modeled financial benefits that could result from increasing outpatient attendance using text messaging and although the authors report the methods as cost-effectiveness, it was classified as a cost benefit analysis because the outcome was measured as cost per success and the reported cost difference was in monetary units <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7uSZjD5">However, several of the CHEERS quality items were not reported in this study.</s><s xml:id="_EN9W2PR">Joo et al., reported the short intervention period prohibited the calculation of QALYs as a limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_4u95uny"><s xml:id="_T7YT4rH">To be conservative, we reported results as positive or probable cost-effectiveness if one or more of the primary outcomes showed a positive economic outcome.</s><s xml:id="_nan3bfY">There were cases where secondary outcomes had increased likelihood of cost-effectiveness for an intervention.</s><s xml:id="_d6zVrM2">For example, Maddison et al., identified a mobile phone intervention as not cost-effective compared with usual care for the primary outcome of exercise capacity; however, there were results of cost-effectiveness for secondary outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3sQA925">Similarly, some studies reported the intervention as not cost-effective at base case.</s><s xml:id="_MFT4q2F">However, as the number of patients treated increased, the treatment became less expensive.</s><s xml:id="_fHrjREn">For example, at approximately 1600 users the app evaluated by Luxton et al., became less expensive than in-office treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Egbjc5S">Furthermore, because of the large number of potential app users, an estimated $USD 2.7-2.9 million societal savings was calculated.</s><s xml:id="_hZegyDn">The estimates of probability falling below a recognized value threshold for the cost per QALY gained varied based on access to existing software <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_dZSKVYb"><s xml:id="_kQRr6m3">A main objective of medical research is to improve the health of a population; therefore, conducting economic evaluations from a societal perspective is preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uhgTqyf">The study perspective, such as patient, payer, provider, health systems each take into consideration differing costs and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Gty74KN">A societal perspective is considered high quality because it includes both full direct and indirect costs, such as direct costs to patients and opportunity costs regardless of who bears the costs or receives the effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FUCRff3">Since research is expensive and exposes patients to the risk of experimentation, it is important to think beyond effectiveness of the intervention and to take into consideration the potential to incur opportunity costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gtKw6jK">Only two full economic evaluations reported analyses from a societal perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AM96fM2">Both of these studies also ranked within the top 25 th percentile of CHEERS items reported, representing good quality economic evaluations.</s><s xml:id="_nAJasKu">Those with lower quality score often did not describe the perspective.</s><s xml:id="_DmSUc9W">In such cases from the costs calculated it can often be assumed that the perspective is from the intervention implementer and sometimes the patient or service user costs are also included.</s><s xml:id="_6JbxQjD">Some studies included a mix of perspectives (e.g., provider or health care sector and service user) or at various levels of implementation (e.g., start up, regional level, national level).</s><s xml:id="_48hUDJM">Similarly, although the majority of the studies included the currency used in their analyses, of those categorized as not reporting the CHEERS item 'currency, price date, and conversion,' most failed to include the date or year the costs were calculated.</s><s xml:id="_MnvFtnh">The lack of this information limits reviewers' ability to convert and compare to other similar studies.</s><s xml:id="_7R34hXb">In addition, time horizon was not reported in about a quarter of the studies.</s><s xml:id="_SqqhWgT">A time horizon takes into account preferences for future benefits over immediate benefits and applies a discount rate, typically 3 and 5%.</s><s xml:id="_EzwvGpG">A high-quality study will use a time horizon of over ten years <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DkP7zQy">In evaluations of response rate or clinic attendance, it seems appropriate to use a short time horizon.</s><s xml:id="_D77sx63">However, for behavior change interventions, e.g., smoking cessation or adherence to medication for a chronic disease, longer time horizons may be necessary.</s></p><p xml:id="_EPjFkjW"><s xml:id="_2eqH3xr">As technology based interventions and mHealth, in particular, are relatively new it is not feasible to wait for lifetime data to validate cost-effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_8NUwUGy">Consequently, it is not surprising that many of the identified economic evaluations used modeling techniques to simulate disease projections over a lifetime or long period while incorporating effectiveness and cost evidence.</s><s xml:id="_D7vdudw">In so doing it is important to calculate and represent uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vFaEjU9">For a study to be considered high quality sensitivity analyses are needed to evaluate factors that most influence results and failing to account for the range of adverse events can induce bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5XN9tTw">There are a number of methods used to explore uncertainty in economic evaluations (e.g., one-way and multiway sensitivity analyses, threshold analyses, analyses of extremes and probabilistic sensitivity analyses) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_c3hrPw2">For the studies included in this review that applied a model-based economic evaluation, all described the calculation and reported of uncertainty/sensitivity of incremental costs and most used a Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic sensitivity analysis.</s><s xml:id="_35qEZyw">In contrast, for single study-based economic evaluations, the uncertainty of sampling together with the impact of methodological assumptions (e.g., discount rate, study perspective) was described in less than half.</s></p><p xml:id="_hg6HmaZ"><s xml:id="_T462M5v">Behavior change communication interventions were the most represented mHealth intervention type identified in our review.</s><s xml:id="_hKCgG8B">This finding is consistent with others reporting behavior change communication interventions as the predominant and most successful of all mHealth interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sZfMHQb">No economic evaluations were found for three of the domains (human resource management, financial transactions and incentives, and logistics/supply management).</s><s xml:id="_vMa2SXZ">Similarly, a review of mHealth in low-and middle-income countries by Hall et al., showed no studies were identified as human resource management nor financial transactions and incentives based interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_scNz9Er">In addition, although mHealth is recognized as drawing from a range of tools and often combined with other strategies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> the majority in our study assessed mHealth tools as the primary intervention type and fewer as a secondary or combined component.</s><s xml:id="_3j9pXCV">One exception was Joo et al., who assessed a remote type Internet based intervention with twice weekly SMS prompts for behavior modifications in combination with other intervention components <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_2GwMDyh"><s xml:id="_6E7vqE7">Text messaging was the predominant tool assessed in the studies, consistent with mHealth literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_P9w8SWK">Text-messaging interventions are popular because they can be sent, stored, answered and retrieved at the user's convenience; they are relatively inexpensive; and they are available for any type of phone <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WC4ybvn">Increasingly, SMS reminder systems are being used by healthcare systems to counter the negative impacts of missed appointments, such as lost revenue to the health care system, potential poor impact on patient health and treatment outcomes, and system efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MbxRhsf">The largest number of identified economic evaluation studies focused on assessing cost outcomes of SMS appointment reminders to increase outpatient clinic attendance.</s><s xml:id="_HSHV4du">All but one found positive economic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xSFjfd5">In our review, four focused on diabetes management or prevention, and each of these identified the intervention as cost-effective.</s><s xml:id="_HqqYW5b">However, a systematic review of text messaging interventions concluded that text messaging benefits are still unclear because most studies have used self-reported adherence measures, omitted the measurement of clinical outcomes, and neglected to evaluate beyond the active intervention period to determine lasting effects or to assess baseline adherence difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_mBMUXA5"><s xml:id="_EYnTy9x">Apps are reported to be an ideal platform for behavior change because of their popularity, connectivity, and increased sophistication <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ec9tkdR">Apps can support added functionalities beyond, text messaging, for example.</s><s xml:id="_TKDe4nG">They have the potential for real-time data collection, graphic feedback, interactivity, and links to social functionalities.</s><s
