of rising demand for their services <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hfkhgnb">The magnitude of these constrains makes utterly necessary to change current care models in a bold manner, from late disease management to preventive personalized health, involving a major shift in when, where and how care and support is delivered to each particular patient and service user <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TrTtfwE">In fact, it is generally recognized that most prevalent diseases are partly caused or aggravated by lifestyle choices that people make in their everyday life.</s><s xml:id="_caRKqpm">Unwholesome diets, tobacco use and sedentary conducts, among other unhealthy habits, potentially contribute to develop severe illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> and also limit the effectiveness of medical treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vzAKAza">Thus, enabling people to make healthier choices, to be more resilient, and to deal more effectively with illness and disability when it arises, turns to be a fundamental part of this necessary new health perspective.</s></p><p xml:id="_tCP8wH5"><s xml:id="_NZ7dyrT">Information and communication technology is called upon to be a cornerstone of the new health era, playing a crucial role in empowering people to take charge of their own health and wellness, by providing them timely and ubiquitously with personalized information, support and control <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TxJ8aXm">In fact, an extraordinary interest has been lately shown by the industry in the development of specific applications and systems for health and wellness management, particularly boomed by the growth of wearable and mobile technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NRpsYuS">The immediate targets of these solutions are healthy lifestyle services, especially oriented to the fitness domain, which primarily allow to track primitive user routines and provide simple motivational instructions.</s><s xml:id="_7QTqMEc">For example, mainstream commercial systems such as Withings Activite <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Garmin Vivofit <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Fitbit Surge <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or Misfit Shine <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which consist of sensorized bracelets and gadgets normally accompanied by mobile apps, provide some basic healthy recommendations based on the measured taken steps or slept hours.</s><s xml:id="_v6a7xgc">More prominent health and wellness systems have been shown at the research level, for example, to alert on physical conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or detect chronic illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, yet most of them are prototypes or work-in-progress.</s><s xml:id="_Z7Ryyv5">Some of these systems also provide educational modules and personal coaching for promoting healthier lifestyles and managing health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Fmt6wBF">Despite their interest, main limitations of these solutions refer to misperformance, limited scope and lack of interoperability with other similar systems and applications.</s></p><p xml:id="_2Jsmyw3"><s xml:id="_XjjzNzw">To overcome the shortcomings of application-specific solutions and leverage the potential of health information systems in a wide sense, general frameworks capable of managing these resources are required.</s><s xml:id="_pmn3W4v">A few attempts are found in this respect in the literature, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> a middleware framework integrating multiple interfaces and multiparameter monitoring of physiological measurement is presented.</s><s xml:id="_49Er3E9">In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, distributed signal processing algorithms for the analysis and classification of sensor data are provided as part of a framework for rapid prototyping of body sensor networks.</s><s xml:id="_qBqn3Z8">A mobile platform to collect users' psychological, physiological and activity information for mental health research is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5sVSH3c">The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> propose a healthcare platform particularly devised for interfacing and processing data from body-worn physiological sensors and home appliances, with a proven utility in daily medication management.</s><s xml:id="_eSZPebV">A novel framework that provides advanced functionalities for resource and communication abstraction, wearable health data acquisition and knowledge extraction is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CRdcS4J">Most visible initiatives are especially being underpinned in the mobile health domain.</s><s xml:id="_qGYTcPJ">That is the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, an open mobile health project to help developers produce digital health data as useful and actionable as possible.</s><s xml:id="_FdRhsSj">Google Fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> by Google, SAMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> by Samsung or HealthKit <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref> by Apple are examples of new commercial platforms also devised to integrate and share users health data among diverse health and wellness applications.</s></p><p xml:id="_AeveeM7"><s xml:id="_y3eY3jy">Despite important contributions have been made through these platforms, there is still much room for improvement.</s><s xml:id="_sU7cZty">For example, most mobile health frameworks are bound to the computational capabilities of the smartphone, require continuous maintenance and updates of end-user applications and normally trap data into their devices.</s><s xml:id="_Sy37JHf">Moreover, multiple systems and applications can generate similar health data and outcomes leading to unnecessary redundancy and overcomputation.</s><s xml:id="_kpNjz9H">These systems mostly operate ondemand, thus determinants of health and wellness states can also be lost if not registered in a continuous manner.</s><s xml:id="_QhRKSqY">Platforms devised to share and integrate health and wellness data underutilize cloud resources while simply using them for storage.</s><s xml:id="_eUux6qB">In the light of these limitations we present Mining Minds <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref>, an innovative distributed framework that builds on some of the most prominent digital technologies to enable the provision of personalized healthcare and wellness support.</s><s xml:id="_NfYAkTP">This framework is particularly devised to seamlessly investigate on people's behavior and lifestyles in an holistic manner through mining human's daily living data generated through heterogeneous resources.</s><s xml:id="_NZ8bXN4">Mining Minds aims to innovatively exploit the potential of cloud computing not only for storage but also for high performance computation supporting the discovery of personal and public health and wellness patterns, of primal necessity to facilitate proactive and preventive support.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_zFEsRFN">Requirements of a digital health and wellness framework</head><p xml:id="_FB7sH8V"><s xml:id="_AMeBskG">Diverse types of data are normally required to neatly describe a person's health and wellness state, ranging from physical-sensory-and logical-personal profile and interests-, to socialhuman relations-and clinical-medical-data.</s><s xml:id="_XXGVReK">Many technologies are increasingly available for the collection of these data, such as wearable devices, ambient sensors, social networks or advanced clinical systems.</s><s xml:id="_cCRCYJp">Thus, an important requirement of a digital health and wellness framework is to provide a certain level of abstraction from heterogeneous resources to make their utilization transparent to the user.</s><s xml:id="_b6pekPq">Health and wellness data go beyond standardized structured formats such as "traditional" electronic health records, particularly including other multimedia and unstructured data.</s><s xml:id="_cgV7fx7">Therefore, another primal requirement is to be capable of dealing with this dimension of heterogeneous data, as well as the underlying implications of the management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.</s></p><p xml:id="_9yakYGX"><s xml:id="_nbketK2">Not only data variety constitutes a key factor, but also data volume.</s><s xml:id="_28U3cBr">Massive amounts of data are generated over time on and around the subject with the advent of new sensing and multimedia technologies.</s><s xml:id="_9nWR2wm">Accumulating and digesting these amounts of data are not trivial tasks and need to involve sophisticated processing and storage mechanisms to enable the persistence and availability of the data.</s><s xml:id="_EZDpPKR">Similarly, the rapid pace of data generation makes it necessary to also take into account data velocity as a reference factor.</s><s xml:id="_PN4UD9Z">This proves to be especially challenging when referred to data that represents real-time regular monitoring, such as continuous electrocardiogram measurements or body motion data.</s><s xml:id="_tGRVZ38">Another important concept that applies to health and wellness data is veracity.</s><s xml:id="_GbuKnmH">Different data types may represent similar concepts or contradict each other, or even be of little interest.</s><s xml:id="_YvHPqdp">Therefore, digital health and wellness frameworks should count on governance mechanisms to determine the consistency of the data, ensuring it is certain, meaningful, clean and precise.</s></p><p xml:id="_GdrQzgC"><s xml:id="_DtBdRtK">Extracting the determinants of health and wellness is a very challenging task that requires more than simply collecting and persisting personal data.</s><s xml:id="_4qk4dfS">Accordingly, digital health and wellness frameworks must include automatic intelligent mechanisms to process person-centric data and extract interpretable information and insights for ensuring a personalized health and wellness support.</s><s xml:id="_DWvwSgp">Moreover, insights should not only be gained from individual users but from the collectivity.</s><s xml:id="_72EvUk3">Thus, another important requirement consists in the application of advanced techniques to process information in "deidentified" form to enable population management and deeper insights into cause and effect.</s><s xml:id="_YdDYJaa">These insights can be particularly leveraged by health and wellness care systems to extend, adapt and evolve the knowledge provided by human domain experts.</s></p><p xml:id="_9byS6jP"><s xml:id="_YyAuC5b">Health and wellness information and knowledge are principally devoted to support advanced care services.</s><s xml:id="_ExXnMhC">Mechanisms such as alerts, recommendations or guidelines are particularly used as services to catalyze both information and knowledge to be delivered in a human-understandable fashion to users and stakeholders in general.</s><s xml:id="_SpW5qGP">However, most digital health and wellness systems only support general services that do not differentiate among people's particular needs or interests.</s><s xml:id="_YBe7PF8">Therefore, an important requirement is to provide services that operate on a person-centric manner.</s><s xml:id="_hkKJmRj">To do so, expert systems are required, for example, to precisely map user needs to the best possible recommendations, personalize the recommendations explanation or customize the mechanisms for the communication of these recommendations.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZQty9yK"><s xml:id="_4y7ghS8">Users of health and wellness systems may be of a very diverse nature and play different roles.</s><s xml:id="_pcb9JsR">For example, busy patients may require to get a quick glimpse of their health conditions, fitness enthusiasts wish to observe a detailed description of their vitals and clinical experts be interested in an "in-depth" description of both health and wellness outcomes of multiple people.</s><s xml:id="_hKhvgPF">Accordingly, user interfaces need to be customized to the needs of each particular subject.</s><s xml:id="_RmMwuXB">Similarly, the user experience is of worth consideration.</s><s xml:id="_TK5j772">Users perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency should be taken into account to provide the most personalized experience.</s><s xml:id="_SczJgAB">In fact, the user experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to the person changing circumstances.</s><s xml:id="_qUTsAVy">Thus, user responses and behavior need to be continuously tracked to support a sufficient level of personalization that helps guarantee adoption and engagement.</s></p><p xml:id="_bZnWEGF"><s xml:id="_SKBFaCr">Finally, as it may be obvious, but unfortunately not often considered, all the aforementioned requirements need to be neatly accommodated to user security and privacy principles.</s><s xml:id="_4Xb8nQy">The necessity of privacy and security is crucial for systems that build over sensitive information, and further augmented when data and services are shared by multiple entities in a distributed way.</s><s xml:id="_qBy9WXq">Data ownership, malicious data usage, as well as regulatory and legal policies are important hindrances in the
