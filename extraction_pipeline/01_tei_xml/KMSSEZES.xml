led to more timely decisions regarding continuation, adjustment or termination of the CF procedure for drugs, thereby avoiding waste of valuable time and money for all stakeholders involved.</s><s

<ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HFz3GyJ">Contrastingly, one successful story is that of omalizumab, whereby a Pay-for-Performance scheme was initiated jointly by ZIN, the Ministry of
