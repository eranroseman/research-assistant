(RCTs), are essential for determining the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of drugs, medical devices, and healthcare delivery interventions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> However, Black and Hispanic patients, who are disproportionately impacted by and more likely to have uncontrolled risk factors for cardiovascular disease, are notably underrepresented in prospective cardiovascular clinical research, including RCTs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref></s><s xml:id="_BuZSDpY">3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Despite funding mandates and regulatory authorities' drive to increase enrollment of Black and Hispanic patients into RCTs, a review of 143 cardiovascular clinical trials between 2008 and 2017 showed an average enrollment of 2.1% for Black patients and 2.1% for Hispanic patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_dnGer95">Increasing representativeness of Black and Hispanic patients into prospective cardiovascular clinical research studies is important to improve external validity, increase trust in the medical establishment among groups historically underrepresented in clinical research, and equitably distribute the benefits of clinical research participation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_WK9fhf6">ehavioral economics is a scientific field of inquiry that incorporates principles from economics and psychology to better describe how individuals behave and to influence their behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_Pr9N5Y4">Central to behavioral economic theory is the recognition that individuals demonstrate "bounded rationality," wherein decision-making is limited by incomplete information, thinking capacity, and/or time.</s><s xml:id="_tPAHD5e">Rather than thinking through the full implications of each decision, individuals use cognitive shortcuts, or heuristics, when making decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_Dgf8myp">Many of these cognitive shortcuts consider the context of the decision, rather than the content.</s><s xml:id="_CRQNqaa">For instance, rather than trying to assess the myriad risks and benefits of participating in a research study, individuals may decide not to participate because the invitation is not from someone whose name they recognize and trust or a perception that people like themselves do not participate.</s><s xml:id="_yJFT52h">Knowledge of common heuristics can be leveraged to influence choices by modifying the context in which decisions are made, such as by changing how choices are framed, and marketing studies have shown the effectiveness of such strategies in increasing response to outreach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_brX5Cde">In the context of behavioral economic research, these small changes to how choices are framed are referred to as "nudges."</s></p><p xml:id="_kPkjTFp"><s xml:id="_tPXMckd">For many clinical research studies that recruit participants through direct outreach, the vast majority of participants do not respond to email or text messagebased contact from researchers, and strategies that increase initial responsiveness to outreach could meaningfully increase enrollment rates. <ref type="bibr">12 , 13</ref></s><s xml:id="_bvmYqCu">Challenging social circumstances can be thought of as a "tax" on individuals' cognitive bandwidth, meaning that those in low socioeconomic status-who, in the U.S., are often disproportionately affected by systemic factors such as racial inequality-are more likely to rely on heuristics when making decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_YeV4P5P">Black patients are less likely to respond to unsolicited email invitations to participate in clinical research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_9YezUGu">Thus, outreach messaging strategies informed by behavioral economics have the potential to both increase the overall enrollment fraction and the racial and ethnic diversity of clinical research studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_PQrH9ue">owever, as with any intervention delivered in the context of a complex sociocultural milieu, the effectiveness of these strategies can only be determined through rigorous RCTs. <ref type="bibr">16 , 17</ref></s><s xml:id="_ttbXNDk">ncreasing Trial Equity and Representativeness by Rapid Cycle Testing of Nudges (ITERATE) consists of a series of RCTs to rigorously, systematically, and iteratively test the effectiveness of strategies informed by behavioral economic theory to increase the enrollment fraction-the proportion of individuals who enroll in a study divided by all those contacted with an offer of enrollment-of Black and Hispanic individuals in the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB).</s><s xml:id="_QFwCfme">In each RCT, participants will be contacted with an offer to enroll in the PMBB; they will be randomized to receive 1 message or another, and the "winning" message will be the one that results in the highest enrollment fraction among Black and Hispanic participants.</s><s xml:id="_EAf8STU">The winning strategy from each RCT will inform the "standard of care" for the next RCT in the series.</s><s xml:id="_VfyYzEV">The 4 RCTs will test method of outreach (email vs. text message vs. email + text message), source of outreach (research team vs. clinical team), message framing (appeal to altruism vs. appeal to social proof vs. control), and incentive structure (none vs. medium guarantee vs. small guarantee + small lottery vs. medium lottery vs. large lottery).</s><s xml:id="_Qy8WZEN">Though these outreach strategies will be tested in the context of enrollment into a prospective clinical registry, which has the advantage of having many eligible patients, the results will have relevance for any prospective research study that involves direct-to-patient outreach, as they will help determine the best strategy for overcoming individuals' initial reluctance to engage with unsolicited outreach.</s></p></div>
