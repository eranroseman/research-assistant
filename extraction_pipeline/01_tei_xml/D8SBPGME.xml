worldwide pose increasing challenges to adequate healthcare provision <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qQYmJaE">The crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the practical impact of digital technologies to provide health solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_euaFgVU">Various digital technologies are being developed and used to help in the medical field, one of which is mobile health technology, which has been harnessed in healthcare services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qk77uR4">Mobile health, also known as mHealth, involves delivering comprehensive medical and health aid to individuals seeking healthcare via mobile phones, laptops, tablets, and wearable devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UYv8AFE">Using mobile health technology significantly affects individuals' healthrelated behaviours, including physical activity, dietary choices, alcohol consumption, sexual conduct, and adherence to medication regimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z9a8rBh">There has been significant growth in the body of literature concerning mHealth over the last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, with the United States and the United Kingdom being the most active countries in mHealth research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rdWJq78">Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are considered powerful tools that have led to revolutionary changes in digital health, particularly in access, monitoring, education, and intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_daMrpPt">For example, a recent systematic review found that mHealth interventions could monitor patients' conditions remotely, deliver clinical consultation, enhance their engagement, and increase their autonomy in their health management <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UjsaYWc">While there is evidence supporting general effectiveness of mHealth interventions, there is still limited understanding regarding specific service users outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_wRNSNse"><s xml:id="_BEAw9BE">Furthermore, there is considerable potential for mHealth in various healthcare domains encompassing preventive measures and wellness initiatives, remote and self-diagnostic capabilities, monitoring medication adherence, dissemination of health-related information, and managing chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XBpYYqG">Therefore, mHealth interventions have received recognition and support from global regulatory institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VS4HTyp">For example, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have both acknowledged the potential benefits of mHealth on patient outcomes, disease prevention, and reducing the workload of healthcare providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UqsAQrh">The European Commission also described using mHealth as crucial to addressing the healthcare system's challenges in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ffQDxtR">In the United Kingdom (U.K.), National Health Services (NHS) Digital and other organisations have highlighted the importance of mHealth interventions in managing health problems to meet the high public demand for health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_TfGaaPA"><s xml:id="_5MzmVtd">During the outbreak of COVID-19, mHealth had a significant impact on the management of health issues.</s><s xml:id="_rf8JVfr">In India, patients' engagement and utilisation of mHealth increased dramatically during the lockdown <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_njkUtBD">In Brazil, Randomised Controlled Trial found that using mHealth tools to effectively communicate with the public enhanced people's adherence to preventive measures for COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9ku6xfE">Similarly, in Australia, mHealth interventions were used to provide information about symptoms of COVID-19, prevention, vaccination, and changing behaviour with lifestyle modification for older people <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zJT7gmj">Likewise, other studies worldwide have reported that mHealth technology successfully fought the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_JJJSHNZ"><s xml:id="_pVqKsCw">Furthermore, in the U.K., the NHS long-term plan (2019-2024) recommends that health professions be supported to develop digital literacy to use mobile access to digital services.</s><s xml:id="_bVQ4fPH"><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eGQrypV">However, the global literature from high-income countries suggests that there is hesitation among health professions to implement and advocate for the use of digital health technologies in their practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_z2QYt9n">This was echoed by a study conducted in Catalonia, which revealed that only 6.5% of the surveyed nurses consistently advocated for integrating digital technology into their regular provision of patient care <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2d7vJU6">The reluctance of health professions to promote mHealth may reduce their potential in improving service users' outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_DDGcafp">Understanding the factors contributing to this reluctance as well as the vital role of health professions in promoting mHealth is crucial to maximising the benefits of these interventions for patients.</s><s xml:id="_XSgkY7Z">Although there is a growing body of evidence on mHealth, a critical gap remains regarding the comprehensive assessment of mHealth's impact on service users' outcomes and role of health professions in promoting its adoption.</s><s xml:id="_2prQ3zb">Therefore, this review aims to conduct SR of SRs to assess the current state of evidence on
