2) Telehealth readiness assessment tools, which emphasize planning, technological, learning, societal, and policy readiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>; 3) Barriers to the diffusion of telemedicine, which emphasizes technical, behavioral, economic, and organizational barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>; 4) Lessons in telehealth service innovation, which identify various success factors, including the policy context, perceived benefit, professional roles and willingness to cross boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>; 5) The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), which describes the interaction among variables influencing technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; 6) The Khoja-Durrani-Scott (KDS) Framework, which considers various stages in the telehealth lifecycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; 7) The framework on health system challenges in scaling up for telehealth, which includes consideration for policy, organizational, technological, and financial challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; 8) The layered telemedicine implementation model, which identifies determinants of success associated with each lifecycle phase of telemedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; and 9) The comprehensive telemedicine evaluation model, which considers several issues related to telehealth implementation, including the cost of education, quality of clinical services, and community access to services, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7Zb9TKE">The review (by van Dyk, 2014) concluded that a "holistic" approach is needed to telehealth service implementation, which includes consideration for organizational structures, change management, technology, economic feasibility, societal impacts, perceptions, user-friendliness, evidence and evaluation, and policy and legislation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_T7sbnjU"><s xml:id="_YNm5HSE">It would be relevant to note however, that van Dyk's (2014) review of telehealth implementation frameworks did not include the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pxJKJ6v">The CFIR was introduced in 2009, to serve as a comprehensive metatheoretical framework that could be used to inform both 'implementation science' and 'implementation strategy, ' in health services delivery.</s><s xml:id="_uJvqCYz">Since its introduction, the CFIR has been leveraged to inform effective implementation of a variety of health service innovations, including evidence-based practices for patient safety, best practices for patient-and-family centered care, and a variety of health information technologies, including Electronic Health Records and clinical decision support systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9xnpjpS">Along these lines, in recent years, the CFIR has also been utilized to inform the implementation of telehealth service initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6ZMyrj6"><s xml:id="_3Bsh5Ec">The CFIR comprises five major domains (characteristics of the intervention, the outer setting, the inner setting, characteristics of the individuals involved, and the process by which implementation is accomplished) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_g8zghkx">Each domain in turn, is mapped to an array of constructs informed by existing implementation theories and conceptual models.</s><s xml:id="_2AK7u4c">For example, the domain of inner setting been mapped to the following constructs: 1) structural characteristics, 2) networks and communication, 3) culture, including norms and values of an organization, and 4) implementation climate or the absorptive capacity for change.</s><s xml:id="_fzaTxSW">Six sub-constructs contribute to a positive implementation climate for an intervention, including readiness for implementation, compatibility, relative priority, organizational incentives &amp; rewards, goals &amp; feedback, and learning climate.</s><s xml:id="_zUwtAK9">Readiness for implementation in turn, includes three sub-constructs, i.e., leadership engagement, available resources, and access to information &amp; knowledge.</s><s xml:id="_s9aeQe4">The five domains (and constructs) in the CFIR, are known to interact in rich and complex ways to influence implementation effectiveness.</s></p><p xml:id="_T3VHN8U"><s xml:id="_Q6Hdgh8">As a pragmatic meta-theoretical framework with a comprehensive taxonomy of domains and constructs, the CFIR may be viewed as a "holistic" approach to understanding barriers and facilitators to implementation, compared to any other existing stand-alone framework for telehealth implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rctZeSA">For example, no other framework mentioned above, is known to give due to consideration to the influence of 'organizational culture' or 'implementation climate' on implementation effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_RuA9mCq">By contrast, the CFIR not only emphasizes both these constructs, but it goes a step further in identifying six sub-constructs contributing to a positive implementation climate, including 'readiness for implementation, ' and three additional sub-constructs contributing to 'readiness for implementation.</s><s xml:id="_Q7NY6wc"><ref type="bibr">'</ref> By virtue of its comprehensive taxonomy (five domains and multiple interrelated constructs for assessing implementation effectiveness), a distinguishing feature of the CFIR is that it can help to understand why a particular implementation initiative succeeded or failed.</s><s xml:id="_7mFQgxf">The CFIR has been leveraged as a framework for guiding formative evaluation of implementation efforts.</s><s xml:id="_JVEBhb6">In addition, the CFIR is known to combine well with other established frameworks that could be used to assess implementation scalability and sustainability, e.g., the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ejp6GAG">Supplementing the CFIR with the RE-AIM framework in turn, has potential to serve the dual purpose of providing insight into 1) implementation effectiveness and 2) implementation scalability &amp; sustainability.</s></p></div>
