Health Record (EHR).</s><s xml:id="_cmwnEar">We used the definition of the EHR from the Center of Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS): Electronic health records are digital forms of patient records that include patient information such as personal contact information, patient's medical history, allergies, test results, and treatment plan <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BtSBBk9">Some benefits of EHRs include improving efficiency, increasing positive patient outcomes, and population health. 1 Potential improvements in population health include EHRs ability to organize and analyze a

health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, and recent use found that electronic health records were better able to track Bweekly influenza trends on an ongoing basis better than and in a

higher risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zR4RXyc">The recent shifts in healthcare policy such as The ACA have recommended health practices to focus on preventive care to improve the overall health of the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qtc2udR">Shih and De Leon discovered that physicians who implemented EHRs were better able

quality of care and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vxgU5Yr">EHR systems have been used to manage chronic disease like diabetes, and it has been found that
