xml:id="_te4EEk8">There was some overlap between the patterns of activity observed across all three variables, but we decided to construct an interface with several tabs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>) that allowed participants to peruse each set of data in turn.</s><s xml:id="_Fcbt5WD">Secondly, because these physiological data are quantitative and sampled at relatively high frequency, there was a risk of the user being overwhelmed by the quantity and complexity of the data.</s><s xml:id="_Kz887TU">Therefore, we designed a simplified representation of each data set, splitting the data into four percentile bands that could be colour-coded in an intuitive way.</s><s xml:id="_ehsnvru">The primary motivation for users of the data visualisation was identical to the experimenters in study one, i.e. we wished to identify those instances of increased cardiovascular reactivity and inflammation that occurred over the course of the journey.</s><s xml:id="_vPdsPsz">By labelling those instances clearly (red icons), participants were able to identify and interrogate those instances in order to make an inference about why physiological activity increased at those points.</s><s xml:id="_6nhGZXa">Given that superior classification performance was achieved when physiology and driving parameters were combined in study one, we adopted an approach to designing the data visualisation (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>) where vehicle parameters (i.e. the bar chart at the bottom of the interface) and geolocated data (the position of the vehicle during that epoch) provided a navigable context for the journey as a whole.</s><s xml:id="_vCTMWH6">When users required additional detail, i.e. episodes of high heart rate, low HF_HRV and low PTT were identified, the interface permitted further investigation of those episodes with reference to vehicle location, a still image of the driving scenario and vehicle speed (Figure <ref type="figure"

between pre-and post-test periods.</s><s xml:id="_Dfrc5Qy">Because cardiovascular data were available continuously, we cross-referenced these data with vehicle speed and selected only those epochs when drivers experienced slow-moving traffic (&lt;10 mph).</s><s xml:id="_nnesPDK">This method of filtering the data was far from perfect, i.e.</s></p><p xml:id="_dznw6dw"><s xml:id="_Be2QFDS">participants may be travelling at slow speed because they were approaching a complex junction or a traffic light; however, we were confident that episodes of traffic congestion would be captured by using this simple criterion, because all the drivers had to enter and leave a busy city location at rush-hour times.</s><s xml:id="_T5C8WcN">The analyses of cardiovascular data revealed that heart rate significantly declined and the high-frequency component of HRV significantly increased when participants experienced slow-moving traffic during the post-test compared to pretest period (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_aSbcz7h">The increase of high-frequency HRV is indicative of elevated vagal tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Porges, 1995)</ref> and the observed decrease of heart rate is also consistent with this interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_teQNeST">These changes suggested that cardiovascular reactivity to slow-moving traffic was moderated as a result of exposure to the data visualisation.</s></p><p xml:id="_dsrGpzZ"><s xml:id="_vhCwh5W">However, the actual mechanism underpinning this finding remains open to interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_NnXjPK8">Participants may have adopted a different psychological coping strategy when they encountered journey impedance, such as acceptance, which has been associated with increased vagal tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balzarotti et al, 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eePhxWU">When participants were asked what had been learned from the data visualisation, a number reported psychological insights, such as being "reactive" or "not in control", which may have prompted a change in coping strategy, i.e. several comments in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> pointed towards concerns over the level of physiological reactivity revealed by the data visualisation.</s></p><p xml:id="_YrVQ9BS"><s xml:id="_BfEspbC">Alternatively, participants may have actively practiced a psychophysiological mode of self-regulation, such as slow/deep breathing, which would also reduce heart rate and increase vagal tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Van Diest et al, 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_B75D3uG">The pattern observed in study 2 suggests a change in respiratory patterns because heart rate and high-frequency HRV are particularly sensitive to change in respiratory activity; it should also be noted that no equivalent changes were observed for PTT (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), which would not be strongly influenced by changes in breathing.</s><s xml:id="_rWqb3Gw">Participants may have adopted a pattern of slow/deep breathing when experiencing journey impedance, implicitly or as an active attempt to self-regulate cardiovascular reactivity.</s></p><p xml:id="_caE4mZr"><s xml:id="_kZEtjKd">It is difficult to identify which specific facet of the data visualisation interface prompted those alterations in cardiovascular psychophysiology observed between the pre-and post-test phases of study two.</s><s xml:id="_BCU5TyH">It is also possible changes in physiological responses represented the participants' integration of location, still images and multimodal data streams from the visualisation.</s><s xml:id="_efpdaCj">Feedback from the data visualisation may have been a powerful motivation to actively self-regulate the experience of stress during journey impedance; it was obvious from the interview data (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) that participants identified congestion as a frequent trigger for episodes of increased cardiovascular reactivity.</s><s xml:id="_sQcsA6m">As an additional source of concern and motivation, a number of interview comments focused on the physiological impact of driving on personal health (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) and how an emphasis on high reactivity (red icons on the map) prompted a focus on those physiological "costs" of negative emotion during driving.</s><s xml:id="_GTeNXPc">The whole rationale of the data visualisation was intended to bring these "hidden" patterns of physiological activity to light that accompany stress in everyday life and occur outside the awareness of the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brosschot et al, 2010)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_89zKRZA">One goal of the data visualisation was to provide an opportunity to directly observe these processes, which was unique and informative for our participants.</s><s xml:id="_a6JvDV5">Alternatively, the interview process associated with the data visualisation may have played a direct role in those cardiovascular changes that we observed between pre-and post-test periods, as the questions used in the interview process forced each participant to reflect upon the data visualisation in order to identify triggers for changes in cardiovascular reactivity.</s><s xml:id="_yjPumDS">As part of the interview process and to aid interpretation of the data visualisation, participants were informed about those physiological inferences that could be drawn from individual cardiovascular markers, e.g.</s></p><p xml:id="_JGjVMcQ"><s xml:id="_WPsgU7b">HRV is associated with inflammation in the body, PTT is associated with blood pressure; hence, our participants were capable of reflecting upon the data visualisation from an informed position.</s><s xml:id="_mKJyQhm">This type of explicit link between physiological markers that were visualised on the map and an awareness of the implications for longterm health may have constituted a powerful agent for behaviour change.</s></p><p xml:id="_vF5YCpF"><s xml:id="_smEDyhr">There was evidence of increased awareness of emotional triggers from the interview data and altered psychophysiological reactivity during journey impedance; however, the absence of any data collection after the post-test phase, such as a follow-up questionnaire or interviews, made it difficult to assess whether observed changes stemmed from a conscious or unconscious process of self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_SZUHXGm">It would be valuable to explore this particular issue and identify coping strategies for self-regulation of negative states via further research.</s><s xml:id="_5gkn2hR">As an additional caveat, the post-test phase immediately followed the data visualisation session and only lasted for two days, which prompts the question of whether those observed changes in cardiovascular reactivity would persist a week or a month later.</s></p><p xml:id="_YDBbscw"><s xml:id="_z67kZWv">With respect to the data visualisation interface, participants were able to easily interrogate personal data and extract meaningful information.</s><s xml:id="_G6zKG7c">The inclusion of context-specific photographs was enormously useful for participants to identify specific triggers for cardiovascular change.</s><s xml:id="_BE6SGCP">In general, participants found the combination of colour-coded icons placed on the Google map easy to understand.</s><s xml:id="_mM6U9DP">However, several participants requested a dynamic 'playback' mode and a colour-coding system that was based upon absolute rather than relative scores, which would permit comparisons between different journeys.</s><s xml:id="_tsz7Zxw">The bar chart, which provided an indication of car counts/traffic density, was not deemed to be very useful and could have been omitted.</s><s xml:id="_z8bfq4k">Despite positive responses to the data visualisation, it was noted that several participants questioned the utility of this approach in the context of everyday driving.</s><s xml:id="_JTbjqDH">The general feeling (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>) was that real-time feedback would have been more useful in aiding active self-regulation in situ compared to the retrospective approach that we used in the current study.</s><s xml:id="_ku4JUWG">In addition, a number of participants felt the approach was only really warranted for users with existing medical conditions.</s></p><p xml:id="_scquv38"><s xml:id="_Czn7bU3">The second study contained a number of shortcomings and weaknesses.</s><s xml:id="_tev6NUT">A large volume of data was collected over four days of driving but the number of individual participants was low.</s><s xml:id="_72cZ9nr">This weakness represented the practical difficulty of asking individuals to accommodate the data collection and associated inconvenience into their daily routines.</s><s xml:id="_rwePMMe">While the Shimmer sensors provided excellent data fidelity and it was important for the study to obtain an ECG, our participants found the necessary set-up of apparatus to be burdensome.</s><s xml:id="_6dKF8vh">There are alternative methods for monitoring heart rate and HRV non-invasively <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kranjec et al, 2014)</ref> and it is possible to capture HRV from a PPG signal if the participant remains in a stationary position <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lin et al, 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w9zKhSU">By reducing the logistic burden of data collection on participants, it would be possible to employ a similar protocol with a higher number of participants.</s><s xml:id="_WFP6n4D">The duration of the measurement period was limited by similar factors and it would have been preferable to monitor psychophysiology and mood over a longer period of time, simply to assess whether shortterm changes observed in the study persisted over weeks rather than days; this longitudinal methodology would also permit repeated interaction with the data visualisation interface and the inclusion of follow-up questionnaires.</s></p><p xml:id="_3SZSYYP"><s xml:id="_PRH5cpD">If a larger pool of participants was available, a follow-up study could also include a between-groups experimental design, wherein one group received data visualisation and the second (control) group did not.</s><s xml:id="_nDCZzJN">The current study used photographs taken every 30 seconds in order to provide a visual documentation of each journey.</s><s xml:id="_BVjbdUW">This approach ran a risk of missing transient events on the road, e.g.</s><s xml:id="_Ww7HT8q">sudden braking of lead vehicle, erratic behaviour from another motorist, and it could be argued that film footage would improve the visual documentation because it provides a continuous record of events on the road.</s><s xml:id="_arNFSYn">One can imagine an alternative data visualisation wherein clicking on a red marker within the map prompts a short playback on a second-by-second basis with accompanying psychophysiological data record.</s><s xml:id="_cRDerf4">However, this approach would be time intensive to review and there is a tradeoff between the fidelity of the data record and the willingness of the user to review frequent daily activities at that level of detail.</s></p><p xml:id="_SNcYBRb"><s xml:id="_napj3TQ">With respect to future work, it would be useful to compare and contrast real-time feedback of negative emotional states with the retrospective record provided in the current study.</s><s xml:id="_CC8PSE6">It can be argued that real-time feedback would be a superior approach to emotion regulation, because it works in situ and provides timely feedback, but introduction of real-time emotional feedback during driving.</s><s xml:id="_Y3E4vrT">A number of researchers have experimented with ambient light as feedback to driver mood and psychological states <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hassib et al, 2019)</ref>, the use of emoticons <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kim &amp; Lee, 2015)</ref> and the design of a dashboard dedicated to feedback on driver state <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Völkel et al, 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_avj9Ycs">Irrespective of the design of the feedback interface, there are the risks of distraction inadvertently intensifying negative emotional states when the person is driving.</s><s xml:id="_RVWYhb2">With respect to retrospective feedback, such as the interface designed in the current study, one can imagine a minimalist design where icons or pins are dropped into an electronic map of a regular route only to alert individuals of specific 'hot points' for negative emotions.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZT4Dnz7"><s xml:id="_9p3XNyV">The current study collected physiological data for individual drivers travelling on different roads at different times of day.</s><s xml:id="_GEngpJU">Future work could adopt a 'big data' approach where physiology is monitored across a large group of drivers, travelling on the same road network at the same time.</s><s xml:id="_pTsVyyf">The resulting data could provide valuable insight into health epidemiology (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_P8AQQRP">assessing cardiovascular changes during driving as a marker for disease), traffic management (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_4H86fC5">understanding the relationship between traffic flow and driver physiology) and roadway design (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_5Yq8Vrq">identifying junctions or stretches of road that are associated with high levels of cardiovascular reactivity for a large group of drivers).</s><s xml:id="_Thr6E3f">It would also be valuable to use this type of lifelogging platform to assess different methods of self-regulation in everyday life with respect to the reduction of inflammation.</s><s xml:id="_CW7pPBE">Different types of selfregulatory activity, such as slow breathing or psychological acceptance, could be contrasted and feedback via data visualisations, such as the one used in the current study, could play an important role as a training tool.</s><s xml:id="_tnVz4aV">The type of monitoring used in the study could also be used as an input to a passive or ambient intervention, e.g.</s><s xml:id="_GCrEKtr">detection of cardiovascular reactivity could prompt the introduction of low activation music, which has been shown to be effective in the reduction of systolic blood pressure during journey impedance <ref type="bibr"
