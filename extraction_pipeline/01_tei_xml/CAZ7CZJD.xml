Emotional support involves the provision of empathy, love, trust, and caring.</s><s xml:id="_2yWAEfE">2. Instrumental support involves the provision of tangible aid and services that directly assist a person in need.</s><s xml:id="_snMhThb">3. Informational support is the provision of advice, suggestions, and information that a person can use to address problems.</s><s xml:id="_CCSBacE">4. Appraisal support involves the provision of information that is useful for selfevaluation purposes-in other words, constructive feedback and affirmation.</s></p><p xml:id="_k3NvNya"><s xml:id="_FQvj9Gh">Although these four types of support can be differentiated conceptually, relationships that provide one type often also provide other types, thus making it difficult to study them empirically as separate constructs.</s><s xml:id="_Rv5syVr">(For a comprehensive review of measurement and methodological issues, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barrera, 2000;</ref><ref

is always intended (by the provider of the support) to be helpful, thus distinguishing it from intentional negative interactions (for example, social undermining behaviors such as angry criticism and hassling).</s></p><p xml:id="_DwFHzCd"><s xml:id="_sNeRYcE">Whether or not the intended support is perceived or experienced as helpful by the receiver is an empirical question, and indeed, negative perceptions and consequences of well-intended interpersonal exchanges have been identified (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wortman and Lehman, 1985)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2faZpZe">In addition, social support is consciously provided, which sets it apart from the social influence exerted through simple observation of the behavior of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura, 1986)</ref> or from receiver-initiated social comparison processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wood, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WP9Ctvr">Finally, although the provision of social support, particularly informational support, can attempt to influence the thoughts and behaviors of the receiver, such informational support is provided in an interpersonal context of caring, trust, and respect for each person's right to make his or her own choices.</s><s xml:id="_5GzrzvY">This quality distinguishes social support from some other types of social influence that derive from the ability to provide or withhold desired resources or approval.</s></p><p xml:id="_df8RuQA"><s xml:id="_xfmkm6d">Although many investigations of the effects of social relationships on health have narrowly focused on the provision of social support, a broader social network approach has several advantages.</s><s xml:id="_X3ed3cn">First, a social network approach can incorporate functions or characteristics of social relationships other than social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Israel, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berkman and Glass, 2000)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xDcRmBp">For example, there is increasing evidence that negative interpersonal interactions, such as those characterized by mistrust, hassles, criticism, and domination, are more strongly related to such factors as negative mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fleishman and others, 2000)</ref>, depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cranford, 2004)</ref>, risky health behaviors such as substance abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Oetzel, Duran, Jiang, and Lucero, 2007)</ref>, and susceptibility to infectious disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cohen and others, 1997)</ref> than is a lack of social support.</s><s xml:id="_ptJ79BE">Second, whereas a social support approach usually focuses on one relationship at a time, a social network approach allows for the study of how changes in one social relationship affect other relationships.</s><s xml:id="_ZXqrPh8">Third, a social network approach facilitates the investigation of how structural network characteristics influence the quantity and quality of social support that are exchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(McLeroy, Gottlieb, and Heaney, 2001)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SjhSM8Z">This information can be important for the development of effective support-enhancing interventions.</s><s xml:id="_xq4z7TN"><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes's (1954)</ref> pioneering work in a Norwegian village first presented the concept of a social network to describe patterns of social relationships that were not easily explained by more traditional social units such as extended families or work groups.</s><s xml:id="_R3NSmEB">Much of the early work on social networks was exploratory and descriptive.</s><s xml:id="_KMUA3JK">The findings from these studies provided a knowledge base that helped identify network characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_HFZwFDg">In general, it was found that close-knit networks exchange more affective and instrumental support, and also exert more social influence on members to conform to network norms.</s><s xml:id="_Stc2gfw">Homogenous networks, networks with more reciprocal linkages, and networks with closer geographical proximity were also more effective in providing affective and instrumental support (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Israel, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berkman and Glass, 2000 for reviews)</ref>.</s></p></div>
