beyond primary victims to impact overall unit cohesion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_z5j8JuP">Taken together, these studies suggest that the consequences of MSA are far-reaching, negatively impacting individual survivors and having deleterious effects on military functioning.</s><s xml:id="_JemGeXP">Owing to these consequences, beginning in the early 1990s, Congress mandated the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to address the trauma associated with MSA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref> Since the mid-2000s, there has been renewed interest in understanding the prevalence and causes of sexual assault in the military.</s><s xml:id="_6hNy2FT">Understanding these factors is crucial to developing tailored programs/policies to prevent victimization and interventions to address the consequences of MSA for individual victims, military functioning, and overall community health.</s></p><p xml:id="_9yEAmgP"><s xml:id="_4nNUPsB">The social-ecological model is widely used by researchers to understand the causes of violence, including sexual assault.</s><s xml:id="_AGKyuxy">Advocated by the Centers for Disease Control and

factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_fgA2wy2">This focus on individual-level factors stems from the availability of data and a history of victim-blaming that is reflected in research focusing on the behavior of victims rather than organization and community-level causes.</s><s xml:id="_pK5BdYG">The most consistent individual-level finding from the research is that rates of MSA, including harassment and sexual assault, are higher for women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref></s><s xml:id="_k8aMKTB">7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> Alcohol and drug use is common among these incidents, for both perpetration and victimization, which parallels the dynamics of sexual violence in the civilian population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref></s><s xml:id="_tHrJ7FV">Experiences in the military, including deployment and combat exposure, have also been found to increase rates of MSA, particularly for women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s xml:id="_44kk83t">In qualitative interviews, women attributed MSA during deployment to a combination of stressors associated with deployment and military culture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s xml:id="_t4KnafU">Individual-level factors are important as they point to differential risk among military personnel, but they do not address systematic structural conditions that influence MSA.</s><s xml:id="_eKU6tWX">Although prevention programs can address behaviors (e.g., intoxication) that increase individuals' risk of victimization, these efforts alone are unlikely to be effective without addressing risk factors found on the other levels of the social-ecological model.</s></p><p xml:id="_TcrTBG2"><s xml:id="_g7TMzyx">Explanations for MSA beyond the individual-level emphasize the roles of hypermasculinity and military structure in fostering a climate that supports MSA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref></s><s xml:id="_JAdEATa">or example, half or more of sexual assaults are perpetrated by higher-ranked military personnel, and assaults against men are more likely to involve multiple offenders and are attributed to humiliation or hazing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_h9WJNsc">Studies also demonstrate differences in the prevalence of MSA across branches, which are often attributed to branch-specific norms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_yf3vJeY">In addition to cultural differences, differences in MSA may reflect institutional structural factors that influence sexual assault.</s><s xml:id="_uqAEjSz">For example, a low ratio of women to men and the proportion of men that outrank women increase the risk of MSA for women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s xml:id="_nUUXZ3T">esearch also indicates that the prevalence of MSA varies considerably across bases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_FKnbEwc">Whereas factors unique to the military may contribute to a heightened risk of sexual assault compared with civilian populations, variation between bases points to the possibility of structural conditions that shape the risk of MSA, such as the size and type of installation.</s><s xml:id="_ZPaadjs">Likewise, research has found that the broader community context shapes outcomes related to the well-being of service members. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_GgdeqZp">Community economic disadvantage, residential mobility, population density and change, and racial heterogeneity are all associated with quality of life outcomes for military personnel and with the rate of sexual assault and victimization among civilian populations. <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_m8CFyqa">Many of the existing sexual violence prevention programs in the military have been developed for civilian populations and have not been rigorously examined for their effectiveness in reducing MSA among active service members. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">35</ref></s><s xml:id="_FA9XFvw">Furthermore, those that are developed specifically for the military are applied branch-wide.</s><s xml:id="_Xc2Q4xv">Programs and wider efforts to combat MSA, such as the policies and programs offered by the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, need to be thoroughly evaluated across a wide range of bases with varying structural characteristics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36</ref></s><s xml:id="_zuERHdz">ough previously not extended to MSA, most of the findings for the community indicators included in this study parallel the findings found for civilian populations.</s><s xml:id="_Nkp3Wed">Residential mobility and percentage of racial minorities positively predict MSA.</s><s xml:id="_SAZVhEe">However, this study found that economic deprivation was associated with less MSA.</s><s xml:id="_ux2u8ku">It is possible that economic deprivation in the surrounding community influences base security/organization (e.g., higher levels of installation security).</s><s xml:id="_wXeVBTJ">However, future research should explore this potential relationship.</s><s xml:id="_beS79tr">Structural factors that serve as protective factors are important as they can also be integrated into prevention efforts.</s></p><p xml:id="_g4qRdeE"><s xml:id="_SHzG3Wu">Paralleling the finding regarding the concentration of military personnel within a base, the percentage of veterans in the surrounding community was also associated with MSA.</s><s xml:id="_KcCgekt">Efforts to prevent MSA and support both active service members and veterans who are victims should involve a comprehensive approach that is tailored to the military context, include coordination between the DoD and VA, and leverage strong community partnerships.</s><s xml:id="_BA8JENT">Compared with prevention, there has been a more comprehensive response in supporting victims.</s><s xml:id="_twRkUrt">Through the VA, service members who are victims of MSA can access both community-and military-based services.</s><s xml:id="_ujwWuAM">For example, the Office for Victims of Crime works with communities that have a large military presence with the intention of facilitating and strengthening military-community partnerships.</s><s xml:id="_K5ZVvGx">These partnerships may provide the basis for more comprehensive approaches to prevention and trauma-informed care.</s><s xml:id="_J67BSFX">However, these programs such as MSA prevention programs have not been extensively evaluated regarding processes or outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_AyXrbTZ"><s xml:id="_3RnNt49">There are a number of other potentially relevant base characteristics that should be explored in future research.</s><s xml:id="_gvqrcwB">Extending the finding that the overall concentration of military personnel on an installation increases MSA, the

xml:id="_jPybDjt">Combat exposure, at the individual level, is associated with an increase in MSA for both men and women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_qj9HEqJ">Likewise, leadership characteristics have been associated with MSA in surveys of service members. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">37</ref></s><s xml:id="_F2ZJmTp">The composition of military personnel may not be evenly distributed among bases, and future research should explore the extent to which that variation contributes to MSA.</s><s xml:id="_HqBZzF7">Furthermore, this study found that structural characteristics impact MSA and that MSA varies by military branch.</s><s xml:id="_kDvuh5m">The extent to which structural factors differentially impact military branches should be explored.</s><s xml:id="_EGgetnD">Additional community-level factors should also be examined in future research on MSA.</s><s xml:id="_TJV4MSS">For example, measures of land usage such as the density of alcohol outlets are associated with violent crime (including sexual assault) in the community among civilian populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">38</ref></s><s xml:id="_As6pbMk">Other measures of community health that have been shown to influence military retention and re-enlistment, such as transportation infrastructure, may also have a relationship with MSA.</s><s xml:id="_bbWbwRM">Likewise, concepts that are generally associated with violent crime, such as collective efficacy, may also extend to sexual assault among service members. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">39</ref></s><s xml:id="_bN2CyKW">Furthermore, the impact of changes in community health and more relational measures between the base and the larger communities in which these bases are embedded should be examined.</s></p><p xml:id="_JZ3njUy"><s xml:id="_8kQQbyA">Future research should also explore factors related to social inequality, particularly as they relate to the societal level of the social-ecological model.</s><s xml:id="_ZRKP9wN">Previous research has found that structural factors related to gender inequality (e.g., ratio of men-to-women service members) is associated with MSA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s xml:id="_rsS5Snt">Comparable structural factors related to inequality in the community may also influence rates of MSA on bases.</s><s xml:id="_SyPZAHj">Extending beyond structural factors, the prevalence of MSA is thought to stem from hypermasculine cultural norms within the armed forces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_3422jfZ">Although these cultural factors may in part be unique to the military context, they exist in a larger system of cultural norms that perpetuate sexual violence.</s></p><p xml:id="_PXx3ugh"><s xml:id="_GV6GxKG">As noted by previous research, community-level studies often do not explore the potential differential impact of these factors on specific subpopulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_NgDHyeG">This is an important avenue for future research.</s><s xml:id="_wPGDSna">Individual-level research
