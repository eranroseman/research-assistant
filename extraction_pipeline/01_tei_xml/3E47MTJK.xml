<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_sMU4yE6"><p xml:id="_D2mjAW6"><s xml:id="_QVQ3sMW">Motivational interviewing is a relatively new and promising therapeutic approach that integrates the relationship-building principles of humanistic therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rogers, 1951)</ref> with more active cognitive-behavioral strategies targeted to the client's stage of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Prochaska, DiClemente, &amp; Norcross, 1992)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wExBKvH">It has been defined as a client-centered yet directive method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving client ambivalence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DRe6hwp">Since publication of the first edition of the motivational interviewing book <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Miller &amp; Rollnick, 1991)</ref>, empirical research has advanced on approaches related to motivational interviewing for a variety of clinical problems.</s><s xml:id="_9gEKTVA">In the past decade, three exemplary studies that eliminated almost all threats to internal validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Miller, Benefield, &amp; Tonigan, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Project MATCH, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Stephens, Roffman, &amp; Curtin, 2000)</ref> have provided strong support for the efficacy of these approaches in the areas of alcohol and drug addiction.</s><s xml:id="_hvuxYNc">The present article reviews this research domain meta-analytically, focusing on controlled clinical trials of individually delivered interventions that incorporated the four basic principles of motivational interviewing discussed in turn in the following text: (a) expressing empathy, (b) developing discrepancy, (c) rolling with resistance, and (d) supporting self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_GasVAAk"><s xml:id="_vqCzSr5">Although expressing empathy is fundamental to virtually all psychotherapies, in motivational interviewing it takes the specific form of reflective listening (or accurate empathy) as described by Carl <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rogers (1951)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SD9ruHh">Underlying this principle of empathy is a client-centered attitude of acceptance, wherein client ambivalence or reluctance to change is viewed as a normal part of the human experience rather than as pathology or pernicious defensiveness.</s><s xml:id="_FXR5R79">Developing discrepancy, the second principle of motivational interviewing, is where it begins to depart from classic client-centered therapy.</s><s xml:id="_XquQ8QS">A key goal in motivational interviewing is to increase the importance of change from the client's perspective.</s><s xml:id="_axhTCks">This is accomplished using specific types of questions, along with selective reflections, that direct the client toward the discrepancy between his or her problem behavior and broader personal values.</s></p><p xml:id="_SyF4NR8"><s xml:id="_SWSuEfd">Although motivational interviewing is intentionally directive, the therapist is careful not to explicitly advocate for change; it is the client who presents the reasons for change.</s><s xml:id="_CuKnn5F">Accordingly, when a client expresses resistance to change, it is a signal for the interviewer to respond differently.</s><s xml:id="_9W7H3Mb">Resistance is conceptualized as an interpersonal variable, and the third basic principle of motivational interviewing is not to oppose the client's resistance actively but rather to accept and flow with it, again using reflective listening skills.</s><s xml:id="_x2t6HFp">Finally, a client's readiness for change is hypothesized to stem from two main factors: the importance of the change for the client (as discussed above) and the confidence the client has about successfully making the change.</s><s xml:id="_DVvkJMe">This confidence, often termed self-efficacy, is an essential element in motivation and a good predictor of treatment outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_myU4Rre">The fourth guiding principle of motivational interviewing, therefore, is to enhance the client's confidence in his or her own capability to cope with obstacles and to succeed in changing.</s></p><p xml:id="_9CdxePH"><s xml:id="_F9U8Rfn">In the research literature, the most widely used approach related to motivational interviewing has been one in which the client (often alcohol or drug addicted) is given feedback based on individual results from standardized assessment measures, such as the Drinker's Check-Up <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Miller, Sovereign, &amp; Krege, 1988)</ref> or a modification of it.</s><s xml:id="_c4UK8jc">This feedback, which concerns the client's level of severity on the target symptom compared with norms, is delivered in a motivational interviewing "style," wherein possibilities for change are elicited from the client in a nonthreatening manner.</s><s xml:id="_TRcVr7p">Discussion of the problem may extend to one or more sessions that continue to embody the fundamental spirit and methods of motivational interviewing.</s><s xml:id="_uPbG39V">We, along with <ref type="bibr">Miller (W. R. Miller, personal communication, March 2001)</ref>, consider this feedback-based approach to constitute an adaptation of motivational interviewing (AMI) because it is defined by the presence of the feedback component and not solely by the use of motivational interviewing per se.</s><s xml:id="_cn7TnCa">More broadly, we also apply the term AMI to interventions that incorporate additional nonmotivational interviewing techniques while retaining motivational interviewing principles as the core of treatment as well as to interventions that have been specifically adapted for use by nonspecialists <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rollnick, Heather, &amp; Bell, 1992)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mhu5YNW">To date, virtually all of the empirical studies in this area (and therefore in this review) have dealt with the efficacy of AMIs, and no studies have addressed the efficacy of motivational interviewing in its relatively pure form.</s></p><p xml:id="_4REJBsQ"><s xml:id="_Uqf4ZGz">Three previous reviews of approaches related to motivational interviewing have been published.</s><s xml:id="_x74ZauD"><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Noonan and Moyers (1997)</ref> reviewed the 11 clinical trials of AMIs available at that time (9 with problem drinkers and 2 with drug abusers) and concluded that 9 of these studies supported the efficacy of AMIs for addictive behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_WJZNcCV"><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dunn, DeRoo, and Rivara (2001)</ref> performed a systematic review of 29 randomized trials of brief interventions that claimed to use the principles and techniques of motivational interviewing (or what we have called AMIs) to change behavior in four areas: (a) substance abuse, (b) smoking, (c) HIV-risk reduction, and (d) diet and exercise.</s><s xml:id="_UzNBV8T">Data on methodological features were tabled, as were calculations of effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals, although the authors chose not to combine or compare data meta-analytically.</s><s xml:id="_SqYX67p">The strongest evidence for efficacy was found in the alcohol and drug abuse areas, in which AMIs appeared to work well for problem drinkers and improved the rate of entry into and retention in intensive substance abuse treatment.</s><s xml:id="_4y7Xkqy">AMI effects did not appear to diminish over time, and the effect sizes for AMIs as preludes to other treatments (e.g., inpatient care) were roughly equivalent to those for AMIs as stand-alone interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_9NVFAcg"><s xml:id="_BuXzuDc">More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burke, Arkowitz, and Dunn (2002)</ref> qualitatively reviewed 26 studies that met their specified inclusion criteria.</s><s xml:id="_mZbjhKG">The authors concluded that the research supported the efficacy of AMIs for alcohol problems, drug addiction, hypertension, and bulimia as well as its efficacy for encouraging compliance in patients with diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_QcAbAZA">Mixed support was found for AMIs in the areas of reducing cigarette smoking, increasing physical activity, and enhancing dietary adherence in patients with hyperlipidemia.</s><s xml:id="_a83Ec2P">No support was found for AMIs in the reduction of HIV-risk behaviors (e.g., needle-sharing).</s><s xml:id="_atCMNQv">In general, the AMIs reviewed were superior to no-treatment control groups and less credible alternative treatments and equal to active comparison treatments.</s><s xml:id="_Tj6yC3R">After examining evidence regarding the mechanism of AMIs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burke et al.

(1986)</ref> reported that 50% of clients improved in eight sessions of psychotherapeutic treatment-yet AMIs yielded these same improvement rates in an average of just two sessions.</s></p></note>
