Internet-based trials.</s><s xml:id="_nqVyPT5">Peter Farvolden and colleagues present an Internet-based evaluation of a panic disorder self-help Web program, struggling with a huge proportion of users discontinuing usage: only 12 out of 1161 (about 1%) completed the entire 12-week program <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_u8rSpbK">A similar observation has been made previously by Christensen et al in her evaluation of Moodgym, a depression program with 5 modules, where only 97 out of 19607 (0.5%) participants completed all 5 modules in an "open " setting, and 41 out of 182 (22.5%) completed all of them in a trial setting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_drBjtpv">Also in this issue, Wu et al report results from an exemplary study evaluating whether people would actually use (and continue to use) an innovative Internet-based communication and disease management platform requiring patients to enter different parameters and enabling them to exchange messages with clinicians online.</s><s xml:id="_ZgRpZ96">He found that 26 out of 58 used it over a period of 3 months, only 16 patients continued to use the system after 12 months, 8 continued to use the system at 2 years, and 4 continued to used the system after 3 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wNGzTrN">Among the users, there also seemed to be a decline in the intensity of use, with a decrease in the number of messages entered by both patients and clinicians over time.</s><s xml:id="_BB3fQUg">These data are reminiscent of the experiences of Anhoj in a previous issue of the Journal of Medical Internet Research.</s><s xml:id="_E8xVfRd">Anhoj observed the contrast between users' positive perception of LinkMedica and their unwillingness to use the website for more than short periods.</s><s xml:id="_rtw2H5y">The primary reason for this was that LinkMedica "did not fit into their everyday lives."</s><s xml:id="_nW4Q3Qc"><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Finally, in this issue, is Jean-Fran√ßois Etter's landmark paper reporting results from one of the largest and perhaps best conducted Internet-based trials ever published to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dpZFweR">He as well reports a considerable proportion of dropouts, with only 35% of the 11969 enrolled participants replying to the follow-up questionnaire.</s><s xml:id="_P9PzgAr">Amazingly, despite this huge loss-to-follow-up rate, the study still had enough statistical power to detect significant differences between the two interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_fVJxHPa"><s xml:id="_ppJUBJE">All these papers allude to a common problem: the law of attrition, as I call it, ie. the phenomenon of participants stopping usage and/or being lost to follow-up, as one of the fundamental characteristics and methodological challenges in the evaluation of eHealth applications.</s><s xml:id="_ZWtdUUH">While in most drug trials the intervention is "prescribed", in studies involving information and communication technology usage of the intervention is mostly at the discretion of the participant and the participant has the option to discontinue usage very easily.</s><s xml:id="_ZfCmrQb">In any longitudinal study where the intervention is neither mandatory nor critical to the participants' well-being, trial participants will be lost.</s><s xml:id="_vDXjs3d">Lack of compliance is usually not a major problem in drug trials, as participants are more closely supervised and sometimes experience observable and immediate health benefits in taking a drug.</s><s xml:id="_NWQQMxd">Thus, in drug trials, almost everyone in the intervention group will actually be getting the intervention (and receiving the same dose).</s><s xml:id="_XcBRntp">In contrast, one of the fundamental methodological problems in eHealth trials is that in the intervention group a (sometimes substantial) proportion of people will not be using the intervention or using it sparingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VunrT7H">It is difficult to measure an effect of an intervention if participants in the intervention group do not use the application.</s></p><p xml:id="_8hTE36m"><s xml:id="_VyYW6b5">In this paper I argue that a "science of attrition" is needed.</s><s xml:id="_BDzynbX">Nonusage data per se should be of great interest to researchers, and attrition curves may be underreported and underanalyzed.</s><s xml:id="_RGNnrrr">Some theoretical models of attrition are proposed and I argue that by understanding and describing patterns and predictors for attrition and empirically verifying the proposed models, eHealth researchers may not only advance our understanding of the impact and uptake of eHealth interventions, but also contribute to the interdisciplinary field of diffusion research at large.</s></p></div>

Rogers defines innovation as "an idea perceived as new by the individual" and diffusion is "the process by which an innovation spreads."</s><s xml:id="_AjCUEH8"><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> The model of diffusion of innovation proposed by Rogers was originally used by rural sociologists to study the diffusion of agricultural technologies in social systems.</s><s xml:id="_FzYT5YH">After its conception, an innovation spreads slowly at first -usually through the work of change agents, who actively promote it -then picks up speed as more and more people adopt it.</s><s xml:id="_zBHPYva">Eventually it reaches a saturation level, where virtually everyone who is going to adopt the innovation has done so.</s></p><p xml:id="_NwCqppQ"><s xml:id="_phF8gsY">In trials of efficacy of eHealth interventions we are usually starting with an enrolled population of 100% "intent-to-use" participants, who have already gone through a recruitment, selection and informed consent process, ie, all of them have, in principle, already agreed to use and "adopted" the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_cwAMD2a">However, as shown above, in many trials a considerable number of users may discontinue the intervention or (worse) drop out of the trial altogether -a reversal of the adoption process.</s></p><p xml:id="_NUq48uU"><s xml:id="_MUsU8MF">In his 550-page book about how new ideas spread and are adopted, Rogers spends a mere 5 pages on reversal of decisions to adopt an innovation, illustrating how little research has been done in this area.</s><s xml:id="_gJEHwe8">Empirical evidence in eHealth (and perhaps in other areas in health care, for example, the self-help and self-support area in general, as noted by Farvolden <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) suggests that abandoning an innovation is a significant phenomenon, perhaps deserving more attention and research.</s><s xml:id="_YtbeXTN">The fact that reversals of decisions are frequent is acknowledged by diffusion scholars.</s><s xml:id="_bNGT4mP">Rogers cites a study among Wisconsin farmers showing that the rate of discontinuance was just as important as the rate of adoption in determining the level of adoption at any particular time, for in any given year there were as many discontinuers as there were first-time adopters.</s></p><p xml:id="_zagNccX"><s xml:id="_nSxCHJn">Rogers calls the innovation adoption stage where people may reverse their decision the confirmation stage.</s><s xml:id="_C7scBXM">In this stage, according to Rogers, "The individual ‚Ä¶ seeks reinforcement for the innovation-decision already made, and may reverse this decision if exposed to conflicting messages about the innovation."</s><s xml:id="_nMYmYQG">If a dissonance is created, ie, a state of internal disequilibrium or uncomfortable state of mind evolves, the innovation may be abandoned.</s></p><p xml:id="_eAZvHQY"><s xml:id="_vKqapY4">Rogers distinguishes disenchantment from replacement discontinuance.</s><s xml:id="_9B7JYv6">Replacement discontinuance is a "decision to reject an idea in order to adopt a better idea that supersedes it", eg, MP3 and iPod players replacing walkmans, email replacing postal mail.</s><s xml:id="_bWdCTKn">In the context of Internet-based medical studies, the next website with (perhaps better) content competing for the attention of the participant is only a few mouseclicks away <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, making replacement discontinuance a not unlikely event.</s></p><p xml:id="_FHRS4dP"><s xml:id="_tQUPPSe">Disenchantment discontinuance leads to a rejection because the individuals are dissatisfied.</s><s xml:id="_ku3ECsc">In health care, disenchantment and replacement often go hand in hand, as it is often not possible to simply drop an intervention without using a replacement.</s><s xml:id="_xh9eem3">In an Web-based communication tool intervention such as the one described by Wu et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, electronic messaging can, for example, be replaced by phone calls or office visits.</s></p></div>
