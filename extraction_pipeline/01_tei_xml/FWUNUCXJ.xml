increase health disparities due to unequal access to technology.</s><s xml:id="_p5YhuNj">Vulnerable, hard-to-reach, or otherwise high-risk patient populations were the target audiences for several mAdherence interventions.</s><s xml:id="_b5ZrRV3">There is a clear recognition that mHealth tools have the potential to impact patients who are less inclined to engage traditional health services.</s><s xml:id="_RpExmNz">mAdherence offers a way to address barriers to care and to reduce health disparities.</s><s xml:id="_YWBy8Th">There is also some recognition that unequal access to, use of, and knowledge of information and communication technology can influence the uptake and use of mHealth tools.</s><s xml:id="_TBaPW35">These inequalities and the needs of the target user group should be taken into consideration early in the design and development of the mAdherence tool.</s><s xml:id="_US9xMQx">However, none of the studies included in this review addressed systematic differences in usability between diverse patient groups.</s><s xml:id="_nEGYDFr">Future research can be designed to better understand these differences and to encourage the development of mAdherence tools that address the needs of diverse patient groups.</s></p><p xml:id="_7TpTZjv"><s xml:id="_8ZGPDdt">Of note, few studies take seriously the issue of cost.</s><s xml:id="_4Aw3cmX">In many of the small pilot studies, expensive devices or vouchers were given to study participants.</s><s xml:id="_5tNgknP">When implemented at scale, interventions that use patients' existing mobile devices rather than relying on gifted devices will go further toward explaining feasibility and improving adherence.</s><s xml:id="_gxG4zW7">Though currently concentrated in the developed world, pockets of mAdherence innovations are expanding around the globe.</s><s xml:id="_tXvCjXP">As developing countries work to address the burden of chronic disease, they may look to the potential of mHealth to lessen that burden.</s><s xml:id="_2DHfBAM">Part of that potential is to reduce costs and expand outreach.</s><s xml:id="_DY8qp2V">More mAdherence studies from resource-limited settings, especially in Africa and Asia, are needed.</s><s xml:id="_NFgnFas">Rigorous cost-effectiveness analyses will be necessary to demonstrate not only the health impact but also the value of investing in these innovations now.</s></p><p xml:id="_H6ADGUF"><s xml:id="_tGRJeSz">Besides cost, language, and literacy barriers, availability and connectivity issues are also potential barriers to consider.</s><s xml:id="_qmbDKjQ">Perhaps most critically, if adherence to chronic disease management is not encouraged and actively practiced, it is very unlikely that mAdherence will be successful.</s><s xml:id="_WCH7RrW">mHealth tools are communication platforms and delivery mechanisms, not solutions in and of themselves.</s><s xml:id="_GMQ6EPs">mAdherence will only work where there is already a
