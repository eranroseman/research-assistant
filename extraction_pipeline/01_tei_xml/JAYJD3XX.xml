<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_3RxVKZ2">Need Support: The Social Context and the Motivation Continuum</head><p xml:id="_7UgDZCj"><s xml:id="_MS8SeNX">One of the defining features of SDT is its treatment of both the person (i.e., personality) and the situation (i.e., the social context) in motivated behavior.</s><s xml:id="_MdwzGa8">That is, at a personality level, individuals may orient to their surroundings in relatively more or less autonomous ways and thus their behaviors may be, on average, relatively more or less autonomously regulated.</s><s xml:id="_FW6d6Hs">However, personality does not tell the full story.</s><s xml:id="_2MMcPjd">Indeed, the social context may support or thwart autonomous self-regulation and the process of internalization in any given domain.</s><s xml:id="_y9hDVVe">According to SDT, the extent to which one experiences need support from various contexts (e.g., doctor-patient interactions) is largely predictive of how autonomouslyregulated one is likely to be for prescribed behaviors.</s></p><p xml:id="_DWysagT"><s xml:id="_6cVwnr8">SDT has identified three psychological needs critical to supporting the process of internalization and the development of optimal motivation and personal wellbeing.</s><s xml:id="_VjfCNdd">The need for autonomy reflects the need to feel choiceful and volitional, as the originator of one's actions.</s><s xml:id="_CuamAKY">Competence involves the need to feel capable of achieving desired outcomes, conceptually similar to selfefficacy in social cognitive theory.</s><s xml:id="_hAgqDhd">Finally, relatedness reflects the need to feel close to and understood by important others.</s><s xml:id="_guPjyv6">When people experience the satisfaction of these needs in a given context, they are more</s></p><p xml:id="_dMSUe8P"><s xml:id="_XRbeAfD">Type of Regulation Definition Health Behavior Example External Regulation Introjected Regulation Identified Regulation Integrated Regulation Behaving to gain some reward or avoid some negative contingency Behaving out of a sense of guilt or obligation or a need to prove something Behaving because of the importance one ascribes to the behavior Behaving because the behavior is consistent with other goals &amp; values Losing weight to get a prize and/or recognition in a competition Losing weight because one feels that obesity is a character flaw Losing weight because a healthy weight is an important goal to accomplish Losing weight because it is consistent with other health goals (e.g., lower cholesterol) likely to be autonomously self-regulated around the behaviors relevant to that context.</s><s xml:id="_KW5Ew4k">Thus, to the extent that a patient feels his needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are supported in a discussion with his primary care doctor about, for example, modifying his diet to include more fruits and vegetables, the patient is likely to feel more autonomously self-regulated (i.e., more identified or integrated) around this recommended health behavior change.</s></p><p xml:id="_G24Qeua"><s xml:id="_eDMxF3Q">Given the importance of need support in facilitating internalization, SDT has offered suggestions for specific behavioral strategies that may support one or more of these needs.</s><s xml:id="_qZRydp5">For example, autonomy supportive behaviors include eliciting and acknowledging patients' perspectives and emotions before making recommendations; supporting patients' choices and initiatives; providing a rationale for advice given; providing a menu of effective (i.e., evidence-based) options for change; minimizing control and judgment; and exploring how relevant health behaviors relate to patients' aspirations in life.</s><s xml:id="_Jfeh3EZ">For example, a practitioner working with a patient on tobacco cessation may support the patient's autonomy by asking the patient to express what the patient thinks it would be like to deal with stressful situations without smoking (i.e., by eliciting the patient's perspectives and emotions).</s><s xml:id="_PW5jqhE">Competence support involves being positive that patients can succeed; reframing past failures as short successes; providing accurate effectance feedback in a non-judgmental manner; identifying barriers; skills building and problem solving; and developing a plan that is appropriately challenging to patients' skill and experience level.</s><s xml:id="_HnPPuwE">Competence support may be particularly relevant in the context of failure.</s><s xml:id="_8tpHE6Q">For example, a patient may have gone two weeks without smoking but started smoking after a particularly stressful event at work.</s><s xml:id="_eswCKKs">The practitioner could support the patient's need for competence by focusing on the accomplishment of being smoke-free for two weeks and discussing with the patient the important gains that were made in that (e.g., knowing that quitting for 2 weeks is possible; learning more about triggers for smoking, etc.).</s><s xml:id="_P4WjXDE">Both theoretical conjecture and some recent empirical evidence in applications of SDT to health suggest that authentic perceived competence does not emerge without the person feeling fully volitional (i.e., autonomously regulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_baFmHdf">Thus, supporting patient autonomy by ensuring that patients are fully volitional or willing to consider change is also relevant to supporting competence.</s><s xml:id="_RCpkpTn">Finally, relatedness support includes providing unconditional positive regard (particularly in the face of failure to achieve desired goals), being empathic with patients' concerns, and providing a consistently warm interpersonal environment.</s><s xml:id="_y3VUhNf">Thus, a practitioner may support a patient's need for relatedness by expressing understanding about how difficult making a behavior change like quitting smoking can be and reflecting the patient's concerns about failure.</s><s xml:id="_7QF5YuK">Support for all three needs requires that clinicians are actively engaged with their clients, and that they take a clientcentered approach to the interaction.</s><s xml:id="_wCYm4qd">For example, eliciting and acknowledging the client's perspective starts with active listening and includes reflections (e.g., brief summaries of the thoughts, emotions, and plans the client has about the health issue being addressed).</s><s xml:id="_UjnZ2SM">Typically perceived need support from health care practitioners has been measured with the Health Care Climate Questionnaire, (HCCQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_TeK3Cyh"><s xml:id="_SxxHEa5">The concept of need support is one factor that makes SDT particularly amenable to health contexts as it is consistent with biomedical ethics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, law and medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, medical professionalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and informed decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wptfqu2">Respect for patient autonomy is an integral part of all health care interventions.</s><s xml:id="_7xaeREU">Biomedical ethics has elevated respect for autonomy to one of three highest-priority outcomes of all healthcare encounters, equivalent to those of enhancing patient welfare and improving social justice (e.g., eliminating discrimination).</s><s xml:id="_FU7ABAd">Thus, SDT's emphasis on supporting basic psychological needs, particularly individuals' need for autonomy, is consistent with these more general principles of patient care, making its practical utility in clinical and healthcare contexts paramount.</s><s xml:id="_G36kuDA">These general principles of patient care also suggest that measuring autonomy and its change is important-if not essential-for translational research, as all clinical interventions are obligated to respect autonomy regardless of the theoretical frame it is based upon, or the outcome it is intended to change.</s><s xml:id="_zMHgc8P">Biomedical ethics establishes that respect for autonomy and autonomous self-regulation is an important health outcome in and of itself.</s><s xml:id="_XqfvEjk">This topic is addressed further by Vansteenkiste and Williams, this issue.</s></p></div>

below) indicated that an SDT-based intervention helped to sustain intrinsic aspirations at 12 months post-intervention.</s><s xml:id="_jTRvRkb">Further, intrinsic aspirations demonstrated both a mediating and a moderating effect on the intervention such that (a) an SDT-based intervention facilitated a maintained increase in the importance of intrinsic aspirations for health which in turn

a rationale for advice given, and minimizing control, while avoiding judgment.</s><s xml:id="_m67m7Ug">The need-thwarting condition was characterized by the physician dominating the conversation, minimizing patient choice, and instructing the patient on what he or she should do, with no rationale or reflection.</s><s xml:id="_dMujZND">Patient involvement in the discussion was assessed by independent raters, based on audio tapes of the doctor-patient interaction.</s><s xml:id="_vbEGFQD">Patient smoking status was assessed at 6 months, 12 months, and 30 months post-discussion.</s><s xml:id="_hr5KeHK">Results revealed that observed physician interaction style indirectly predicted patient smoking status through its direct influence on patient involvement-a hallmark of autonomous self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_UyBkMjp">This intervention is particularly important because it speaks directly to the practical utility of SDT as it was conducted in the real-world setting of a

about dental health conducted by a dental hygienist.</s><s xml:id="_g9nhRmQ">The informational session was designed to be consistent with the principles of SDT including acknowledging patient perspectives and feelings about dental health concerns, providing a rationale for dental prophylaxis, and providing choices and options for preventive behaviors that patients could choose to adopt.</s><s xml:id="_SSy9Kcj">The dental hygienist also provided competence-support for intervention participants by demonstrating proper brushing and flossing techniques, allowing participants to practice these dental health behaviors, and conveying confidence in participants' ability to maintain these behaviors over time.</s><s xml:id="_dEUqDX7">Six months after the routine dental cleaning,

examined SDT variables in the context of traditional medical weight loss interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, this recent research activity has used the tenets of SDT to inform the development of interventions for weight loss, physical activity, and diet.</s><s xml:id="_VXVfPyf">For example, in a study of patients in a community-based primary care practice, participants who

efforts have been made toward the development of an emergent theory of MI <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_257SXCh">This is perhaps the most notable distinction between MI and

SDT is that it offers a theoretical basis from which to understand the mechanisms through which SDT-based interventions are efficacious, a challenge to SDT researchers has been to translate theoretical concepts of need-supportive contexts into clinical techniques used in interventions.</s><s xml:id="_TY2EDvn">Thus, because of the consistency between MI techniques and SDT need support,

has ensued between SDT and MI researchers is around the area of directiveness.</s><s xml:id="_4DDsMrf">Although Miller and Rollnick <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref> define MI as both client-centered and directive, MI is also very clear that attempts to directly persuade a client are ineffective in dealing with the client's ambivalence because such persuasive attempts inherently "take sides" in the ambivalence.</s><s xml:id="_QxGGjP4">In contrast, SDT has maintained, in the practice of healthcare interventions, that patient autonomy may be supported, in part, by making explicit recommendations about health and well-being (cf 12, 49).</s><s xml:id="_kanpWjj">Further, in medical contexts in particular, explicit recommendations are often an expected component of interactions between practitioners and patients, and a practitioners' refusal to provide such direction-in addition to its potential for being unethical-does not support the patient's psychological needs.</s><s xml:id="_ZumATay">To illustrate, if a patient asks for a recommendation about treatment for a heart attack, the patient would likely feel a high level of control (e.g., thwarting of need for autonomy) and abandonment (thwarting of need for relatedness), for the doctor to insist the patient choose the treatment without a recommendation.</s><s xml:id="_avg7G7j">Within SDT, recommendations must be given after eliciting and acknowledging client perspectives, non-coercively and in an autonomysupportive way.</s><s xml:id="_frT6ZBM">When provided in this manner, the recommendation is more likely to be experienced by the patient as being informational, as opposed to coercive, and thus supports the patient in making the decision himself or herself (e.g., "I believe that stopping smoking is the best thing for your health, but only you can decide if you are going to smoke or not.</s><s xml:id="_uxvJEwq">The choice is ultimately yours, and I am here to support you in whatever decision you make.").</s><s xml:id="_9dg64xV">More recent formulations of MI have allowed for medical practitioners to make recommendations when patients specifically ask for advice and

of the term "intrinsic motivation."</s><s xml:id="_DtYBtpe">MI maintains that a primary goal of the techniques employed in MI interventions is to enhance intrinsic motivation [e.g., <ref type="bibr"

MI.</s><s xml:id="_Hbb68Cr">Despite these differences, there is actually a good deal of conceptual overlap and similarity between SDT and MI.</s><s xml:id="_f9e2cYM">Perhaps most noteworthy is that both SDT and MI start with the same basic assumption: That humans are naturally oriented toward growth, health and well-being.</s></p><p xml:id="_w5HnRgz"><s xml:id="_4hUSURU">Additionally, both identify and work with-rather than attempt to combat-patient's ambivalence toward change.</s><s xml:id="_a6Wtgdk">Further, MI techniques are at least partially consistent with SDT's notion of need support.</s><s xml:id="_kFHwuru">Although traditionally, SDT has spoken primarily to the issue of autonomy support, the way in which perceptions of autonomy support have traditionally been measured (i.e., HCCQ [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>]) and the nature of SDT-based interventions really address

strategies that result in greater perceived competence.</s><s xml:id="_FJ4vMbG">SDT predicts that perceived competence alone is not sufficient to motivate behavior; it must be accompanied by autonomy.</s><s xml:id="_nYT6AhW">This is in contradistinction to Social Cognitive Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref> which places nearly exclusive emphasis on self-efficacy.</s></p><p

empathically, Empower the patient) and three core communication skills (ask, listen, inform).</s><s xml:id="_tP8mjch">We also discuss how these elements of MI are consistent with the support of psychological needs identified by SDT and thus, may support the process of internalization more broadly.</s></p><p xml:id="_XMwrVQh"><s xml:id="_NxdXFE9">MI recognizes the natural tendency for those in the helping professions-particularly those in health care settings-to want to try to "fix" whatever is wrong with their patients or clients.</s><s xml:id="_JCNjVJ2">However, MI also notes that resistance can arise when patients feel that their practitioner is trying to convince them of a particular course of action.</s><s xml:id="_cm2HFP9">This may be particularly pronounced in situations in which the individual feels ambivalent about change.</s><s xml:id="_C9xwEGY">Thus, it is critical that practitioners resist the righting reflex and instead allow clients to explore both sides of their ambivalence so that, in the end, the client is the one giving voice to reasons for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fAB9vKa">This guiding principle is similar to what SDT describes as minimizing control and remaining nonjudgmental.</s><s xml:id="_XzyNrn5">This may support clients' needs for both autonomy and relatedness by allowing patients the freedom to explore reasons for or against change (autonomy) in a non-judgmental context (relatedness).</s></p><p xml:id="_xZBaqAM"><s xml:id="_Uk8PK2a">Like SDT, from the perspective of MI, it is critical for patients to experience themselves as the originators of their actions toward behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_EkxbNKA">Thus, practitioners need to understand and explore the patient's motivations.</s><s xml:id="_dRkXUpa">This includes exploring how the patient views their current behavior and situation, concerns about change, and other goals and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_c6tncVQ">This guiding principle of MI is consistent with SDT autonomy support, particularly eliciting and acknowledging client perspectives and emotions,

accepted and valued before behavior change is possible.</s><s xml:id="_f7tYQEm">Listening to a patient empathically likely supports the client's need for relatedness and reflects that both MI and SDT emerged from the Rogerian school of thought, which promotes unconditional positive regard and patient centeredness as paramount to the therapeutic relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nXsE4wc">Finally, the fourth guiding principle of MI-empower the patient -involves supporting self-efficacy for change.</s><s xml:id="_FGbtqEQ">This technique likely primarily supports clients' need for competence by enhancing their confidence in being able to make progress toward positive change and to cope with challenges and barriers as they arise.</s></p><p xml:id="_FjZQcVp"><s xml:id="_qXgSxWn">In addition to these four guiding principles, MI researchers have also articulated three core communication skills that provide practical utility to these principles.</s><s xml:id="_nC8RugB">These communication skills include asking, listening, and informing.</s><s xml:id="_nyjNTpG">The purpose of asking is to elicit the client's perspective so that the practitioner understands where the patient is coming from and how the patient approaches the possibility of behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_CfU3YH5">Listening is an active process whereby the practitioner "checks in" with the client to ensure that he or she has an accurate understanding of client's perspective, motivations, and struggles through the process of behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_bhCB3CH">Finally, informing is the primary means by which practitioners convey knowledge to a client about their health condition, the behavior changes necessary to monitor or improve the health condition, and treatment options that may be available.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_H5ncjdv">Directions for the Future</head><p xml:id="_CGCVURC"><s xml:id="_ZJtnrAt">Although SDT and MI originally began on two distinct paths, it seems clear from this special issue, the meeting in Sintra, and previous publications elsewhere [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68]</ref>] that there is now a critical mass of researchers engaged in dialogue about the similarities and distinctions between SDT and MI.</s><s xml:id="_7gaTypm">However, it is important that this endeavor not stagnate with discussion and debate.</s><s xml:id="_KRFzzcX">Indeed, the next steps in this process of bringing together this theory and these clinical techniques must be borne out empirically.</s><s xml:id="_T9AxmFN">SDT has not yet identified the critical components for supporting psychological needs and facilitating autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence in health behavior interventions.</s><s xml:id="_dRWUt8g">MI techniques and their assessments may be useful additions to current SDT interventions in informing this empirical avenue.</s></p><p xml:id="_SQQqxtA"><s xml:id="_Sm8e2gU">Some MI interventions have included SDT measures [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70]</ref>], and this is an important step toward empirically testing the similarities between the two approaches.</s><s xml:id="_Yeduz79">However, to date, results on whether MI interventions facilitate change in autonomous self-regulation, in particular, have been somewhat mixed, though some research has found that autonomous self-regulation mediates the association between MI intervention and treatment outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n5YeWK5">Additional research is needed to identify which principles of MI operate on need support and the process of internalization.</s><s xml:id="_tfAtpzb">Further, current measures from SDT may need to be refined to better capture all three dimensions of perceived need support and to more accurately assess fluctuations in autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence in the initial stages of behavior change as well as behavior maintenance.</s><s xml:id="_FQcNTMy">In addition, assessment techniques, advanced analytic methods (growth curve analysis and latent trajectory modeling) and the use of internet technology and mobile devices in ecological momentary sampling may also improve researchers' ability to detect changes in motivation in response to provision of specific components of need support.</s></p><p xml:id="_Svd75SR"><s xml:id="_ZtFCSRC">Finally, future research in which MI and SDT-based interventions are directly compared are needed to (1) more clearly elucidate the extent to which SDT can explain how and why MI interventions effect behavior, (2) identify aspects of SDT-based interventions that are similar to and distinct from MI (e.g., MI coding of SDT interventions and vice versa), (3) determine if MI interventions facilitate change in both autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence and support the need for relatedness, and (4) better clarify how both approaches can be used in concert to yield the most positive results.</s><s xml:id="_YDnzHEd">These empirical endeavors require not only a bridging of ideas but, perhaps more importantly, the convergence of a multi-conceptual team with representation from both SDT and MI camps to refine MI techniques, to improve SDT applications to health behavior, and to further expand our understanding of these approaches and how they serve to facilitate the initiation and maintenance of health behavior change.</s></p><p xml:id="_v2eNMzD"><s xml:id="_VgEDEAZ">Miller and Rose <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> recently published a statement on a theory for MI.</s><s xml:id="_Hz8D3nf">Although SDT was not mentioned directly in that publication, SDT researchers may facilitate linking SDT to MI through empirical study of how eliciting change talk is experienced by clients (i.e., as relatively more or less need-supportive) and the extent to which change talk reflects a shift in patients' perceived locus of causality and/or change in autonomous self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_HT9g6Dd">From the SDT perspective, change talk is a reflection of the client or patient shifting from a voice of external locus of causality to internal -literally reflecting "real time" internalization.</s><s xml:id="_7fqEUav">However, it is not clear that this is precisely how MI views change talk.</s><s xml:id="_xfjaK3G">Miller and Rose <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and others have placed strong emphasis on practitioners actively promoting and eliciting change talk.</s><s xml:id="_cxzZcGE">This may be somewhat inconsistent with SDT.</s><s xml:id="_65XFy4e">The aggressive push toward change talk may reflect an underlying assumption that the person is better off changing (when in fact this may not be their goal).</s><s xml:id="_V7hHM2T">Pushing change talk may be experienced as coercive and judgmental, and thus is not need-supportive.</s><s xml:id="_uYHar72">Self-determination theorists will also need to carefully consider whether MI's statement of theory is consistent with SDT.</s><s xml:id="_5xKcDxU">Particularly important for SDT theorists and researchers will be the resolution of issues such as MI's conceptualization of intrinsic motivation, the role of directiveness, and the issue of development of discrepancy.</s><s xml:id="_hNnRwQm">Though the latter is not explicitly listed in current conceptualizations of MI's guiding principles, the extent to which development of discrepancy is key to the execution of MI interventions may be important particularly with respect to whether this aspect of MI supports or thwarts need satisfaction.</s></p></div>
