pressure to be present to catch the care team when they are in the patient's room.</s><s xml:id="_9Pdpm4x">More engaged, better-informed caregivers may also facilitate better care postdischarge.</s><s xml:id="_ZBrX8Wf">Such partnerships between patients, caregivers, and their providers demonstrate a means through which a patient could be more involved in their health care, with patients

that physicians are also impacted by patient portals and look forward to including their perspectives in future work.</s><s xml:id="_6RSRDGT">Finally, responses were gathered at different points in
