these data may also misrepresent and misinform summative judgements regarding the performance of the teacher.</s><s xml:id="_saxvM35">Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the direction of that bias.</s><s xml:id="_c5Tfy5p">Although (in this hypothetical case) students responding to online surveys may be more positively disposed towards online teaching approaches, this does not mean that they will also be more positively disposed towards the teacher's teaching.</s></p><p xml:id="_PDMUZw2"><s xml:id="_GYpnNjk">The hypothetical scenario above serves to illustrate another problem too: imagine an online survey of all students yields a 30% response and an on-paper survey of the same students yields a 60% response.</s><s xml:id="_WYcaRp3">The temptation would be to regard the results of the latter as more valid and more worthy of consideration.</s><s xml:id="_FVQssCx">However, as already described above, it may be that the online survey attracted responses from those who predominantly make use of online teaching and learning resources, while the respondents to the paper survey may contain few of these people.</s><s xml:id="_9aD7fMT">Effectively the two surveys have sampled two different sub-groups of students with systematically different views which may (or may not) be reflected in the nature of their answers to survey questions (depending on the questions).</s><s xml:id="_seKbmXf">Neither survey may be a valid reflection of the whole group but each one may be a valid reflection of each sub-group.</s></p><p xml:id="_A5YX5AN"><s xml:id="_55RahhE">In practice, it is likely that only one of these two surveys would be conducted-the academic will not have both sets of data for comparison.</s><s xml:id="_4PMgJSS">The academic's responses to improve his/her teaching and/or his/her course might therefore be erroneous.</s><s xml:id="_9GGYfgy">Similarly, the data for either survey may be misleading if used for summative purposes.</s><s xml:id="_wkqtE6s">This is not a problem resulting from low response rate per se but, rather, a problem associated with the potential for systematic sample bias in respect of the respondents to any one survey type-or, indeed, any survey.</s></p><p xml:id="_EjKyJqY"><s xml:id="_qkewY7N">This last point takes us into territory that is beyond the scope of this paper.</s><s xml:id="_vPtAcnZ">Suffice it to say that the design of a survey, not only the mode of administration, may also affect who responds to it and what they say.</s><s xml:id="_Q2kJHgd">Thus, when interpreting survey results, it is important to think about what was asked, how it was asked and how these variables may have resulted in bias in respect of who responded, what they said and how these responses may have differed if the survey itself, the mode of administration and the resultant pool of respondents had been different.</s><s xml:id="_4Gpaypq">The implication is that data derived from surveys are likely to be somewhat more easily and validly used if the surveys themselves are appropriately designed and used for particular targeted purposes.</s><s xml:id="_snqxFKJ">Given that doing this is difficult, even in the best of worlds, this observation underscores the need to evaluate courses and teachers using multiple methods, and to carefully consider the differences between the pictures that emerge from each in order to triangulate a more accurate position.</s></p><p xml:id="_y52AESF"><s xml:id="_3Pn7QdF">It follows from all this discussion that, although Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> gives us a guide for response rates which could (in a theoretically ideal world) be considered adequate, the reality is that even if the response rates suggested are achieved, great care is needed to be sure that results for a survey are representative of the whole group of students enrolled.</s><s xml:id="_AStd3hs">Although this is known, current practice frequently ignores this need for caution.</s><s xml:id="_bGKyDKa">Generic course and teaching surveys are often used to evaluate situations they were not designed for, and response rates which are below those advocated by Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> are generally accepted.</s><s xml:id="_y23PxSf">Despite this a high weight is simultaneously placed on student evaluation results.</s></p></div>
