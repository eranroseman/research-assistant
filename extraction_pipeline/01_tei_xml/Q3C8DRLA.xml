<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_JRQBUra">Real-world engagement</head><p xml:id="_PCApRcM"><s xml:id="_rN63pGt">Arguably, engagement rates from RCTs investigating DMHIs are inflated compared to real-world deployments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JCefnkR">Indeed, one study found that levels of engagement with self-guided DMHIs were four times higher in RCTs compared to real-world usage of the same DMHI <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QJcdpUb">Conceivably, multiple factors including monetary incentives, differences between research participants and real-world users such as higher levels of motivation as a result of screening or consenting procedures, greater perceived accountability via calls and/or visits with study staff, and rigid inclusion/exclusion criteria, may contribute to higher levels of engagement in RCTs relative to real-world settings.</s></p><p xml:id="_53QcJ3w"><s xml:id="_khmW8Sb">However, studies of real-world engagement with DMHIs similarly report substantial variability in engagement rates.</s><s xml:id="_qku6vDr">One review of 10 real-world studies of seven publicly available DMHIs found that rates of minimal usage ranged from 21% to 88%, moderate usage ranged from 7% to 42%, and sustained usage (completing all intervention modules or engaging longer than six weeks) or completing the intervention ranged from 0.5% to 28.6% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. 1 Other research suggests some DMHIs may have high numbers of monthly active users, whereas others have nearly none <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_vWyS4XT"><s xml:id="_zwayQEw">Furthermore, there may be subsets of real-world users that engage at particularly high levels.</s><s xml:id="_JPRHNa6">For example, a cross-sectional survey of 12,151 users of the Calm meditation app found that the average length of engagement with their DMHI was 11.49 months and 60% were using the app five or more times per week <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n6Xx6Vp">Although this was a convenience sample that is unlikely to be representative of the average user, particularly because users had to open at least two Calm emails and complete at least two sessions during the previous 30 days in order to qualify for the study, it highlights that there are subsets of real-world DMHI users who are very engaged, both in terms of frequency and duration of usage.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_yqz7DEt">Patterns of engagement</head><p xml:id="_BvCEFFj"><s xml:id="_JzdsF8N">DMHI studies, with some exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, suggest that engagement rates exhibit a non-linear pattern where they are the highest after signing up for the DMHI, decrease over time, and ultimately level off <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Q8vjKAh">For example, one study found the largest decreases in engagement within the first two to four weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, whereas another study of a DMHI for Body Dysmorphic Disorder found that approximately three quarters of users' engagement occurred during the first six weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ergVvey">Although these data could suggest that users are disengaging from the DMHI over time, the relationship between time and engagement may be more nuanced.</s></p><p xml:id="_5GG2ANr"><s xml:id="_QTG4YtH">One issue is that many studies report average levels of engagement at a sample level, which may be problematic given the high variability in engagement rates discussed above.</s><s xml:id="_CdMWp2d">More recently, research has started applying statistical approaches that permit exploring patterns of engagement among different clusters of users.</s><s xml:id="_zvdEj6a">In one such study, Chen et al. examined patterns of usage across the Intellicare platform, which houses 13 different DMHIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gDEhdqw">They identified four clusters of users.</s><s xml:id="_4uvhAnq">Two clusters reflected overall use, regardless of the DMHI utilized: a low usage group that had low levels of engagement across all DMHIs, and a high usage group that had comparatively higher levels of engagement overall.</s><s xml:id="_aUmnaU9">The other two clusters reflected a preference for a specific DMHI within the platform (i.e., Daily Feats, and Day to Day).</s><s xml:id="_JATn7Bq">Although the low usage cluster was the largest of the four groups, making up just over 45% of their sample, the two clusters exhibiting higher levels of engagement with a specific DMHI made up just over 47% of the sample when combined.</s></p><p xml:id="_EeFSg6m"><s xml:id="_qc4CME4">In another study, Agachi et al. used hidden Markov modeling to examine patterns of activity versus inactivity among DMHI users over a 78-week observational period <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_m5BqqKb">They found that, on average, 70% of participants were considered to be inactive, whereas 18% were considered to be engaging at the average level, and 12% had high levels of engagement.</s><s xml:id="_JXtzmwy">Importantly, they found that users classified as inactive or high engagers were relatively stable; users who were inactive in Week 1 had a 91% likelihood of remaining inactive in Week 2, whereas users who were high engagers in Week 1 had an 82% likelihood of remaining highly engaged in Week 2. Users classified as average engagers, however, had the highest risk of transitioning to a lower rate of activity-with a 64% likelihood of remaining moderately engaged from Week 1 to Week 2, but a 31% likelihood of dropping to inactive.</s><s xml:id="_3MYBzw2">This suggests that efforts to improve engagement among those who are inactive may be less effective, and that strategies should be adopted to help maintain (or increase) levels of engagement amongst those who are moderately engaged after starting a DMHI.</s></p><p xml:id="_xYe4RMg"><s xml:id="_67H6YvB">These strategies may be particularly important when users begin using a DMHI as there is some indirect evidence that DMHI users who overcome the initial risk of dropout may be likely to remain active over time.</s><s xml:id="_PV9S6dN">For example, one study of 93 mental health apps found that the median 15-day retention across apps was 3.9% and the median 30-day retention was 3.3%, suggesting minimal dropoff after this initial two-week period <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_knUqCW9">Similarly, Dahne et al. found that although there was a drop of nearly 20% in active users between the second and third week of their trial, the rate of active users remained flat between the third and sixth weeks (with smaller drops in active users occurring at the seventh and eighth weeks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zXpvxjG">Looking at more long-term engagement, a retrospective analysis of Vida Health's DMHI also found that among users who completed an assessment after a 12-week intensive intervention phase, 77% were still active users after 6 months, and 58% were still active after nine months <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_TavYqJu"><s xml:id="_Sm4RdTx">Other studies have employed similar statistical approaches to identify types of users using other characteristics as well as engagement patterns.</s><s xml:id="_dnaP6h3">Aziz et al. found that approximately 93% of their DMHI users fell into one of two clusters which corresponded with life satisfaction and varying patterns of regular use <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WuW9SE9">A larger cluster (68% of users) could be described as having a greater need, due to lower levels of life satisfaction, and engaged with the DMHI almost daily, whereas the second, smaller, cluster (25% of users) exhibited less consistent use but had comparatively greater life satisfaction.</s><s xml:id="_mekKfHy">In other words, users' engagement patterns may have been primarily driven by whether users perceived a need for a DMHI-and those with less need (e.g., those with higher life satisfaction) may not engage as frequently.</s></p><p xml:id="_3rdYmfV"><s xml:id="_Nq3PfcN">Taken together, these studies suggest that a more individualized approach to conceptualizing or studying engagement with DMHIs is important, as users do not engage with these interventions in the same way.</s><s xml:id="_7qWtxQt">More specifically, Agachi et al. 's research suggests that a large proportion of users may be inactive almost right away, and that these users may be particularly difficult to reengage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qmKku4k">More research should focus on what might predict these clusters of activity; however, Aziz et al. <ref type="bibr">'</ref>s study suggests that one potential predictor may be perceived need <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EDZZcxb">Interestingly, if perceived need is an important driver of initial engagement with a DMHI, this may also help to explain why engagement becomes less frequent over the first six weeks: if the DMHI is effective, the user likely experiences improvements in these first six weeks, thereby reducing the perceived need and the motivation to continue engaging at the same level.</s><s xml:id="_R9rFfwg">Chen et al. 's study further suggests that some users may prefer a variety of content, as evidenced by the cluster of users who engaged at a high level across the suite of Intellicare apps, whereas others may show a preference for a specific type of content or intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q3JMRaY">Research exploring the different predictors of these types of engagement patterns could also prove beneficial to DMHI developers, who may be able to use this information to personalize their interventions by adjusting their content to suit the user's preference.</s><s xml:id="_8BdZ5N8">And, as we discuss in more detail later, understanding the extent to which different patterns of engagement can be effective-and whether different people benefit from specific patterns-is an important next step in this line of research.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_NGhTMWX">Summary</head><p xml:id="_T5yEGWw"><s xml:id="_FeqcMEP">Despite broad criticism that engagement and retention rates are particularly bad for DMHIs, the research suggests there is substantial variability in these rates.</s><s xml:id="_MQRbzbB">This research also suggests that one cohort of users-perhaps the largest cohort-sign up for a DMHI but show little to no engagement.</s><s xml:id="_GDtdsAk">This engagement pattern tends to be stable, making this cohort particularly difficult to engage.</s><s xml:id="_PkHh7eV">Given how easily most DMHIs can be accessed and downloaded, this pattern may suggest that many people download a DMHI without any commitment or intention to begin using it.</s><s xml:id="_dCeqVa8">However, there are other cohorts of users who exhibit high levels of engagement, and this pattern of engagement is also relatively stable over time.</s><s xml:id="_ffQpT9W">Consequently, identifying the factors that predict these high levels of engagement may be particularly important to increasing the size of this particular cohort, thereby increasing the number of users who can benefit from DMHIs.</s></p></div>

DMHIs may be indicative of different reasons for discontinued usage.</s><s xml:id="_mmh9P49">For instance, in their study, Dahne et al. found a notable drop in active users between Week 2 and 3 of their 8-week trial, followed by a smaller, but notable drop again between Weeks 7 and 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6MJ3z5w">Another study conducted by Pham et al. found

who discontinue usage shortly after signing up likely have different reasons for disengaging compared to users who disengage after several weeks of use.</s><s xml:id="_sCVv2EX">Indeed, as we discussed earlier, users who experience improvements in mental health outcomes may subsequently have less need for the DMHI, resulting in less frequent engagement over time.</s></p><p xml:id="_jjBMRm4"><s

others have been designed to be available as needed, and on a long-term basis.</s><s xml:id="_cESpqYA">Sustained engagement may not be the goal with the latter; rather episodic engagement may be expected.</s><s xml:id="_pDJ4JEU">If users begin engaging with a DMHI due to a perceived need and then discontinue (or reduce) use of that DMHI after experiencing some meaningful improvement, they may re-engage with the DMHI later if the perceived need returns.</s><s xml:id="_ZrB9Ypf">This concept is similar to 'booster sessions' utilized in the context of CBT wherein individuals who have completed a course of treatment return at a later date for additional support, if necessary <ref type="bibr">[126]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x4W58TC">To date, research on patterns of engagement have not explored this kind of episodic engagement and likely do not follow users long enough to observe this type of pattern.</s></p><p xml:id="_VXbc7ar"><s xml:id="_dGH4Jnh">Similarly, Weingarden et al. 's research showing that participants exhibited comparable levels of improvement regardless of whether they had more frequent, but briefer, periods of engagement versus less frequent, but longer, periods of engagement with a DMHI <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> suggests that optimal engagement does not reflect a one size fits all concept.</s><s xml:id="_Aukctg4">Moving beyond the assumption that sustained engagement is always the goal, to explore other potentially beneficial patterns of engagement-particularly among DMHI responders-is critical to better understanding how to promote optimal engagement and improve outcomes.</s></p></div>

Adopt clearly defined, common definitions of 'engagement' and 'adherence' .</s><s xml:id="_K3DKaQD">One of the primary limitations of research on adoption of and engagement with DMHIs is the lack of consistent findings, making it difficult to identify predictors of adoption or engagement.</s><s xml:id="_sczZwCf">This is largely driven by the inconsistent definitions of engagement and adherence across studies-some of which even confound engagement with adoption.</s><s xml:id="_WbYWWSM">There should be careful consideration of how engagement and adherence are operationally defined, with a particular emphasis on multidimensional definitions of engagement.</s><s xml:id="_2phwTuB">Adopting a common definition of these constructs would likely help reduce heterogeneity in research findings and ultimately help to clarify what factors may predict engagement and retention.</s><s xml:id="_nKWMeJ6">2. Explore different patterns of engagement rather than assume a 'one size fits all' approach.</s><s xml:id="_bxdS8Mg">Emerging research exploring different patterns of DMHI usage, or clusters of DMHI users, has shed light on how people may use DMHIs differently.</s><s xml:id="_Z4brHGt">It is unlikely that one way of engaging with a DMHI will be effective for all users; therefore, identifying effective patterns of engagement, and whether some people will benefit from a specific pattern, will allow for more individualized instructions for use and potentially increase the proportion of users benefiting from the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_qW5hxTs">Moreover, some patterns may be indicative of users who are at risk of drop out and could be used to determine effective means of re-engaging those users as well.</s><s xml:id="_4kX4cZc">3. Define 'success' as the degree of improvement, rather than DMHI engagement.</s><s xml:id="_mQfEnhF">Most research defines adherence, or the extent to which a user engages with a DMHI as intended, in terms of the amount of DMHI content accessed or the number of weeks a DMHI user is active, rather than by how much they improved.</s><s xml:id="_tFMdncb">However, 'dosage' for most of these interventions is arbitrary, not based on data that supports its effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_GhBvdZY">Consequently, treating intervention responsiveness as the outcome, rather than intervention adherence is an important avenue to identifying patterns of optimal engagement and minimally effective doses.</s><s xml:id="_WzQ45WW">Additionally, as described in (2) above, studying the different patterns of engagement that may result in improvement among different types of users is particularly important to understand optimal dosage for a particular user and help to optimize intervention responsiveness.</s></p><p xml:id="_U94saGF"><s xml:id="_8mqssSX">In summary, the shortcomings of engagement and retention with DMHIs may not be unique to digital interventions, but there is nevertheless substantial room for improvement.</s><s xml:id="_ycjV4yE">Despite the challenges we have outlined in this review, we believe these create numerous opportunities for DMHI researchers and developers, and we remain optimistic that embracing a more nuanced view of DMHI engagement will ultimately help to improve access and response to DMHIs.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_S6YTzmz"><s xml:id="_N4JRNE6">Summary of evidence for barriers and facilitators to engagement with digital mental health interventions</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>User Characteristics</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Gender</cell><cell>Higher adoption rates have been observed among women, but evidence is mixed for actual engage-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>ment with DMHIs.
