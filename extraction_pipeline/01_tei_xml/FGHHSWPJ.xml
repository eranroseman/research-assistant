practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Cq4uNju">Participants from all three groups described this issue repeatedly using the codes 'hierarchy' and 'patriarchy', with

advocate for women and how to navigate this hierarchy of risk management in a way that maintains shared decision-making as a team.</s><s xml:id="_Rd2NAxe">Further, interviews with all participant groups indicated that due to limited access and awareness of MCC models, most women continued to be restricted to care within obstetrics-led maternity units, which provide hospital-based fragmented midwifery care.</s><s xml:id="_UZ4B5HC">This further embeds task-based fragmented hospital care, dubbed the 'industrial model of childbirth', as the prevailing maternity care option available to women <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fzhUF5x">Other evidence supports the findings of this study, which revealed that midwives' frustration with organizational attitudes affects their work and hampers their ability to provide quality woman-centered care <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Pj6zhgt">These factors are shown to lead to fatigue and a lack of confidence within the midwifery workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EY36nJG">Another major concern raised by midwifery participants was a need to 'address misinformation about [the] MCC lifestyle'.</s><s xml:id="_CW4Za5E">This category indicated that midwives' confidence in transitioning to a MCC model was hampered by concerns about managing on call commitments, as compared with working rostered shift work.</s><s xml:id="_a8yvdvW">However, other participants observed that MCC was quite flexible, as work could be negotiated around both the woman's and the midwife's needs.</s><s xml:id="_juTYmBd">Perceptions of excessive workloads, long hours on call, professional isolation and difficulty achieving work-life balance have hindered the widespread translation of midwifery caseload models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2Tmytvd">However,

target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gAwmGtM">This is important because the findings from this study claimed that midwives were concerned that having children would prevent them from working in MCC models.</s><s xml:id="_J7aFpTP">Australian public hospital maternity services should feel confident that a reorientation of midwifery care aligned with MCC evidence is likely to be a sustainable way forward and improve workforce wellbeing.</s></p><p xml:id="_bK5nrmN"><s xml:id="_YFC392f">Similar to phase one participants, midwives described witnessing a shift in midwifery culture, with the

research about MCC and were motivated to translate this evidence into practice.</s><s xml:id="_esx42nk">Students were also valued because they experienced providing continuity of care from within 'mini-midwifery practice' opportunities during their university studies.</s><s xml:id="_MtvhGYd">However, some participants were concerned that there was a lack of support for new graduates to find employment in MCC models, which contributes to their attrition rates from the workforce.</s><s xml:id="_FbeS5Qe">The literature confirms that these findings demonstrate a high number of early-career midwives are leaving the profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZmZ6Vk2">New graduates and student midwives should be acknowledged

available.</s><s xml:id="_696q8MK">Furthermore, Ebert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> found that students who worked in a fragmented hospital setting with unknown supervisors were at an increased risk of stress and anxiety, which in turn reduced the students' confidence and skill competence.</s><s xml:id="_gTX8Nyj">Research has questioned whether students can gain a realistic experience of MCC when they follow women through a fragmented system <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ASGEFVq">Evidence demonstrates that students need to be immersed in a MCC model for their practicum experience, so that they can observe the flexibility of midwives arranging workloads around family or other commitments, negotiating time off and navigating 'on call' work in a sustainable way 66 .</s><s xml:id="_GcdWUVC">Students stated that these experiences reaffirmed their desire to work within MCC models, and that it provided insight into how they could transition into that model upon graduation 66 .</s><s xml:id="_rKsy9ng">As supported in other research, participants identified the

frequently said women in their communities would not know what MCC was, or that it was an option of maternity care.</s><s xml:id="_cgfEqdv">McKellar et al. identified that a significant barrier to increasing access to MCC models was a lack of public understanding regarding the role of the midwife <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9gXYDzM">It was clear a lack of

successfully pursued the implementation of an MCC model in their health services.</s><s xml:id="_z8nquEm">The tipping point for the women in this study was the threatened closure of maternity services within their local health services, a catalyst also noted in earlier literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NvSTTKY">This 'crisis' was described as a 'golden opportunity' that resulted in a 'cascade' of actions and steps that women made to ensure that key stakeholders were engaged.</s><s xml:id="_vHkuxyW">These actions were consistent across health service areas, and included building community support groups, joining meetings with local politicians and local media resources (newspapers/news reporters), and writing letters to hospital executives.</s><s

acknowledged that during the implementation of a MCC model, consumer engagement with health services became a crucial step towards changing maternity services.</s><s xml:id="_CUBHdVb">Current implementation research suggests that as consumers become more knowledgeable and involved in their health care, more participative models of care will be expected; this challenges current health care organizations to shift away from provider-driven systems by recognizing the importance of woman-centered care <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tYKbu7W">To assist with this
