xml:id="_KcSYCRN">While the European authorities and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) share the broad principles of regulating both traditional health products and software, there are substantial differences in the organisational structure of medical product and software registration.</s><s xml:id="_j8VhJQu">The EMA and the FDA are each responsible for pharmaceutical regulation, but only the FDA regulates both pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</s><s xml:id="_3ky5Aek">In the EU, no single agency but the European Commission is responsible for regulation of medical devices; each individual country retains primary responsibility for organising and delivering health services and medical care.</s><s xml:id="_xq72SdU">As a result, EU member states maintain their own national pharmaceutical regulatory • Consists of a CGM system, insulin infusion pump, and a computer-controlled algorithm (for do-it-yourself AID systems a smartphone app) to allow communication between the

according to EU policies (e.g. the new Medical Device Regulation [MDR]) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rgdfytx">Instead, these responsibilities are retained by individual member states, which delegate to accredited notified bodies responsibilities for implementing these regulations.</s><s xml:id="_hvzYMyH">These entities are accredited by the EU to assess whether a product meets the standards set by the EU Medical Devices Directive (MDD), and their decision is valid across all member states.</s><s xml:id="_wgYTYGm">Assessments are based on evidence of safety and performance (in contrast, the FDA may also require clinical effectiveness data, especially for 'high risk devices' (see classification of medical devices in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32]</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fHf9MSA">If these standards are met, then a manufacturer is authorised to market the product throughout the EU and label it with the Conformité Européenne (CE) mark <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_HUNswVu"><s xml:id="_vxkCTuA">In general, the process of obtaining a CE mark in the EU in the past has been a lower hurdle than obtaining device approval or clearance by the FDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2UZRCUC">This difference between the USA and EU is likely to narrow with the implementation of the European Union's MDR, which repeals the existing directives on medical devices.</s><s xml:id="_jz6Uyzy">The regulation was published on 5 May 2017 and allows a transition time of 3 years before coming into force on 25 May 2020.</s><s xml:id="_Hx9YduT">Currently approved medical devices will have up to 26 May 2020 to meet the new MDR requirements.</s><s xml:id="_cZmDd4d">Among the provisions in this set of regulations are the strengthening of post-market surveillance, establishment of a comprehensive EU database on medical devices, stricter control for high-risk devices before launch in the marketplace, and a new risk classification system for in vitro diagnostic medical devices in line with international guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_7S864a8"><s xml:id="_XXMBguQ">The guidelines in individual countries align with those issued by the European Commission.</s><s xml:id="_jcncdQX">For example, Sweden's Läkemedelsverket Medical Products Agency classifies medical software as a medical device if its stated purpose complies with the definition in Article 1 of Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices ('used specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes'), has a demonstrated benefit over risk, and is CE-marked <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rkRSJ8S">In Germany, medical apps are classified as medical devices if they follow EU guidelines and the German Medical Devices Act and are CEmarked <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_y6eWUtM">The situation in the UK was previously similar but is currently in flux because of continuing uncertainties about the UK's relationship with the EU.</s></p><p xml:id="_Z2UwpXN"><s xml:id="_Z3sPyB9">More recently, the European Commission has made considerable efforts to introduce and implement the MDR as a new regulatory framework, which will provide clarity on what is (and what is not) a medical device software <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NppYx7C"><s xml:id="_6wXZxjc">FDA With a view to prioritising its resources in the face of an explosive growth of digital health apps, the FDA has attempted to draw a line between those that do and do not require regulation.</s><s xml:id="_agdPf9Z">In 2015, it released a guidance document (updated in 2019) for mobile medical applications for apps that meet the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HM4udBu">This definition covers apps intended to be used as accessories to regulated medical devices and those that are stand-alone software.</s><s xml:id="_Tceccnh">However, the guidance expressed its intention to exercise 'enforcement discretion' over those judged to pose a lower risk to users (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_FCAqZfd">apps that provide people with diabetes encouragement to meet their health goals or provide them with tools to track their health information).</s><s xml:id="_FD8ZHPN">Thus, using this 'riskbased' approach, mobile apps
