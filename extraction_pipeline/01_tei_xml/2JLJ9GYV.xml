<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_nDjEVDa">What Is Template Analysis?</head><p xml:id="_w7PKy5h"><s xml:id="_tD6TdUV">Template Analysis is a form of thematic analysis which emphasises the use of hierarchical coding but balances a relatively high degree of structure in the process of analysing textual data with the flexibility to adapt it to the needs of a particular study.</s><s xml:id="_kg58AbG">Central to the technique is the development of a coding template, usually on the basis of a subset of data, which is then applied to further data, revised and refined.</s><s xml:id="_jTWWKXf">The approach is flexible regarding the style and the format of the template that is produced.</s><s xml:id="_2zsbTjm">Unlike some other thematic approaches to data coding, it does not suggest in advance a set sequence of coding levels.</s><s xml:id="_JfFRywQ">Rather, it encourages the analyst to develop themes more extensively where the richest data (in relation to the research question) are found.</s><s xml:id="_eAtV6Ja">Equally, Template Analysis does not insist on an explicit distinction between descriptive and interpretive themes, nor on a particular position for each type of theme in the coding structure.</s><s xml:id="_kYqtNyn">The data involved in Template Analysis studies are usually interview transcripts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Goldschmidt et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lockett et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Slade, Haywood &amp; King 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thompson et al. 2010)</ref> but may be any kind of textual data, including focus groups (e.g., Kirkby-Geddes, <ref type="bibr">King &amp; Bravington 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brooks 2014)</ref>, diary entries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Waddington &amp; Fletcher 2005)</ref>, and open-ended question responses on a written questionnaire (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dornan, Carroll &amp; Parboosingh 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kent 2000)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aZt3E6w">The main procedural steps in carrying out Template Analysis are outlined below (these are described in more detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">King 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_qUwGuf5"><s xml:id="_5GtkU3V">1. Become familiar with the accounts to be analyzed.</s><s xml:id="_tcuPuxt">In a relatively small study, for example, ten or fewer hour-long interviews, it would be sensible to read through the data set in full at least once.</s><s xml:id="_nVkcGNU">In a larger study, the researcher may select a subset of the accounts (e.g., transcripts, diary entries, daily field notes) to start.</s><s xml:id="_tt6N4Yn">2. Carry out preliminary coding of the data.</s><s xml:id="_P8vCF29">This is essentially the same process as used in most thematic approaches, where the researcher starts by highlighting anything in the text that might contribute toward his or her understanding.</s><s xml:id="_scJ4w2e">However, in Template Analysis, it is permissible (though not obligatory) to start with some a priori themes, identified in advance as likely to be helpful and relevant to the analysis.</s><s xml:id="_VytAJwK">These are always tentative, and may be redefined or removed if they do not prove to be useful for the analysis at hand.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ry53jdT"><s xml:id="_7JZfGvs">3. Organize the emerging themes into meaningful clusters, and begin to define how they relate to each other within and between these groupings.</s><s xml:id="_R7Nr83s">This will include hierarchical relationships, with narrower themes nested within broader ones.</s><s xml:id="_8tr4HCE">It may also include lateral relationships across clusters.</s><s xml:id="_pPRGsmX">Themes which permeate several distinct clusters are sometimes referred to as "integrative themes."</s><s xml:id="_sFDCrRH">For example, in a study of the experience of diabetic renal disease, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">King et al. (2002)</ref> identified "stoicism" and "uncertainty" as integrative themes because these aspects of experience tended to infuse much of the discussion whatever the foreground issue.</s><s xml:id="_bq5BWUs">4. Define an initial coding template.</s><s xml:id="_4SZrupt">It is normal in Template Analysis to develop an initial version of the coding template on the basis of a subset of the data rather than carrying out preliminary coding and clustering on all accounts before defining the thematic structure.</s></p><p xml:id="_n2kwAjR"><s xml:id="_MJnpGDk">For example, in a study consisting of 20 face-to-face interviews, the researcher might carry out the steps described above on five of the interviews, and at that point draw together the initial template.</s><s xml:id="_8zgwcyz">The exact point at which it is appropriate to construct the initial template will vary from study to study and cannot be prescribed in advance-the researcher needs to be convinced that the subset selected captures a good cross-section of the issues and experiences covered in the data as a whole.</s><s xml:id="_cccAqZF">This is usually facilitated by selecting initial accounts to analyse that are as varied as possible.</s><s xml:id="_6qmnrEV">5. Apply the initial template to further data and modify as necessary.</s><s xml:id="_XKDUxPH">The researcher examines fresh data and where material of potential relevance to the study is identified, he or she considers whether any of the themes defined on the initial template can be used to represent it.</s><s xml:id="_JegThEN">Where existing themes do not readily "fit" the new data, modification of the template may be necessary.</s><s xml:id="_T4cuQAP">New themes may be inserted and existing themes redefined or even deleted if they seem redundant.</s><s xml:id="_JFpMmBc">Rather than reorganising the template after every new account examined, it is common to work through several accounts noting possible revisions and then construct a new version of the template.</s><s xml:id="_QacWy4r">Thus in our hypothetical example at the previous stage, the researcher might take the initial template constructed from analysis of the first five interviews and apply it to another three transcripts, after which he or she would produce a revised version.</s><s xml:id="_P55EFNd">This iterative process of trying out successive versions of the template, modifying and trying again can continue for as long as seems necessary to allow a rich and comprehensive representation of the researcher's interpretation of the data.</s><s xml:id="_6PVcdsX">Of course, very often practical constraints of time and resource may limit the number of iterations possible, but the analysis should not leave any data of clear relevance to the study's research question uncoded.</s><s xml:id="_dXb4RjZ">6. Finalize the template and apply it to the full data set.</s><s xml:id="_W3uz7qU">In some respects it should be said that there is never a "final" version of the template, in that continued engagement with the data can always suggest further refinements to coding.</s><s xml:id="_H4cFYca">On a pragmatic basis, though, the researcher needs to decide when the template meets his or her needs for the project at hand, and considering the resources available.</s><s xml:id="_kdXYmxx">A good rule of thumb is that development of a template cannot be seen as sufficient if there remain substantial sections of data clearly relevant to the research question(s) that cannot been coded to it.</s><s xml:id="_hpTJwYE">It is always possible to revisit the template if further analysis is required; for example, a template that may work well to help the interpretation of data for an evaluation report might require considerable refinement to produce an analysis that informs an academic journal article (see Kirkby-Geddes, King &amp; Bravington 2013 for an example).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_xDdJXwB">Epistemological Position of Template Analysis</head><p xml:id="_EuV4CPt"><s xml:id="_veqkJdY">The epistemological position of thematic analysis can be problematic.</s><s xml:id="_VcHMtat">It is not uncommon to see research articles at the review stage (and sometime in print) that claim to have used a specific methodology such as IPA or Grounded Theory, but where even a cursory examination shows that the basic theoretical underpinnings of such approaches have not been adhered to.</s><s xml:id="_8FXb58A">Instead, the researchers have taken the thematic analysis procedures associated with a methodology and used them in a way that is not in keeping with the methodology as a whole.</s><s xml:id="_y7vcFyc">An example would be studies "using" IPA, where theoretical ideas from mainstream psychology (or elsewhere) have been used quite prominently in shaping the analysis.</s><s xml:id="_KWm5gdC">While the use of existing theory in, for example, the design of an IPA study need not conflict with the basic tenets of the approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Brooks, King &amp; Wearden 2013)</ref>, IPA is principally focused on individual's experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Smith, Flowers &amp; Larkin 2009)</ref> and codes are generated from the data using a "bottom up" approach.</s></p><p xml:id="_DxP4gpN"><s xml:id="_AMUGBdF">Approaching analysis with the intention of imposing existing theory or concepts on the data would thus be out of keeping with an IPA approach.</s><s xml:id="_RkuBzbC">Using methods such as IPA or grounded theory in a manner not in keeping with the approach often reflects a confusion between methodology and data analytical method, but may also be due to discomfort with a "mere" thematic analysis, devoid of inherent philosophical position.</s><s xml:id="_Jcfnqcb">We would concur with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Braun and Clarke's (2006)</ref> position that thematic analysis methods can be applied across a range of theoretical and epistemological approaches: what is important is that researchers using thematic analysis methods are explicit and upfront about their particular epistemological assumptions.</s></p><p xml:id="_VMPRYqW"><s xml:id="_yFXz5j3">Similarly, Template Analysis is not inextricably bound to any one epistemology; rather, it can be used in qualitative psychology research from a range of epistemological positions.</s><s xml:id="_95fDhR2">The flexibility of the technique allows it to be adapted to the needs of a particular study and that study's philosophical underpinning.</s><s xml:id="_dnJsszV">Template Analysis can thus be used in research taking a similar realist position to mainstream quantitative psychology, concerned with "discovering" underlying causes of human action and particular human phenomena.</s><s xml:id="_kU6rnYY">When used in this way, one could expect to see the use of strong, well-defined a priori themes in analysis, and concerns with reliability and validity prioritised and addressed.</s><s xml:id="_cVp4Vpy">In contrast, Template Analysis can also be used within what <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Madill, Jordan and Shirley (2000)</ref> have termed a "contextual constructivist" position (p.</s><s xml:id="_rCB7qYR">9), a stance which assumes that there are always multiple interpretations to be made of any phenomenon, and that these depend upon the position of the researcher and the specific social context of the research.</s><s xml:id="_9xcVJPe">A researcher using Template Analysis from this position would be likely to take a bottom-up approach to template development, using a priori themes far more tentatively, if at all, in the development of their template.</s><s xml:id="_b5p4Ed3">Additionally, and somewhere between these two approaches, Template Analysis can also be used in research adopting a "subtle realist" approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hammersley 1992)</ref>, a position which acknowledges that a researcher's perspective is inevitably influenced by his or her inability to truly stand outside one's own position in the social world, but nonetheless retains a belief in phenomena that are independent of the researcher and knowable through the research process.</s><s xml:id="_ajGqHVh">Such an approach can thus make claims as to the validity of a representation arising from research while recognizing that other perspectives on the phenomenon are possible.</s><s xml:id="_xZfTeVk">The applicability of Template Analysis taking a social constructionist approach, with its radical relativist epistemology, is more questionable.</s><s xml:id="_Vn4SvM3">Certainly, it is not suited to those social constructionist methodologies that are concerned with the fine detail of how language constructs social reality in interaction, such as discursive psychology and conversation analysis.</s><s xml:id="_yEPcWRu">However, some social constructionist work does seek to look at text in a broader manner and may use thematic types of analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Taylor &amp; Ussher 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budds, Locke &amp; Burr 2013)</ref>; there is no reason why Template Analysis should not be considered for this kind of analysis, though it would be crucial to be clear that themes were defined in terms of aspects of discourse rather than representations of personal experience.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_p7N2mf2">How Template Analysis Relates to Other Forms of Thematic Analysis</head><p xml:id="_33Mh6TV"><s xml:id="_hQ9N5HE">We are sometimes asked how Template Analysis differs from, or is similar to, "thematic analysis."</s><s xml:id="_vJkJzyh">This is not really a meaningful question because thematic analysis is not a particular approach in and of itself; rather, it is a broad category of approaches to qualitative analysis that seek to define themes within the data and organise those themes into some type of structure to aid interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_NTHqVNx">A more sensible question is therefore how Template Analysis relates to other forms of thematic analysis.</s><s xml:id="_CprQBg4">One main distinction is between those thematic approaches that are incorporated within a specific methodology and its philosophical assumptions, such as Grounded Theory or IPA, and those that do not have such a commitment.</s><s xml:id="_UEeNRA2">Template Analysis clearly falls into the latter category, alongside such techniques as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Braun and Clarke's (2006)</ref> version of thematic analysis, Framework Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ritchie &amp; Spencer 1994)</ref>, and many others.</s><s xml:id="_UG9M4MT">We will summarize here some of the key similarities and differences between Template Analysis and these two approaches in particular.</s></p><p xml:id="_m9yshCJ"><s xml:id="_ecb2PmJ">Template Analysis shares with Braun and Clark's approach flexibility and a focus on developing a hierarchical coding structure.</s><s xml:id="_wmQAxNR">They differ in three main ways.</s><s xml:id="_Qm9Q3nV">Firstly, in Braun and Clark development of themes and creation of a coding structure take place after initial coding of all the data.</s><s xml:id="_fbP9R63">In Template Analysis it is normal to produce an initial version of the template on the basis of a sub-set of the data.</s><s xml:id="_H7kXc5b">Secondly, in Braun and Clark's methods, defining themes is a late phase of the process.</s><s xml:id="_jn8JgbP">In Template Analysis the researchers often produce theme definitions at the initial template stage, to guide further coding and template development.</s><s xml:id="_43dcsV6">Thirdly, while Braun and Clark do not specify limits to the number of levels of coding, studies using their approach typically have only one or two levels of sub-themes.</s><s xml:id="_Grej5hH">Template Analysis commonly uses four or more levels to capture the richest and most detailed aspects of the data.</s></p><p xml:id="_5YwK7C6"><s xml:id="_Qqweb7k">Template Analysis has much in common with Framework Analysis; they can be seen as having evolved in parallel to address many of the same needs.</s><s xml:id="_3wFXyng">Both are examples of what <ref type="bibr">Crabtree and Miller (1992)</ref> refer to as "codebook" approaches, where a coding structure is developed from a mixture of a priori interests and initial engagement with the data and then applied to the full data set.</s><s xml:id="_svdmE7M">The most notable difference between them is that Template Analysis is more concerned with providing detailed guidance on the development of the coding structure than Framework Analysis, and less concerned with delineating techniques to aid in the interpretation of the data once fully coded.</s><s xml:id="_FC3BKXW">Studies using Framework Analysis do not typically show the depth of coding we see in Template Analysis, and while the need to modify the framework in the course of analysis is recognized (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gale et al. 2013)</ref>, in general the iterative (re-) development of the coding structure is a much more central aspect in Template Analysis.</s><s xml:id="_g2sHcTQ">Conversely, the emphasis in Framework Analysis on reducing the data through "charting" and identifying patterns by "mapping" is not an essential part of Template Analysis.</s><s xml:id="_yFse35C">These differences in emphasis to a large extent represent the different disciplinary backgrounds of the techniques and those involved in their evolution.</s><s xml:id="_kPzCApM">Framework Analysis was developed by health services researchers specifically for use in health policy research contexts.</s><s xml:id="_fbh5ySD">Template Analysis has strong roots in organisational research and is probably used in a wider variety of research settings than Framework Analysis.</s><s xml:id="_dPwRevv">It also tends to be employed rather more in experientially focused studies than is Framework Analysis, reflecting the input of experientially orientated psychologists in its development.</s></p><p xml:id="_ytEfqdE"><s xml:id="_bVypkMM">We feel that it is crucial that researchers are not precious about "their" ways of working with thematic analysis.</s><s xml:id="_QpYgF6j">For novice researchers, the detailed guidance provided by the likes of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Braun and Clarke (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Richie and Spencer (1994)</ref>, and the current authors can be very helpful in steering them through the rocks and shoals of qualitative analysis.</s><s xml:id="_keYJz8a">For those with more experience, it is entirely appropriate that they should draw selectively on such sources to define an approach that suits the needs of their own study.</s><s xml:id="_MDFt4an">This is one of the reasons we refer to Template Analysis as a "style" of thematic analysis;

be readily modified for the needs of a particular study.</s><s xml:id="_zv4rFSD">The method can be adapted to fit different research topics and the available resources of a particular study.</s><s xml:id="_XCSwbqY">Additionally, Template Analysis can be used from a range of different epistemological and methodological positions.</s><s xml:id="_XNCVtWG">Compared with some other methods of qualitative data analysis, Template Analysis may offer a more flexible technique with fewer specified procedures, allowing researchers to tailor the approach to the requirements of their own project.</s><s xml:id="_QYbRQzz">Template Analysis may offer a suitable alternative to qualitative psychology researchers who find that other methods of analysis come with prescriptions and procedures which are difficult to reconcile with features of their own study.</s></p><p xml:id="_RDqnVpx"><s xml:id="_Hqr3xUz">A particular feature of Template Analysis is its use of a priori themes, allowing researchers to define some themes in advance of the analysis process.</s><s xml:id="_VrDQRJu">The case studies presented in this article demonstrate how a priori themes can be usefully employed in different ways in diverse areas of research: ensuring focus on key areas potentially relevant to a study, building on existing theory, and developing ideas in linked pieces of research.</s></p><p xml:id="_9n3hR8f"><s xml:id="_BPNRMJa">Although not a requirement of the method, the use of a priori themes can be particularly advantageous in qualitative psychology research with particular applied concerns which need to be incorporated into the analysis.</s><s xml:id="_AFCN7MH">A priori themes are equally subject to redefinition or removal as any other theme should they prove ineffective at characterising the data.</s><s xml:id="_zZnfkMp">However, the selective and judicious use of a priori themes can allow researchers to capture important theoretical concepts or perspectives that have informed the design and aims of a study, or to address practical concerns such as evaluation criteria that a research project has been designed to address.</s></p><p xml:id="_ty58WsM"><s xml:id="_PctFV3Q">There are potential limitations to the approach which should be acknowledged.</s><s xml:id="_5879Vys">The focus in Template Analysis is typically on across case rather than within case analysis, the result of which is unavoidably some loss of holistic understanding in relation to individual accounts.</s><s xml:id="_JCAj6sH">This is a limitation of any thematic approach to qualitative data analysis, and a problem which manifests more evidently in studies employing larger sample sizes.</s><s xml:id="_kWAwfHD">While recognizing this as a principally inescapable limitation, our response to this in our own work has often been to combine cross-case analysis with the more idiographic-the sagacious use of individual case summaries to illustrate a line of reasoning can successfully achieve this.</s></p><p xml:id="_J3EAg4D"><s xml:id="_vFTyYRV">While the flexibility of Template Analysis is one of the method's acknowledged strengths, the tractable process of developing an initial template and of the template structure itself may feel less secure for relatively inexperienced qualitative researchers than the kind of clear progression described in other forms of thematic analysis which explicitly advocate moving from the descriptive to the interpretive and finally toward overarching themes.</s><s xml:id="_y3K3RAV">Without such explicit instruction to keep initial coding purely descriptive, there is a danger that researchers can rush too far in the direction of abstraction in interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_Ab8zNUy">However, in our extensive experience of teaching Template Analysis to novice researchers, we have not encountered many who have found the method's flexible approach to coding structure problematic.</s><s xml:id="_C5RJDaQ">A more prevalent difficulty we have observed in novice researchers using Template Analysis is the danger of losing sight of the original research project aims, and focusing on the constructed template as an end product, rather than a means to an end.</s><s xml:id="_T2X28dz">It is essential to remember that template development is intended as a way of making sense of data, and not the purpose of the analysis in and of itself.</s></p><p xml:id="_29chKqX"><s xml:id="_Q72rUdn">Overall though, we would suggest that Template Analysis offers a clear, systematic, and yet flexible approach to data analysis in qualitative psychology research.</s><s xml:id="_8vVPj3D">The flexibility of the coding structure in Template Analysis allows researchers to explore the richest aspects of data in real depth.</s><s xml:id="_J7DtHhf">The principles of the method are easily grasped, and the discipline of producing a template forces the researcher to take a systematic and well-structured approach to data handling.</s><s xml:id="_M2XmhdA">The use of an initial template followed by the iterative process of coding means that the method is often less time-consuming than other approaches to qualitative data analysis.</s><s xml:id="_tmns5Kk">Iterative use of the template encourages careful consideration of how themes are defined and how they relate to one another.</s><s xml:id="_whJJvxB">This approach lends itself well to group or team analysis, and working in this way ensures a careful focus on elaborate coding structures as the team collaboratively define meanings and structure.</s><s xml:id="_jsaxhPe">Template analysis can additionally handle larger data sets rather more comfortably than some other methods of qualitative data analysis although it can also be used with small sample sizes and has been used in the analysis of a single autobiographical case <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(King 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_WWXbKsC"><s xml:id="_A5jJtX2">A common feature of qualitative psychological research is the extensive and often complex data it produces.</s><s xml:id="_9uKAXCY">How a researcher or research team move from this mass of data to produce an understanding of their research participants' experiences depends upon their choice of data analysis technique.</s><s xml:id="_fcbT9X7">There is no one "best" method of data analysis in qualitative psychology research, with choices regarding analysis determined by broader theoretical assumptions underpinning the work and the research question itself.</s><s
