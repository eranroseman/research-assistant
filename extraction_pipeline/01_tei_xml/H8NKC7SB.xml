relationship is causal, our results suggest that if all participants had exercised for at least 1 hour each week, 12% of the cases of depression at follow-up could have been prevented.</s></p><p xml:id="_9mDkmGG"><s xml:id="_QPxU9TQ">The key strengths of this study are its large sample size, prospective data collection, use of validated measures of physical activity and mental disorder, and the detailed information available on a wide range of potential confounding and mediating factors.</s><s xml:id="_zZuUppx">Despite these strengths, the analyses presented have some important limitations.</s><s xml:id="_K7Umgws">Regarding the study design, while individuals reporting current symptoms and/or impairment of depression or anxiety at baseline were excluded using a two-step process, we were not able to exclude individuals with a history of prior episodes of depression and anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_PZXR4b7">Thus, it is possible that some individuals with a lifetime history of depression or anxiety may have been included in the "healthy" cohort, and thus a proportion of the future cases may be recurrent episodes of depression or anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_rnzTwNB">While the long follow-up time is a strength, the use of a single measure of a relapsing and remitting condition such as depression means that some misclassification will have occurred.</s><s xml:id="_vkzrwyf">Such misclassification is likely to be random and therefore results in regression dilution bias and an attenuation of effect sizes.</s><s xml:id="_vUZVRTb">This has important consequences for the interpretation of the results and suggests that the actual protective effect of exercise may be even greater than that reported in this study.</s><s xml:id="_GCwwsER">The measurement of exercise at a single time point will also have created some misclassification, although there was a significant correlation between levels of exercise at baseline and follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_VUhYx2S">The majority of other limitations relate to the measures used.</s><s xml:id="_ZpJ4Ntu">While the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is one of the most widely used and validated measures of depression and anxiety, the operationalization of any mental disorder via a self-report screening tool cannot be considered equivalent to a clinical diagnosis, and a risk of misclassification remains.</s><s xml:id="_9Dmd5xv">Similarly, while the measures of exercise used have been extensively validated <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, they remain reliant on self-report, and each factor considered in the analysis of mediation was measured with a single item that may not have fully captured the constructs being considered.</s><s xml:id="_VFQ4W6q">In

attributable fractions can be a useful way to help guide public health interventions, but any estimates of population attributable fractions assume a causal relationship with no residual confounding.</s><s xml:id="_eUjUFqh">While attempts were made to account for many confounders, a number of important potential confounding variables, such as personality, attitude toward health, diet, seasonal weather variations, and the degree to which each participant's local environment is conducive to regular exercise, remained unmeasured.</s><s xml:id="_cH6xZ6B">Nord-Trøndelag County is

any observed cross-sectional association between exercise and depression.</s><s xml:id="_Wyh2ydq">However, this longitudinal study mitigates against this by the fact that there was no link between the seasonal timing of the assessments in HUNT 1 (when exercise levels were measured) and HUNT 2 (when levels of depression were assessed).</s><s xml:id="_rB7qvuD">The invitation for participation in the HUNT 2 phase was sent to all residents of the county at a time that was unrelated to when each individual had been assessed during the HUNT 1 phase.</s><s xml:id="_ga6CK3p">The equal popularity of

largest and most detailed modeling of the prospective dose-response relationship between exercise and depression and the first published epidemiological exploration of the causal pathways involved.</s><s xml:id="_3kp9TT9">In addition to confirming that more active individuals are less likely to develop depression, we were able to demonstrate that this was most accurately modeled as an exponential decay model, with decreasing benefit as the total time spent exercising increases.</s><s xml:id="_ggbHQDV">This supports and expands on the tentative conclusions from a review published in
