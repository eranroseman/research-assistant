data errors are common <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, impeding the realisation of improved record quality.</s><s xml:id="_8CWPPg9">An American study conducted in an emergency department found that even small data errors had measurable effects on the department's ability to determine its operational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TJFnqNQ">In a study conducted in the UK, researchers deliberately seeded errors in a large database of 17,600 congenital heart operations to examine the impact of these errors on the estimation of mortality rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hx73UeJ">They found that the estimated mortality rates could be more than double the true value using the error-seeded data <ref type="bibr"

when using erroneous data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wxv6KYV">In another Australian study conducted in a hospital surgical unit, researchers found that erroneous data affected approximately 16 % of inpatient cases during a six-month time period, resulting in a $575,000 underpayment to the hospital <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_dymdCJd"><s xml:id="_4qNpZJW">Recognising the importance for healthcare organisations to develop error-reduction strategies, many studies have investigated the types and causes of data errors in eMR systems.</s><s xml:id="_DxXey66">A systematic review of 34 studies identified eight key themes of prescribing errors associated with the use of a computerised provider order entry system <ref

xml:id="_KSgrsPT">They thought it was the total volume of dose that should be administered, but the system meant the total volume of an individual bag of fluid.</s><s xml:id="_Mr9CkU7">As a result, they entered wrong information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kCRtQmg">This misinterpretation issue was not uncommon, as a later study also identified it as a cause of data

professionals work.</s><s xml:id="_dxzbBb5">A systematic review on the impact of system design on usability identified a drop-down menu selection error <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a type of error that has been frequently reported by studies on computerised provider order entry systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WF6stHa">Causes of this error included lengthy lists of items in the menu <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and inadvertent mouse wheeling to unknowingly choose an incorrect item <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jbqZu7C">It was also found that higher rate of the drop-down menu selection error was associated with single mouse click and urgent clinical situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eR32NuT">Other types of errors identified by previous studies included time stamp error, missing data, duplicate records and
