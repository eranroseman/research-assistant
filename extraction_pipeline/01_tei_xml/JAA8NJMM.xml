target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gFSteqU">Mobile phone messaging or SMS is a component of mHealth that has shown promising outcomes in regard to

form of the benefits of practicing a particular behavior (i.e., gain-framed) or the consequences of failing to practice that behavior (i.e., loss-framed) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_y9vTGyw">MF is inspired by prospect theory, which assumes that gain-framed messages (GFMs) are more effective if people perceive that the behavior stated in the message indicates a potential benefit, and that loss-framed messages (LFMs) are more effective if people perceive that the behavior stated in the message has a potential risk <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_BYs2xBj">Acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness are the most prominent measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, and perceptual implementation outcomes that are proximal

current study in addition to assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the message-framing intervention delivered via mobile phone messaging.</s><s xml:id="_JNKxadp">This study has also contributed to the existing body of knowledge, especially in developing countries, where there is a scarcity of evidence on the subject matter.</s><s xml:id="_mAPPAJq">Exposure to UM messages refers to how frequently participants received them and the proportion of exposure to the message type.</s><s xml:id="_eh4nQCC">Although UM messages were sent to participants every week, only three in five of them reported they had received the messages weekly.</s><s xml:id="_Cf93WyX">Some participants may have missed weekly messages due to poor network coverage or electric power outage.</s><s xml:id="_UC8yaB4">This challenge might have been resolved if the system sending the messages provided a delivery report and automatically resent undelivered messages.</s></p><p xml:id="_3a3XnbE"><s xml:id="_taJpcJz">Participants who received UM messages via family members' phones might mainly have missed the weekly message since 43.5% did not regularly have access to the phone the phone and, in 22.4% of cases, family members forgot to inform them about the messages.</s><s xml:id="_aCz8tPr">More than half (54.1%) of the participants read all of the messages they received, while 31.7% of them read most of the messages, and this implies that UM messages achieved high reach.</s><s xml:id="_ywkVtqs">ANC-related messages had a higher exposure recall (87.1%), while the lower (64.6%)</s><s xml:id="_8sU3PH6">exposure recall was related to lifestyle message content.</s><s xml:id="_4CacqE4">Regarding engagement with the intervention, 63.6% of the participants had high levels of engagement with the UM messages.</s><s xml:id="_Qzxsw4C">High engagement with an intervention has been reported by other studies that used SMS to increase adherence to triage among HPV-positive women <ref

xml:id="_xrvXsxJ">The observed higher feasibility and appropriateness in our study might be due to the personalization of the messages, the frequency, and the number of messages used in the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_7aVdJty">Assistance provided from community volunteers to participants who experienced difficulty in using the messages may have also increased the feasibility and appropriateness in our study.</s></p><p xml:id="_UaGZqQp"><s xml:id="_Usdbehy">In this study, internal consistency was assessed by computing Cronbach's alpha as a psychometric measurement of the implementation outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_9p83NxH">Accordingly, acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness were found to have strong internal consistency.</s><s xml:id="_eNtGPRZ">This finding was

feasibility.</s><s xml:id="_MUTKHkU">This is also supported by previous studies that reported high <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref> and moderate

target="#b31">[33]</ref> of acceptability and appropriateness.</s><s xml:id="_zmSn26M">These correlations imply mothers are more likely to use mHealth interventions they perceive as a good fit to their situation (appropriate) and practical to use in their setting (feasible), which are regarded as more acceptable.</s><s xml:id="_hMBubRJ">Feasibility and appropriateness were moderately correlated in our study.</s><s xml:id="_whE8Z9E">However, previous studies have shown a high correlation between feasibility and appropriateness <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33,</ref><ref

education was also positively associated with the feasibility and appropriateness of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_ySpwTuA">Tailored messages delivered at specific stages of pregnancy to provide timely information on pregnancy, childbirth, and newborn care may have contributed to increased mother satisfaction and increased perceptions of the intervention's practicality and appropriateness.</s><s xml:id="_uVPSsbw">Receiving UM messages in the evening negatively affected both the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention in our study.</s><s xml:id="_Rp47WAf">In contrast, another study that assessed the influence of content relevance and delivery time on SMS showed a higher acceptance of SMS in the afternoon and evening than in the morning <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_CAaYjgP"><s xml:id="_GHUtST8">Moreover, this study identified several sociodemographic factors that influenced implementation outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_CdHJYM2">Living in a rural area was found to negatively affect the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_jHH5GHK">Participants from rural areas may have encountered limited mobile network coverage, which potentially reduced their satisfaction and led to negative perceptions of the intervention's practicality and appropriateness.</s><s xml:id="_GqEfYB8">This finding implies the need to consider participants' places of residence when designing and implementing an mHealth intervention.</s><s xml:id="_aQVwSgv">This study also revealed the effect of wealth on implementation
