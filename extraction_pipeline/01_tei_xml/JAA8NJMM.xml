newborn care, the obstetric and gynecologic problem referral and network system, maternity waiting homes, community-based newborn care, integrated management of newborn and childhood illness, the

target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gFSteqU">Mobile phone messaging or SMS is a component of mHealth that has shown promising outcomes in regard to

target="#b18">20]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_AanTtuQ"><s xml:id="_DyyBe6z">Message framing (MF) is a communication strategy that aims to influence behavior by presenting and structuring messages in the form of the benefits of practicing a particular behavior (i.e., gain-framed) or the consequences of failing to practice that behavior (i.e., loss-framed) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_y9vTGyw">MF is inspired by prospect theory, which assumes that gain-framed messages (GFMs) are more effective if people perceive that the behavior stated in the message indicates a potential benefit, and that loss-framed messages (LFMs) are more effective if people perceive that the behavior stated in the message has a potential risk <ref type="bibr"

target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2D3nfn9">However, reports on the effectiveness of GFMs vs. LFMs in promoting health behavior have shown inconsistent findings, according to which neither GFMs

target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>, and LFMs were found to be more effective than gain-framed ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s

the main facilitators and barriers to the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zS3cNav">Assessing implementation outcomes along with effectiveness can speed up dissemination and translation of the research into usual practice by measuring how well the intervention can be implemented in real-world settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BYs2xBj">Acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness are the most prominent measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, and perceptual implementation outcomes that are proximal can be strongly associated with the effectiveness of the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_H7rwYsq">Scholars have assessed the acceptability, feasibility, and
