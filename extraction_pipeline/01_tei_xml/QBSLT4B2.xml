xml:id="_WJGsweU">The vision of a "quantified self " really began with Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly (then editors at Wired magazine) in 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wolf, 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JvF2sCs">Its original intention was to promote the value of self-monitoring facilitated by emerging mobile (and other) connected digital technologies (mobile apps, wearables, wireless peripherals, etc.) for data acquisition and self-reflection.</s><s xml:id="_ZhhsAqt">The data covered a range of overt and covert behaviors (steps, mood, diet, stress, medication adherence, etc.) and biomarkers (sleep, heart rate, weight, etc.) of which the end user's ultimate goal was to gain greater self-insights and share those insights with others.</s><s xml:id="_THDwjHc">The movement itself centered largely on the activity of selfmeasurement (aka tracking or self-monitoring) as the primary functional component of the experience.</s><s xml:id="_HpqyXq3">Much has changed since Wolf and Kelly originally coined this term [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heyen, 2020)</ref>].</s><s xml:id="_tDzNMfw">The technology currently available for quantifying various biometric, behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial factors of daily life has become increasingly diverse, accurate, and accessible.</s><s xml:id="_BwEFZqt">Many believe these burgeoning technologies can and will profoundly alter the way lifestyle, health, wellness, and chronic disease are managed in the future although, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heyen (2020)</ref> notes, the quantified-self phenomenon has had minimal impact on the collective scientific knowledge to date.</s><s xml:id="_RymFhYW">For those pursuing the potential of such digital technologies, several concepts have surfaced and/or resurfaced that when conceptually and practically integrated may help facilitate the as-yet-unrealized potential of connected care.</s></p><p xml:id="_wdMKMTz"><s xml:id="_H9jHAPX">The first of these concepts is that of a digital twin.</s><s xml:id="_ruUHkqp">A digital twin is a digital representation of a real-world entity or system that offers information on the functional status of that system.</s><s xml:id="_aK9c4za">The digital twin has its origins as an engineering paradigm for predictive problem solving of dynamic systems with early applications at NASA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Marr, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tao and Qi, 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eqVPQy2">The concept has been extended into many manufacturing-and process-related contexts to map out potential system failures.</s><s xml:id="_HdHTJJ2">Gartner named the digital twin concept one of the Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">2017</ref><ref

with more than 50 sensors/minicomputers that continuously monitor the functioning (i.e., health) of the car.</s><s xml:id="_gnD4N7E">The driver is signaled when one of these key functions falls outside a specific set of parameters via simplified and displayed dashboards.</s><s xml:id="_dmv8XAw">Such information allows drivers to determine the current functional state of their vehicle and intervene to avoid more extensive and costly problems prior to catastrophe.</s><s xml:id="_HqJk57S">When serious trouble arises, these integrated computers alert the dealership to diagnostic issues and even contact emergency services based on continuously collected data from the car).</s></p><p xml:id="_QVA8vrc"><s xml:id="_S27yPg5">Imagine if people had access to a similar set of selfgenerated biobehavioral information via a dashboard connected to the increasingly sophisticated and diverse set of commercially available devices, biosensors, technologies, and related data representing their own operational health and lifestyle.</s><s xml:id="_pcpnSqE">These digital twins could be the by-product of a networked set of biosensors, wearables, peripherals, smart pill dispensers, smart inhalers, ingestible smart pills, implantable devices (e.g., implantable cardio defibrillators), smart injectors, smartphone applications, and/or smart speakers all connected to an intelligent home ecosystem.</s><s xml:id="_gF8JSCp">Data emanating from these varied sources and sensors would be rendered back to the person, reflecting everything from their ongoing blood pressure to degree of hydration.</s><s xml:id="_ejXBatu">The rendered data, with supporting content, would drive personalized and actionable health choices and behavior change guidance to each person uniquely throughout the day based on their own configuration and biobehavioral readings.</s></p><p xml:id="_StT8Pns"><s xml:id="_D2Bxgme">The technology for creating a usable digital twin largely exists today for addressing wellness, prevention, and ongoing management of focused health conditions.</s><s xml:id="_A8WaSCd">Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> lays out a conceptual (albeit incomplete) digital health technology map as it might be applied to the range of monitoring possibilities by organ system based on commercially available digital technology.</s><s

purposes.</s></p><p xml:id="_yBKHnSu"><s xml:id="_heDphMS">If the concept of a digital twin is currently conceivable with existing commercially ready digital health and therapeutics technologies, then data derived from such enhanced selfmonitoring technology represents the individual's digital phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Onnela and Rauch, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Huckvale et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7ERHxjM">As such, this digital phenotype is the sum of an individual's ad libitum behavior expressed through digital media (sensors, tools, devices, apps, and related software, such as machine learning or artificial intelligence, etc.) in vivo and in situ.</s><s xml:id="_hgNGShx">Today, these digital phenotypes do not necessarily reflect an a priori attempt by the individual to make use of their digital information as reflected in their phenotype.</s><s xml:id="_sKjrNU9">However, the collected data, when organized, has the potential to typify an individual's behaviors, lifestyle, and related baseline biomarkers as they relate to targeted risks and health end points consistent with what is now being referred to as P4 <ref

xml:id="_KNeXgZV"><s xml:id="_K2X4Ada">The link between the digital twin and the digital phenotype would likely be a set of algorithms patterned off the current scientific knowledge base.</s><s xml:id="_U7wnRkb">For example, findings from the ongoing Framingham Heart Study have been used to establish a 10-year coronary risk prediction algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(D'Agostino et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x7ME7PU">If an individual has contributed the necessary input data of age, diabetes diagnosis, smoking status, treated and untreated systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or body mass index (BMI) from any combination of sources, including consumer devices, clinical records, or selfreport, then the system could provide real-time feedback that also ties to a risk score for cardiovascular health as well as related evidence-based insights for cardiovascular risk modification.</s><s xml:id="_aG94hw3">Additional algorithms could provide similar scores for other biological functions.</s><s xml:id="_fwVCauK">Collectively, the dashboard could demonstrate changing future risk based on real-time, present-time performance.</s><s xml:id="_ZCsEYKf">This can also prompt individuals to connect other data sources if key variables are missing from certain algorithms.</s></p><p xml:id="_TdB8XeW"><s xml:id="_Ycg8Ckf">One concern, which we address in more detail in the conclusion, is basing digital twin technology on data sets that capture patterns of bias.</s><s xml:id="_HmNyMP7">Because the technology, by nature, hones in on patterns, training the algorithm with flawed data can exacerbate and perpetuate those flaws.</s><s xml:id="_ChU7Hyj">For example, a study examining an algorithm used by Optum to assign risk levels to patients systematically under-risked Black patients, likely due to the use of data that included racially based care disparities <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Obermeyer et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SdPxQAQ">The resulting algorithm treated less care tendered to Black patients as indicative of lower need rather than less access.</s></p><p xml:id="_yMaDpsZ"><s xml:id="_aF4z3Tn">Several considerations are important here.</s><s xml:id="_Rs5fEcK">First is the integrity of the data itself as is true of all data operations.</s><s xml:id="_SRSWPWr">Second, any data included in the digital twin technology should be critically reviewed to identify and remediate issues that perpetuate historical bias.</s><s xml:id="_sdKRDba">Third, and most importantly (and often confused with the second consideration), is the interpretive lens.</s><s xml:id="_DyMfbDZ">Reliable and valid data do indicate biases in healthcare because they truly exist (and are now commonly and collectively referred to as the "social determinants of health").</s><s xml:id="_5aMeZPD">What is deeply needed and will not be addressed by data or analytics alone is the strong interpretive lens, and that is about values <ref type="bibr">(NEJM Catalyst, 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZxCXcWX">The history of intelligence testing and the eugenics movement is a sober reminder <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gould,
