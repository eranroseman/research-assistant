<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_2SrWj3r"><p xml:id="_GHjUeCN"><s xml:id="_4naUcYw">There are over 285 million wireless subscribers in the USA alone <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, and an estimated 67.6% of adults worldwide own cell phones <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UgYhanc">Approximately 75% of US high school students own a mobile phone <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wJWWTZf">In contrast to the initial Internet digital divide which limited the reach of computerized health behavior interventions for those in lower socioeconomic groups, mobile phone use has been widely adopted across socioeconomic and demographic groups and appears greater among those populations most in need of these interventions <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qnKQ6kz">The penetration rates in developing countries, where wireless technologies have leapfrogged the wired computer infrastructure, have produced considerable excitement in the global health community to reach and follow individuals who were previously unreachable via traditional communication channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_DCEDuNx"><s xml:id="_Y4UB8QR">Compared to Internet interventions delivered to desktop and laptop computers, mobile interventions Implications Practice: Mobile technologies are rapidly evolving as a method for delivering health behavior interventions that can be tailored to the individual throughout the intervention, but the content and timing of these interventions have not been consistently grounded in health behavior theories, so practitioners need to consider the theoretical and empirical basis of mobile health behavior interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_MtFCtH7"><s xml:id="_VxjKQXu">Policy: Investment in the development of mobile health behavior interventions needs to be balanced with investment in theoretically grounded content development and evaluation procedures that are responsive to this rapidly evolving area.</s></p><p xml:id="_32yP2Eb"><s xml:id="_vaM4jQq">Research: In addition to the responsive evaluation of mobile health behavior interventions, researchers need to utilize these applications to test and advance more dynamic health behavior theories, taking advantage of control systems engineering and other dynamic feedback models to advance new theories that can be better applied to the intensive adaptability possible from mobile health behavior interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_WeAqkMa"><s xml:id="_yAkn8F9">have the capacity to interact with the individual with much greater frequency and in the context of the behavior.</s><s xml:id="_EbVMA4G">As sensing technologies integrated with the mobile phone via Bluetooth or other data transmission process continue to develop, health behavior change interventions can be delivered based not only on self-reports and time/location parameters but also on psychophysiological state, social context, activity level, and behavior patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_C4KYxTD">The availability of these rich, complex, and frequent data inputs provides the potential to deliver health behavior interventions tailored not only to the person's baseline characteristics but also to his/ her frequently changing behaviors and environmental contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_4TdsMXm"><s xml:id="_9K88Xux">To better leverage the potential of mobile technologies for health behavior interventions, health behavior theories and models need to be able to guide the development of complex interventions that adapt rapidly over time in response to various inputs.</s><s xml:id="_aPcay6G">Existing health behavior theories and models have served for many years as guides to intervention development and delivery, and these theories have been the basis not only for face-to-face counseling interventions but also mass media and social marketing efforts.</s><s xml:id="_GWNuCNK">Models such as the Health Belief Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[12]</ref>, Theory of Planned Behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref>, Social Cognitive Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[14]</ref>, the Transtheoretical Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>, and Self-Determination Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref> have served as the basis for many of the eHealth web and desktop/laptop computer interventions and have informed how interventions can be tailored to the individual's baseline status.</s></p><p xml:id="_MAfpaUA"><s xml:id="_vwR9nFF">As intervention developers take full advantage of mobile technologies, health behavior models will be required to guide not only tailored adjustments at intervention initiation but also the dynamic process of frequent iterative intervention adjustments during the course of intervention.</s><s xml:id="_WYdX3jS">The content and timing of a specific mobile phone intervention delivered via voice, text, resident application, mobile web, or other modality can be driven by a range of variables including (a) the target behavior frequency, duration, or intensity; (b) the effect of prior interventions on the target behavior; and (c) the current context of the individual (time, location, social environment, psychophysiological state, etc.).</s><s xml:id="_txUmCfK">Such interventions require health behavior models that have dynamic, regulatory system components to guide rapid intervention adaptation based on the individual's current and past behavior and situational context.</s><s xml:id="_kcfMwny">Some have argued that current health behavior models are inadequate even for low-tech interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref>, but the predominately linear and static nature of these models severely limits their ability to guide the dynamic, adaptive interventions possible via mobile technologies.</s></p><p xml:id="_UgcZsaf"><s xml:id="_2uztNpw">To evaluate the theoretical basis and adaptive nature of mobile interventions, the current literature on mobile technology health behavior interventions was reviewed.</s><s xml:id="_2UDE2G2">For this review, we define "mobile technology" as computer devices that are intended to be always on and carried on the person throughout the day (i.e., during normal daily activities).</s><s xml:id="_zYQ7BYa">Mobile phones are the prototype device within this space, and most of the interventions reviewed used mobile phone platforms, but precursors to current smart phones and text messaging systems such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and two-way pagers also are consistent with this definition.</s><s xml:id="_H8meBKB">Excluded from this definition are devices that are portable (e.g., laptops, netbooks, iPads) but are not intended to be carried on the person throughout the day.</s><s xml:id="_AkqH4Sf">Although technically mobile, we also excluded interventions that involved phone-based counseling, whether live or by interactive voice response (IVR), that could be delivered similarly via landline (i.e., phone-based counseling via mobile phone).</s><s xml:id="_8NdxcuV">Prior to the advent and widespread use of multipurpose mobile devices, special purpose devices were developed for the delivery of health behavior interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">19]</ref>, but these pioneering prototypes often lacked the portability, connectivity, input-output interface, and/or computing power of current multipurpose devices and are not included in this review.</s><s xml:id="_zYJbQvQ">This review is also limited to the use of these mobile devices for delivering health behavior interventions, not assessments.</s><s xml:id="_bkVnUak">There is a substantive literature on the use of mobile devices for health behavior assessment (e.g., ecological momentary assessment), and self-monitoring alone has been shown to be an effective health behavior intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref>, but we excluded from this review mobile programs that involved assessment input only or that used mobile device output solely for the purpose of encouraging input (i.e., reinforcing recording adherence).</s></p><p xml:id="_dWcNwGD"><s xml:id="_9cZ56fn">For this review, a Medline search of "mobile phone," "cell phone," "text messaging," "personal digital assistant," "PDA," "palmtop," "handheld computer," and "pager" published through June 2010 was conducted.</s><s xml:id="_DzX6GCV">Articles meeting the definition described above were selected, and additional articles were identified from references of these initially selected articles.</s><s xml:id="_X7VaTnE">A considerable number of these articles were proof-of-concept reports that described technical development, an ongoing study, or reported only usability/satisfaction data.</s><s xml:id="_txBKjxY">To insure review of fully functional mobile interventions, we narrowed the selection criteria to studies that reported some form of clinical outcome data, with or without randomized controlled conditions.</s><s xml:id="_HjR4HSe">Nearly all of the articles identified meeting these criteria fell into one of four major health behavior areas: smoking, weight loss (including diet and exercise interventions), treatment adherence (i.e., adherence to medical recommendations including both taking medication and attending appointments), and chronic disease management.</s><s xml:id="_2kxEEXE">Therefore, we limited this review to mobile health behavior interventions in these four areas.</s><s xml:id="_DfszGfK">Others have reviewed subsets of the research reviewed here for the purposes of estimating effect sizes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">22]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_EWwGbWE">In contrast to meta-analytic reviews of effect size, the purpose of this review is to assess how theory has been employed in the development of mobile health behavior interventions and how the interactive and adaptive potential of these interventions may require new dynamic systems theories of health behavior.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_HQJ97QF">Smoking cessation</head><p xml:id="_rUwt8hS"><s xml:id="_PaCREZz">Seven studies were identified that used mobile technology to deliver smoking cessation interventions.</s><s xml:id="_5rxfef2">In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and subsequent tables of the other three areas reviewed, we summarize for each study the basic study characteristics (e.g., sample, design), a brief description of the intervention, the theoretical basis of the intervention if reported, the interactivity of the intervention, and the primary outcome.</s><s xml:id="_g7npuCt">For interactivity, we specify if the intervention output was adjusted based on input provided by the user, if this adjustment was manual (e. g., healthcare professional reviewed data and determined intervention output) or automatic (e.g., intervention output generated by computer algorithms), and if the adjustment occurred at intervention initiation (i.e., tailored or personalized based on initial assessment) or during the course of the intervention, or both.</s><s xml:id="_JMFPdY6">The concept of "just-in-time" of Intille et al. is used to characterize interventions that adjust based on data obtained during the course of the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bV9PbDd">As opposed to the term "real-time" which is commonly is used in the mobile assessment literature to denote input occurring at the time of a recording prompt or the behavior being monitored, mobile interventions are often lagged over minutes, hours, or days as sufficient data are obtained to adapt the intervention, hence the use of "just-in-time" to describe adaptations occurring during the course of the intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZpJxkB5"><s xml:id="_Mnp9zaW">As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the seven studies identified are from three research groups who developed and evaluated interventions delivered via mobile phone text messaging (aka short messaging service (SMS)).</s><s xml:id="_adMZcgY">These interventions consisted primarily of text message output although Whittaker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> also delivered mobile videos of role models and their quitting experiences.</s><s xml:id="_qwN4csB">All of the interventions were computer-tailored at treatment initiation.</s><s xml:id="_vtHmvQp">The intervention developed by Riley and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25]</ref> tailored both content and timing of the text messages to the times users indicated via an associated Internet site that urges and high-risk situations were likely to occur.</s><s xml:id="_jv7vjvZ">All of these interventions also adjusted just-in-time via text message requests from users for assistance which generated immediate return text messages with tips and strategies to manage urges or withdrawal.</s><s xml:id="_5YCDRMs">The Brendryen <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">28]</ref> and Riley interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25]</ref> also adjusted the intervention based on smoking status (e.g., different messages before vs. after quitting, resetting quit dates if relapse occurred).</s></p><p xml:id="_4dfUx6r"><s xml:id="_gjjaNM3">With the exception of the Rodgers intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">29]</ref>, these mobile smoking cessation interventions provided a theoretical basis, citing Social Cognitive Theory, Self-Regulation Theory, the Transtheoretical Model, and cognitive-behavioral theory.</s><s xml:id="_QMTk4Tk">These theories primarily appear to have informed the content of the text messages which included skills to manage urges and the facilitation of social support.</s><s xml:id="_PAmHNXB">The Transtheoretical Model was used to adapt the content of the text messages to the preparation, action, and maintenance stages of the quit process.</s><s xml:id="_kJh8U9q">In a separate report, Brendryen and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31]</ref> provided a detailed description of the intervention mapping process for the development of the Happy Ending intervention based on Self-Regulation Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and relapse prevention.</s><s xml:id="_hR6kUfR">In a stepwise approach, they performed a needs assessment and devised proximal change objectives based on the self-observation, self-evaluation, and self-reaction processes of Self-Regulation Theory and the behavioral determinants posited by Social Cognitive Theory and related models.</s><s xml:id="_KtDFXZD">They generated theory-based methods and practical strategies to address these change objectives and developed the resulting intervention to deliver each of these strategies.</s><s xml:id="_qaCjfDr">This report provides a well-devised framework for the application of theory to a mobile health behavior intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_GNJUgNp"><s xml:id="_GzPzfzb">Quit rates from the interventions evaluated in these studies range from 8% <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref> to 53% <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> with a followup period ranging from 4 weeks to 12 months.</s><s xml:id="_sAzcZdW">A recent Cochrane review of randomized studies of mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation, which included all of the randomized controlled trials (RCT) reviewed here, found a significant shortterm increase in self-reported quitting (relative risk= 2.18; 95% confidence interval 1.80 to 2.65) but considerable heterogeneity and lack of sufficient evidence for long-term effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FaFzhcu">Although promising, the effects of mobile technologies for smoking cessation require more study, especially of the longterm effects of these interventions.</s></p></div>

salutary effects of positive affect and dosages of intervention components such as medications and psychosocial interventions.</s><s xml:id="_sbSP22k">In a control systems conceptualization, smoking urge (y(t)) is the controlled variable, while smoking activity represents a manipulated variable (u 1 (t)) whose action serves to reduce the urge to smoke.</s><s xml:id="_VjWgddM">Environmental
