underserved population given that few are reached by currently available evidence-based smoking cessation interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jKBXSvV">Novel cessation interventions to reach young adults smokers are clearly needed.</s></p><p xml:id="_9W5nrAA"><s xml:id="_2rZRNar">Recent reviews of Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> or social media interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> for health behavior change and a meta-analysis of Web-and computer-based smoking cessation interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> have concluded that these kinds of interventions can have small but significant beneficial effects (eg, effects of Web-based interventions on smoking cessation-relative risk 1.40) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qf6td5s">However, low participant engagement with online or social media interventions is

xml:id="_MHcr5AZ">Research on Internet-based health promotion interventions suggests that peer and counselor support, email/telephone contact, and regular updates to the website improve participant engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hMazXqe">Further, the results of a Web-based smoking cessation intervention suggested that a prescriptive message tone (vs a motivational tone), a dictated content viewing order (vs navigation autonomy), and email reminders increased engagement among participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xmaZtT8">Compared to other online interventions, social media offer several potential advantages for participant engagement, since they can reach large audiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> that are already regular users and familiar with the platform.</s><s xml:id="_kFenCxf">Further, social media are typically more interactive and require the user to engage more than traditional websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and can promote social connectedness and sharing of experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CGmWQM6">However, little is known about how characteristics of social media interventions are related to participant engagement.</s></p><p xml:id="_fF4UHUh"><s xml:id="_XzKGWAM">The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is a well-researched theory of health behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>, conceptualizing the process of behavior change into five different stages: Precontemplation (not ready to change in the near future), Contemplation (intending to change within the next 6 months), Preparation (intending to change within the next 30 days), Action (achievement of intended change for less than 6 months), and Maintenance (achievement of intended change for 6 months or more) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_N5DGeQe">Additional dimensions of the TTM include Decisional Balance, or the balance between pros and cons of the problematic behavior and of behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, and 10 processes of change that aid progression from one stage to the next <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ATWF66j">See Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for an overview and definition for all TTM content used in the current study.</s><s xml:id="_rA8GmYh">Realizing that the behavior change is an important part of one's identity Self-Reevaluation Previous research suggests that processes of change focused on cognitions, affects, and evaluations are more appropriate in earlier stages, while commitment, conditioning, and stimulus control are more appropriate in the more advanced stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7qs2MvK">The TTM and its components are frequently used to design Internet-based interventions to promote health behavior change and TTM-based interventions were found to result in significant effects on health-related behaviors including smoking cessation <ref

mixed-methods formative work suggested that an intervention tailored to readiness to quit smoking would likely appeal to the widest range of young adult smokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EFQgsuK">Yet, there is no evidence as to how social media intervention content should be tailored to best engage young adult smokers who are in different stages of change.</s></p><p xml:id="_g8DBvRG"><s xml:id="_7gU8TfF">Engagement in Facebook interventions to change health behavior has previously been operationalized as posting, commenting, or liking of content <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, and previous studies also reported that engagement in social media interventions more generally tends to

social media interventions for smoking cessation, it is important to know how intervention content should be tailored to produce high participant engagement.</s><s xml:id="_WyuyxrK">However, to our knowledge, no study has examined how intervention content is associated with participant engagement in a smoking cessation intervention delivered through Facebook.</s><s xml:id="_m3DSRPG">Intervention engagement is a meaningful outcome to study, since results from behavioral smoking cessation counseling studies suggest that abstinence increases with overall contact time (up to 90 minutes) as well as with number of treatment sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_caGsKwv">With regard to digital health interventions, one previous study suggests that higher engagement

the context of a feasibility trial of the Tobacco Status Project, a Facebook smoking cessation intervention for young adults, this study aimed to identify which intervention content based on the TTM
