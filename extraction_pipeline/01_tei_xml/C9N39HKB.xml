between 20% and 40% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZnEwucP">Characterized as a cluster of major interrelated risk factors for cardiovascular disease, MetS significantly exacerbates health outcomes by more than doubling the risk of cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_C88rdNW">A MetS diagnosis is established when 3 or more of the following 5 risk factors are present: waist circumference indicative of obesity, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nDkJjtv">As MetS is closely linked to lifestyle factors such as poor diet and insufficient physical activity (PA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, it can be prevented by targeted lifestyle modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Jdf6zAU">Given the substantial individual, societal, and economic burdens MetS imposes, proactive prevention and ongoing management are imperative.</s></p><p xml:id="_4A38KZd"><s xml:id="_BbdUWEE">Digital health care refers to the use of information and communication technology to monitor and manage health and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YGsAxyr">Advances in the information and communication technology sector have facilitated health care delivery through mobile apps, wearable devices, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and telemedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Gg9gBdX">Digital health care has already been extensively applied across various health care domains.</s><s xml:id="_25TUuvD">For instance, smart bands, a category of wearable devices, can quantify PA metrics such as step count, walking distance, and walking intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KUj4yJV">Studies indicate that the adoption of these wearable devices can enhance PA levels among individuals with chronic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tdHUdBU">Moreover, health-related mobile apps have the potential to instigate behavioral changes in users by providing educational content, personalized health counseling, and diet and exercise monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x5pTE5Q">This approach takes genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors into account to develop personalized treatment plans, offering potential improvements in the management of MetS through more targeted interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E4XT5mx">In other words, it enables the application of precision medicine, a health care approach that tailors medical treatment to each patient's individual characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HFyE23W">Given that digital health care is already widely used in health care settings, evidence from multiple

xml:id="_5a9rBGg">Previous studies on MetS within the realm of digital health care have used systematic reviews, meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and scoping reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nt2Hjej">However, these approaches have limitations, particularly in the depth to which they explore subjects, key concepts, and topics.</s><s xml:id="_ppHSR4z">Given the rapid advancements in digital health care research, it is imperative that researchers stay informed about the evolving knowledge structure, including emerging topics and shifting trends in MetS and digital health care research.</s><s xml:id="_A3VahNW">This understanding is essential for maintaining the relevance and efficacy of ongoing and future studies in this dynamic field.</s></p><p xml:id="_PbJAcSV"><s

significant keywords, serving as a valuable network statistical indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rP6HBdb">Furthermore, topic modeling serves as a statistical inference model that uses text mining to objectively and clearly evaluate research topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Qq2g6jD">We used text mining analysis to examine trends in MetS-related digital health care research to understand the existing knowledge structure and inform the direction of future investigations.</s><s xml:id="_SWBbq98">Accordingly, this study aimed to clarify the relationships between keywords by analyzing previous research on MetS within the domain of digital health care through text network analysis and to investigate research topics related to MetS within the digital health care sector.</s></p><p xml:id="_3nahSN6"><s xml:id="_KShaYwh">The objective of this study was to construct a network that consolidates prior research on MetS within the field of digital health care.</s><s xml:id="_NJFMrZF">The study aimed to create an informed body of literature by comparing and analyzing keywords and research topics.</s><s xml:id="_5KmwhBs">The study had 3 primary goals: first, to identify the terms associated with MetS research in digital health care; second, to establish a text network comprising core keywords from existing literature on MetS and digital health care; and third, to identify trends in MetS research within the digital health care context through topic
