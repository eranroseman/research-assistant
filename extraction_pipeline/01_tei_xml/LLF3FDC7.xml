<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Murthy, 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8SapeM9">Approximately 17 % of young adults (i.e., those between the ages of 18 and 25) experienced major depression in the past year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 2020), and approximately 15 % experienced past-month anxiety symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goodwin et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nxgxqfp">The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated mental health challenges young adults face <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vahratian, 2021)</ref>, leading to more daily stressors, disrupted life transitions, and increased isolation.</s></p><p xml:id="_9pybY3m"><s xml:id="_X95CqWM">Despite high rates of mental health challenges, relatively few young people use formal mental health services.</s><s xml:id="_SwhwzD3">Young adults have the most disproportionate underutilization of mental health services of any adult age group, with less than half receiving any formal mental health service such as psychotherapy, counseling, or medication management (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 2020).</s><s xml:id="_Xnej7ZC">Young adults' limited use of these treatments reflects both structural and attitudinal barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gulliver et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9yjR7qR">Structural barriers include financial costs, provider shortages, and transportation challenges, whereas attitudinal barriers include stigma, preferences for self-management, and beliefs that one's mental health condition is not severe enough to warrant treatment or that treatment will not help <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gulliver et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mehra et al.,

adults who may not have access to, or may not want, formal mental health services.</s><s xml:id="_8Wshx44">These interventions can be designed to be self-guided, and to involve brief engagement in one's free time and personal environment.</s><s xml:id="_uaGny6p">Because of these and other factors, many young adults are more willing to use DMHIs than to seek in-person help <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Liverpool et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qdfMwat">DMHIs are also efficacious, with effect sizes comparable to faceto-face therapy in clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Linardon et al., 2019)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_DY4eGhR"><s xml:id="_esu4rA6">However, until recently, little attention had been paid to designing evidence-based DMHIs that individuals will use outside of research trials.</s><s xml:id="_W6rmYaK">When accessed "in the wild," the vast majority of DMHIs have had low engagement and high attrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baumel et

reaching a less motivated population outside the trial context, and losing structure and support for tool use <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mohr et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MNefPWZ">To ensure tools are convenient and useful in the context of day-to-day life, it is necessary to involve end-users across the design and development process <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mohr et al.,

type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fitzpatrick et al., 2017)</ref>, and social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dobias et al., 2022)</ref>, so that interventions fit easily into users' daily routines and are more scalable.</s></p><p xml:id="_bwM3HGW"><s xml:id="_WrRBHBC">In this paper, we address a prototype of a text messaging intervention designed to support young adults' self-management of depression and anxiety symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_KYXdDv9">Consistent with the Accelerated Creation to Sustainment (ACTS) framework for digital intervention development <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mohr et al., 2017)</ref>, the design process was rooted in the perspectives of endusers with experiences of depression and/or anxiety, involving them in elicitation of design ideas and iterative evaluation of intervention prototypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kornfield et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kruzan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Meyerhoff et al., 2022a)</ref>, including evaluating example messages and proposing revisions.</s><s xml:id="_fE9b46g">This process led to the preliminary design of a text messaging program that provides variety in the psychological strategies users can learn about, and in the types of interactions users can have with the program <ref type="bibr">(Meyerhoff et al., 2022b)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MtmUXWC">Text messaging was selected as an intervention medium as it is one the most used forms of interpersonal communication across demographic groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gallup., 2014)</ref>, and is accessible without internet-capable devices like smartphones or without consistent access to a data plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Willcox et al., 2019)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_BPDb83Z"><s xml:id="_4Kr8qQW">Here we describe procedures for, and results from, a study of a prototype of the "Small Steps SMS" program.</s><s xml:id="_f8szTpJ">While the program is intended to be automated, this study used a Wizard-of-Oz approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dow et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tennent et al., 2018)</ref>, a user-centered design method in which research staff play the part of the system by manually sending messages based on a detailed script.</s><s xml:id="_bQqczRF">We piloted 1-and 2-week versions of the program and collected feedback through semi-structured interviews.</s><s xml:id="_cPDM9QC">We report, based on message logs, how much users engaged with the program and-drawing on qualitative data-aspects of the design that kept

largely within interactive dialogues that were conversational, and when presenting stories.</s><s xml:id="_srUDatf">For such dialogues, further experimentation may be necessary to identify optimal latencies.</s><s xml:id="_ACCC8h6">For example, users could be sent dialogues with shorter versus longer latency, with ratings or engagement rates used to determine future content delivery.</s><s xml:id="_j9Xmhjt">It may also be possible to determine the ideal latency for a user based on their own latency in responding, akin to matching speech rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Manson et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MHbgWQs">Dissatisfaction with message volume also reflected users' availability and psychological states, suggesting that systems should adapt accordingly.</s><s xml:id="_EbGJRZ6">Many users wanted options to pause messages, or to actively launch dialogues at a chosen time.</s><s xml:id="_wTHRSqb">Users also wanted personalized schedules, fitting delivery into time windows when they tend to be available and motivated.</s><s xml:id="_ugYgVrn">This could involve sending messages within user-selected windows (e.g., late morning, early afternoon), or testing responsiveness in these windows and then adapting delivery.</s><s xml:id="_kckDqVv">Sensorbased measurements (e.g., location, movement) offer another potential avenue to understand users' contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Meyerhoff et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hppuqfu">For example, a user who is at home outside work hours and whose phone is unlocked may be likely to be available for a message.</s><s xml:id="_gmGXsy3">Other work has proposed linking messaging systems to users' digital calendars <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bhattacharjee et al., 2022)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_eD4tfwR"><s xml:id="_cwS2NDZ">Finally, some participants objected to the content of psychological strategies.</s><s xml:id="_rYXjQW6">Preferences varied but could be strongly held.</s><s xml:id="_7sU3ZXN">Further work is needed to understand how to present strategies that are therapeutically beneficial but also challenging, which may include normalizing the difficulty experienced, or conveying why a challenging strategy is still worthwhile.</s><s xml:id="_8bAnNy9">Participants also valued having the ability to discontinue strategies they deemed unhelpful or irrelevant.</s><s xml:id="_2jhZRqe">This suggests the risk of creating interventions that are too strictly "tunneled," meaning that the user must complete content on the topic before proceeding to the next topic, without an option to exit early.</s><s xml:id="_rFxEnMY">Instead, designers must find convenient ways to allow ongoing customization, while considering the potential burden of habitually requesting feedback.</s><s xml:id="_d49HnrZ">For example, a system might follow up on especially low ratings or engagement with additional queries to better understand their basis (e.g., not liking a psychological strategy, a timing or volume issue) and offering a way to opt out of problematic content.</s><s xml:id="_F4nkXCV">For preferences that are less strongly held, the program can collect ongoing ratings or engagement data to inform passive, gradual tailoring, without complete exclusion of a content type.</s></p><p xml:id="_HAFtWxh"><s xml:id="_gxxE7TG">This study has several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_GjPU8Vg">Our Wizard-of-Oz approach allowed us to gather rapid user feedback and monitor free-text responses so researchers could conduct participant outreach, if indicated.</s><s xml:id="_zEkyyQM">Yet, this approach likely impacted users' experience.</s><s xml:id="_Z2NXTr3">For example, researchers could perform disambiguation of unclear messages (e.g., where a user replies "ok" instead of "yes") and could respond when users replied out of sequence or changed their answers, which likely improved user experience.</s><s xml:id="_bhFcuCB">In addition, knowing researchers would read their messages may have changed how users responded.</s><s xml:id="_h5StqDg">The approach also was subject to some fidelity issues, where team members made errors in following messaging scripts or sent messages later than scheduled due to conflicts.</s><s xml:id="_4SGHX6Z">In addition, our results focus on one definition of engagement: responding at least once to a daily dialogue.</s><s xml:id="_ruGN6Ap">This parallels common definitions of engagement used for DMHIs (e.g., any daily app use) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baumel et al., 2019)</ref>, and other interactive messaging systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Psihogios et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_68m3H74">This could be considered a low threshold since participants often had multiple timepoints at which they could respond.</s><s xml:id="_CtCfZp6">On the other hand, participants can use the program in ways that are invisible to the system (e.g., acting on a suggestion without sending any response).</s><s xml:id="_SptsNGd">Future work should consider additional metrics, including link clicks, response latency, sensor-based data, and subjective engagement measures which may capture invisible responses like reading, thinking about, and acting on messages.</s><s xml:id="_p8nzPbB">Additional limitations include that the qualitative feedback came only from those willing to provide interviews, and that the findings related to general favorability of the program will not necessarily translate into acceptance or use of the psychological strategies, or reduced symptoms.</s></p><p xml:id="_ezXenXF"><s xml:id="_9gVgzcF">These limitations suggest the need for efficacy trials of the system to assess effects on depression and anxiety symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_sjP2WY6">Furthermore, additional study designs may be considered to link specific content types to effects on symptoms, differentiating the helpfulness of each content type for depression versus anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_dApRAy2">For example, participants may be exposed one-at-a-time to psychological strategies or dialogue types before reporting on depression and anxiety symptoms at the completion of each, or multiple versions of the system could be created that each focus on one strategy or dialogue type, with these versions then being compared.</s></p></div>
