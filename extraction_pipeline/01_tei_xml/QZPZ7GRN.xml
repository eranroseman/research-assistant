<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_75xNKyW">DISCUSSION</head><p xml:id="_My9c446"><s xml:id="_YkWkbJX">The study of self-change and therapy-change subjects yielded several important findings.</s><s xml:id="_78vuX7F">Self-Quitters differed significantly from therapy subjects on the importance given to five of the ten processes of change.</s><s xml:id="_RsHTseH">Self-Quitters were as successful as the formalized treatment group in maintaining cessation at the five-month follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_cGwhk7Y">Maintainers did not differ significantly from recidivists on the processes of change that were emphasized in producing change.</s><s xml:id="_s7DvKes">In general, the Verbal Processes of change were significantly more important during the Decision Stage, while the Behavioral Processes were most important during the Active Change and Maintenance Stages.</s></p><p xml:id="_QUSKAcv"><s xml:id="_87QEUBW">While provocative, these findings may be limited by reliance on self-reports.</s><s xml:id="_DZ7R3s6">The fact that the experimenters were unrelated to the subjects' treatment was assumed to lessen some biases of self-report.</s><s xml:id="_UsthSN9">Nevertheless, future studies need to validate smoking status with more objective measures.</s><s xml:id="_scKHVat">Self-reports for assessing the processes of change that subjects emphasize are appropriate, though limited, means for beginning process research.</s><s xml:id="_fnRU4UR">The reliance on available volunteers, though difficult to avoid, may result in selection biases that could systematically affect the findings.</s></p><p xml:id="_UhNPbDR"><s xml:id="_5KnZvK6">Given such qualifications, the present study still provides an interesting perspective on self-changers.</s><s xml:id="_YswqYWU">The self-changers appeared to have been as entrenched in their smoking habit as the therapy-change subjects.</s><s xml:id="_ECWDPxW">On the average, each group began smoking as teenagers, had smoked for over 15 years and had tried to quit at least twice previously.</s></p><p xml:id="_DgVDZ3K"><s xml:id="_s3u7ruV">Self-change cannot be accounted for by the type or intensity of the smoking habit or the previous success or failure of the individual.</s><s xml:id="_7hDEeBA">Why some individuals go to therapy programs for smoking cessation rather than quitting on their own continues to be an intriguing question.</s><s xml:id="_473CBbV">It is especially intriguing, since at five month followup self-quitters were able to maintain cessation of smoking as well as the subject who attended expensive, sophisticated treatments.</s><s xml:id="_t5xehQJ">As expected, the change process model was effective in differentiating the three treatment groups on the importance of particular processes, Self-Quitters rated Feedback, Stimulus Control and Social Management as significantly less important in quitting than did the therapy groups.</s><s xml:id="_m8urKCy">This finding supports the validity of the questionnaire since it is consistent with the fact that self-quitters did not have available to them group feedback and reinforcement or instructions on behavioral techniques as did the therapy subjects.</s><s xml:id="_B3RVqH7">The Commitment Process of self-liberation was given the highest rating of importance by self-quitters and yet it has received the least attention in the therapeutic research literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Prochaska, 1979)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HxQ4pBw">Inadequate attention to the process of Self-Liberation may partially explain why self-change remains a difficult phenomenon to explain.</s></p><p xml:id="_TxthYWA"><s xml:id="_dkuSvV9">The Behavioral-Management subjects rated Counterconditioning as most important and more important than the other two groups.</s><s xml:id="_VxhVgEf">The finding is consistent with the emphasis that behavioral treatments place on Counterconditioning as an effective alternative for managing stress and anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_U9tS7zJ">The ability to manage stress and anxiety may also have been especially important for this group of subjects since they had spent more time smoking and could be considered more dependent on the habit.</s><s xml:id="_dkdc4Tu">The fact that the Aversion subjects rated Self-Liberation as most important in their success is puzzling, since aversion techniques are generally viewed as Counterconditioning and Social Management processes.</s><s xml:id="_gm2gHhh">It is possible that the large financial commitment and the ordeal of undergoing unpleasant procedures either reflected or increased the personal commitment of these subjects.</s></p><p xml:id="_Z6BThQX"><s xml:id="_Q4UsK7M">Contrary to expectation, there were no significant differences between the maintainers and recidivists on any of the change-processes.</s><s xml:id="_mRyY25R">The expectation in this study was based on the common assumption that if change processes are powerful enough to produce change they should be powerful enough to maintain change.</s><s xml:id="_u9Qgjqk">While it is possible that the model and/or the questionnaire did not identify the initial variables of cessation that relate to maintenance, the most direct interpretation suggests that there may be no intrinsic relationship between the processes involved in short-term cessation and the processes of long-term maintenance.</s><s xml:id="_FZqWhFS">This interpretation is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marlatt and Gordon's (1979)</ref> view of maintenance as a separate treatment entity and Bandura's construct self-efficacy as a separate mediator of maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bandura, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">DiClemente, 1981)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NhWhwEc">Many treatments have been able to produce short-term smoking cessation but have difficulty with long-term maintenance.</s><s xml:id="_5xNbVJt">The maintainers in this study reported that self-statements about smoking, physical activity, and active control over smoking related events were especially important in maintaining abstinence.</s><s xml:id="_UTQyqrM">Maintenance may not be maintenance after all but may really be continued change.</s></p><p xml:id="_KX87BQu"><s xml:id="_yKGhgEU">The idea that maintenance is continued change received further support from the data on periods of change.</s><s xml:id="_Fv2CETb">Subjects reported that different processes were important at different times in the course of changing.</s><s xml:id="_meUGsvv">Verbal processes were more important when the decision to change was being made.</s><s xml:id="_jhBAQJd">Behavioral processes were more important in the Active Change stage and in the initial phase of Maintenance.</s><s xml:id="_6EVYkhA">The exception to this pattern was that Self-Liberation was associated more with Active Change, as if personal commitment is not realized until action is taken.</s><s xml:id="_v6rcBAP">By integrating processes of change along a time dimension of periods of change, a more comprehensive model may be developed in which verbal and behavioral approaches both contribute to successful change.</s><s xml:id="_ZS5N38N">The verbal processes may be most important in preparing individuals for action, while the behavioral processes become more important once individuals have committed themselves to act.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
