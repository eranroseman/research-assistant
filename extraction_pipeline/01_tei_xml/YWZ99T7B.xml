preventable cause of death and disability in China and other countries.</s><s xml:id="_aKmfkNS">In 2015, it was estimated that there were 933.1 million daily smokers worldwide, and more than 6 million deaths (accounting for 11.5% of global deaths) were attributable to cigarette smoking, including at least 1 million in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_84JsWhv">Over 80% of deaths attributable to smoking were among men, and more than half of all cigarette smoking took place in 4 countries (China, India, the US, and Russia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, with China having the highest proportion of smokers, accounting for more than 40% of the world's total cigarette consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JbcEN8s">In comparison with many countries, especially European countries, smoking remains highly normalized within China, further necessitating the advancement of smoking cessation interventions for Chinese smokers.</s></p><p xml:id="_jX2mZc7"><s xml:id="_tUKVWnf">Nationwide prospective studies show that "the annual number of deaths in China that are caused by tobacco will rise from about 1 million in 2010 to 2 million in 2030 and 3 million in 2050, unless there is widespread cessation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wtkpPzB">While smoking cessation remains the single most effective prevention measure for lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the availability of smoking cessation services is extremely limited in China, and the majority of cessation attempts are not successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8s9HSsc">Insufficient smoking cessation services are an important contributing factor for the low cessation rates reported in China.</s><s xml:id="_8YEjkfK">A study conducted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Chinese cities reported that almost half of smokers would like to stop <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Dfxc4wE">However, the rate of smoking cessation among smokers in urban areas, which have the highest rate of successful quitting, was just 10% to 13% according to previous studies in 2010 and 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FVZBqUn">There is an urgent need to improve the availability and utilization of smoking cessation interventions and to reach underserved populations in China.</s></p><p xml:id="_cxu26FQ"><s xml:id="_CBHwqcs">Evidence indicates that individualized counseling can effectively assist smokers to stop smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DDXJqUQ">However, less than one-third of physicians in China believe that most smokers will follow their cessation advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and, in fact, many smokers do not receive smoking cessation advice or medications from their physicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AZydabE">Furthermore, a study showed that less than half of physicians usually ask about patients' smoking status, and less than 7% of physicians set quit dates or prescribe pharmaceutical therapies to help smokers quit <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D7mMeMD">Self-help smoking cessation materials have the potential to reach large numbers of smokers, but the effect is likely to be small <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rbnpS6T">An important unmet need in China is the dissemination of an effective smoking cessation intervention that can reach a large population regardless of social class, income, educational status, or geographic region.</s><s xml:id="_Ag7yzzW">Mobile-phone-based interventions may hold such promise.</s></p><p xml:id="_jUqTX5V"><s xml:id="_yRGTx8q">Mobile phones are widely used in China, and most of these phones are smartphones.</s><s xml:id="_ktBM9y5">By the end of 2017, the number of mobile phone subscribers had reached 1.4 billion in China (<ref type="url" target="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278204/china-mobile-users-by-month/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/278204/china-mobile-users-by-month/</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_USGNzNh">Mobile-phonebased interventions such as those employing short message service (SMS) communications have been used to intervene regarding risky behaviors, improve preventive healthcare, and promote self-management of chronic illness.</s><s xml:id="_TfctJs8">For preventive healthcare, strong evidence exists that interventions may be successfully delivered through SMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jHUvZPd">Mobile-phone-based text messaging for intervention in smoking cessation has several potential benefits, such as easy access, cost-effective delivery, independence from time and place, and the potential to help a diverse range of smokers quit, particularly those who may not otherwise have easy access to cessation services.</s></p><p xml:id="_BEHKMQy"><s xml:id="_C6WekeP">In view of a shortage of smoking cessation services in China and evidence of the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of mobile-phone-based text messaging interventions for quitting smoking from other countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, we designed a population-based, widely accessible smoking cessation program in China.</s><s xml:id="_ASKngvX">In this single-blind randomized trial of a mobile-phonebased text messaging intervention ("Happy Quit"), the primary objective was to test the effectiveness of the Happy Quit program in the general population within China.</s><s xml:id="_3bfKZVK">In particular, we were interested in testing the efficacy of Happy Quit on biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence at 24 weeks (primary outcome).</s><s xml:id="_hxsp3Su">Based on the efficacy of similar interventions in previous studies in other countries, we hypothesized that Happy Quit can be applied as a promising and innovative means to deliver smoking cessation services in China.</s><s xml:id="_UeU3sPU">Mobilephone-based text messaging

xml:id="_cwaRhj9">We identified no statistical difference in quit rate with the HFM intervention compared with the LFM intervention.</s><s xml:id="_uP8tVET">Participants in the HFM group displayed

they ranged from about 10% to more than 26% with intervention, and from less than 4% to almost 12% with no intervention.</s><s xml:id="_2gVEcDz">As noted earlier, however, smoking remains more highly normalized in China than in many other countries, and there are fewer generalized pressures to quit.</s><s xml:id="_wqWmA2E">It is interesting to note that the 7-day point prevalence cessation rate increased up to around 16 weeks and then reduced slightly in this trial.</s><s xml:id="_ctyeaWb">Other trials have reported similar patterns.</s><s xml:id="_NFCaVRH">For example, the Text2Quit program demonstrated that not smoking in the past 7 days increased in the intervention group from 30.5% at 1 month to 33.2% at 3 months and then slightly decreased to 31.7% at 6 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w424qCM">However, further studies are needed to explore the reasons for this pattern of a decreasing quit rate curve after 16 weeks: usually, with an imposed quit date, we would expect a continually increasing quit rate curve.</s></p><p xml:id="_3tmKWDp"><s xml:id="_xWRQWeH">Although the intervention resulted in a 3-fold increase in biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence at 24 weeks compared with control participants, the quit rate was relatively low.</s><s xml:id="_USbuqSF">This low quit rate is not unique to our trial; a computer-tailored smoking cessation program in Switzerland evaluated about 2 decades ago, for example, demonstrated abstinence of 5.8% in the intervention group and 2.2% in the control group (p &lt; 0.001) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_T3fuqPs">However, quit rates at the present time, on average, are relatively higher in European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where the denormalization of smoking has occurred in recent decades.</s><s xml:id="_fUjdCJa">Furthermore, the widespread practice of smoking in social networks may inhibit cessation among Chinese smokers, as not only do peers generally reinforce behaviors within networks but Chinese smokers embedded in networks of other smokers are more likely to have self-exempting beliefs that the negative effects of smoking will not befall them <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fE9adfn">Thus, because Chinese smokers inhabit a social environment that is more supportive of smoking and less supportive of cessation, it is perhaps unsurprising that they may be more resistant to individual-level intervention than smokers in other countries.</s><s xml:id="_MbT6v7G">Yet, such intervention still makes a measurable difference relative to not receiving such assistance.</s><s xml:id="_7AYUdXb">A similar smoking cessation program conducted in Turkey (also a middle-income country) showed that CO-verified sustained abstinence at 3 months was 11% in the intervention group and 5% in the control group with intention-to-treat analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k3xRMRp">Although this trial was underpowered, the available evidence suggested that its effects were similar to those of trials in other countries.</s><s xml:id="_MU4bgAQ">A systematic review of RCTs with a pooled analysis showed no evidence of between-study heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%).</s><s xml:id="_T7faE8A">This review suggested that mobile-phone-based smoking cessation interventions significantly increased biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence of smoking cessation, with no evidence of increased adverse events <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_DksKDtd"><s xml:id="_NHGgcP2">Unlike some other countries like the United Kingdom and the United States where smoking cessation programs are well established and smoking cessation medications are widely available, the limited smoking cessation services and social support in China may partly explain the low quit rate we observed.</s><s xml:id="_DfF44ZF">In a study carried out in a Guangzhou smoking cessation clinic, for example, even though some participants from the clinic asked for nicotine replacement therapy or other medications for quitting, the clinic did not provide medications, as they were not available at that time.</s><s xml:id="_7nucpH3">The point prevalence quit rate for that study at 6 months ranged from 18% to 24% during the follow-up period, which is similar to the findings in our current trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n95mwUD">Furthermore, the advice from primary care providers on quitting smoking currently may not have a strong impact on Chinese smokers' quitting or future intention to quit <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, but visiting a healthcare provider still has the potential to enhance attempts to quit smoking and promote abstinence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3sseEE5">Substantial work remains to be accomplished to assess the smoking cessation services provided by health professionals and quit rates in China.</s></p><p xml:id="_cYC5bR4"><s xml:id="_xQcHJ7v">The strengths of this trial include its large sample size from China and a particularly rigorous measure of abstinence with both self-reported response and biochemical verification, which is often considered the "gold standard" in validation studies.</s><s xml:id="_298WEUZ">Furthermore, as far as we are aware, our trial represents the first RCT of a text messaging intervention for smoking cessation in China with long-term follow-up and biochemical confirmation for self-reported quitters.</s><s xml:id="_FbvP3n8">In addition, demographic data and smoking characteristics were evenly matched across groups.</s></p><p xml:id="_AXHXgtg"><s xml:id="_9CnvNGB">This trial has some limitations, however.</s><s xml:id="_KtY6mBZ">One limitation is that we could not prevent participants from using other smoking cessation services, although very few participants reported using them.</s><s xml:id="_NChHgbt">Given the shortage of smoking cessation services in China, this may not be unusual.</s><s xml:id="_8QXDrGQ">In China, male physicians tend to have a high smoking prevalence, and very few of them are former smokers.</s><s xml:id="_bt7y6gg">Also, standard smoking cessation tools and treatments are rarely provided by healthcare service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NSRHfPp">Because the availability of smoking cessation training programs in China is extremely limited, most cessation attempts end in relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zFRDf3R">Additionally, cotinine tests can only detect smoking status for a few days; thus, we sent several samples to self-reported quitters and required them to test at least twice between reporting days, and confirmed that the participant took the test via their significant other.</s><s xml:id="_ETFtnMM">We only evaluated the efficacy of the text messaging intervention for smoking cessation; studies are needed that compare the Happy Quit program to other established smoking cessation treatments, including hospital smoking cessation units, which are currently in use but with few clients in China.</s><s xml:id="_8YbSTzH">Although the Happy Quit program showed similar effects for younger and older adults, it is possible that the text messaging intervention may have a smaller effect for some underserved populations, such as HIV-positive or drug-using smokers.</s><s xml:id="_hFcn23A">Yet, a randomized trial from the US displayed no long-term treatment effect for HIV-positive smokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BGWXgFJ">Upon completion of the intervention trial, we offered the Happy Quit program booklet to all participants, but we do not know whether smokers in the control group who received the quit booklet after the trial also increased their quit rate afterwards.</s><s xml:id="_zfC6RYn">A previous study showed similar quit rates for participants with either the text messaging intervention or the quit booklet only <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PpxVvBt">By the end of our trial, the intervention groups had lower follow-up rates than the control group (83.2% of the HFM group, 74.6% of the LFM group, and 87.1% of the control group completed the study).</s><s xml:id="_zQeW79j">Another limitation is the small proportion of quitters in this study.</s><s xml:id="_ahDvArM">The relatively low quit rate might be a result of a shortage of other smoking cessation services in China; the challenging social context, in which behaviors of family members, friends, colleagues, and even health professionals may discourage smokers from quitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>; and the cultural norm of giving and sharing cigarettes in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XuAEEcQ">Additionally, the participant recruitment for this trial did not meet the anticipated target sample size as specified in the protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SyMM2ca">Nonetheless, based on our primary outcome (6.5% biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 24 weeks in the HFM group and 1.9% in the control group) and a 5% 2-sided type I error rate, a power of 80% requires a sample size of 610 and a power of 90% requires a sample size of 1,010.</s><s xml:id="_QASQppx">Thus, the sample size in the current trial should be considered reasonable.</s><s xml:id="_fn92vYq">However, large-scale high-quality trials of the effects of optimized text message interventions on smoking cessation in different
