cognitive decline and dementia.</s><s xml:id="_SBaNSyD">Cognitive impairment encompasses a broad spectrum of syndromes characterized by persistent deterioration in cognitive function, which ultimately leads to a decline in daily living and working abilities, along with behavioral changes, placing a substantial burden on patients, families, and society.</s><s xml:id="_uNxFps7">Globally, 43.8 million people were living with Alzheimer disease and related dementias in 2016, and this number may increase to 152 million by 2025 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, with the associated economic burden estimated at US $2.8 trillion in 2019 and projected to exceed US $4.7 trillion by 2030 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mQF5QKb">As the condition progresses, patients increasingly rely on informal caregivers, who face not only physical and emotional stress but also financial strain, including reduced work hours and income loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jDVJSyy">These trends underscore an urgent need for scalable, innovative, and cost-effective solutions to support

integration.</s><s xml:id="_SgUnXs2">While recent literature offers valuable insights into the clinical efficacy and application scenarios of specific CDTx, ranging from randomized controlled trials of cognitive training for older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, home-based digital interventions for patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and meta-analyses of computerized cognitive training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, to reviews on digital support for patients, caregivers, and health care professionals <ref type="bibr"

technological innovation with the practical realities of cognitive care remains limited.</s><s xml:id="_f3QySNB">Most existing studies focus on isolated interventions, lacking a structured perspective that addresses both the challenges and prospects of implementing DTx in this field.</s><s xml:id="_apDUKH9">This absence of a comprehensive perspective leaves a critical gap in understanding how to scale innovation, address real-world barriers, and fully realize the potential of CDTx in routine clinical practice.</s></p><p xml:id="_SbC7jSE"><s xml:id="_ekFg9TK">This study aims to explore the current landscape of CDTx by synthesizing published literature and our clinical experiences on recent innovations and critically assessing the challenges that limit their broader integration into health care systems.</s><s xml:id="_7yNvJ5b">Through this perspective, we aim to provide timely, actionable insights for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers working to advance cognitive care.</s><s xml:id="_UvbRBdZ">Ultimately, we underscore the potential of DTx to promote healthy aging and improve cognitive outcomes for aging populations worldwide.</s><s xml:id="_QQ7Nkv7">This study
