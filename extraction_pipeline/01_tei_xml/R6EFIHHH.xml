<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_TaP3TS7">Strengths and limitations of our framework</head><p xml:id="_Qj5PQ69"><s xml:id="_JupMwwm">Situated in the conceptual areas of patient engagement frameworks and health innovation design, A Generative Co-Design Framework for Healthcare Innovation offers a method for research teams focused on engagement of end-users in creative innovation design work.</s><s xml:id="_A3tCWTh">One of the strengths of this framework is the emphasis on engagement of end-users, including patient partners and other stakeholders, as a vital component of designing relevant, acceptable, useable health innovations.</s><s xml:id="_9qdcEpw">Use of co-design strategies for healthcare innovation includes the lived experiences of end-users in research, generates ideas for patient-focused service improvements, empowers the included groups, and tailors interventions to end-user requirements thus increasing the likelihood of their adoption and integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xFHRbY4">Successful examples of co-design have been demonstrated in existing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, wherein strategies such as patient journeymapping, experience-based surveys, and workshops have been utilized to improve end-user adoption and integration of program services.</s></p><p xml:id="_SawSSw3"><s xml:id="_PcZqYr9">Another highlight of this framework is the emphasis on the incorporation of creative strategies for idea generation, while allowing for flexibility for research teams to customize these creative strategies to their needs.</s><s xml:id="_ssZR6qB">The ability to generate many alternative solutions to a problem, to approach problems with an open mind, and to tolerate ambiguity and persist in seeking novel solutions with merit are all attributes of individuals' creative personalities that strongly affect the likelihood of successful innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Hb5QKFS">Thus, the central place of creative strategies within A Framework for Healthcare Innovation is a key strength in its construction as a tool for health innovation.</s></p><p xml:id="_ys2CZyn"><s xml:id="_qbU3dW5">Additionally, there are some limitations of the framework that must be considered.</s><s xml:id="_JrRydTp">The first is that our framework relies on the in-depth participation of key end-users to shape the future state of care, which may result in an over-reliance on the perspectives of a dedicated group of few end-users, who may not be representative of the larger population of interest.</s><s xml:id="_CDKZ6aR">In combating this limitation, healthcare innovation teams may want to consider selecting a diverse array of end-users to participate, including those working in diverse roles, from differing age, cultural, and gender identities, and with varying years of professional experience, in order to make the application of the framework more generalizable.</s><s xml:id="_kV7FAES">While highly contextualized and intimate personal knowledge that comes from individual endusers is key to the creation of a useable healthcare innovation, these needs must be balanced against the creation of an innovation that will be applicable beyond a small group.</s></p><p xml:id="_BTQY5A9"><s xml:id="_CCvK6HZ">A second potential limitation of our Framework is that some end-users may have concerns about speaking up around personal challenges encountered in the current system.</s><s xml:id="_Et8uZH9">End-users are often highly entrenched in the system which they are being asked to critique during codesign, creating the potential for them to approach codesign in an overly cautious manner.</s><s xml:id="_y2wnu8v">In healthcare settings, fear of retaliation is a well-known barrier to speaking up with critiques of the healthcare system or context in which individuals work <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dS6A3My">To confront this potential limitation, healthcare innovation teams are encouraged to invest time in establishing trusting relationships with participants and maintaining an environment of openness and acceptance during co-design.</s><s xml:id="_nRQ5af3">Some potential strategies to accomplish this are informal individual meetings with participants before co-design, as well as team building exercises such as those described under the 'Framing the Issue' step.</s></p><p xml:id="_BddYPSf"><s xml:id="_mxnn9SY">Finally, we acknowledge that the co-design process described within our framework is time-and labourintensive.</s><s xml:id="_DD9sYSc">In the context of healthcare innovation, we appreciate that many innovation projects are undertaken by clinicians, quality improvement specialists, and researchers who are already pressed for time and resources.</s><s xml:id="_ARcB7pf">However, we have demonstrated that the actual co-design engagement from participants can be successfully undertaken in a single day, with the proper preparations being taken during the Pre-Design phase.</s><s xml:id="_HBUHdtj">This is in contrast to other methodologies such as Experience-Based Co-Design, in which engagement sessions are typically run over multiple days.</s><s xml:id="_C3uccYe">Therefore, for teams in which engaging co-design participants over multiple sessions may be difficult, our framework may offer an advantageous alternative to others.</s></p></div>
