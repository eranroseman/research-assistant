responses.</s><s xml:id="_uQJmxWf">Fear appeals, that is, the use of persuasive messages to stimulate fear based on harmful outcomes that are associated with dangerous lifestyle practices, have been used extensively for more than 60 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ANMbH2r">Perhaps not surprisingly, they have been found to be

health-related interventions.</s><s xml:id="_hCjjXtE">This model posits that an individual's willingness to make behavioral changes is driven by his or her readiness to change.</s><s xml:id="_NmFzQEW">Stages of readiness are described as precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance, with relapse to prior unhealthy behaviors possible between the action and maintenance stages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_fNemj5R"><s xml:id="_GkfZepP">This type of approach aims to empower an individual via education and introspection to create a positive feedback loop as behaviors are changed over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DVMhrsj">For AD prevention, this TTM approach would be performed by educating an individual on specific behaviors, having the individual introspectively assess his or her own behaviors, and setting attainable future goals to target change.</s><s xml:id="_hzAUE22">On completion of these goals, the individuals are affirmed of their efforts and subsequently reevaluate their goals, thus creating a positive feedback loop.</s></p><p xml:id="_bEwanmg"><s xml:id="_xwnB5tZ">Using such an approach in a health care intervention would rely heavily on the ability to personalize the education material and the ability to set attainable goals.</s><s xml:id="_SeCHfUy">To achieve such an intervention in the physical world, using people, buildings, and paper, would require enormous resources and planning.</s><s xml:id="_xJAbsQY">Fortunately, Internet-based technologies can reduce this burden, by digitally delivering intervention material.</s></p><p xml:id="_PKxePNG"><s xml:id="_2CBhkJc">Mobile and
