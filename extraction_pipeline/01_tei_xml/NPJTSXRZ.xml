unintentional non-adherence is the result of other factors such as forgetfulness, misunderstanding of medication regimens, access to medication, or language barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Z7gCvgR"><s xml:id="_ZgQb4xA">Elderly patients' medication adherence is a major challenge in health care.</s><s xml:id="_e7rTJr7">The elderly routinely uses medications to enhance their quality of life, increase their life expectancy, and treat or prevent disease.</s><s xml:id="_37XKaKu">However, it is apparent that elderly people frequently do not really take their prescriptions as prescribed, which has unfavorable clinical and financial effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Zd5dy9v">The elderly are more likely to suffer from many comorbidities;

apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) in the real-world setting also revealed that around one-third of patients were non-adherent (MPR 80%), which was related to an increased risk of stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_9JtFEBA"><s xml:id="_G37C4eh">Several strategies have been developed to improve or maintain patient medication adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6AtSxHz">Patients can use compensation strategies or technology-based strategies.</s><s xml:id="_3nR8gEF">Compensation strategies are typically used proactively to prevent or delay loss of function, and in some situations, they may also serve as an enhanced version of established routines (e.g., organizational habits).</s><s xml:id="_yddJRta">The use of a compensation strategy can occur in older adults because of both normal cognitive aging and a neurodegenerative condition that is progressing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DxUtndy">Additionally, technology is starting to be used to enhance adherence.</s><s xml:id="_KywwZQs">Digital interventions for behavior change show potential in studies with current evidence for persons living with chronic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Yr6Kcm6">Utilizing portable digital devices, mobile health (mHealth) has evolved as a strategy to enhance the implementation of evidence-based medicine and assist public health.</s><s xml:id="_34TWFhS">It has been investigated whether using this medium can increase treatment adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_s8cmNv9"><s xml:id="_zwKK3Zz">Patients can use a range of adherence aids to help them remember dose times and organize their prescriptions (e.g., medication boxes, alarms) or technology-based strategies.</s><s xml:id="_UjN84E4">External memory aids, conspicuous locations, and association strategies were all frequently recommended methods, indicating that older persons try to compensate for memory loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zk3Guh7">Most published studies have focused more on patient adherence, and few have simultaneously assessed the strategies to maintain or improve patient adherence, particularly in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_vCXANx3">A prior systematic review conducted by <ref type="bibr">Elizabeth et al. (2009)</ref> explored strategies to optimize medication adherence in older adults; however, the results of this review focused entirely on interventional education strategies and memory aids and cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GrD2AVu">Chun-Yun Kang (2022) also conducted a systematic review that examined the effectiveness of technology-based intervention in boosting adherence to taking antihypertensive medication.</s><s xml:id="_xuYep4g">Technology-based interventions reportedly boosted adherence, according to this systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jMhkTMA">However, this systematic review only addressed technological approaches to managing hypertension medication adherence, whereas our systematic review concentrates primarily on older adults and the strategies adopted by the elderly to maintain and enhance their medication adherence.</s><s xml:id="_fWznpHk">The authors were interested in conducting a comprehensive review of compensation and technology-mediated strategies to maintain older adults' medication adherence to fill this gap.</s><s xml:id="_uVKS9hD">This review examines current strategies for maintaining older adults' medication adherence, especially compensation and technology-mediated strategies.</s><s xml:id="_4BDNZTJ">This review sought to answer the following two questions:</s></p><p xml:id="_HEDtNwX"><s xml:id="_VreRU82">(1) What compensation strategies could the elderly utilize to maintain or improve their medication adherence?</s><s xml:id="_VDBtcUW">(2) What technology-mediated strategies could the elderly utilize to maintain or improve their medication adherence?</s></p></div>
