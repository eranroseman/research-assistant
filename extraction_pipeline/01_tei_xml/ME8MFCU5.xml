and nowadays, out of every three individuals affected by diabetes, one lives in a rural setting (176 million) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wxarYJA">Rural populations face many challenges that can prevent better glycemic control, such as geographic isolation, health worker shortages, and lower health spending compared to urban populations <ref type="bibr"

and investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DpYTGWr">In the United States, studies showed that there is a 17% higher prevalence of diabetes in rural areas compared to urban areas, with poorer outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_fNqHBJj">The elevated prevalence of diabetes positions it as the third most critical rural health priority in 2020.</s><s xml:id="_7ndxzNB">While

education of HCPs, all in the interests of progressing the health of individuals and their communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EQPrfHw">It also includes remote
