observation and evaluation of EID completion rates at control facilities could have resulted in bias towards higher EID at control facilities and a null effect of the trial.</s><s xml:id="_hknnUxe">In addition, some facilities in the control condition had been part of a pilot implementation of the intervention prior to the effectiveness study.</s><s xml:id="_qbg3yTY">This limitation was mitigated,

addition, all health facilities that provide HIV services in this region also receive considerable support from HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs.</s><s xml:id="_yHsc5tQ">The high HIV prevalence as well as presumably higher level of care than at facilities not receiving external support could reduce the generalizability of our findings to areas with low HIV prevalence or to clinics outside this region that may not receive external support for HIV services.</s><s xml:id="_XjUtFvH">Finally, it was not possible to distinguish a real secular trend from an apparent trend caused by improvement in the intervention over time with this study design.</s><s xml:id="_mwZDW24">To examine this effect directly would have required a third control arm that did not receive the intervention during the entire course of the trial.</s><s xml:id="_F6M8sfd">Importantly, our secondary analyses revealed an increase in infant testing and maternal retention in the clusters that received the intervention in both time periods (although this increase is less than the intervention effect).</s><s xml:id="_njKMbkq">This could represent a true secular trend over time that would have occurred even if there was no intervention (i.e., improvement in outcomes in the broader community from which the clinics were drawn, completely independent of the intervention).</s><s xml:id="_Xb2Qenf">The increases in infant testing and maternal retention in the facilities that were randomized to receive the intervention in both time periods could also be due to improvement over time in the intervention effect (i.e., a learning effect whereby improvement occurs with prolonged use and gain in experience).</s></p><p xml:id="_zzpJ4vV"><s xml:id="_UKgexUn">Koepsell and colleagues note that interventions that show improvement in efficacy trials do not always yield the same results when tested more broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_csh7d8R">An instructive example is the failure to replicate "model" substance abuse programs in the real world, despite evidence of efficacy from smaller randomized trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4uu7ugc">To our knowledge, our study is the first in the field of implementation science for HIV to demonstrate the feasibility (and pitfalls) of moving an evidence-based mHealth intervention from the controlled environment of a randomized trial to the complex real world of implementation to achieve "relevance without sacrificing rigor," as recently articulated in an Editorial in PLOS Medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_f4xd6YY">Our study highlights the importance of conducting effectiveness studies as part of the continuum of implementation to confirm that efficacy trial results can be replicated with fidelity under complex real-world contexts.</s><s xml:id="_quw6pgQ">The low cost of this intervention makes it a "low-hanging fruit" that PMTCT programs globally could easily adopt and disseminate more broadly.</s><s xml:id="_94PUQUc">For example, a single nurse in the present trial's study team performed tasks essential to intervention delivery, including responding to phone calls and messages from women receiving the intervention, calling women to determine delivery status, and training mentor mothers.</s><s xml:id="_DbvCSfz">The cost of incoming and outgoing text messages and calls was approximately 25 Kenya shillings per woman (approximately 0.25 USD) over the entire study period.</s><s xml:id="_bX4ZjXm">Initial setup costs were estimated at about USD 7,000 and included the costs of setting up and hosting the automated text messaging software, training sessions for mentor mothers, buying phones for each of the study sites, and providing mobile phone connectivity for data transmission between study sites and the central "server" phone.</s></p><p xml:id="_gQstgT5"><s xml:id="_JMaHC54">Notably, while the P values reported for the primary analyses in this pragmatic effectiveness trial do not meet the conventional significance threshold of 0.05, there may be value in considering the results in their totality, with attention to the 95% CIs and to the evidence from the earlier efficacy trial.</s><s xml:id="_xfvpc8V">For example, the 95% CIs around the aRRs range from a 3% decreased probability to a 10% increased probability of infant HIV testing, and from a 3% decreased probability to a 30% increased probability of being retained in care.</s><s xml:id="_Q55vcKw">In the context of this pragmatic implementation trial of a low-risk and low-cost intervention that was previously shown to be significantly efficacious, it may be most appropriate to interpret these results based on the extent to which the data are compatible or incompatible with an effect similar to that observed in the earlier trial.</s></p><p xml:id="_JRpMKss"><s xml:id="_9gd6W3b">In the context of conducting pragmatic implementation research, this study illustrates the difficulty of evaluating intervention effectiveness against a backdrop of what may already be an improving system.</s><s xml:id="_CKDETzr">Ongoing programmatic efforts to improve retention in PMTCT likely contributed to the rise in background retention rates that were observed in this pragmatic implementation effectiveness trial compared to our earlier efficacy trial of the TextIT intervention.</s><s xml:id="_WxMrkkM">Within the FACES program, these included a series of "rapid results initiative" interventions to improve uptake of PMTCT services through simple but intensive strengthening of existing health systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, integration of PMTCT services with antenatal care <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and initiatives to increase male partner involvement in PMTCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aXRtY38">What remains unknown is how the intervention would have performed in a setting that started out with low infant testing and maternal retention rates.</s><s xml:id="_mSnHpew">Under such conditions, it might be worth considering having a control group that does not receive the intervention during analysis, and could still receive the intervention after analysis, especially if there is a chance that the system is improving independent of the intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_cBhvfuK"><s xml:id="_Gj75esp">The high rates of EID during the control period in the delayed intervention arm in this study provide indirect evidence that simple improvements in service delivery (such as staff awareness of monitoring) could increase EID rates substantially.</s><s xml:id="_7U9QqE6">Despite the lack of a significant effect of the intervention on EID rates and maternal retention in this study, key lessons have emerged, both for strengthening efforts to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission and for implementation research more generally.</s><s xml:id="_kgYz2hR">Perhaps most important, improving implementation during the control period in delayed intervention facilities, primarily through staff awareness of monitoring, was sufficient to substantially improve infant HIV testing rates.</s><s xml:id="_f2zwpne">Our earlier efficacy study showed that under ideal conditions, text messages could have a benefit beyond good service delivery.</s><s xml:id="_SZQBmJH">In contrast, the present study showed that in a realworld setting, most of the benefit was probably from the basic improvements created by monitoring.</s><s xml:id="_Wc2ezVB">Nonetheless, we feel that this intervention could be important in the context of both low and high rates of EID and maternal follow-up in PMTCT.</s><s xml:id="_VcWvaY3">In both contexts, it would likely be implemented along with other ongoing programmatic activities designed to improve delivery of existing services.</s><s xml:id="_C4CYmVK">In settings in which EID and maternal follow-up outcomes are poor, the observed effect of TextIT is likely to be larger.</s><s xml:id="_XNhhArX">In settings in which EID and maternal follow-up outcomes are already improving, TextIT may provide the boost needed to reach the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig
