motivational strategies, such as feedback, health literacy, reminders, and motivational messages, goal-setting, social interaction, gamification, and rewards can improve patient adherence to self-care behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_4KQH32A">However, their effectiveness relies on theoretical grounding, data-driven features, and personalization.</s><s xml:id="_FrmmY4b">Future research should prioritize

<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_4HeBHFU">Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are two of the most common chronic diseases due to their high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Bdp2nTX">CVDs refer to heart and blood vessel disorders, which are chronic physical diseases that evolve gradually over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , which can lead to heart failure, stroke, and sudden death <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_ccrUBU4">DM is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Ys5eYjW">It damages many body systems,

enhancing clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_xx2Dtud">According to the middle range theory of self-care of chronic Illness, self-care is defined as "a process of maintaining health through health promoting practices and managing illness," which encompasses three key elements: maintenance, monitoring, and management <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_eXMRghz">Maintenance refers to adherence to behaviors for maintaining physical and emotional stability; monitoring means observing changes in signs and symptoms; management requires

target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_upcEPpz">RMTs commonly use two approaches to data collection: active and passive.</s><s xml:id="_vjWNEcs">Active RMTs require users to actively input data, which include subjective measures like mood and pain, and behavioral data, such as medication adherence and alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_4uxPAub">Passive RMTs automatically collect information from users through device-embedded sensors, tracking metrics, such as heart rate, skin conductance, step count, and activity levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_V5BQPSq"><s xml:id="_tWGuXGu">Successful RMT-based digital interventions require patients to adhere to active data collection, which requires user effort and accurate selfreporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_2xhzN7v">While RMTs can offer valuable feedback and support in acquiring health behavior information and skills, patients often face challenges in maintaining motivation over time to use RMTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_EKZUBCT">According to the information-motivation-behavioral (IMB) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , motivation (personal and social) is a key determinant of adherence behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_EyqYA7F">The declining motivation can directly reduce patients' adherence to RMTs, decreasing the effectiveness of overall self-care outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_znRJxTw">Therefore, understanding and addressing motivational factors is important for enhancing the efficacy of RMTs and supporting sustained self-care.</s></p><p xml:id="_9t92GsT"><s xml:id="_XS8UHB4">Furthermore, how patients interact with and interpret health data collected from RMTs can significantly impact the patients' motivation to use RMTs and their adherence to self-care <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_v4mmhDY">Data is not merely a fact but requires thoughtful engagement to be meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_QTWGZ2M">Recent studies have focused on facilitating patients' understanding and utilization of their health data through various methods, such as data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> and AI-driven chatbots <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_cTcSuTA">Beyond these methods, the design of data presentation in RMTs can also impact motivation.</s><s xml:id="_6aHtU6K">For example, in study <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , virtual crowns and trophies were used as rewards to recognize users when they achieved specific goals aimed at boosting motivation.</s><s xml:id="_HV8AQ4D">However, it remains unclear which motivational strategies are employed and how these strategies affect longterm adherence to self-care.</s></p><p xml:id="_cxjByq8"><s xml:id="_tkNSCDr">Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to assess the current breadth of evidence on the use of motivational strategies within digital intervention to promote self-care adherence among patients with CVD or DM.</s><s xml:id="_9rRRQ8G">This review specifically aims to (1) examine the types of RMTs used, (2) identify the motivational strategies and associated theories employed, (3)  inventory the design of data presentation implemented in these RMTs, and (4) assess how adherence outcomes were evaluated and reported.</s><s xml:id="_Zd9GvE5">To our knowledge, the only review that has explored motivational strategies to increase participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation was recently published by ref. 34.</s><s xml:id="_PrX4CUd">However, this work did not examine self-care adherence but rather focused on content like motivational interviewing and counseling delivered by healthcare professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_ayC8r7s">Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> on quantifying the quantified self-focused on understanding patients' motivations for self-tracking health data.</s><s xml:id="_bnNWAqP">However, it did not identify specific motivational strategies that could be integrated into health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_2VNjyUd">Moreover, previous studies on adherence have generally focused on RMTs addressing specific behaviors or activities within self-care.</s><s xml:id="_WYTE7C9">For instance, one study evaluated the effectiveness of app-based interventions in improving medication adherence in CVDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_txxEMq6">Another review focused exclusively on wearable activity tracker-based interventions aimed at improving adherence to physical activity and health outcomes in chronic disease contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_v6PdBQw">Considering these limitations in the scope of previous reviews, the increasing amount of research on RMTs, and the importance of motivation for sustained adherence to self-care practices, there is a need for an up-todate and comprehensive systematic review.</s></p><p xml:id="_pgYBT6A"><s xml:id="_xw5q2Xt">This systematic review summarizes the research on motivational strategies in digital interventions from 2004 to 2024.</s><s xml:id="_fqQT6Wq">A comprehensive search across four electronic databases yielded 17 studies for inclusion.</s><s xml:id="_a3eagFs">The included studies are analyzed from the perspective of the types of RMTs, the motivational strategies and theories applied, the data presentation designs, and the evaluation methods for patient adherence.</s><s xml:id="_GqMakkH">This review reveals that while various strategies and designs have been employed to motivate patient adherence to self-care, challenges remain in the research and development of digital interventions.</s><s xml:id="_pU8mX6p">Insights from this review contribute to the growing field of health information technology, particularly in how digital tools like RMTs can enhance chronic disease management.</s><s xml:id="_xdH4f77">By integrating motivational strategies into self-management systems, these technologies can improve healthcare delivery.</s><s xml:id="_F2bEZZX">This knowledge may inform the design of health information technologies, such as remote monitoring tools and selfmanagement platforms, to improve patient engagement, adherence, and health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_A7VmNqc">This review also highlights areas for improvement, emphasizing the need to
