<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_phFtHHB">Theoretical background</head><p xml:id="_3TAKu9K"><s xml:id="_76Zvevp">The SROI model was initially developed by the REDF in 1996 as a tool to evaluate capital grant requests made by organizations belonging to the REDF's philanthropic portfolio.</s><s xml:id="_uVsbtvd">The rationale behind REDF's willingness to assess their resources' impact was to evaluate how much people's lives were improving in reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gair, 2002)</ref> and simultaneously, broaden the traditional concept of financial return by enclosing "who" the return was linked to and including all the elements contributing to the production of the return.</s></p><p xml:id="_4fCXvEe"><s xml:id="_pCNXnND">Since its first application, SROI has been gradually modified and integrated with principles and processes usually applied to economic and financial assessments (e.g. return on investment).</s><s xml:id="_bzn4VxZ">It aims to assess an intervention under social, economic and environmental points of view, known as the triple bottom line <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Norman and MacDonald, 2004)</ref>, as each investment has to yield social, economic and environmental returns to create blended value <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Emerson, 2003)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZTuezCF">Moreover, REDF tried to overcome the barriers that nonprofit organizations had experienced for years in assessing nonmonetizable social results, by translating social results into dollars by developing the index of return, which is expressed as the ratio of the estimated value of benefits to the value of the estimated investment required to generate those benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gair, 2002)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_4ShsRcW"><s xml:id="_S8zcPW7">The SROI model was developed and structured as a specific blended value-accounting method.</s><s xml:id="_FJQxkRj">First promoted in the nonprofit world and second in academia as an impact assessment tool, it has been defined as a framework for measuring and accounting for the much broader concept of value.</s><s xml:id="_rKFxkUh">It seeks to reduce inequality and environmental degradation and improve well-being by incorporating social, environmental and economic costs and benefits <ref type="bibr">(Nicholls and Murdock, 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JKhfarU">The first step of the SROI process includes the calculation of the SROI ratio, which is the numerical relationship between monetized benefits and investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Faivel et al., 2012)</ref> or according to Klemelä, a "pseudo-financial parameter" (2016, p. 387).</s><s xml:id="_62Z7USt">For instance, a ratio of 4:1 indicates that an investment of $1 produces a social value of $4.</s><s xml:id="_XEBYe3P">However, even though the pursuit of a single digit as a summary of the social value created has been overemphasized among the potential results obtained from the SROI analysis, this model is not intended to be one sided and reductive <ref type="bibr">(Klemelä, 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fGGvU8d">Table <ref type="table">1</ref> provides an executive summary of an SROI report to better present the information analyzed through this methodology.</s></p><p xml:id="_8B2PeR2"><s xml:id="_Ka2nhMB">The SROI analysis can target either a specific program or an entire organization in two different directions: evaluative and forecasting.</s><s xml:id="_fQ89RfA">While the former is conducted retrospectively on outcomes that have already occurred, whose information comes from the organization's management systems, the latter aims to predict how much social value will be created if the activities meet their intended outcomes with information that should stem from an estimation of the organization's experience, data from previous years and research based on other people's experiences <ref type="bibr">(Mook et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2012, p. 8)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CkEQNaC"><s xml:id="_TVuGcnw">In pursuing the twofold aim of proving and improving <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arvidson et al., 2010)</ref>, SROI has spread worldwide since its first discovery in the USA, with different improvements occurring throughout the years.</s><s xml:id="_Hqq6dUJ">As part of an ongoing process, further advancements of the SROI model were proposed by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) in London and a new version was applied to social enterprises (SEs) throughout the UK with support from the Hadley Trust.</s><s xml:id="_3dPzarP">One of the guiding principles that drove the expansion of the SROI model was to extend its usage as much as possible by including organizations with limited resources and integrating SROI with social accounting methods.</s><s xml:id="_CyeJcxq">Consequently, two reports were produced by the NEF as guidelines for the correct implementation of the SROI model (NEF (New Economic Foundation), 2007, 2008).</s><s xml:id="_pX26NSX">In the second edition of the guidelines, Measuring Real Value: a DIY guide to Social Return on Investment, NEF decreased the number of procedural steps, standardized them, provided more knowledge through increasing assistance for organizations willing to implement the model and developed reliable impact indicators and financial proxies whose scarce availability is highlighted as one of the crucial barriers in the SROI analysis <ref type="bibr">(Higham et</ref> al., 2018; Lophongpanit et al., 2019; Murzaliyeva et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2018) leading to what Cooney defines as the "illusion of precision" (2017).</s><s xml:id="_fjbPpB2">Consequently, the choice of financial proxies becomes entirely subjective, compromising the reliability of the model (Gibbon and Dey, 2011; Lingane and Olsen, 2004; Mook et al., 2015).</s></p></div>

conducted by the consortium of the SROI network, comprising the NEF, Charities Evaluation Services, the National Council for Voluntary Organizations and New Philanthropy Capital, aimed at measuring social value.</s><s xml:id="_WkZjrPY">Consequently, A Guide to Social Return on Investment was published by the Office of the Third Sector in the Cabinet Office in 2009 (Nicholls et al., 2009) and a revised version was published three years later (Nicholls et al., 2012).</s><s xml:id="_rcMZkdm">Furthermore, to support practitioners in the implementation of the SROI model, the Social Impact Analysis Association was established in the UK in 2011, and four years later, it merged with the SROI Network in a new organization known as Social Value International (SVI), which represented the governing body of the UK national networks.</s><s xml:id="_5NPmway">SVI developed a principle-based approach comprising seven principles of social value (The SROI Network, 2015): involve stakeholders, understand change, do not overclaim, only include what is material, value what matters, be transparent and verify the result.</s><s xml:id="_cYKCCjc">The implementation of these guiding principles

the blended value proposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Emerson, 2003)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3Pfyn9R">Therefore, the SROI soon became the applicative principle of the blended value theory,

studies by scaling the units of analysis, typically projects and/or organizations, toward value chains and ecosystems.</s><s xml:id="_RrdfRhC">Regarding the use of SROI as a signal, it is crucial not only to focus on the technical issue of calculation but also rather to direct the attention toward the relationships that this signal is able to represent.</s><s xml:id="_YtQ7Sns">The key issue is related to the role that the SROI might play within value chains and multistakeholder ecosystems as a common signal that works as "mediating technology" (Puyou and Quattrone, 2019) among the different actors.</s><s xml:id="_ytz9pU7">SROI has increasingly been used within impact investing and impact finance contexts where the presence of different types of stakeholders (public administration, profit

same type of information regarding the economic, social and environmental values generated by organizations, activities and programs.</s><s xml:id="_KnPHVHU">A few steps have been taken in this direction at the international level, such as the Data Stewards Network <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> initiative promoted by the GovLab and the Rockefeller Foundation that aims at opening the public and

directions.</s><s xml:id="_MrqMNkh">Indeed, the overall results showed that academia has definitely been moving forward in the development of SROI, confirming what Arvidson and Lyon stated in their
