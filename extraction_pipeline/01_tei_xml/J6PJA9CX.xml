[1þ(m-1) ICC] where m is the cluster size (assumed constant across all clusters) and the ICC represents the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), that is the correlation between two randomly chosen observations in the same cluster. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s xml:id="_QSeCWCa">This implies an exchangeable or compound symmetry

become more complex when the measurements are taken at more than a single point in time.</s><s xml:id="_xYmNXVF">There are various ways of parameterizing these correlations.</s><s xml:id="_qNTwMEG">One common method, used in multiple-period designs, is to distinguish the within-period ICC (which measures the correlation between any two observations from the same cluster in the same measurement period) from the between-period ICC (which measures the correlation between any two observations from the same cluster but in different measurement periods). <ref type="bibr"

within-period and between-period ICC (equivalently a common between-period CAC), referred to henceforth as a two-period correlation structure, is intuitive in studies where there are two periods, such as a two-period crossover design or a parallel design with a baseline measurement, but may be less intuitive in a design with more than two periods.</s><s xml:id="_cdY97a5">However, the two-period correlation structure has also been advocated in study designs with more than two-periods, such as the SW-CRT and the multipleperiod cluster randomized cross-over design. <ref type="bibr"

after measures, the two-period CRXO, the multiple-period CRXO and the SW-CRT design, among others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_Fpw3THA">These design effects are a function of the cluster size per period (not to be confused with the total cluster size), the number of sequences (in the SW-CRT) and the correlation between repeated measurements on the same clusters and possibly the same participants (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_MX5nJe2">All design effects assume an equal number of clusters allocated to each arm or sequence. <ref

ICC and a common between-period CAC may not be realistic: the CAC may depend on the length of time between periods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_jCfqWw7">ntuitively, the between-period ICC for two temporally adjacent periods is generally expected to be larger than for two periods further apart in time.</s><s xml:id="_TuwTZPt">Thus, instead of one between-period ICC, there could potentially be one for each pair of periods within a cluster.</s><s xml:id="_W9TGraN">Several possible extended correlation structures can be defined: the most general requiring only that the entire within-cluster correlation matrix be positive definite.</s><s xml:id="_cZfZDTp">The simplest of these correlation structures, and the one that we consider here, supposes that the CAC decays exponentially as a function of the distance between two periods.</s><s xml:id="_F83Yg38">We call this a discrete time decay correlation structure.</s><s xml:id="_eSbbXxT">For example, the CAC for two periods 'j' periods apart in a study would be the CAC for temporally adjacent periods to the power of j.</s><s xml:id="_3fnw3dv">The power of studies for this discrete time decay correlation structure can be determined by numerically inverting matrices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_KCFQqMX">These more complicated correlation structures might also be of importance for parallel CRTs where the observations are measured at anything other than a single cross-section (see Example 1 below; and, Supplementary Appendix 2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online for an illustration of this). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_jSECT7v">inally, where the study involves repeated measurements on the same participants over time, the individual

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_CT2qcRS">Strengths and limitations</head><p xml:id="_E3SnYU4"><s xml:id="_vvajSaX">The methodology considered here makes some assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_4fh6VA9">First, the methodology used uses large-sample normal approximations and, for binary and count outcomes, approximates the variances of a difference between two proportions/counts.</s><s xml:id="_SBRnqBs">These approximations might break down when there are low proportions/counts or small cluster sizes.</s><s xml:id="_THX39tV">We have also assumed generalization of the concept of estimation of ICCs for binary outcomes on the proportion scale using linear mixed models, to estimation of CACs for binary outcomes on the proportion scale using linear mixed models.</s><s xml:id="_wKgTVvp">Further work is required to determine the conditions under which the use of these methods is appropriate.</s><s xml:id="_er3AHya">We limit our models to the assumption that the variance in the outcome is the same across both arms, whereas others have relaxed this assumption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref></s><s xml:id="_P8kCczC">urthermore, we have relaxed large-sample assumptions by using critical values from the t-distribution, but the corresponding degrees of freedom used have not been verified for designs other than the simple parallel CRT with continuous outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54</ref></s><s xml:id="_kf7ypUc">For parallel CRTs, these degrees of freedom corrections result in up to four extra clusters being added to each arm, and our calculations suggest that in stepped-wedge trials the extra number of clusters per sequence might also be high (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).</s><s xml:id="_bNzeSsf">However, we do urge caution in the use of the t-distribution for stepped-wedge studies and other multiple-period designs with small numbers of clusters, as the appropriateness of this degree of freedom correction is unclear.</s></p><p xml:id="_6W8zy8Y"><s xml:id="_N5bzMu4">Finally, whereas the correlation structures considered allow for correlations to decay with increasing separation between periods of measurements, in settings where data are continuously accrued a more intuitive correlation structure is one that allows correlations to decay with increasing separation between 'actual times' of measurement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s xml:id="_MJyUsH6">Furthermore, although we have allowed for within-cluster correlations to depend on time period of measurement at least in some form, in designs that repeatedly measure the same individual we have not allowed for individual-level correlations to depend on time of measurement.</s><s xml:id="_CZKcsKr">Importantly, where the correlation structure is misspecified, sample size can be under-or over-estimated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref></s><s xml:id="_5uKHgg4">he Shiny CRT Calculator provides a user-friendly and flexible means of estimating power across a full range of different cluster trial designs.</s><s xml:id="_ypTWfPJ">Yet there are some limitations in its functionality that users should consider.</s><s xml:id="_RYvJCkw">First, we do not recommend that researchers use the Shiny CRT Calculator to identify the minimum number of clusters necessary, as studies with a small number of clusters risk lack of internal and external validity and questionable suitability of statistical design and analysis methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s xml:id="_fPDBnJ4">econd, for multiple-period designs, the methodology assumes that intervention effects of interest are expressed as time-averaged treatment effects; and alternative approaches are needed where this is not the primary focus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref></s><s xml:id="_4rDbDAW">Perhaps more importantly, the Shiny CRT Calculator does rely on asymptotic approximations and users should be mindful of this fact.</s><s xml:id="_fqZFC92">Whenever cluster sizes, numbers of clusters or proportions of events are small, the calculations will be at increased risk of not meeting the required assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_dTrRHRZ">In such circumstances, it might be necessary to consider power by simulation as an alternative, or perhaps complementary, approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56</ref></s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_e3HVjtN"><s xml:id="_dxPGdk7">Figure 1.</s><s xml:id="_WwkexwU">Schematic representation of different multi-period cluster randomsied trials.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,65.76,59.47,480.91,569.31" type="bitmap" /></figure>
