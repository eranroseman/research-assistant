psychological support 1 has led to the development, evaluation, and/or deployment of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including software applications (apps).</s><s xml:id="_jgG43cc">A DMHI is defined as an intervention delivering information, support, or therapy for mental health conditions through an electronic medium with the aim of treating, alleviating, or managing mental health difficulties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s xml:id="_eYvdmfE">DMHIs have demonstrated efficacy, supported by meta-analytic evidence for a range of mental health difficulties, including anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_fnJZQBd">DMHIs are increasingly regarded as viable alternatives to augment and expand the delivery of mental healthcare. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_kzSv9Ya">ith the widespread availability of smartphones, apps are increasingly being used to address the shortage of access to psychological interventions.</s><s xml:id="_A2NSEFg">Although evidence supports the use of apps for the delivery of DMHIs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> app use over more lengthy periods of time is not sustained. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_3Zkqz5r">isalignment between researchers' aims and clinical users' needs has been shown to be a major contributing factor to attrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> ; specifically, lack of attention to individual user characteristics and poor app design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_EGmGJTA">Additionally, apps require users to be intrinsically motivated, as users typically engage with apps in their own time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_BsYnbNH">Therefore, key to continued engagement is understanding end users' needs and preferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_NRu384N">In this study, the term 'end user' is used to refer to the person who uses or is intended to use the DMHI for mental health support.</s></p><p xml:id="_JHCRJ9K"><s xml:id="_r2nBhPZ">Participatory methods provide one means of ensuring that apps are designed to better meet users' needs and therefore promote longer term engagement.</s><s xml:id="_5NvwXJY">The health literature contains various participatory methods that involve different approaches for collaboration between researchers and stakeholders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_cftXxZM">The terminology for these methods is not always consistent, with a multitude of terms used (often interchangeably), including: patient and public involvement (PPI), co-production, co-design and co-creation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_AVhfzqT">In the absence of a single agreed term, the term 'co-production' is used throughout this review.</s><s xml:id="_fs5xhat">Despite inconsistency in terms, a common principle underlines all methods of co-production: 'Nothing about us, without us', <ref type="bibr">15,p.1</ref> with an underlying ethos of developing with and not for users, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> by placing end users at the heart of the process.</s></p><p xml:id="_uAuUv9E"><s xml:id="_u4RmRNA">Co-production has a sound theoretical basis and is grounded in self-determination theory, whereby autonomy and relatedness increase the likelihood of behaviour change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_KZy7Shg">Evidence indicates the indispensability of co-production in developing interventions to enhance outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_n8MAK2h">In a comprehensive review of co-production in mental health more generally, commissioned by the mental health charity, Mind, Slay and Stephens <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> examined pertinent themes related to well-being, social connectedness, stigma, and the mitigation of acute mental health service utilisation following co-producing services and interventions.</s><s xml:id="_q7QrCBw">Notably, their findings underscored the impact co-production had on improved functioning, characterised by heightened autonomy, competence and relatednessa congruence with the tenets of self-determination theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_7EBGtBM">he importance of co-produced research is also increasingly recognised by national agendas, including the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s xml:id="_8Pv6GMk">o-production is deemed to be particularly important as it enables the inclusion of minoritized groups and the accommodation of cultural needs by its ability to address mental health inequalities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s xml:id="_HYsxDzf">It is even possible for researchers to prioritise engaging under-representative groups and ensuring that their voices are embedded throughout decision making processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_KJ7DTWS">espite the growing recognition of the importance of co-producing DMHIs with people who experience mental health difficulties, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> few DMHIs have involved co-production processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_K2c8Wyb">Additionally, those DMHIs that have been co-produced are often limited to involvement in only the early and/or final stage of research design/intervention development or delivery, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> which is contradictory to the core principles of co-production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s xml:id="_zAPN2Sr">onsequently, many mental health apps are publicly accessible from app stores and have many monthly active users, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> but lack sufficient evidence regarding their design, development, and evaluation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_yyaYeTd">One possible barrier in involving users in app design is that there is no standardised guidance on how to involve stakeholders in this process.</s><s xml:id="_pd2MzHp">There are several frameworks for involving users in research more generally, but none focus specifically on involving users in the design of DMHIs more specifically.</s><s xml:id="_XPWvUDm">Involving users in the design of DMHIs can bring additional complexity owing to the diverse and multitude of stakeholders required, including researchers, service users (or 'end users'), health professionals and app developers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s xml:id="_UsYMFtb">n terms of user involvement in research frameworks more generally, the NIHR INVOLVE produced guidance around co-producing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> describing five key principles: (a) the sharing of power; (b) inclusion of diverse perspectives and skills; (c) respect and value the knowledge of those working together; (d) reciprocity; and (e) relationship building and maintenance.</s><s xml:id="_YCu3BFt">Additionally, the UK Design Council's double diamond method advises four main phases where involvement can take place; discover (identify the problem), design (define the intervention), develop (develop potential solutions) and deliver (testing).</s><s xml:id="_TekJqcC">Another tool is the Involvement Matrix, co-produced by Smits et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> which defines five main roles within co-production (the listener, co-thinker, advisor, partner and decision-maker).</s><s xml:id="_TQ7v9Eq">The roles reflect the degree of stakeholder involvement, ranging from passive recipient of information (listeners) to active contributors of options (co-thinkers) and advice (advisors), to equal collaborations (partners) and finally, the highest level, the decision makers.</s><s xml:id="_4tDUT4W">In a systematic review of 22 studies, Veldmeijer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> explored the extent to which stakeholders were involved in mental healthcare through design, including DMHIs.</s><s xml:id="_aCwAuA2">The review found most studies involved end users at a 'co-thinker' level within the matrix framework developed by Smits et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> with no single study involving end users at the highest level as 'decision maker'.</s><s xml:id="_JrMnKAg">These conclusions were supported by another review of 433 studies by Baines et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> who explored co-production within digital health innovation, implementation, and evaluation, and found whilst co-production is recognised as essential, it is rarely practised.</s><s xml:id="_b4mSH2t">Whilst these reviews concern co-production, they did not describe the methods and approaches to facilitate co-production, nor explore the barriers and added value to implementing co-production, which would be clinically useful for guiding decisions when co-producing DMHIs.</s><s xml:id="_7jDu6H2">Furthermore, the studies were not limited to the delivery of DMHIs through apps, despite the widespread availability of apps, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and increasing popularity of this platform for mental health treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s xml:id="_jaZsAEP">ome individual studies have described the way in which they have used co-production methods in the development and delivery of DMHIs.</s><s xml:id="_GCqECyd">However, to our knowledge, there are no published reviews that systematically aggregate the methods and approaches employed.</s><s xml:id="_EazcrSz">Therefore, our aim is to systematically review the literature to map out the methods of, and approaches to, co-production when designing, producing, and evaluating apps aimed at supporting individuals with mental health difficulties.</s><s xml:id="_YRFyJ34">Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no previous review has focused on apps, despite their rapid scalability and stakeholders' concern regarding the lack of scientific evidence.</s><s xml:id="_ayMhHFM">We aim to offer an in-depth exploration by synthesising the methods used in co-production of mental health apps and offer recommendations for improving the co-production process to maximise acceptability and engagement with DMHIs.</s><s xml:id="_eEKVRHD">The objectives of this study are to: (i) describe the methods and approaches to co-production that have been used when designing, producing, and evaluating DMHIs delivered via apps; and (ii) explore the barriers and facilitators affecting co-production with DMHIs delivered via apps.</s></p></div>
