being sicker and with a higher CMI than the non-engaged cohort.</s><s xml:id="_eDWjhWE">One would expect, then, that the engaged cohort would return to the hospital more frequently, just by virtue of the severity of their illness.</s><s xml:id="_x3fxgdy">In contrast, patients who were engaged were significantly less likely to be readmitted compared with the non-engaged cohort, and their revisit rates were significantly less when compared against the non-engaged cohort.</s><s xml:id="_Sgxn6YV">These findings are in line with Bressman et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> who also found that a text message-based system of monitoring patients after hospitalisation used significantly fewer revisit and readmission sources.</s><s xml:id="_Y6NYcHD">While it is unclear what mechanism or mediating factors are associated with reduced need for acute care resources, Bressman et al theorised that the more frequent check-ins and 'lower friction medium' for patient-initiated outreach allowed for earlier identification of issues that should be escalated or triaged to primary care follow-up or emergency care follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_wvnn42T">In addition, we believe the rigorous implementation plan, described in this paper, that focused on optimised response time and quality of care coordination, as well as the bidirectional messaging plus human navigation could have contributed to improved patient education, care coordination and monitoring that have shown to improve readmissions and revisit outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_ywMX8m6">mitations and implications for future research This study had several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_zTt2g4d">First, this research was conducted in one health system in Southern SA and results may not generalise to other systems with varying patient demographics, socioeconomic variables, discharge processes and cultures.</s><s xml:id="_ufdcCym">Second, this study focused on a single-mode interaction (ie, bidirectional texting plus human navigator).</s><s xml:id="_wnCdDtN">Other studies involving semiautomated texting messaging platforms on predischarge and postdischarge with limited escalation to humans either found that automated and semiautomated systems are associated with fewer acute care resources but have had little to no perceived difference in HCAHPS <ref type="bibr">14 23</ref> or did not evaluate the effects on HCAHPS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_wtDsrQ5">More work is needed to compare the effectiveness of various modes such as fully automated texting, phone call or email follow-up.</s></p><p xml:id="_QxNcM2R"><s xml:id="_hChBmwk">Second, the metrics used in this study focus on postdischarge.</s><s xml:id="_7Pv3gCV">However, patient experience is a summative construct which may be affected by any events along the care continuum.</s><s xml:id="_p5G6bAF">One could argue that the reason why patients were engaged postdischarge in this study was because they were happy with their earlier hospitalisation experience.</s><s xml:id="_AqeU8SF">Perhaps patients who become so dissatisfied with their hospitalisation disengage altogether from the postdischarge experience, and that is why non-engaged patients tended to score their care experience lower than those who were engaged.</s><s xml:id="_EN3Z6Sy">Similarly, a limitation of most studies using acute care resources as an outcome measure, like ours, is that we could be underestimating readmissions or revisit rates in that we are only privy to readmissions or revisits within this hospital system.</s><s xml:id="_WmNBSvV">Perhaps patients who are disengaged are less likely to see follow-up care within this, or any other care system.</s><s xml:id="_cb3xqFf">Further, perhaps by including patients who did not fully complete the HCAHPS survey, and only answered some questions, there may be (a) latent factor(s) that we did not fully account for-like perhaps they chose what questions to answer based on their previous hospitalisation experience or their postdischarge experience.</s><s xml:id="_fkvKmya">It is challenging to speculate on the link between engagement and satisfaction or experience, other than to acknowledge that the causal relationship between them remains elusive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s xml:id="_qafQEkc">hird, the operationalisation of engagement in this study was limited to quantity of engagement rather than the quality or substance.</s><s xml:id="_ZswMBMP">We chose a quantitative measure of engagement, due to its objectivity and practicality in evaluating thousands of cases and our desire to maintain patient privacy as much as possible by refraining from reading each 1:1 patient-clinician text exchange.</s><s xml:id="_qvVcF9N">However, by choosing a quantitative number threshold, the nuances of patient engagement may be lost. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s xml:id="_KXSDK9n">A patient could have initiated one, meaningful text message to a care manager and yet would not be considered 'engaged'.</s><s xml:id="_j28awmH">Likewise, a patient could have sent three negative, expletive-filled, patient-initiated messages and yet would have been considered engaged.</s><s xml:id="_WQHts7F">While qualitative assessment of patient experience remains a challenge, more research is warranted to operationalise more robust engagement metrics, although with a powered sample.</s></p></div>
