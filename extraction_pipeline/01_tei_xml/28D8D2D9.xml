<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ABtUQr3">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_uByfgk7"><s xml:id="_4FbRsX9">Health interventions that draw on games as their inspirational source (ie, game-based interventions) come with the promise of increasing motivation, engagement, and overall sustainability of health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> by enabling new paths of interactions between health care providers and patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tRrWSyf">Although games are present in various forms and genres, they generally share four defining traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>: a goal players try to achieve, rules that limit how players can achieve the goal, a feedback system telling players how they can achieve the goal, and voluntary participation of the players.</s></p><p xml:id="_xjW6r2p"><s xml:id="_RGhzDK8">Over time, a myriad of different labels for game-based interventions have emerged, including playification <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, educational games <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, game-based learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, active video games <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, fitnessification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, fitness games <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, exergames or serious exergames <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, cognitive games <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, simulation games <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, games with a purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, persuasive information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and persuasive games <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RTz3v2B">Among these approaches to game-based health interventions, gamification and serious games have emerged as the 2 prevailing concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WXFqB8t">Both concepts have been reported to be successfully used in various areas of health care, such as promoting healthier lifestyles, supporting rehabilitation processes, or fostering the education of health professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_h72Xk9b">However, although serious games have been researched long before the proliferation of computer technology and can be traced back to the 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the term gamification only became popular around the 2010s <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and has since then rapidly gained interest from health care researchers and professionals alike <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_E7j2FC3"><s xml:id="_y6AGN6g">As both concepts have become increasingly established, scholars have developed a variety of definitions for the terms gamification and serious games <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rUBmYNp">In addition, several researchers have discussed substantial conceptual differences between gamification and serious games.</s><s xml:id="_2fzDhGn">For example, Liu et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> argued that serious games are full-fledged games that are modeled after but independent and separate from real-world systems, whereas gamification can never exist on its own and is always a part of a real-world system that maintains its instrumental functionality.</s><s xml:id="_r2kJMx8">Such conceptual considerations have been supported by empirical studies that showed differences in the effects of gamification and serious games on specific health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NwgTa5a">Consistent with the law of parsimony, the differences in conceptual and empirical levels indicate that gamification and serious games are, in fact, 2 distinct concepts that require separate scholarly consideration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2R5UpnT">However, researchers frequently report cases in which terms related to gamification or serious games are used ambiguously (eg, due to a lack of definitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>) or even interchangeably <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yVVy9PG">Over the course of our own research endeavors, we have also seen first indications that there is an amalgamation of the terms in the form of authors using them interchangeably or ambiguously.</s><s xml:id="_CxFZrez">The fuzzy use of the 2 terms can yield negative consequences, such as an impediment to cumulative knowledge development <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> or the prevention of collaboration between researchers and practitioners <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JXRPJGh">Some of these issues are already visible in the literature.</s><s xml:id="_nSvRGU3">For example, Koivisto and Hamari <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> reported in their well-cited literature review that they had to consider every paper that was labeled as gamification by the authors, despite being aware of and acknowledging conceptual unclarity between the terms gamification and serious games in some research communities.</s><s xml:id="_vXqFkmT">To ensure the feasibility of the review, they had to perform some substantial abstraction, which "has consequently caused some specifics of the studies to be lost" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VDzSYBR">In health care, negative effects stemming from conceptual unclarity may also ripple through to practice, as it is not uncommon for game-based health interventions to be built around theoretical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_BZgWeg9"><s xml:id="_RxhqXQe">Within health care literature, the extent to which existing research explicitly distinguishes between gamification and serious games and whether it draws on existing conceptual considerations to do so remains unclear.</s><s xml:id="_4QgeJD8">A major challenge for authors may also be that they see themselves faced with several different definitions and conceptual differences of gamification and serious games, each operating on a different level of abstraction, focusing on different characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_Yn4aqq3">This can lead to contradictory indications and may make it difficult for the authors to reconcile different views <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ygfmjks">We argue that more practical guidelines for authors to avoid ambiguities between different types of game-based interventions can help achieve a more accurate attribution of cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes to either gamification or serious games and ultimately advance the development of effective interventions.</s><s xml:id="_a7KtXfW">In this study, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with the necessary tools.</s><s xml:id="_C2h7u4e">To develop such tools, it is necessary to capture the status quo of how health care researchers understand, define, and use the terms gamification and serious games and whether they explicitly distinguish between the 2 concepts.</s><s xml:id="_79CR9KN">Consequently, we formulated the following research questions (RQs): RQ1: How does extant research conceptualize gamification and serious games in health care?</s><s xml:id="_MB6FwyN">RQ2: How does extant research distinguish between gamification and serious games in health care?</s><s xml:id="_XqZJDfq">RQ3: How can authors be guided to avoid conceptual ambiguity when reporting game-based intervention studies?</s></p><p xml:id="_m7dr4J5"><s xml:id="_CTCFyNU">To answer our RQs, we use a 2-step research design.</s><s xml:id="_cFJbuhD">In step 1, we analyze the current understanding of the terms gamification and serious games in health care research by reviewing the literature in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and its sister journals.</s><s xml:id="_Z7EBGmX">By doing so, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing conceptualizations of gamification and serious games in health care (RQ1) and provide rich insights into the nature of the conceptual unclarities surrounding gamification and serious games (RQ2).</s><s xml:id="_CjrCfW5">In step 2, we derive guidelines for authors of game-based intervention studies that may support them in avoiding conceptual ambiguity when reporting their results (RQ3).</s></p><p xml:id="_aAaSrvY"><s xml:id="_DRACjVQ">and Ellis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HAK7cK3">We limited the search to journals of JMIR Publications, as the Journal of Medical Internet Research itself is one of the leading medical informatics and health care sciences and services journal with an impact factor of 5.43 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and a broad area of topics is covered in more than 30 of its sister journals.</s><s xml:id="_weUx8NC">To identify relevant literature, we used the search tool on the JMIR website <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref> to search for papers containing terms related to either gamification (search terms: gamification, gamified, gamifying, or gamify) or serious games (search terms: serious AND games, serious AND gaming, or serious AND game) in any field.</s><s xml:id="_szmcaw8">The search was performed on November 12, 2020, and yielded 271 studies, for which we screened their full text to assess their relevance.</s><s xml:id="_XUQ7DaA">In doing so, we excluded 65 studies that did not focus on either gamification or serious games but, for example, only mention them in the keywords of the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> or as a possible future research avenue <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wJrRRU9">We presumed that all articles published in a journal of JMIR Publications belong to the research area of health care (ie, are related to research on efforts made to maintain or restore physical, mental, or emotional well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_jMNepYr">Hence, we were left with 206 studies for further analysis.</s><s xml:id="_D6vDDem">Our data analysis followed a concept-centric approach informed by Webster and Watson <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NV2QxFN">For each relevant study, we conducted a full-text analysis to identify the applied research methods, health care context (based on a study by <ref type="bibr">Stepanovic and Mettler [19]</ref>), and applied conceptualizations of the terms gamification or serious games.</s><s xml:id="_qnfKj83">Regarding the conceptualization of gamification and serious games, we first analyzed whether and, if so, how each of the studies defined the terms.</s><s xml:id="_MHTkp2v">For the purpose of this study, we broadly construed a definition as a phrase that conveys the meaning of a term.</s><s xml:id="_X5mzfyf">Furthermore, we analyzed the inspiration sources of each provided definition (ie, whether they were based on extant literature or self-developed).</s><s xml:id="_5qgC2wV">In addition, we analyzed whether and how the studies differentiated between gamification and serious games.</s><s xml:id="_tfucCZF">The full results of our concept-centric data analysis, including all 206 papers, can be found in Multimedia Appendix 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref>.</s></p></div>

xml:id="_RjrpaBf">Overall, the findings of our study help to better understand the phenomena of gamification and serious games and how they are conceptualized in research published in JMIR journals.</s><s xml:id="_vbGfJqy">Our results paint a heterogeneous landscape of different conceptualizations and different ways of distinguishing the 2 concepts.</s><s xml:id="_uB4Akq9">In addition, there are also some major differences in the evolution of definitions over time.</s><s xml:id="_87VxtAF">We identified some common pitfalls that may arise when researchers deal with gamification or serious games and provide guidance on how to avoid them.</s><s xml:id="_VEpPeFj">In the following sections, we discuss the principal findings of this study.</s></p><p xml:id="_y2h5RcJ"><s xml:id="_3w78FtX">First, the results from our literature review provide insights into the vast differences in how researchers conceptualize gamification or serious games.</s><s xml:id="_76tJ3Kn">Our results show that less than half (121/265, 45.7%) of concept mentions are accompanied by an explicit definition which leaves room for improvements in scientific rigor.</s><s xml:id="_XdYcgYA">Regarding the sources used for definitions, our results show clear differences between gamification and serious games.</s><s xml:id="_AxSNhXW">Although the majority of definitions used for gamification (43/61, 70%) can be traced back to the seminal paper by <ref type="bibr">Deterding et al [245]</ref>, no such single central article exists for the concept of serious games.</s><s xml:id="_y4sEQD6">Regarding the content of definitions, in the case of gamification, most studies follow the understanding of <ref type="bibr">Deterding et al [245]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hsekDxd">Deviations from this understanding are particularly evident in a change of the nongame context, meaning that the context is either limited to a specific area of application (eg, health care and education) or omitted completely.</s><s xml:id="_wqgqN8K">From our perspective, both approaches can be problematic.</s><s xml:id="_huEe2Wx">First, we think that gamification and its potential to positively shape the cognition, affection, and behavior of people is not limited to a specific context.</s><s xml:id="_dj86Q97">In fact, extant research has repeatedly stated that investigating the context specifics of gamification outcomes is one of the most interesting and challenging questions that researchers currently face <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr">266]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6u8Bgea">Second, we think that omitting the nongame context from the definition of gamification can lead to great confusion around the concept, as this would technically allow including classic video games with pure entertainment purposes, which was actually intended to be avoided when conceptualizing gamification <ref type="bibr">[245]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n9svySD">For serious games, the definition content was considerably more heterogeneous than that of gamification.</s><s xml:id="_E93BA7y">However, one aspect stood out.</s><s xml:id="_HQusZjw">Although some authors emphasize that serious games refer to video games in their entirety <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, others state that they only draw specific aspects from video games, such as design principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PRuapmq">In the latter case, the definitions of serious games seemed considerably closer to the common definitions of gamification.</s><s xml:id="_bPmzCbE">Second, by analyzing 59 studies that mentioned both gamification and serious games, our results reveal 4 approaches to the relationship between the 2 terms.</s><s xml:id="_ZEeSfNJ">From our point of view, 2 of these approaches, namely interchangeable use (5/59, 8%) and implicit differentiations (15/59, 25%), are not ideal for communicating one's own ideas of the concepts to the academic audience.</s><s xml:id="_pqduUcx">As outlined in our reporting guidelines, we think that explicit definitions and distinctions play a key role in mitigating the conceptual ambiguity surrounding different types of game-based interventions.</s><s xml:id="_26xVA6H">This is also echoed by extant literature on conceptual ambiguity problems, which states that such problems can arise when researchers implicitly assume that because they can make a logical distinction between concepts, this distinction will also exist in the minds of others <ref type="bibr">[267]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6vsuQg3">The largest group of studies (22/59, 37%) labeled serious games as a type of gamified intervention or as the product resulting from the gamification process.</s><s xml:id="_cd2gdjM">This seems closely related to the classic process view of gamification <ref type="bibr">[265]</ref>, where gamification is construed as a process of transforming a purely utilitarian system into a system that combines utilitarian and hedonic functions by implementing game design elements <ref type="bibr">[268]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_H6ZHH8a">From our point of view, this approach is incompatible with the understanding of the last group of studies (9/59, 15%) that, similar to <ref type="bibr">Deterding et al [245]</ref>, consolidate serious games as full-fledged games, whereas gamification involves systems that only partly consist of game design elements and in addition have nongame parts.</s><s xml:id="_MYP6NA4">A similar view is shared by <ref type="bibr">Marczweski [259]</ref>, who argues that contrary to gamification, serious games provide gameplay, which he describes as "[having] all the elements you would expect to see in a real game."</s><s xml:id="_qmn7jHn">Although conceptually sound, this distinction can also be problematic, as deciding whether users actually play a game or use a system is an often complex question that involves empirical, subjective, and social factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr">245]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E5R9ePx">In fact, for medical interventions in practice, it seems infeasible to empirically investigate each individual user on whether they are using or playing their system.</s><s xml:id="_5zM7MX6">On a conceptual level, this issue may be approached by substituting actual user behavior with design intention.</s></p><p xml:id="_gkp4rmY"><s xml:id="_nuxrk5J">Finally, when analyzing the thematic focus of our review literature, our results show an ever-increasing amount of both gamification and serious games studies in the JMIR research community since 2015, with seemingly no concept prevailing over the other.</s><s xml:id="_xycAhsv">We found this particularly interesting because it contrasts previous observations that gamification is increasingly superseding serious games as a more popular concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cadq2Kj">In fact, we also think that the circumstance that no concept prevails over the other even strengthens the relevance of clearly distinguishing between different types of game-based health interventions and attributing research results accurately in the future.</s></p></div>
