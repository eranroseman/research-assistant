health information' (PHI) except in a specified list of circumstances; 'business associates' face similar limitations under required contracts with covered entities 28 .</s><s xml:id="_v8UjJ9f">The definition of PHI is broad, including most individually identifiable health information; covered entities includes most health care providers, health insurance companies, and 'health information clearinghouses.</s><s xml:id="_PVnpzXb">' <ref type="bibr">28</ref> HIPAA creates a set of rules that are arguably both overprotective and underprotective of privacy (HIPAA also directly protects information security through a separate Security Rule 29 ).</s><s xml:id="_fMUfewH">On the overprotective side, while HIPAA allows use of PHI for health care treatment (including 'quality improvement'), operations, payment, public health, and law enforcement-it does not allow the use of PHI without Institutional Review Board (IRB) waiver or patient authorization for research, which is to say the systematic production of generalizable knowledge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_k8BDVtU"><s xml:id="_KCZwHuV">As to health data covered by HIPAA, the rule also has gaps.</s><s xml:id="_Rj3ZJVE">One of HIPAA's most important strategies for protecting patients from privacy breaches while enabling data sharing is deidentifying their data by removing a set of 18 specified identifiers, like names and email addresses 31 .</s><s xml:id="_U9g3k3F">However, deidentified data may become reidentifiable through data triangulation from other datasets (Box 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_tEDGYGx">Moreover, HIPAA focuses its regulation on particular actors and their activities, not the data themselves.</s><s xml:id="_VXaAWwS">For instance, once a patient requests their own health data-which HIPAA gives them the right to do, and some concerted efforts encourage patients to do <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> -if the patient then gives those data to another individual, HIPAA does not restrict use or disclosure of those data (unless the recipient is another covered entity or a business associate) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_dz9kve9"><s xml:id="_PgXhzFm">But the more fundamental problem is that the majority of health data is not covered by HIPAA at all (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_QHqGAzj">When Congress enacted HIPAA in 1996, it envisioned a regime in which most health data would be held in health records, and so it accordingly focused on health care providers and other covered entities.</s><s xml:id="_qSbM3Ed">In the big-data world, the type of data sources covered by HIPAA are but a small part of a larger health data ecosystem.</s><s xml:id="_9ZDDM8C">HIPAA does not cover health care data generated outside of covered entities and business associates, such as health care-related information recorded by life insurance companies.</s><s xml:id="_2NhSttE">It does also does not cover health (as opposed to health care) data generated by a myriad of people or products other than the patient.</s><s xml:id="_MG6yQvB">It does not cover usergenerated information about health, such as the use of a bloodsugar-tracking smartphone app or a set of Google searches about particular symptoms, and insurance coverage for serious disorders.</s><s xml:id="_mvtFDS4">And it certainly does not cover the huge volume of data that is not about health at all, but permits inferences about healthsuch as the information about a shopper's Target purchases that famously revealed her pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_6kCX5gZ">This focus on data specifically arising from health 'care' contrasts with European regulation of data concerning health more generally.</s></p><p xml:id="_yr46X53"><s xml:id="_9pSwfXx">We are already entering a future in which traditional health care spaces, HIPAA's covered entities, are being supplanted in the health data space by behemoths like Google, Apple, and IBM-all of which operate outside of HIPAA's regime.</s><s xml:id="_jpJjAAu">While, as we discuss below, some laws may protect particular uses of those data, overall there is little to protect patients from these threats to their health privacy in the United States at the moment.</s></p><p xml:id="_c9C5nmr"><s xml:id="_6By47P4">Equitable data collection.</s><s xml:id="_63fwUDW">Another concern is not that too much data is taken from patients, but that data collection is not occurring equitably.</s><s xml:id="_d6ssgVW">As an ethical matter, data collection is best justified as a kind of 'bargain' struck between data sources and data users-sources provide users with data, recognizing that this may encroach in some ways on source privacy, because it will permit the users to provide advances in health care that will improve the lives of sources.</s><s xml:id="_vX6AfJw">When this balance is off, the bargain may break down.</s><s xml:id="_SExJvt6">Existing bias can reappear in data mining, as has been shown for predictive analytics in policing: racial disparities in policing patterns result in racially biased predictions of criminal activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_hgcNmSm">Unfortunately, health data have many of the same problems.</s><s xml:id="_AfJ9EyU">Marginalized populations that are missing from non-health data such as credit card use or Internet history-leading to biases in credit scores or consumer profiles-may also be absent from big health data, such as genomic databases or EHRs, due in part to lack of health insurance and the inability to access health care as well as a number of other reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_RUghauE">The distributional consequences of this lack of inclusion in big data are complex; in some instances it may favor but in other instances disfavor those whose data are missing.</s><s xml:id="_ETzZvKR">For example, consider an allocation decision between multiple patients as to a scarce medical resource.</s><s xml:id="_XHBJzpc">If a particular minority group actually responds less well to the medical intervention then other groups, failure to collect information on the minority group might lead the algorithm to give the minority patient more priority than had the data been included.</s><s
