represent the true impact of the disorder.</s><s xml:id="_V8KBqCF">An attempt was made to minimize measurement bias by using the validated iPCQ instrument to quantify both paid and unpaid productivity losses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48</ref></s><s xml:id="_CxqGbxw">The response rate was high (89%) and respondent burden for filling out the survey was

target="#b49">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49</ref></s><s xml:id="_TwsHEXW">lthough the human capital method is often preferred because it is easy to implement and understand, it has been

target="#b52">51</ref></s><s xml:id="_cWEwPDN">One concern is that the method assumes full productivity in the labor markets in which the work by individuals is actually lost instead of just postponed.</s><s xml:id="_VZnjfhC">In real-world settings, when individuals are absent from work, their tasks are typically put off until they return, although this may be difficult to do for repeated or lengthy absences, as may occur with SCD.</s><s xml:id="_3Zma9Mf">Another objection is that productivity calculations attributable to presenteeism assume that all individuals are 100% productive all of the time.</s><s xml:id="_V5StNYP">This assumption may overestimate the lost productivity of individuals.</s><s xml:id="_QCKPDAU">Nevertheless, the human capital method is widely used in economic studies, and no other method of measuring productivity is better or more transparent.</s></p><p xml:id="_9a9h5qw"><s xml:id="_WQCjVpD">Finally, the calculations of nonwork productivity may be controversial.</s><s xml:id="_axWyCFG">In this study, impairment was calculated to cost approximately $41 209 for individuals with SCD and their caregivers, a figure that exceeds the previously

xml:id="_K8qfxAa">Some might argue against including nonwork productivity because of methodologic difficulties or an opinion that nonwork is not really economically productive.</s><s xml:id="_285FZsu">Decision makers with this opinion may choose to ignore calculations of nonwork value, despite the theoretical support and widespread use in the economics literature.</s><s xml:id="_pChzhAX">One may consider that a substantial amount of lost productivity was missed because it was not possible to calculate unemployment owing to SCD.</s><s xml:id="_s5E34SF">A majority of survey respondents reported being unable to work, being out of work and looking for work, or not looking for work.</s><s xml:id="_4zBcTVr">If SCD contributes to the cause of unemployment for these people, absenteeism and presenteeism calculations are insufficient to capture the disorder's full indirect costs on patients and on society.</s></p><p xml:id="_rm3mvCs"><s xml:id="_hFnyJrg">Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that the impact of SCD has implications that extend well beyond medical resource usage.</s><s xml:id="_Uzcfeps">The first implication relates to medical care itself and to costeffectiveness analyses about medical treatments.</s><s xml:id="_ve4x74f">Decisions and policies regarding medical and nonmedical interventions in SCD should account for both indirect and direct medical costs associated with patient care.</s><s xml:id="_ujgdMPD">Our study provides such measures of indirect costs.</s><s xml:id="_x9cJgst">The second implication of our findings relates to their power to support SCD advocacy.</s><s xml:id="_VhTKC2h">Most SCD pain, including VOCs, is treated at home.</s><s xml:id="_e6mJatv">VOCs are unpredictable.</s><s xml:id="_Q39Hp56">Nevertheless, patients, families, and clinicians dealing with SCD may feel helpless to defend patients against employers prepared to fire employees with SCD because of their VOCs, especially when VOCs are long, frequent, or severe.</s><s xml:id="_y7g7EYF">Sickle cell pain and VOCs have been described as "invisible"-there is no incontrovertible, clinically objective measure of a VOC.</s><s xml:id="_KVetaBj">SCD employment policies suggest that the number of annual hospitalizations is not the only valid measure of disease severity or reason for accommodation of with SCD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52</ref> but, anecdotally, employers depend on hospitalizations and clinic visits to validate employees' SCD claims of medically valid work outages.</s><s xml:id="_ZnqgD23">Some clinicians themselves may doubt the validity of heavy job absenteeism owing to VOCs or presenteeism despite being in a VOC.</s><s xml:id="_YjdBRTY">Other clinicians may feel incapacitated when validating disability or repeated absences for their patients.</s><s xml:id="_eTEafG7">Validation requires them to state that the employee wants to work but cannot or that the
