however, the specific criteria and regulations may differ across countries or regions.</s></p><p xml:id="_Gm6Vxz3"><s xml:id="_GU8zpxE">CDSSs are used to provide support across a spectrum of health care activities, including early disease detection, diagnosis, data interpretation, treatment planning, patient care, monitoring, and prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QWx3C6w">These functions can be enabled via specific CDSS features, such as the ability to estimate treatment efficacy or level of risk, recommend a treatment regimen or a referral, predict drug-drug interactions and dosing alerts, flag potential aspects for further monitoring, and facilitate shared decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sExZx6e">CDSSs can be knowledge based, using predefined clinical decision rules (such as reinforcement-based methods), or non-knowledge based, relying on data-driven approaches like artificial intelligence, machine learning, or statistical pattern recognition, instead of being programmed to follow expert medical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zqehDYA">CDSSs can integrate data from multiple sources such as clinical guidelines, peer-reviewed literature, historical patient data, and EMRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_H54X7zE">In integrated CDSSs, input data (ie, relevant patient information) are acquired from an EMR database, such as Epic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Allscripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Aifred Health [10], and Eclinicalworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, which serve as primary platforms for clinicians to check patient laboratory results, clinical documentation, and reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z8XncWp">In contrast, stand-alone systems require manual data entry such as Epocrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, a CDSS that provides accurate, reliable, and actionable clinical tools to support clinicians in making point-of-care decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_P7zH2M6"><s xml:id="_t2ry8Qk">CDSSs aim to improve health care delivery by enhancing medical decisions and tailoring patient care with targeted clinical knowledge and multidimensional medically relevant health indicators.</s><s xml:id="_kGJhy2G">These indicators can span across several dimensions of patient health and include but are not restricted to vital signs (eg, blood pressure and heart rate), laboratory values (eg, blood glucose levels and cholesterol levels), diagnostic test results (eg, electrocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging), disease-specific biomarkers (eg, tumor markers and hemoglobin A 1c [HbA 1c ]), patient-specific data (eg, allergies and medications), and predictive models (eg, Framingham risk score).</s><s xml:id="_n5JTFty">Since CDSSs first originated in the 1970s, a manifold of systems has been developed and implemented using different modalities (eg, PC and tablet) as EMR-integrated or stand-alone systems for the management of numerous conditions at different stages, with a vast scope of functions (flagging, drug control, shared decision-making, etc), users (eg, HCPs, patients, and nurses), and settings (eg, ambulance, surgery room, and general practitioner's office) to address unmet needs of a given region or country <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2szw7rt">In the context of ongoing digital transformation in the health care sector, the potential of CDSSs for improving the quality and efficacy of care has been increasing.</s><s xml:id="_VFUqjC7">Indeed, CDSSs have been associated with a positive impact on the quality of clinical practice and patient adherence in the management of chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5ddFHmd">It is noteworthy that while some CDSS significantly improved clinical practice, some yielded limited results, and others failed to meet expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bMYbhjP">To date, a body of research sheds light on the reasons behind the lack of success or adoption of CDSSs from both theoretical and practical standpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>; however, while previous research addresses clinical practice in general terms for both computer-based and manual systems, this review aims to complement previous work by focusing on the studies that address electronic and guideline-based CDSSs for the management of chronic, noncommunicable diseases in a primary care setting.</s><s xml:id="_zTD8EjR">Specifically, we aim to identify features and characteristics that impact the efficacy of CDSSs based on the outcome measures, consequently contributing to several value areas.</s><s xml:id="_82WDpTw">We sought to gain a deeper understanding of the various value areas where improvements could be made through these systems, as well as the features that contributed to positive outcomes in the studies evaluating the benefits of CDSSs for HCPs.</s></p></div>
