dietary interventions for facilitating dietary change in adults with chronic disease.</s><s xml:id="_z8e6zTj">The primary finding was that dietary interventions delivered by telehealth effectively improved dietary adherence on a moderate scale and made small improvements in diet quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5exU7va">Single macronutrients were less likely to be modified by telehealth intervention, including energy and total dietary fat intake, which were not significantly different between groups in the pooled analysis.</s></p><p xml:id="_8HPgp6g"><s xml:id="_mj5vqhy">Telehealth interventions resulted in a significant reduction in dietary sodium intake compared with nontelehealth interventions (SMD 20.39, P = 0.0001), which is considered a moderate effect statistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2wUvKa9">All dietary sodium outcomes showed improved compliance with a reduced sodium intervention by use of telehealth.</s><s xml:id="_uJcDuVX">This has clinical implications for telehealth because it may provide a useful tool in future intervention studies, given that sodium modification is hampered by poor patient compliance in clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_G7UtY2v">The finding that fruits and vegetables increased by 1 serving/d following telehealth interventions supports the potential for the use of these interventions to improve diet quality, which is a finding similar to a systematic review in telephone-based interventions in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qgrNayB">Although significant heterogeneity was observed, subanalysis by type of technology reduced the effect size to 0.8 servings/d, but remained significant.</s><s xml:id="_2UrU4cQ">Fruit and vegetable consumption is a strong predictor of mortality, and the magnitude of change that we found may reduce the risk of allcause mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2BaQC4F">The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heart study estimated that an increase in every 80-g portion of fruit and vegetables was associated with a 4% reduction in risk of death <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NpQadyY"><s xml:id="_Q5NKqbP">Whole-of-diet approaches, as opposed to isolated singlenutrient interventions, reflect how foods within the diet are consumed and have an impact on other nutrients when manipulated (e.g., a change in fat intake often results in a concomitant increase in the proportion of energy derived from carbohydrates).</s><s xml:id="_YSgkfsV">Developments in nutrition science recognize the effect of the complexity of foods consumed in combination on long-term CVD risk, weight regulation, and disease progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HGc7n57">Such approaches appreciate the interaction of foods and nutrients, which may be more relevant to chronic disease when examining the cumulative effect over time of food on health <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jjNkVFz">This shift in nutrition focus suggests that single-nutrient interventions will be used less often clinically and in public health practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref>, which is an important consideration for emerging telehealth interventions in the design of dietary educational content.</s><s xml:id="_QbweFC3">Although we observed only small changes in diet quality, the magnitude of change demonstrated may result in a substantial public health benefit if adopted for secondary prevention of chronic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zzgf9JX">For example, higher-quality diet has been linked to a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in people .65 y (72).</s><s xml:id="_uRmTYBf">Although a stronger association was found when comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles, the risk decreases at each quartile above the lowest-quality diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hFKHxMu">Furthermore, improving fruit and vegetable intake to better reflect dietary guidelines and therefore overall diet quality may reduce the complications of chronic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, which have been demonstrated to result in a reduction in all-cause mortality of 21% during a 15-y follow-up period <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(73)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_FPEuqNT"><s xml:id="_Nb4zD52">Dietary change through telehealth interventions can translate to small improvements in some clinical outcomes, such as a reduction in SBP of 3 mm Hg.</s><s xml:id="_jPjDc47">Although this is slightly less than the larger-scale meta-analyses of all dietary sodium interventions in hypertension of 25 mm Hg, the effect size is similar to that in people without hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hZAJdWR">A sustained change in SBP of 2-3 mm Hg in a period .6 mo has been suggested to translate into a reduced risk of cardiovascular events <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(75)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GBmb6Ym">Other risk factors such as weight, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and triglycerides improved significantly in some studies following telehealth interventions, whereas LDL, HDL, and HbA1c did not.</s><s xml:id="_pEcYKSV">The long-term studies (.12 mo) included were not adequately powered to detect BP and weight change at final follow-up, and the inclusion criteria meant that some larger trials were excluded because of the lack of reporting of dietary outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_7sqFyQD">For example, the Practice-based Opportunities for Weight Reduction study <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref> observed a between-group change in SBP of 21.8 mm Hg and weight change of 24 kg after 24 mo in the telephone coaching group, but it was not possible to include it.</s><s xml:id="_hhnffTD">This welldesigned trial supports the effects of telehealth interventions on surrogate CVD outcomes in chronic disease.</s></p><p xml:id="_NPhrZAj"><s xml:id="_kkqpFVw">A previous systematic review demonstrated that technologies such as telephone and video contact improved adherence to diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, which we have extended to improved dietary quality, improved fruit and vegetable intake, and reduced sodium intake when compared to usual chronic disease care.</s><s xml:id="_hYeZqca">Telehealth may facilitate compliance with the diet via a variety of mechanisms beyond the provision of regular review and behavior prompting, although it is likely the most influential on sustained dietary change in our review <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ExzksdJ">Telehealth strategies offer feasible ways to facilitate dietary changes and offer advantages over FTF consultations, including flexibility (78) and a high rate of patient acceptability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_N6dKVUA">Smartphones are used by .75% of the population (80, 81), highlighting the widespread potential that telehealth interventions provide to improve access, coverage, and implantation methods, particularly in low socioeconomic populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q8WZV6f">Because primary health care may hold the key to the dissemination of telehealth dietary delivery interventions, evaluation studies are needed.</s><s xml:id="_qssGhu3">Process evaluation frameworks should be incorporated into future telehealth trials, reporting attendance and participation, acceptability, and costs, which will ultimately assist in their translation into clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(82)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_V8pnEyH"><s xml:id="_hRW3mXD">To our knowledge, our study is the first systematic review of telehealth strategies for facilitating multifactorial dietary change.</s><s xml:id="_WP7n2ke">Its strengths are the comprehensive search strategy used, the use throughout the review of 2 independent review authors, and the use of Cochrane methodology to appraise the risk of bias.</s><s xml:id="_UPBvMu8">The TIDieR checklist <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> was used to extract data, which allowed multiple sources of heterogeneity and intervention reporting inadequacies to be identified.</s></p><p xml:id="_8QbGchV"><s xml:id="_3UMm9Ae">Our review has several limitations, including that multifaceted dietary changes usually were a component of multiple lifestyle recommendations (22 of the 25 included studies), making it difficult to delineate the effect of isolated dietary intervention on clinical outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_3wJvEej">Half of the included studies used telephone delivery methods; other telehealth technologies such as smartphone applications and Internet use were underrepresented and may reduce the generalizability of the findings.</s></p><p xml:id="_xtFRk24"><s xml:id="_rzRJ4tG">This review highlights the need for future trials that aim to change dietary behavior with telehealth interventions other than telephone, such as mobile, Internet, or videoconference methods.</s><s xml:id="_rnYBJJU">The application of the TIDieR checklist highlights a need for better reporting of telehealth interventions, because many trials did not report important logistical data relating to intervention conduct.</s><s xml:id="_cN9X8Je">Finally, although favorable changes were reported in some surrogate clinical outcomes such as BP and lipid profiles following telehealth interventions, this may not translate to hard clinical endpoints.</s><s xml:id="_mmpjEtn">Because of a lack of studies, conclusions cannot be drawn about effects on mortality and hospitalizations.</s><s xml:id="_TwJQ4vm">Future well-designed intervention studies with adequate length of follow-up are required to assess these important endpoints.</s></p><p xml:id="_RRRCnsX"><s xml:id="_8ZHUUBB">In conclusion, adults with a diet-related chronic disease may experience improvements in diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake, and dietary sodium intake if they are provided with dietary interventions through telehealth.</s><s xml:id="_f7RjFWE">Although large variations in findings may be explained by differences in intervention conduct, it is difficult to explore as a result of suboptimal reporting of dietary interventions.</s><s xml:id="_YGjasKY">Single macronutrients (calories and total dietary fat) were not significantly modified following telehealth interventions, which may highlight the benefit of delivering complex dietary intervention that target the quality of the diet and/or dietary patterns facilitated by convenient telehealth technologies.</s><s xml:id="_eSTahAP">The results of this review support the changes in nutrient focus and may inform the future development of evidencebased telehealth programs,
