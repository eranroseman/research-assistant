how care is sought and delivered for disease prevention and management.</s><s xml:id="_6tNkqyH">The emergence of digital health technology is particularly relevant for mental health services.</s><s xml:id="_5sb4kw4">With a 12-month prevalence rate of 6.7% and 3.1% for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively, in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, depression and anxiety are the leading causes of disability and lost productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q7F4xJy">Nevertheless, there are barriers unique to mental health that hinder timely access to care.</s><s xml:id="_TEMF6rc">Besides affordability and accessibility issues, stigma surrounding mental illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, lack of motivation, and low rates of mental health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> significantly impact willingness to seek treatment and contribute to low engagement with mental health services.</s></p><p xml:id="_GarS2zq"><s xml:id="_rqAvCFg">With the rapid development and application of digital technologies such as smartphone apps, telemedicine has emerged as a compelling solution for disease treatment and management.</s><s xml:id="_uZSVpAy">Digital mental health interventions are growing in appeal because they offer scalable solutions and can improve uptake rates among those who are less inclined to seek mental health services.</s><s xml:id="_U5rZtVW">Digital mental health interventions are an effective means of delivering evidence-based psychological treatment to patients who are unable or unlikely to seek in-person treatment with a provider <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2nsBJZs">In addition, digital mental health interventions also appear to improve access, reduce stigma, and ease pressure when compared to face-to-face services <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_GJaKeEz"><s xml:id="_nbMbXqP">Given the potential benefits of digital mental health interventions, there has been increased research focusing on their effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_kxuzcKk">In their meta-analytic review, Richards et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> observed a significant and clinically meaningful effect of internet-based interventions for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder when compared to waitlist controls, including those with comorbid depression.</s><s xml:id="_MvnRss8">Similarly, in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that employed smartphone-based mental health interventions, Firth et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> observed a significant moderate treatment effect of internet-based interventions on depressive symptoms when compared to both waitlist and active controls; a similar treatment effect was observed for anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_QYr2ys6"><s xml:id="_9VQrjj3">While early evidence is promising, digital mental health interventions are not monolithic in their treatment approach, design, or delivery.</s><s xml:id="_HndAwCm">They can be game-based, focus primarily on psychoeducation, or incorporate human interactions.</s><s xml:id="_23Avsn8">Digital mental health interventions can entail one-on-one interactions in real time with a therapist via audio or video conferencing tools and involve both synchronous and asynchronous text messaging.</s></p><p xml:id="_Fe8j9QB"><s xml:id="_A783rs9">Interestingly, Firth et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> observed that smartphone-only apps were more effective than interventions that included a human or computerized interaction were and hypothesized that smartphone-only apps may be more comprehensive and self-contained in content and experience than interventions that relied on external input are.</s><s xml:id="_9uytfFd">Li et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> observed a similar pattern: a larger effect size for game-based interventions for the treatment of depression that did not include therapist support than for therapist-supported interventions.</s><s xml:id="_3Nt3dfR">On the other hand, Spek et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> noted the opposite pattern, wherein a stronger effect size was observed for therapist-supported internet-based cognitive behavior therapy interventions for anxiety symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_gsvTZWt">It is important to note here that digital mental health interventions can vary substantially in their therapeutic approach from a focus on mindfulness and psychoeducation to therapist-supported digital cognitive behavior therapy.</s><s xml:id="_79zfZBg">Indeed, Firth et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> did observe cognitive behavior-based interventions were associated with significantly greater reductions in depression compared to those associated with other approaches.</s><s xml:id="_bnhz8wF">Additionally, research suggests that internet-based cognitive behavior therapy programs are roughly equivalent in effectiveness compared to those of face-to-face therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_4JuNypU"><s xml:id="_qZzqjqB">Digital mental health interventions are not without their drawbacks.</s><s xml:id="_kK6g8vn">Importantly, it is still unclear if all digital psychological treatments are equally effective.</s><s xml:id="_P6cPjz3">For instance, in their review of digital mental health interventions for students, Lattie et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> found that web-based interventions were effective in improving depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being.</s><s xml:id="_skS8dQH">However, they noted participant attrition and program discontinuation across studies, suggesting that sustaining patient engagement remains a continued challenge for digital interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_aphDWtQ"><s xml:id="_9AyAVYa">In summary, recent interest and demand for remotely delivered mental health interventions has led to an increase in app-based solutions.</s><s xml:id="_QqezRVw">Technology-based mental health programs have been shown to be effective in improving access and treating common mental health conditions such as depression.</s><s xml:id="_HBXjbu8">However, given the heterogeneity of digital mental health interventions in terms of treatment approach and modality and continued challenges of attrition, their overall effectiveness remains an open question.</s><s xml:id="_wDReGgA">Though a fairly robust body of academic research supports the efficacy of digital mental health interventions in the treatment of mild to moderate depression and anxiety, there remain gaps.</s><s xml:id="_2883trV">Specifically, commercially available, app-based mental health programs have received less research scrutiny, particularly, in evaluating medium-term and long-term outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_GCnxvUp">Second, hybrid models that combine a cognitive behavior therapy-based digital intervention with one-on-one remote therapist support have been assessed to a lesser extent.</s></p><p xml:id="_hRW3dxN"><s xml:id="_XuQyZsf">In this study, we evaluated the Vida Health therapy program, a digital therapeutic intervention for mild to moderate depression and anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_mukvNvB">Vida Health is a commercially available, app-based digital health program for mental health and cardiometabolic conditions.</s><s xml:id="_dQJmFbV">The program is available direct to consumers, as an employee-based benefit or via select health plans.</s><s xml:id="_hpbGA7d">The Vida Health app offers tailored digital content paired with remote therapy and health coaching with licensed therapists, registered dieticians, certified diabetes educators or health education specialists.</s><s xml:id="_tTkpFvM">Vida Health program offerings include cognitive behavior therapy, mindfulness-based stress management, weight management, and chronic disease (eg, type 2 diabetes) management.</s><s xml:id="_SCnU566">Available in all 50 states, the therapy program that is the focus of this study is based on cognitive behavior therapy, a therapeutic approach that has shown the strongest evidence for treating depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UQ73Bam">Cognitive behavior therapy stands out as the leading therapeutic modality for depression and anxiety, as it is both shorter in duration, and its positive outcomes last longer, as compared to those of other therapeutic modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gQ7D58y">Our primary objective was to assess the long-term outcomes from a digital mental health intervention incorporating evidence-based psychotherapeutic content along with one-on-one sessions with a remote licensed therapist.</s><s xml:id="_MNMjH4w">Our secondary objective was to examine if intervention engagement was associated with stronger outcomes at the end of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_dupvDVE">This study also examined depression and anxiety improvements during the postintervention maintenance phase.</s></p></div>
