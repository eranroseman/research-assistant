<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_nkSmRsY">Developing a Story Through Triggers</head><p xml:id="_wuH9NYh"><s xml:id="_ZpD36qF">Triggers can be seen as actuators of an intervention or built as a component within a larger intervention framework.</s><s xml:id="_wUSzQ4j">An actuator controls the movement or flow of system components.</s><s xml:id="_RAKqC4r">We think of triggers as the adaptive control mechanism for all components of an intervention that focus not only on immediate action, but also on the larger story surrounding behavior change in the context of a person's life and changing goals.</s><s xml:id="_vC9TvFk">Initial baseline tailoring efforts can help build a story around salient components of an individual's life (eg, social network), patterns of behavior (eg, usual heavy drinking times), and progress toward change in symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_MvwPQYs">In this way, triggers are framed to meet both longand short-term needs and goals.</s><s xml:id="_BtepXTE">A recent study on using messaging to reduce problem drinking revealed that the largest effect sizes for drinking reduction and subjective goal attainment were found among those whose messages were adapted weekly based on whether or not they met their goals for the week <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zAPwKTK">The adaptation of triggers in line with the users' experiences and goals can be applied in any context to curate tailored components immediately to meet the current demands of the individual and the entire trajectory of an intervention within the context of individuals' lives.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_UPk7whb">Limitations</head><p xml:id="_AMumxmM"><s xml:id="_79Dq4eZ">Digital triggers offer unprecedented opportunities to increase goal salience without requiring significant effort on the part of the end user.</s><s xml:id="_DyMdHpa">However, as noted throughout the paper, implementation efforts can backfire without understanding of the potential pitfalls of each component.</s><s xml:id="_AntqZav">Alert fatigue is a major concern among emergency and medical groups and can occur in health-based interventions as well.</s><s xml:id="_vjWkpUj">Subgroups of individuals in studies have reported that messages can be burdensome, too frequent, and received at inopportune times, among other complaints.</s><s xml:id="_zaQcbnA">Habituation or ignoring triggers is another concern that can occur with long-term trigger-based interventions.</s><s xml:id="_yFr2s6R">Such user responses can reduce trigger salience.</s><s xml:id="_EmuuZv2">In addition to these concerns over intervention effectiveness, intervention developers need to take privacy and security concerns into account.</s><s xml:id="_U4tFPsx">For example, text messaging is possibly the least secure method of trigger delivery, as it is stored on the phone company's server, the messaging provider's server, and the end user's phone.</s><s xml:id="_FQqGdsm">Users should be aware of all privacy concerns prior to engaging in trigger-based adjuncts or interventions, like they would for any digital intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_A4nDd29"><s xml:id="_NPscP5S">In addition, as mentioned above in the Paper Aim paragraph, this review included papers from the marketing literature, where sometimes the goals of the intervention (eg, email subscription, special-sell) are very much different from the goals embedded within health interventions (lifetime changes needed to cope with a chronic illness).</s><s xml:id="_KaQUe6v">We accounted for this difference, however, by interpreting the findings from the marketing literature only within the particular context of the reviewed component (eg, when).</s><s xml:id="_SxKsc95">In this way, the marketing literature could be perceived as an exploratory laboratory of specific human behaviors and reactions to triggers in the context of daily living (eg, when people are most available), which enabled us to generalize these data to the health domain.</s></p><p xml:id="_ap2YPEP"><s xml:id="_Skdna85">Finally, due to the high variation in research and development methods of digital interventions that embed triggers (sometimes without clear information about component tailoring), and the broad disciplines from which data can be retrieved, we were not able to apply a systematic process to review and retrieve data (eg, systematic review).</s><s xml:id="_Wnc9ez9">As research moves forward in this field, more evidence about the impact of trigger tailoring will emerge, and such a review would become more feasible.</s></p></div>
