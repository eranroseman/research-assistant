Allen as chair, and J. Nagel as co-chair <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6egu6Nr"><s xml:id="_dKfXx8T">The first task was to define the elements of the health system, in a way consistent with the WHO classification of health services in Primary, First referral, Second referral and Last referral levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mV76d7g">HTTTG planned to assist countries in defining their health technology needs and identifying and rectifying health system constraints for adequate management and utilization of health technology, particularly through training, capacity building and the development and application of appropriate technology.</s></p><p xml:id="_xbECjrT"><s xml:id="_epxezr6">The second task, consolidated after B. Allen visited several health services in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Region, was the formation of Actions Groups (AG) to address the technical aspects of what were considered essential subjects.</s><s xml:id="_D3qcP4D">Each AG was to elaborate specific requirements and explore commercial availability or propose a development project to satisfy equipment design criteria.</s><s xml:id="_5rbPCa2">Six AGs, listed below, were created with a nominated chair, who then selected the group members.</s><s xml:id="_ZKFMjJz">By the end of 2007, the AGs were populated with a total of 50 international experts, who provided an expression of interest, a brief CV and a provisional action plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>: 1.

Allen's visit the year before, but focusing exclusively on diagnostic imaging services.</s><s xml:id="_Wg65KxW">There are 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta Region; their geographical distribution is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_bTv5CJC"><s xml:id="_puFuTvS">The evaluation, which followed the criteria established by the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, included visits to three radiology departments in the Kien Giang Province of the Mekong Delta Region (see their location in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), as well as to several district hospitals and health centers with diagnostic imaging equipment.</s><s xml:id="_c8eyPTy">Recommendations were made regarding needed equipment and staff, type of equipment and staff training, and image acquisition techniques.</s><s xml:id="_aEkezHy">Because of the serious problems encountered with film processing, it was proposed that health centers desiring imaging equipment only acquire ultrasound units for obstetric work.</s><s xml:id="_DjWcE54">(If the machine is portable, a welltrained nurse/technician can go with it to other health centers on a periodic basis, thus expanding the health services coverage).</s><s xml:id="_zBR7tVn">It was suggested that health stations do not offer x-ray services, but if they had to (for example to diagnose tuberculosis), the recommended equipment was the World Health Imaging System-Radiography unit, a basic x-ray system developed by WHO <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, that requires less operator training, is easier to maintain, and can be used with computed radiography (CR) phosphors instead of film/screens.</s><s xml:id="_KF85fFz">The digitized images could then be sent to the district or provincial hospital for interpretation by a radiologist.</s></p><p xml:id="_GaSxVks"><s xml:id="_r2kTpnc">When discussing the final report <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> with the health authorities in the Kien Giang Province, they expressed great disappointment.</s><s xml:id="_7STk58R">Based on B. Allen's visit, they were expecting that the HTTG would now provide funding resources to implement at least some of the recommendations made by the two experts, with which they fully concurred.</s><s xml:id="_nAntYmY">C. Borrás had to tell them that no money was currently available for such a purpose.</s></p><p xml:id="_DrwjeqN"><s xml:id="_zGqqnjx">Despite financial constraints, B. Allen performed two additional country evaluations, a comprehensive one in Vanuatu in 2008 and a review of the Philippines's Cebu Island Level 1 and Level 2 Hospitals in October 2009.</s><s xml:id="_D5Vyrjr">The report "Vanuatu Health: Review of Medical Equipment Needs 2008", documented both diagnostic (including mammography) and therapy services at all the health care levels, from the National Referral Hospital in Vila Central Hospital, Efate, to health centers and even dispensaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BDJ5JrN">Such an extensive review was possible thanks to a grant from the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM).</s><s xml:id="_X37GpJP">In fact, one of the recommendations made by B. Allen was to suggest that the health authorities request aid from Australia, especially technical visits from engineers who could repair x-ray equipment.</s></p></div>
