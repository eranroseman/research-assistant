the body as an accessory or embedded into clothing.</s><s xml:id="_pbnTA3V">These include smartwatches, rings and wristbands, to name a few, and they all have high processing power and numerous sophisticated sensors that can glean new health insights.</s><s xml:id="_cuVKch4">An estimated 20% of US residents currently own a smart wearable device and the global market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25%, reaching US$70 billion by 2025 (refs 1,2 ).</s><s xml:id="_Y7u7wK4">Although the integration of this technology in the clinical workplace is still in its infancy, it has rapidly moved through the Gartner Hype Cycle for emerging technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and its adoption has further accelerated after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the explosive growth of telehealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_NParjzd">In this Review, we summarize the basic engineering principles of common

correlated to adverse cardiovascular outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and all-cause mortality and is recommended by the AHA as one of the 'Life's Simple 7' lifestyle recommendations to promote heart health <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_muRGHe8">The assessment of physical activity levels has traditionally been subjective and recorded only during clinic visits, if at all.</s><s xml:id="_XGvrTxA">This approach is limited by a lack of sufficient detail, recall bias and a failure to objectively assess physical activity in a real-life environment.</s><s xml:id="_R8hRpUG">Common statements such as "I walk five times a week for 30 minutes" do not include important information such as physical activity intensity, distance and sedentary time.</s><s xml:id="_sZdwfhk">Therefore, the subjective reporting of physical activity levels will become obsolete as digital health trends, such as wearables and smartphones, can objectively and accurately assess physical activity and energy expenditure through various sensors.</s></p><p xml:id="_77K5hkx"><s xml:id="_pbf4ZJB">The triaxial accelerometer is the dominant method of activity monitoring in current wearables and measures Smart wearable devices in cardiovascular care: where we are and how to move forward linear acceleration along three different planes.</s><s xml:id="_S6WDdHc">The other major inertial sensor is the gyroscope, which measures angular motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_tv9srtX">The common operation principle of triaxial accelerometers is based on a seismic mass attached to a mechanical suspension system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Tmagyxu">These devices take advantage of Newton's second law in which mass deflection to the opposite direction of motion with a certain amount of acceleration can be measured electrically.</s><s xml:id="_WAajHQM">The three most common types of accelerometers are the piezoresistive, piezoelectric and differential capacitive accelerometers, with the differential capacitive accelerometer being the most commonly used in wearables owing to its superior performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_5GsY9TR">In differential capacitive accelerometers, the seismic mass is suspended between two electrodes and the acceleration of the seismic mass is proportional to the differential capacitance between the electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Q3VsxS6">The advantages of these accelerometers include low power consumption, fast response to motion and superior accuracy compared with the piezoresistive model, which can be undermined by its temperature sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_urbAXgj">The placement site on the human body is one of the most important factors that affect the accuracy of accelerometer measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_FUN2RsJ">A centrally located sensor on the torso (embedded into vests, mounted by straps or attached to the skin) is best suited for detecting posture, acceleration and whole-body movements and offers the least errors compared with other body locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_wzRTucY">An ankle-mounted sensor is better suited to measure steps and energy expenditure.</s><s xml:id="_MKm8bJJ">However, wrist placement has taken precedence over ankle placement in commercial wearables owing to increased compliance and convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_74quWtk"><s xml:id="_MZWdtXB">Global Positioning System (GPS) and barometers are also included in wearables to more accurately assess physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_V5qUMUc">GPS utilizes a system of 24 or more satellites that are continuously emitting signals to identify their precise orbital position and time based on extremely accurate and stable atomic clocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_89szP88">With the use of complex equations that include signal emission time and speed of light and account for Einstein's relativistic concepts, the GPS receiver can determine its distance from at least four satellites.</s><s xml:id="_RJEDPVF">The receiver can then trilaterate its position on earth with an accuracy of up to 4.9 m (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> )</s><s xml:id="_pe6rfwG">.</s><s xml:id="_rKksPbW">However, GPS function is limited by satellite geometry, signal blockage, building reflections, atmospheric conditions and receiver design features <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_cNW9cNW">By contrast, barometers utilize a diaphragm mounted on a vacuum chamber that compresses proportional to pressure.</s><s xml:id="_p4eBYvx">The amount of deformation of the diaphragm is converted to electrical signals via a capacitive model that relies either on plates moving closer together or on a piezoresistive strain model in which resistors on the diaphragm change their electrical resistance according to the extent of deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_4GPqEkq">The barometer is then able to determine changes in altitude, track stair count and detect falls on the basis of the principle that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_rxpvEp2">However, barometric measurements can be error-prone because the device might mistake natural changes in ambient temperature and pressure as a change in altitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_dsTfgqA">Although the use of more sensors leads to better estimation of physical activity and energy expenditure, this approach can also put further strain on battery life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_t3jCz9h"><s xml:id="_ZW89pdj">Heart rate and rhythm sensors.</s><s xml:id="_wrvn8Ep">Heart rate (HR) measurements during rest and exercise can be used to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease.</s><s xml:id="_PszGyft">In healthy populations, a high resting HR has been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and all-cause death <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and is also well recognized as a predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_AtmEzFn">An impaired HR recovery after exercise correlates with increased adverse cardiovascular events <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_d5GZ4CD">HR variability (HRV) has also been strongly linked to the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in healthy individuals and in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_XEXBstE"><s xml:id="_NjXscs8">Commercial wearables measure HR and heart rhythm through electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) by calculating beat-to-beat time intervals and using algorithms to classify heart rhythm.</s><s xml:id="_B8sWvFD">ECG sensors come in various forms and are the gold standard for HR and heart rhythm measurement.</s><s xml:id="_xnvZUM7">Chest-strap monitors and ECG patches provide continuous monitoring of heart rhythm but are less appealing to the average consumer than other options such as smartwatches given their bulkiness, limited functions and long-term inconvenience.</s><s xml:id="_qCZvs2u">Some smartwatches can record a single-lead

xml:id="_SGmQHK8">as the positive electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_s5t7tAX">Single-lead ECGs are useful to diagnose simple and common arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF).</s><s xml:id="_rBmCC9r">However, these single-lead ECGs are often insufficient for the accurate diagnosis of more complex arrhythmias and other conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI) or to detect interval abnormalities unless specific manoeuvres are deployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_kVmZG4x"><s xml:id="_ssWXxxK">PPG measures changes in microvascular blood volume that translate into pulse waves and a tachogram recording <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_6UmDnTJ">An emitter sends a continuous pulse of photons through the skin and a photodetector measures the variable intensity of reflected photons from the tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_FbC58Eb">Most wearables continuously activate the PPG during exercise whereas, during rest and sleep, PPG measurements occur only intermittently to preserve battery life.</s><s xml:id="_2XpRSAX">PPG tachograms, especially when augmented by single-lead ECG, can also identify arrhythmias <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Dy9Sy3W">Nevertheless, PPG technology has limitations.</s><s xml:id="_cB6gMQ2">The main drawback is that the sensor works best when in direct contact with the skin, which is not always the case with wearables secured with straps.</s><s xml:id="_9Pbc2ge">Skin colour, moisture and even tattoos have also been postulated to affect PPG accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , although one study showed similar device performance across a full range of skin tones <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_fPJSNs7"><s xml:id="_V5AmVmk">Given the variability in HR accuracy of PPG sensors across different wearable devices, a number of studies have directly compared their performance.</s><s xml:id="_htz2Hzk">One study that investigated the accuracy of the Apple Watch 3 (Apple, USA) and the Fitbit Charge 2 (Fitbit, USA) showed that both devices provided an acceptable PPG sensor HR accuracy (&lt;10% mean absolute percent error) across 24 h and during various activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , including sitting, walking, running and activities of daily living (such as chores or brushing the teeth).</s><s xml:id="_N7SPgyN">Over 24 h, the Apple Watch 3 had a mean difference of -1.80 beats per minute and a mean agreement of 95% compared with the gold standard ECG <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> ; the Fitbit Charge 2 had a mean difference of 3.47 beats per minute and a mean agreement of 91% compared with the gold standard ECG <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_pDv9hnV">Another study evaluated the accuracy of several wrist-worn HR monitors (Fitbit Blaze, Apple Watch, Garmin Forerunner 235 (Garmin, USA), TomTom Spark Cardio (TomTom, Netherlands)) and one chest monitor (Polar H7, Polar Electro, Finland) compared with ECG in patients with established heart disease undergoing phase II or phase III cardiac rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_vcR2x3M">The chest strap had the best concordance with the standard ECG during all activities (Lin's concordance coefficient r c = 0.99); the accuracy of wrist-worn devices varied substantially by the type of activity and 5% of HR measurements were substantially inaccurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_bWuVQTv">These studies highlight that PPG HR readings from wrist-worn devices during activity should be interpreted with caution <ref type="bibr"
