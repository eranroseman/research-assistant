<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gPD5Ej6">Especially now, given indications that food insecurity rates have skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, it is critical to be able to accurately capture the range of experiences of food-insecure families.</s></p><p xml:id="_ryFhe3k"><s xml:id="_JCUDAvM">The FSSM intentionally takes a conservative approach to measuring food insecurity, meaning that it focuses on more severe cases of food insecurity, where people are cutting or skipping meals, or not eating for an entire day <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JKWXFzP">In doing so, the FSSM may be capturing households that are the most food insecure but perhaps missing other households <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_A55fEZd">Research has established that the food access dimension of food insecurity includes four domains: quantitative (insufficient quantity of food), qualitative (inadequate food quality), psychological (uncertainty and worry about food), and social (social unacceptability) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3J5yfba">However, the FSSM does not evenly represent all four domains.</s><s xml:id="_wEvWnaE">Rather, it focuses primarily on quantitative indicators of food insecurity, such as skipping meals, with less attention to qualitative indicators and little to no attention to social and psychological indicators like the sociocultural unacceptability of foods and feelings of deprivation, alienation, or shame <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, which are most relevant for mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QbgSaXf">In practice, this means that the FSSM should accurately capture people at high levels of severity, who are reducing their food intake, but may miss people at low levels of severity, who are eating foods they deem unacceptable because of food shortages or because they are feeling stress, anxiety, or shame around running out of food.</s><s xml:id="_7MHGpMz">In addition, the FSSM requires three affirmative responses (in the 18-or 10-item scales) to be classified as food insecure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_c2ehy2f">Some critics argue this cutoff may be too high given that some items have an acute focus on particularly harsh experiences like not eating for a whole day or eating so little that a person lost weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_dwKcAx2"><s xml:id="_j4dmXYQ">The development and widespread use of the FSSM is an achievement and the USA has some of the most comprehensive data on food insecurity in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_awFnDUm">However, it is worth considering its limitations and developing complementary measures.</s><s xml:id="_Psjetmr">As Maynard et al. note, we need more comprehensive measures of food insecurity to complement this data, providing a fuller picture of how the severity of food insecurity shapes health and well-being among U.S. individuals and households, in order to better inform research, programs, and policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_t7srWW5">Previous research (including the USDA's reports, based on the FSSM) clearly demonstrates that food insecurity is more prevalent in households with children and in female-headed households, Black and Latino/a/x-headed households, Native American households, households headed by people with disabilities, and households with recent immigrants an noncitizen immigrants <ref

showed good overall fit with the hypothesized four-factor model.</s><s xml:id="_8njeKbf">The relatively high factor loadings and inter-factor correlations provided evidence that the 4D-FIS assesses quantitative, qualitative, psychological, and social experiences of food insecurity.</s><s xml:id="_sACbPu5">The first major finding is related to the initial evidence for the internal consistency reliability and constructs validity of the 4D-FIS.</s><s xml:id="_rwbQ2uU">Cronbach's alpha, an indicator of internal consistency, met the recommended cut-off for the overall scale, which suggests that the 4D-FIS items have strong relationships with the latent variable (food insecurity).</s><s xml:id="_SQHUKQJ">These results are indicative of the scale's reliability.</s><s xml:id="_tbbyj2r">We developed the 4D-FIS scoring protocol to align with the qualitative data, derived from semi-structured interviews with participants about their experiences of food insecurity.</s><s xml:id="_MjtUmKg">There was better agreement between the 4D-FIS and the qualitative categorization than between the qualitative categorization and the USDA FSSM adult scale.</s><s xml:id="_JAmAadY">Overall agreement was fair when comparing categorization between both scales for three-level and binary categorizations.</s><s xml:id="_CZEYCk4">There were important differences between the two scales.</s><s xml:id="_bQuhzrZ">For the threelevel categorization, the two scales varied most categorizing participants in the less severe food insecurity category.</s><s xml:id="_AXXZYRV">For the binary categorization, the 4D-FIS categorized 68% participants as food insecure, while the FSSM categorized 61% participants as food secure.</s><s xml:id="_jDPCgME">This difference is related to the two scales' approach to scoring.</s><s xml:id="_vkFK3z7">The 4D-FIS categorizes people with at least one affirmative response as food insecure, which are a lower threshold for food insecurity than the FSSM (e.g., ≥3 items) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cvqBFFE">This cutoff (e.g., ≥1 item) is more consistent with the USDA's broad definition of food insecurity and with previous studies that recommend defining food insecurity based on one indicator of food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Bg2EpPT">Coleman-Jensen similarly described a 70% increase in the prevalence of household food insecurity when using a less conservative definition than the FSSM definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_aGEMvcV"><s xml:id="_hAjPYPE">As researchers recognize the need to broaden conceptions of food insecurity (beyond quantitative deprivation), in order to understand the experiences of underserved and vulnerable communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, comprehensive tools like the 4D-FIS can help to illuminate a wider range of experiences of food insecurity that other tools might overlook.</s><s xml:id="_cqsQ3T4">The 4D-FIS attempts to capture experiences of food insecurity that might previously have gone undocumented using measures like the FSSM.</s><s xml:id="_PGwp8BE">However, this less conservative approach also means that more participants would be categorized as food insecure.</s></p><p xml:id="_z8kB3wC"><s xml:id="_Cz6BYhT">Second, our study demonstrates the importance of examining the full range of food insecurity experiences, particularly psychological and social experiences.</s><s xml:id="_WEbCP9x">The 4D-FIS included items for the psychological (n = 3) and social (n = 4) experiences.</s><s xml:id="_rC7Nfk2">When we compared the patterns of responses to the 4D-FIS with the qualitative data from the interviews, evidence suggested that affirmative responses to the qualitative and social subscales of the 4D-FIS aligned with less severe food insecurity (as defined by the qualitative data), while affirmative responses to the quantitative and psychological subscales aligned with more severe food insecurity.</s><s xml:id="_B43AV5Q">Prior research has outlined a progression of food insecurity, in which the psychological experiences (e.g., worry) are associated with less severe experiences and the quantitative experiences (e.g., reductions in food intake) are associated with more severe experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ArCk6Gu">While our results supported social experiences (assessed in the 4D-FIS) as part of less severe food insecurity, our results did not support psychological experiences as part of less severe food insecurity.</s><s xml:id="_49A3Zf4">Instead, psychological experiences reflected more severe food insecurity.</s><s xml:id="_pPVRcVf">Review papers have provided evidence that food insecurity is associated with stress and depressive symptoms, especially for women and people from high-income countries like the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k9Ju8Z6">This sample of participants was from of a 5-year project conducted in rural and urban areas of North Carolina.</s><s xml:id="_Qm2PRQw">Data shown are from female caregivers who participated in year 3 (n = 109).</s></p><p xml:id="_TVHF8ev"><s xml:id="_PynYpFh">a One participant reported more than one race/ethnic category (1%).</s></p><p xml:id="_MYhsz9m"><s xml:id="_GUPHHuF">b Assessed with the USDA FSSM adult scale.</s><s xml:id="_UaWS5Xk">Food secure included categories of high and marginal food security; food insecure included categories of low and very low food security <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CHkhtZB"><s xml:id="_z8NyWby">More research is needed to understand how the psychological and social indicators of food insecurity, traditionally considered less severe, may threaten well-being or mental health, especially for vulnerable subgroups <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KSNuNnH">Based on our findings, the 4D-FIS has potential as a reliable and valid tool and can be tested more broadly.</s><s xml:id="_7nnPRJj">Health professionals (researchers and practitioners) need practical and flexible tools that can work in low-resource settings and with diverse populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DkEt2jY">Like the FSSM, the 4D-FIS does not require a lot of time and can be administered in a variety of settings (e.g., homes and clinics).</s><s xml:id="_jF5mNWu">However, the 4D-FIS has distinct features that make this tool valuable for assessing food insecurity within specific communities or settings.</s><s xml:id="_7E4MjX2">First, the 4D-FIS includes framing text and options for non-verbal response options to facilitate administration with different samples and settings.</s><s xml:id="_GF9BJaM">Second, by including nonquantitative (in particular, psychological and social) domains of food insecurity, the 4D-FIS captures a wider range of experiences of food insecurity.</s><s xml:id="_95qZ8Yn">For example, critics note that the FSSM fails to address feelings of deprivation and social unacceptability, which are part of food insecurity experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and that the FSSM may overlook individuals or households dealing with less severe food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CuMZv8T">Prior research points to a need for more comprehensive measures of food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, particularly at lower levels of food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EJS8Eb2">By assessing people's experiences of food insecurity more fully, researchers can better understand relationships between food insecurity, diet, health, and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, and practitioners and policymakers can obtain evidence needed to inform programs and policies for specific subgroups and settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_hzFdeZR"><s xml:id="_G3WQ9Ud">This study had limitations related to the scale development procedures and to its reliance on cross-sectional data from a relatively small sample of women.</s><s xml:id="_6ZFTZge">The 4D-FIS was administered at one time to a development sample and not administered to a validation sample.</s><s xml:id="_rPJwQ2D">The sample size (n = 109) was lower than the recommended sample size (n ≥ 200) for confirmatory factor analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, although the sample size met the minimum for a 16-item scale (e.g., 5-10 observations per item <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>) and scale development projects have been completed with sample sizes &lt;200 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7H7wxuV">The smaller sample represented the intended population of women who are at risk of food insecurity (e.g., women with children and women of color, from low-income and rural households <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_usc7cbp">Representativeness of both participants and settings is important for research to have real-world relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pb5gmJb">While it was advantageous that the sample was representative of women at risk of food insecurity, the sample was not representative of all adult subgroups at risk for food insecurity, in particular because it excluded men, which limits generalizability.</s><s xml:id="_5EAyswm">This study did not include Factor loadings and standard errors were from the confirmatory factor analysis.</s><s xml:id="_qhupGkQ">There were four factors representing the four domains of food insecurity: quantitative, qualitative, psychological, and social.</s><s xml:id="_RMw6dGB">Indicators represent the 16 items included in the 4D-FIS.</s><s xml:id="_bwMgS5P">A factor loading with a magnitude &gt; 0.7 is considered high <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HYS8dGV">The variance is

<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5bYZ5bF">Women (and mothers specifically) have traditionally been the focus of childhood obesity research.</s><s xml:id="_cySdDZa">Given that men and women experience food insecurity differently <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, additional research is required to explore gendered aspects of food insecurity.</s><s xml:id="_j5ESNyM">Participants were recruited from only one region in the Southeast USA and this region is not representative of all communities.</s><s xml:id="_RAM7nC5">Future research is required to administer the 4D-FIS with larger and more representative samples and evaluate its reliability and validity.</s></p><p xml:id="_4ecJKHF"><s xml:id="_g3cnKBa">Unique strengths of the study included the rigor in application of recommended scale development procedures, including the utilization of qualitative and quantitative data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, purposeful sample of women at-risk of food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and the research team.</s><s xml:id="_kp57fSv">Although cognitive interviewing was not possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, when developing the 4D-FIS and interview script, a diverse research team considered participants' concerns and issues of linguistic and cultural relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J9DxYyX">Additionally, the 4D-FIS was designed to be interviewer-administered to facilitate administration with participants.</s><s xml:id="_DS9HYFC">Cohen et

target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fYkYucA">The 4D-FIS development process makes the tool potentially more valuable for assessing food insecurity for people in a range of demographic subgroups
