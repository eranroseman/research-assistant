<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_JuGgPyg"><p xml:id="_62fdBqu"><s xml:id="_epTyPt9">We read with great interest the recently published article by Patel et al <ref type="bibr">1</ref> and commend the authors for their tremendous efforts to tackle this challenging and important research question.</s><s xml:id="_NwbYp8w">We recognize and appreciate that the authors correctly note that the findings from their study ".are intended to provide a description of trends in use of EC data in support HTA decisions, and not to provide a causal link between the use of RWD or EC data and the probability of a successful submission."</s><s xml:id="_mDgmZQX">Nevertheless, we believe that despite this caveat, a number of the findings from Patel et al 1 may be placed out of context and risk providing readers with causal interpretations about the impact that external comparators (ECs) may have on health technology assessment (HTA) recommendations.</s></p><p xml:id="_d8kaa5F"><s xml:id="_QWYBFbZ">Their finding that 59% of submissions (51 of 87) based on single-arm trials that used real-world data (RWD) ECs received positive decisions, a greater proportion than submissions with trial-based EC data (49%) or no EC data (43%), was notable.</s><s xml:id="_7Q3AxnN">Partnered with their statement that they found ".that adding RWD ECs resulted in a higher acceptance rate than observed when prior trial ECs or no EC data at all were used."</s><s xml:id="_BZBnqCf">and a discussion section titled "Impact of ECs on HTA Decision Making," the article may imply to the casual reader that, when faced with single-arm trials, ECs based on RWD represent an optimal and well-accepted solution for providing comparative evidence on single-arm trials to HTA bodies.</s></p><p xml:id="_wt7zQNK"><s xml:id="_zX7tNhj">HTA as defined by HTAi is "a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine the value of a health technology at different points in its lifecycle." <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As such, it involves decisions on the value of health technologies being made after the appraisal of a significant body of clinical, humanistic, and economic evidence.</s><s xml:id="_aWJyBrY">The varying and sometimes opaque approach to valuing these various pieces of evidence renders it difficult to quantify the specific importance of a single piece of evidence in the overall HTA decision process. <ref type="bibr">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_y9jsSjh">In our view, this is a particular issue for assessments using RWD, and therefore, we are unsurprised that in reviewing HTA commentaries Patel et al 1 found it ".challenging to find clear reasons for higher acceptability for RWD ECs over other types of EC datasets.." Furthermore, in our experience, where detailed commentaries are provided, they are often critical of RWD ECs and suggestive that the HTA body would be inclined not to use or give any specific weight to such data in their decision making.</s><s xml:id="_bFfWazB">We provide selected examples of such cases in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref></s><s xml:id="_banmU6u">5]<ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> Notably, findings of this nature have been reported in the regulatory setting, with a recent analysis of EC submissions in oncology to the US Food and Drug Administration finding that none of the ECs directly influenced Food and Drug Administration decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_69aHFzy">We believe it may benefit readers to know whether the authors encountered similar findings during their review of HTA commentaries and, importantly, whether they found any cases where RWD ECs appeared to play a pivotal role in supporting a positive decision.</s><s xml:id="_EPwf32p">Similarly, a finding that did not receive any attention in Patel et al <ref type="bibr">1</ref> is the fact that the proportion of HTAs with "no recommendation" are approximately double among HTAs that used previous clinical trials with or without real-world evidence as EC (whereas the proportion of negative recommendations are close to identical among the 3 groups).</s><s xml:id="_smgNCMw">These situations could have represented an opportunity to better incorporate RWD but equally likely may have been the result of the limitations of existing guidance on the use of previous clinical trials as EC.</s></p><p xml:id="_X4cxgRJ"><s xml:id="_54eyt2Z">Although HTA bodies such as NICE have acknowledged the need to use a variety of approaches to generate relative treatment effects when faced with single-arm data, the value HTA decision makers place on such data remains unclear.</s><s xml:id="_Bpxw8Xs">The need for HTA bodies to consider RWD ECs to enable patient access to beneficial medicines is becoming increasingly crucial as new treatments are being developed for rare patient populations where randomized controlled trials are hard or impossible to perform.</s><s xml:id="_39wskkx">To do this, multistakeholder (including HTA, regulator, patient, healthcare professional, and industry) efforts are needed to provide more concrete guidance on how to collect and analyze RWD in ways that will reduce uncertainty in the HTA decision-making process to enable patient access to vital and beneficial medicines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_RcUyQeC">Considerable developments in guidelines and processes and the transparency and clarity of HTA outputs will be required to better support the imperative use of RWD as an EC.</s><s xml:id="_k3y3GaR">In the interim, the work of Patel et al 1 is important in highlighting the trends but cannot be interpreted as a definitive answer to the preferred EC approach and needs to be complemented with further research.</s><s xml:id="_KMb5wQb">Translated feedback:</s></p><p xml:id="_kFmtBrH"><s xml:id="_v4qaU95">The level of proof of the results is questionable, in particular for the following reasons: Choice of studies serving as control groups not specified when writing the protocol for the single arm trial Heterogeneity of studies (clinical studies and observational studies) in SCHOLAR-1 No systematic analysis of the differential biases of the observational studies included in the indirect comparison provided No rationale provided for the prognostic factors considered.</s><s xml:id="_FtMVWws">Disparities between studies, in particular on: -very different median followup times; -on the characteristics of patients and the disease that cannot be overlapped, the proportion of relapsed and refractory patients; -on the treatment history (autograft) and the number of previous treatment lines; Accordingly, these indirect comparisons are presented for illustrative purposes only.</s><s xml:id="_kRBvnjT">No reliable estimate of the difference in effect of this drug compared to current treatment can be made from these indirect comparisons. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_KqFyjbD">ntinued on next page</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_NFvKWzb"><s xml:id="_ySHUKHq">Letters to the Editor The (Harsh) Reality of Real-World Data External Comparators for Health Technology Assessment Oliver Cox, MSc, Cormac Sammon, PhD, Alex Simpson, MSc, Radek Wasiak, PhD, Sreeram Ramagopalan, PhD, Kristian Thorlund, PhD</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
