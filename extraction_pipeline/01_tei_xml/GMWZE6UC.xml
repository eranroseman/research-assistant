type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> with the mining of opinions in customer reviews and online news.</s><s xml:id="_BjT56dU">The initial task considered was to distinguish positive from negative reviews (referred to as polarity analysis) or subjective from objective parts of a text (referred to as subjectivity analysis).</s><s xml:id="_q4C8FAx">Later on, additional tasks were introduced: emotion analysis determines the emotional category of texts (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_GBkxFyN">anger, disgust) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> while intensity analysis focuses on identifying different levels of polarity or emotion (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_axMnT9Q">very positive, very sad).</s></p><p xml:id="_qsA275t"><s xml:id="_hacHY4z">Existing sentiment analysis methods developed for processing unstructured text in web media treat the task as a classification problem: a classifier is trained to detect the polarity at sentence or document level.</s><s xml:id="_QPf3W6q">For example, Pang et al. presented a series of supervised methods such as naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM) and maximum entropy classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mNH4n6n">An unsupervised mechanism has been developed by Turney, who proposed a solution to recognize the semantic orientation of texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_UESTGs5"><s xml:id="_UbQK44b">These approaches are based on feature sets including semantic or lexical features.</s><s xml:id="_MRfEApG">Often, the underlying assumption is that sentiment is explicitly mentioned in the text, and is thus manifested in opinionated words.</s><s xml:id="_wNcnXpK">Normally, adjectives, adverbs and specific nouns express sentiments in free texts.</s><s xml:id="_WwbGzWk">Given this, conventional sentiment analysis is based on the detection and analysis of such opinionated terms (semantic features).</s><s xml:id="_XC2zq3y">These terms are usually categorized into the categories positive, negative and neutral and made available in sentiment lexicons (see Section 3.2).</s><s xml:id="_wyQ4jay">The latter are then exploited by sentiment analysis algorithms to identify the opinionated terms and their polarity in a text through lexicon-lookup.</s></p><p xml:id="_e6YvhSu"><s xml:id="_3KtkeNV">Apart from a lexicon-lookup to identify opinionated terms, additional features can be extracted from texts for exploitation in sentiment analysis methods.</s><s xml:id="_jwAubWe">They include lexical features such as unigrams, bigrams and parts of speech.</s></p><p xml:id="_JMPef7h"><s xml:id="_FAfyXmF">Sentiment analysis can be considered at different levels: at the level of a word, aspect, sentence and document.</s><s xml:id="_Prx6kVc">Pang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> considered the problem at document level.</s><s xml:id="_YPGEvyn">However, there is a need for fine-grained approaches to sentiment analysis.</s><s xml:id="_3BmS9kZ">Aspect-based analysis aims to identify the aspects of entities and assigns a sentiment to each aspect (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_dtFcntj">The CD is good but it was too expensive describes two aspects, the content of the CD and its price) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6u5FCkh"><s xml:id="_dSSUr6A">Studies have shown that sentiment analysis is often domaindependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> since the polarity of single terms can differ depending on the context they are used in.</s><s xml:id="_pY2rT5J">For that reason, feature models on which a machine learning classifier is based, need to be trained on domain-specific datasets.</s><s xml:id="_Vvjy7qG">Lexicons need to be adapted to the domain-specific interpretations of words.</s><s xml:id="_c8bgV64">An approach to domain-independent sentiment analysis was presented by Montejo-Raez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dbVmYer">They represented each term in a tweet as a vector of weighted WordNet synsets that are semantically close to the term.</s><s xml:id="_n3TBz4Y">The weights were used in SentiWordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to estimate the polarity.</s></p><p xml:id="_9yFYGew"><s xml:id="_PKUakXt">Limited work is available on sentiment analysis from fairly objective texts.</s><s xml:id="_tRE7GYk">Balahur et al. applied sentiment analysis methods to news articles to separate the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on a target and to mark explicit opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_e5qHtKj">For this particular text type of news articles, opinion is "conveyed through facts that are interpretable by the emotion they convey" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XSACuQt">This is to a certain extent comparable to sentiment analysis in healthcare: sentiment can be conveyed through diseases, treatments or medical conditions and they impact a patient's

xml:id="_UwsyQVJ"><s xml:id="_Y5HxEGw">While conventional methods have mainly focused on determining explicit sentiment expression, the annotation scheme proposed by Deng et al. <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_XJcHPHW">Health status aggregation.</s><s xml:id="_W3HGNMf">For physicians, sentiment analysis results can be used to identify and summarize the health status of a patient and its development over time in general or for specific medical conditions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_ybCAk4w">By extracting and aggregating the attitudes and intentions expressed in clinical narratives from all the cooperating physicians an overall status from different medical perspectives can be illustrated based on the extracted opinions.</s><s xml:id="_xZ64a5E">Physicians diagnose the status of the patient progressively through examinations, observations and discussions with others.</s><s xml:id="_6auzS3Y">Each step reflects one aspect of the patient's status.</s><s xml:id="_bVnMZZs">Recovering the status information and personal perceptions of individual health carers is necessary to reconstruct the entire status of the patient, since it provides the connection between treatment, and the transition of treatments as well as the outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_EBYZZRS"><s xml:id="_ncKU6m4">To demonstrate this usage, consider a patient with a longterm medical condition such as diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_pVpDXBV">From time to time, additional medical conditions related to diabetes occur.</s><s xml:id="_Dzk6Nkw">Multiple physicians are involved in treatment.</s><s xml:id="_gxREdrC">However, the general practitioner receives clinical summaries from the other colleagues and needs to aggregate this information.</s><s xml:id="_86PqC9s">Sentiment analysis methods could be applied to generate a curve over time showing the patient's health status as a whole.</s><s xml:id="_DtBfKzh">Information could also be plotted for individual medical conditions that have occurred for some time and been treated.</s><s xml:id="_2HpY9Rb">Updated by changes to their medication (including dosage) as well as any surgery or other treatment carried out, a graph like this could provide an initial overview of the patient's current status and the development of their health.</s><s xml:id="_dvf6Srz">In this way, decision-making can take into account the patient's overall status reconstructed from the "wisdom of crowds" scattered in multiple clinical narratives.</s></p><p xml:id="_7BnQgm2"><s xml:id="_bTkHext">Similarly, a graph like this could also help patients monitor their own health.</s><s xml:id="_K7cqqCk">When such a graph is generated from patient questionnaires or online diaries, information can be compared to clinical information to see whether the clinical impression matches the patient's perceptions.</s></p><p xml:id="_UVr84xt"><s xml:id="_VGywdub">Quality assessment.</s><s xml:id="_TaUTp8T">Sentiment analysis could be used to collect statistical information on the outcome of treatments in response to a medical condition to improve clinical decision-making and quality management.</s><s xml:id="_S8WjXDx">For example, it would enable analysis of how often a certain complication or critical event occurs following a specific treatment.</s><s xml:id="_sHcBWVh">Thus, for a hospital manager and resource planner, sentiment analysis results can provide a basic quantitative parameter based on different medical narratives which can be used as a reference for quality assessment, planning and scheduling.</s></p><p xml:id="_zamytPX"><s xml:id="_VCeMaKW">Furthermore, consider patients in palliative (end-of-life) care: They require not only anaesthetic treatment to eliminate the symptoms and pain, but also the mental support of practitioners and comfort from social connections.</s><s xml:id="_2EtgvnB">Patient's feedback in the palliative ward is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.</s><s xml:id="_7PThCpy">Based on the feedback from patients reflected in nurse notes, different aspects of treatment can be evaluated and therapy adjusted accordingly.</s></p><p xml:id="_qS8eg8z"><s xml:id="_mMEm4Kr">Outcome research.</s><s xml:id="_8hg7JGM">For researchers, sentiment analysis methods can be employed to extract and classify the outcome of different types of medical treatment and learn about their effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_2nzhC3X">This would facilitate the labour-intensive user studies of treatment.</s><s xml:id="_kDUZrtJ">Furthermore, sentiment analysis could be harnessed to perform a retrospective analysis of treatment processes and outcome research.</s><s xml:id="_WG3CW63">Information about treatment outcome is captured in clinical documents and biomedical literature.</s><s xml:id="_8mgthCs">An automatic analysis of patient records with respect to sentiment could help in learning more about outcomes and influence factors of diseases and treatments.</s><s xml:id="_zAvaDHV">Considering the individual patient's treatment, sentiment analysis methods could support in the collection of information about the patient's health status, or the detection of critical events that occurred during treatment.</s><s xml:id="_kqR4RqA">For example, information on problems such as severe haemorrhaging could be extracted from operation records.</s><s xml:id="_bVAwGre">Such information might be relevant in surgical planning.</s><s xml:id="_yxpCppE">Moreover, decisions on follow-up treatment should also take into consideration any problems occurring during an intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_g8UQkQA"><s xml:id="_rtWkH2C">Sentiment analysis could be employed to gain insights from both medical social media and clinical documents regarding the effectiveness of a treatment or medication.</s><s xml:id="_AdgSuez">Social media provide an additional source of information previously unconsidered.</s><s xml:id="_WmADWwU">They offer the opportunity to learn from patients' experiences since they describe their personal perceptions of types of treatment in social media such as drug reviews.</s><s xml:id="_hNbh2TQ">This information augments the more implicitly described information on effectiveness in clinical narratives and biomedical literature.</s></p></div>
