asking "Do you use an activity tracker?" and the interviews began with a vague request along the lines of: "I'm interested to hear what trackers you use, what you like and dislike, and so on."</s><s xml:id="_3dDK69a">This request was not met with a naming of what apps and devices that person had, or what kinds of thing they wanted to measure, but something more akin to a life story.</s><s xml:id="_G7KC7xd">Often this story concerned weight management, or ever-developing interests in sports and training.</s><s xml:id="_aRbQraj">Often this story involved family and friends.</s><s xml:id="_99KV9DM">Often the story extended over years, and followed people who would move countries, form and leave relationships, and start or change careers.</s><s xml:id="_SRrm8Jj">Tracking was explained in terms of people's lives, worries, hopes, interests, careers and so on.</s><s xml:id="_bT9nFEQ">Something that we were perhaps a little underprepared for was the emotionality of activity tracking.</s><s xml:id="_MzHcYhj">For most people, tracking was directly tied to self-esteem.</s><s xml:id="_GwbXAd2">For some it tied into pride at completing marathons, achieving fantastic speeds on a bicycle and/or raising thousands of pounds for charity.</s><s xml:id="_bvaJKFv">For others the tracker tied into body image problems, to aging, and/or to broken relationships.</s><s xml:id="_TYjDUcH">Often tracking seemed to tie into people's mental health.</s><s xml:id="_qeaAMbv">The situation is reminiscent of McCarthy and Wright's discussion of "technology as experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and we find ourselves drawn to their call for design to engage with the felt life.</s></p><p xml:id="_V3xsWkv"><s xml:id="_2FQfyMQ">There was a range of different people in the study.</s><s xml:id="_JVSgaQu">Not only were their circumstances different, but there were clear differences of interest and personality.</s><s xml:id="_X98kT2y">Some people identified as being (in the words of P3) "a stats person" and liking to see data, charts and other information.</s><s xml:id="_JRT4Mp4">Some people were very organized and tidy.</s><s xml:id="_My9Kfn3">Others said they were (in the words of P1) "not a data person at all", but made the effort to track and even found they could take pleasure in it.</s><s xml:id="_pVRyJMJ">Some reported that they were (in the words of P4) "into fitness" whereas others were (in the words of P2) "not a gym person".</s><s xml:id="_f5XXPwV">One person was P13 "into games" but another P14 "not a games person".</s><s xml:id="_YGGNaBy">Each person, in his/her own way, made the activity of tracking his/her own.</s><s xml:id="_x8BZJv8">Although participants regularly referred to personality, it seems unlikely that cognitive models can explain their tracking.</s><s xml:id="_RC9bsaw">Personality was only part of a larger story of body image, family, personal circumstances and so on.</s></p><p xml:id="_ju9QaG8"><s xml:id="_2Nu4rxm">Nobody was just a user in this study.</s><s xml:id="_kQffsSZ">Behaviour change, where this was even an issue, was not being done with a tracker, but across multiple technologies over time.</s><s xml:id="_hwsvemH">Nobody had downloaded an app or bought a device and then decided to lose weight or start running because of it, but rather they were using apps often over short-term periods to support longer-term interests and issues.</s><s xml:id="_gpNAzHk">Sometimes apps and devices would inspire people to walk more, or perhaps follow a training plan.</s><s xml:id="_zK6SZ3v">Only one participant was interested in the retrospective use of long-term data.</s><s xml:id="_3dCdzjZ">Tracking data is overwhelmingly for use in the short term.</s><s xml:id="_rqyM2xu">In fact, personal tracking might best be understood as prospective rather than retrospective.</s><s xml:id="_4K9aF8X">Tracking is often about where you are heading in life.</s><s xml:id="_AaywpmJ">It is often about trying to lose weight, about training for a marathon and similar goals.</s><s xml:id="_Wxqzs8w">People here do not aspire to do dispassionate data analysis about their bodies, but on the contrary, are doing something deeply emotional and often passionately focused on a future.</s><s xml:id="_7WrBC8J">We are reminded of Ingold's notion of "dwelling" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FN2nupV">When people track their activities (when they dwell in data) they are not building a description of their lives, but are wayfaring in information.</s><s xml:id="_HN2477k">To know ourselves is not to look at the past or even to the present, but to the future.</s><s xml:id="_sX9n7ep">Ingold uses the term 'wayfaring' specifically to suggest that one is not following a set path to one's imagined future but is navigating using a variety of information, cues and intuitions as best one can.</s><s xml:id="_rVuzqY7">Knowing oneself may involve collecting and reflecting on information about oneself but is for the purposes of a life being lived.</s><s xml:id="_DxqK4gG">In Harper's <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> terms, tracking is part of "a praxis of living".</s></p><p xml:id="_UXgxhGH"><s xml:id="_jXY67yJ">Our observations about 'documentary' and 'diagnostic' tracking are a little closer to the vision of personal informatics than our observations of other forms of tracking.</s><s xml:id="_Bc7upBH">Here people seem to want to create a reasonably accurate account of something, but for the sake of understanding routine, keeping a record or finding something out.</s><s xml:id="_W8S3nkX">These forms of tracking are not long term, and can sometimes playfully involve the creation of false data.</s><s xml:id="_Sw3tc44">Building a long term, accurate record was a minority pursuit.</s><s xml:id="_shnPQwP">Long-term collection may become popular and may prove very valuable, but we emphasise that to track over the short term is not necessarily to give up or fail.</s></p><p xml:id="_ah6GCZp"><s xml:id="_vkNxbUw">To characterize the situation we have observed we introduce the term 'lived informatics'.</s><s xml:id="_FHXXwfW">With this term we are underscoring our observations, trying to characterize a state of affairs rather than laying out a vision.</s><s xml:id="_aDgMDTv">The term is meant to mean just that people are using information and finding its meaning in their day-to-day lives.</s><s xml:id="_zbEmWGz">Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have previously pointed out that people collect personal data for reasons other than personal informatics, such as reminiscing about the past, aiding memory, and personal information management.</s><s xml:id="_TeP2Gr8">But our point is more radical.</s><s xml:id="_4VawVWk">We are not saying that things are done in addition to personal informatics, but that personal informatics must be done over a range of lived activities.</s><s xml:id="_nc9Zp6E">We do not suggest that our work undermines the grand vision of personal informatics.</s><s xml:id="_h3Pt7xk">All we do is show it is unrealistic to assume that people can or want to do rational data collection, and act only when data has been validated and thoroughly analysed.</s><s xml:id="_vyFYNNU">From a lived informatics perspective, we suggest:</s></p><p xml:id="_mWTHtjQ"><s xml:id="_2UCvsVt">• Do not expect people to act as rational data scientists.</s></p><p xml:id="_sQuP6FN"><s xml:id="_3Xgsnzr">Understand that people will pick and choose trackers, switch over time, and will have times when they track a lot and times when they track just a little.</s><s xml:id="_gt7saXd">Consider collecting metadata on app use alongside activity data.</s></p><p xml:id="_8FhYTCD"><s xml:id="_Qkvwbaj">• (Re)consider personal tracking as social tracking.</s><s xml:id="_2PcNEgS">Look beyond support for publishing data to social networks, for example to co-present tracking, kinship, friendship, support, competition and play.</s></p><p xml:id="_XwNCpY9"><s xml:id="_2qtvbZf">• Design for interweaving, not just integration.</s><s xml:id="_HYRCBbk">It is not reasonable to expect that people will have a rational set of trackers each with a clearly defined function.</s><s xml:id="_vpkYa7p">When evaluating a new technology, consider how it might be used alongside others in an information ecology.</s></p><p xml:id="_RFzB6hf"><s xml:id="_fTmUAwD">• Consider that behaviour change is not just a possible outcome of using an individual technology, but is something that is achieved by people, potentially across various technologies that they interweave.</s></p><p xml:id="_dZvTDFA"><s xml:id="_7dvWRZx">• Recognise that data can be meaningful in the context it is produced, but may lose meaning when it is removed from that context.</s></p><p xml:id="_37YfM6X"><s xml:id="_SA84FTN">• Evaluation should address more than measuring 'improvements' in activity.</s><s xml:id="_2xdPuth">Consider, for example, the emotionality, the hope and the fun people may have.</s></p><p xml:id="_tTAw77z"><s xml:id="_xcYXZ5p">• Attend to the physicality of tracking.</s><s xml:id="_tSf4hcw">This includes the physicality of phones when designing smartphone apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_DwExzr5"><s xml:id="_gmk54Px">We have critiqued personal informatics but must emphasise this is from a perspective that does not address or envisage what might be most effective in terms of public health.</s><s xml:id="_Snxv8N2">We have explored the perspectives of current users of personal trackers, and we seek to open discussion of what people want, do, and experience when using personal trackers.</s></p></div>		</body>
