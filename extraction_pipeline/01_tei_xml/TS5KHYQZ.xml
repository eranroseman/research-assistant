of telepsychology suggest that gender role variables may have affected these changes.</s><s xml:id="_JqWvqZc">For example, given that women tend to provide the majority of childcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bianchi, Sayer, Milkie, &amp; Robinson, 2012)</ref>, woman-identifying psychologists with children may have experienced a greater need to increase telepsychology use in order to facilitate provision of care at home after schools and childcare options were closed.</s><s xml:id="_rC6bntq">Psychologists in rural locations may have experienced a lower demand for telepsychology, as initial rates of COVID-19 cases were generally higher in more populated states <ref type="bibr">(CDC, 2020a)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7DRhfDV">Previous research indicates rural psychologists have been less likely to use telepsychology within their practice <ref type="bibr">(Pierce et al., 2020a)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jvUUdVQ">With that in mind, rural psychologists eager to offer their expertise to help areas more severely affected by the pandemic may experience the added benefit of filling openings within their schedules <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Centore &amp; Milacci, 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_P295xDC">Rural psychologists or their patients may also have had limited access to technology required for telepsychology such as reliable high-speed Internet.</s><s xml:id="_gFY5BVg">The findings regarding training and policies underscore the importance of adequate organizational support in addressing both environmental and intrapsychic barriers to telepsychology use.</s><s xml:id="_hepZnVT">This is reinforced by the finding that psychologists in VA medical centers reported higher percentage use before COVID-19 than psychologists in all other primary practice settings except individual practice, given VHA's history of telepsychology infrastructure and accessibility of training (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Caver et al., 2020)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_cDqxekt"><s xml:id="_msECbvn">Finally, the current study explored therapeutic issues and diagnoses associated with increased telepsychology use during the pandemic in comparison to telepsychology use prior to the pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_BZcwFMP">These results suggested that some presenting concerns may be less amenable to clinical work via telepsychology, or that psychologists treating these issues experienced greater concerns about the use of telepsychology.</s><s xml:id="_PgBFJsa">It should be noted that while the overall regression model uncovered a medium-sized effect, the unique effects within the model were quite small and should be interpreted through that lens.</s><s xml:id="_FjkJWnx">The findings might suggest that psychologists believe that complex or severe symptomatology such as antisocial personality disorder, behavioral issues, and bipolar disorder may be more difficult to treat via telepsychology or may require specialized training for psychologists to feel comfortable adapting treatment to telepsychology; psychologists may also be reluctant to treat these issues via telepsychology because of perceived safety concerns.</s><s xml:id="_6W7WsKB">Traumatic brain injury and physical medicine and rehabilitation may be difficult to treat via telepsychology because of the need to coordinate care with in-person services like medical examinations and physical therapy.</s><s xml:id="_eUChZ2s">Testing and evaluation were also associated with lower increases in telepsychology uptake, which could indicate limited access to tests adapted for telepsychology use and concerns regarding test security.</s><s xml:id="_XtYpsYg">In contrast, anxiety, relationship difficulties, sleep/insomnia, and women's issues were associated with greater increases in telepsychology uptake.</s><s xml:id="_8vrypGK">To some extent, this finding may be impacted by increased rates of problems in these areas related to COVID-19 and therefore to increased demand for services.</s><s xml:id="_2CPFb2N">However, these results also suggest that these issues may be particularly amenable to treatment via telepsychology or that psychologists are more open to providing for these concerns using telepsychology.</s></p></div>
