<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1" xml:id="_vmgakVZ">INTRODUCTION</head><p xml:id="_TNdCxsS"><s xml:id="_SCt33B6">Over recent years, an increasing number of systems aimed at changing behavior have been designed by Human-Computer Interaction ( HCI ) researchers, as well as made available commercially, offering opportunities for behavior tracking and interventions that were hitherto unavailable.</s><s xml:id="_sGCPxrY">The field of "persuasive" <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[Fogg 2009</ref> ] and behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[Hekler et al. 2013 ]</ref> technologies precisely focuses on the opportunities for yielding behavioral changes in domains as diverse as health <ref type="bibr">[Luo et al. 2018 ]</ref>, safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Chin et al. 2017 ]</ref>, sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Gentile and Mylonopoulou 2017 ]</ref>,</s></p><p xml:id="_bWxcYqJ"><s xml:id="_UPkPKKp">and work <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[Whittaker et al. 2016 ]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sBxjTGs">The growing popularity of self-tracking devices has further promoted technology-based interventions on behavior: in the so-called "quantified self" rhetoric, people lack knowledge about themselves, and the personal information collected by wearables and tracking apps can support them in reviewing and reflecting upon their own behavior, possibly leading to its modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[Rapp and Tirassa 2017 ]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_QEzYHSM"><s xml:id="_uTrGWAb">As the very name of this research area points out,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> the majority of behavior change technologies are addressed to modify a specific, target, behavior.</s><s xml:id="_hw7rjDW">This may appear obvious, as they are designed to solve a supposed well-defined behavioral problem, like losing weight or stopping smoking.</s><s xml:id="_X3j5qQZ">However, on a closer look, we may see that the focus on the target behavior often clouds the wider context in which it is embedded, that is the "life" of the individual, meant as a nexus of practices, meanings, experiences, and concerns, which characterize her everydayness.</s><s xml:id="_vkgf2ms">This happens as most behavior change designs rely on the idea that the central, not to say exclusive, focus of the technological intervention should be the behavior, conceived as a sort of "quantum" that can be isolated and studied from an external point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[Rapp et al. 2019 ]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d4wPtmE">From this perspective, behavior is an objective phenomenon, which has more or less the same meaning for every individual and can be effectively manipulated without considering the subjective experience of the person.</s></p><p xml:id="_vHEk4Bh"><s xml:id="_FC6S8Mf">Designers have found this way to see behavior pragmatically useful because it enables the identification of well-defined variables that can be easily tackled and turned into design solutions, also allowing for the precise measurement of the successfulness of the intervention (e.g., whether the number of smoked cigarettes has been decreased or not).</s><s xml:id="_j3E3WHp">It is worth noticing that such an approach to behavior change has brought successes [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hamari et al. 2014 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Hermsen et al. 2016 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">Orji and Moffatt 2018 ]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_umpgDej">However, over the years, an increasing number of studies have also started questioning the capability of technologies grounded in this perspective to produce enduring changes in behavior and sustain the user engagement during the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Caraban et al. 2019 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">Baumesteir et al. 1994 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">Agapie et al. 2016a ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Kovacs et al. 2021 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Egebark and EkstrÃ¶m 2016 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Caraban et al. 2019</ref> ].</s></p><p xml:id="_t9CKr7Z"><s xml:id="_y7fCv3y">It may be useful, therefore, to start exploring an alternative approach that, rather than paying attention exclusively to the behavior, may extend our perspective to the wider individual's life, diving into the subjective and "existential" aspects of the behavior change process.</s><s xml:id="_DNbtfwR">With the term "existential" we refer to existentialism and existential psychology tradition pointing to certain fundamental concerns that are an inescapable part of the human being's existence in the world, like our intrinsic finitude and frailty, the difficulty of knowing and being known by others, and the need of being authentic <ref type="bibr">[Kaptelinen 2018 ]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_XnPGcVp"><s xml:id="_vZQqZqV">To this aim, in this article, we investigate how people deal with behavior change using technology, embedding the "behavior change issue" into the person's "life."</s><s xml:id="_nq9bpK8">Building upon research framed within the so-called third HCI wave <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[BÃ¸dker 2006</ref> ] or paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[Harrison et al. 2007</ref> ] and responding to the recent call to tackle existential issues in HCI [Kaptelinin 2018 ], we interviewed 23 individuals that used a behavior change system to modify their own behavior, exploring their lived experience: through semi-structured interviews, we investigated how participants connected their experiences of change through technology to their existential concerns and the life-context in which they occurred.</s><s xml:id="_YfDbRP7">By framing our investigation in this perspective, we hypothesize that different aspects of behavior change would emerge, which, in turn, might enrich the design of systems for modifying behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_9yFUETS"><s xml:id="_dwHV3ks">In sum, we will try to answer questions like: How do individuals experience and account for the changes that they want to produce in their own behavior?</s><s xml:id="_X9xAj64">How do technologies used to address Exploring the Lived Experience of Behavior Change Technologies 81:3 behavioral matters connect to the wider aspects of people's life?</s><s xml:id="_2D43EGz">What lesson can we draw from people's behavior change experiences to the design of novel behavior change technologies?</s></p><p xml:id="_kMcZQYJ"><s xml:id="_98WhwsT">Our contribution to the HCI community aims to be threefold.</s><s xml:id="_3bt288f">First, starting from the findings of 23 interviews we surface some tentative themes that might be relevant to understanding how behavior change is lived and accounted for by people, as well as how technology use is embedded in their everyday life.</s><s xml:id="_cdfKJfn">Second, we preliminarily define a behavior change model that puts in the foreground the internal and existential aspects of change.</s><s xml:id="_XqMhTQa">Third, we identify barriers that may prevent the successful accomplishment of the process of behavior change and propose some design suggestions to overcome them.</s></p></div>

construct.</s><s xml:id="_5Pf5ADv">For instance, by connecting the target behavior to the negative experiences lived in her infancy, U6 still sees physical activity as a potential harm to her own body, inducing ambivalent attitudes toward the change itself.</s><s xml:id="_pwDdXyG">For her, the underlying fear of reexperiencing the past is still a barrier to fully achieve the desired change,

the additional sense that is rooted in their internal dynamics and intimate life.</s><s xml:id="_CfqJf6z">This meaning, in fact, is subjectively constructed by the individual and often points to
