the code they adopted could, however, have been much worse, as is indeed the case in some countries, but that is another story.</s></p><p xml:id="_aREJFD2"><s xml:id="_pj54PfZ">By this time my approach to theory was evolving away from Popper's idea of the need for crucial experiments, largely on the grounds that clear predictions only appeared to be possible in situations that were far narrower than the ones I found interesting.</s><s xml:id="_Q2gKWkw">I subsequently discovered that within the philosophy of science, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Lakatos (1976)</ref>, and allegedly Popper himself, had subsequently abandoned the reliance on falsification, arguing instead that the mark of a good theory is that it should be productive, not only giving an account of existing knowledge, but also generating fruitful questions that will increase our knowledge.</s><s xml:id="_fgbD737">This more map-like view of theory is the one that I continue to take.</s></p></div>

semantic similarity then proved critical <ref type="bibr">(Baddeley 1966b</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_cSbY3Uf">I concluded that there were two storage systems, a short-term phonological and a long-term semantically based system.</s><s xml:id="_n4faHUF">My telephony project was passed on to a newly arrived colleague and I was left free to explore this line of basic research.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZdMxrK6"><s xml:id="_GNnhZzg">I saw my work as fitting into a pattern of evidence for separate STM and LTM stores.</s><s xml:id="_KtxvutA">Other evidence came from amnesic patients who had preserved STM and impaired LTM, while other patients showed the reverse pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Shallice &amp;
