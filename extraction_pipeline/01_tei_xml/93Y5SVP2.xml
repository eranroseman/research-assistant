<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_VCMnk4q">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_mdT3uNy"><s xml:id="_3rUJU4u">There is an implementation science gap in the development and availability of practical, reliable, and valid measures to assess constructs likely to impact effective implementation of evidence-based health-care innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mwUpbgT">One area in need of further attention is the development of targeted and psychometrically sound measures of organizational context for implementation.</s><s xml:id="_ztfARDh">Much of the current research on organizational context of implementation has utilized global measures of general organizational culture or climate, which have been found to be related to clinician's perspectives on evidence-based practice (EBP), client outcomes, and successful implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_C4c624A">Building on this research, this study describes the development of a measure of strategic organizational climate for EBP implementation, which can be used to support appropriate pre-assessment of organizational context and the development of strategies to accelerate effective implementation.</s></p><p xml:id="_8rHwBJx"><s xml:id="_tYkdQQD">Organizational climate has been defined as "the shared meaning organizational members attach to the events, policies, practices, and procedures they experience and the behaviors they see being rewarded, supported, and expected" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_buBcHtn">The research literature on organizational climate can be subdivided into those studies addressing molar climate and those addressing focused climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VeDrqVz">The study of molar climates attempts to capture the totality of the organizational environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, but molar climate measures have not been consistently related to organizational performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eGSNTGW">In contrast, studies of focused climate address the components of the organizational environment that are most relevant to achieve a specific outcome.</s><s xml:id="_AHEfXHg">Such climates include climates that focus on internal organizational processes, or process climates, and climates that focus on the strategic goals of the organization, or strategic climates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WvxdspN">Beginning with studies of service <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> climates, the study of focused climates is currently the most common approach to studying climate among organizational researchers and has expanded to a wide variety of topics.</s><s xml:id="_VZUXgdc">In addition, recent meta-analytic work has confirmed the strong relationships between focused climate and relevant outcomes across a number of domains, including service climate's relationship with customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, safety climate's relationship with accidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and justice climate's relationship with a number of dimensions of unit effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_9NQn9wy"><s xml:id="_XNzMZfh">The focus of this paper is on a specific type of strategic climate, the climate for EBP implementation.</s><s xml:id="_bs4T6Zf">The literature on strategic organizational climate suggests that management communicates what is valued in an organization through their actions, policies, practices, and processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SR73qHv">As employees take in those various messages, they form an overall perception of the extent to which a specific strategic imperative is an organizational priority.</s><s xml:id="_7pSND6X">When applied to EBP implementation, an effective "implementation climate" captures the extent to which employees perceive that the adoption, implementation, and use of an innovation such as EBP is expected, rewarded, and supported by the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qWnfKTH">We define EBP implementation climate as employees' shared perceptions of the importance of EBP implementation within the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tVrU2NW">Thus, a climate for EBP implementation focuses on creating a fertile organizational context for putting EBPs into practice in an organization.</s></p><p xml:id="_QvsKXJg"><s xml:id="_ccxHgSu">There are a number of mechanisms through which employees may perceive the value of successful EBP implementation in their organization.</s><s xml:id="_D9qeVxS">As such, multidimensional measures of the climate for EBP implementation are useful by providing detailed information about the factors that have the strongest impact on the climate's development <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RWwjgZF">For instance, a multidimensional measure reveals the areas that are strengths for the organization and other areas where more attention may be warranted, recognizing that it is the concerted convergence of strategies to promote strategic goals across levels of an organization that ultimately results in the development of a positive and strong strategic climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TVRXSk9">To date, the most commonly cited measure of implementation climate from Klein and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> focuses on employee's general impressions of implementation climate but does not provide a more refined breakdown of climate dimensions.</s><s xml:id="_9Gd3bN8">Their measure was also developed in the context of software implementation in manufacturing plants rather than health and allied health settings.</s><s xml:id="_7gwDr7r">Thus, the goal of this study was to provide a short, practical, and useful measure of EBP implementation climate that captured a variety of policies, practices, and procedures critical for successful EBP implementation in health and allied health settings.</s></p><p xml:id="_KKp79v5"><s xml:id="_YqhG9NU">In addition to scale development, we also sought to evaluate the construct-based evidence of validity of the scale by including measures of a number of other relevant constructs across the domains of climate, change, and implementation success.</s><s xml:id="_CNyZG6U">A summary of the constructs and the proposed relationships is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HKgnU3m">For climate, we included a measure of another strategic climate, service climate, which evaluates the organization's emphasis on delivering high quality services.</s><s xml:id="_CZd5RDw">We anticipated that these two strategic climates would be moderately to strongly associated because effective work groups would emphasize both generally delivering high quality services and specifically implementing EBP, but also that the two would not be completely overlapping because of the distinct focus of each set of items.</s><s xml:id="_HqadEnN">We also included items capturing several dimensions of molar climate, including involvement, performance feedback, efficiency, formalization, and autonomy.</s><s xml:id="_XeZ6VH5">We anticipated weak but positive correlations with these dimensions as they are related to aspects of generally effective work groups but are not implementation specific.</s><s xml:id="_g9ZGAWd">For organizational change, we included items capturing types of change, uncertainty due to change, and readiness for change.</s><s xml:id="_hbR6SBH">We anticipated that climate for EBP implementation would be moderately correlated with the levels of planned change reported by employees, as EBP implementation is a specific type of planned change.</s><s xml:id="_nWnKQzz">Because work groups with a positive implementation climate would have a structure for implementation and an alignment of organizational processes and systems related to implementation, we anticipated that employees would experience less uncertainty about change in those environments (and thus, a weak, negative correlation between EBP implementation climate and uncertainty).</s></p><p xml:id="_JdzdwRx"><s xml:id="_Ee5VXxs">For organizational readiness for change, we anticipated a weak, positive relationship; even though work groups with a positive EBP implementation climate would have demonstrated the ability to effectively address change, readiness also includes aspects of innovation and flexibility that are not central to EBP implementation.</s><s xml:id="_k9c6Gd5">In addition, there are a number of changes that work groups can experience unrelated to EBP.</s><s xml:id="_r5WvFXt">In summary, the goal of this study was to develop a scale measuring strategic climate for EBP implementation that included the most relevant dimensions and that also was pragmatic and brief to allow for use of the scale for both research and applied purposes.</s></p></div>
