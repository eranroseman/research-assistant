all the more so because processes of data acquisition, curation and annotation can actually be sped up via machine learning.</s></p><p xml:id="_5Gy8HkZ"><s xml:id="_TvZq6Au">The clinical implementation of machinelearning software should be informed by the needs of the healthcare providers and their patients.</s><s xml:id="_bqZR2hc">Especially in healthcare systems with stretched budgets and in departments with physicians and nurses with a real risk of burn out, proper use of artificial intelligence should ideally lead to faster or improved care (for example through improved patientphysician interactions), and to a reduction in overall costs.</s><s xml:id="_fURa4Qq">For instance, in some hospitals, machine learning is being tested to maximize the use of operating rooms (the most expensive real estate in hospitals) by estimating the duration of procedures and by anticipating demand.</s></p><p xml:id="_QHZcb6H"><s xml:id="_6FxXpn4">Where machine-learning software is to affect patient care directly, algorithm interpretability will be essential.</s><s xml:id="_urfZStd">Yet addressing the well-known 'black box' problem (one main critique to IBM's Watson for Oncology) by using computational techniques that 'peer' into the innards of the algorithms will not be sufficient in many cases.</s><s xml:id="_BbtypQY">The interpretability of an algorithm's predictions can be skewed by the quality of the data used for the training of the algorithm, the characteristics and quality of the input data specific to the patient being assessed, and local medical standards and practice.</s><s xml:id="_CKuyHwb">Efforts to address these challenges are only starting.</s><s xml:id="_cXKz3xW">For example, a recent study from a collaboration between DeepMind and Moofields Eye Hospital in London reported that a machine-learning algorithm that makes referral recommendations on dozens of retinal diseases on the basis of optical coherence tomography scans highlighted structures in the scans that could lead to ambiguous interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_qW37vQk">And an earlier study by Google Research showed that deep-learning models for predicting cardiovascular risk factors from photographs of the retina could indicate which anatomical features (such as the optic disc or blood vessels) the algorithm used to generate the predictions.</s></p><p xml:id="_xJHJ4Tf"><s xml:id="_HeBNVRx">Two additional research studies, included in this issue, demonstrate the importance of algorithm interpretability and of clinically minded algorithm implementation.</s><s xml:id="_fWcc3bj">Su-In Lee and colleagues trained a gradientboosting machine-learning model (an ensemble model that 'boosts' a set of weak prediction learners into becoming a strong learner) on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries to predict the risk of unexpected hypoxaemia (abnormally low levels of oxygen in blood) during surgery under anaesthesia and, crucially, to provide quantitative measures of the contribution of the many risk factors (such as changes in the level of blood oxygen saturation, in ventilation rate and in the exhalation of previously administered anaesthetics).</s><s xml:id="_7QCNSta">In real surgeries, the software's interpretable predictions and risk warnings could increase the safety of patients under general anaesthesia by strengthening preventive assistance and improving surgical workflows.</s><s xml:id="_TD4KfX8">In another study, Xiaogang Liu and collaborators demonstrate that a deeplearning algorithm (a convolutional neural network, which emulates how the visual</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="1,214.43,164.39,345.12,150.96" type="bitmap" /></figure>
