target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xyPNG5v">Despite the well-documented links between PA and health, only 27% of older adults aged 65 and older meet the PA guidelines according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and this number drops to 2.5% when PA is objectively assessed by accelerometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uCwnHtU">Therefore, effective interventions that aim to increase PA levels in the older population are warranted.</s></p><p xml:id="_zdpd9nw"><s xml:id="_C5ZrcRE">Among many types of PA, walking is identified as the favorite type of exercise among older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XfkuFPq">Interventions targeting walking are most likely to be effective in changing PA behaviors in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7zv6w53">As a cost-effective type of exercise, it is estimated that 10% of the adult population participating in a regular walking program could save $5.6 billion in heart disease costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PJw86AS">Therefore, effective interventions aiming at increasing the walking among older adults may translate into reduced health care costs.</s></p><p xml:id="_Hjuhq8P"><s xml:id="_JdU4YMy">Interventions designed to increase PA usually incorporate various behavior change techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kWXkBdP">A systematic review examined the effects of 26 behavior change techniques using a meta-regression and found that selfmonitoring had the greatest individual effect in changing PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AGWuAsV">It was also found that interventions combining self-monitoring with at least one other technique of selfregulation (e.g., goal setting, providing feedback) were more effective in promoting PA than other interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yeC9RpJ">Self-monitoring is a key component of self-regulation based on the Social Cognitive Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tFFQmCn">According to this theory, self-monitoring one's performance helps individuals set realistic goals and assess their progress toward these goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_P2HzbnG">Self-monitoring one's PA also enhances one's self-efficacy for PA, which is a direct predictor of participation in PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_YSUWaAP"><s xml:id="_XhDDMTp">Wearable activity trackers have been increasingly used as a self-monitoring tool in PA interventions and incorporate multiple behavior change techniques.</s><s xml:id="_j6Ctb4T">A recent study examined the behavior change techniques implemented in 13 commercially available activity trackers and found that self-monitoring and feedback were the mostly incorporated techniques among these activity trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pyfWz6H">Wearable activity trackers monitor an array of PA indicators (e.g., step counts, distance walked, calories burned) and provide real-time feedback of these data for users.</s><s xml:id="_n7USfeA">Unlike traditional hip-worn pedometers which require users to manually record daily step counts for long-term tracking, recent advances in technology allow wearable activity trackers to transmit and store data wirelessly through internetor mobile-based applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6edav6e">Previous interventions using wearable activity trackers as a tool for promoting PA have shown promising results in various populations.</s><s xml:id="_rUKfWyQ">For example, a randomized controlled trial conducted among overweight and obese adults showed that participants who wore a wearable activity tracker for 6 weeks increased daily step counts by 1266, while the attention control group showed no increase in daily step counts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_8vtnwEU"><s xml:id="_ZZPH3H2">Interventions integrating the appropriate use of wearable activity trackers to promote PA in older adults has considerable public health importance for the aging society.</s><s xml:id="_YNc9vKZ">First, as PA is associated with various health outcomes and the older adults are more universally sedentary than any other age group <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, wearable activity tracker-based interventions have the potential to prevent or slow-down the age-related declines in physical and cognitive functioning.</s><s xml:id="_t6jMNGB">Second, older adults are the fastest growing segment of the population regarding Internet use and smartphone ownership <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which facilitates the potential adoption of wearable activity trackers in their daily lives.</s><s xml:id="_yRZDGMd">However, only a handful of intervention studies have used wearable activity trackers to promote PA in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_FEXhA8D">Cadmus-Bertram and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> conducted a 16-week wearable activity tracker-based intervention and found it significantly increased the daily step counts by 789 among postmenopausal women.</s><s xml:id="_FqRVZaU">In contrast, another randomized controlled trial showed that a 24-week intervention combining wearable activity trackers with exercise counseling did not change the PA level in sedentary and overweight older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tzytcu2">Since the findings from previous studies are mixed and limited, more research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of wearable activity tracker-based interventions and understand how to best implement these interventions in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_4eZBepU">Such information will contribute to informing the design and implementation of effective interventions to promote PA among the older population in future studies.</s><s xml:id="_Xp7sTnd">As far as we know, only a few studies have examined the acceptability of wearable trackers in older adults and most of them were conducted within a relatively short period <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_wdJY2Pe"><s xml:id="_xCJ7KJr">The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness and acceptability of wearable activity trackers combined with self-regulatory techniques for promoting PA in older adults living retirement communities.</s><s xml:id="_QWwBzqC">It was hypothesized that using wearable activity trackers combined with self-regulatory techniques (e.g., goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback) would significantly improve the PA level and would be considered to be positive and acceptable among older adults.</s><s xml:id="_PApwJta">The majority of the older adults living in retirement communities were physically inactive as less than 15% of them meet the PA guidelines.</s><s xml:id="_yxx4yyx">The preliminary evidence of the current study would better inform how wearable activity trackers can help this population become more active.</s></p></div>

xml:id="_Jjs4wyk">In the study by Mercer and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> involving older adults with chronic illness, participants used four wearable activity trackers with each for 3 days and perceived that activity trackers helped them become more aware of their activity levels.</s><s xml:id="_rbhxU3E">That the activity tracker increases self-awareness and motivation of PA was also identified in men with prostate cancer who wore the Fitbit activity tracker for 3 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and breast cancer survivors who used two to three different activity trackers with each for 2 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5Kbp53S">The current study supports these findings by expanding the length of using activity

day.</s><s xml:id="_6VcUHMk">This was an unexpected finding because the heart rate was not the main focus of the current study.</s><s xml:id="_TSDwsa2">However, it has significant implications for future interventions such that integrating health indicators into the wearable activity tracker may facilitate its use in the older population.</s><s xml:id="_2sZEzeA">Manufacturers may consider improving the usefulness of the wearable activity tracker by expanding its capability of self-monitoring to other indicators that are critical to older adults, such as blood glucose and blood pressure, if it is technically feasible.</s></p><p xml:id="_ygVJWFT"><s xml:id="_jrESZHV">Comfort and ease of reading are important to older adult users of activity trackers, as several participants in the current study reported negative experiences in these two aspects.</s><s xml:id="_9Fe7ZGb">We also from time to time observed that some participants took up to a few minutes to wear the activity tracker and adjust the watchband.</s><s xml:id="_p92XUHu">When developing future activity trackers for older adults, it should be kept in mind that older adults generally have functional declines such as impaired vision and weakened muscle strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JZdZrqN">Wearable activity trackers designed for older adults must be comfortable to wear, easy to operate, clear to understand, and avoid arousing unpleasant feelings.</s></p><p xml:id="_HqH3CXw"><s xml:id="_YVne878">The interviews also revealed participants' interest in using other functions of the activity tracker.</s><s xml:id="_bjeS9uV">Future research should investigate how to integrate all functions and features of the activity tracker to optimize PA interventions.</s><s xml:id="_ZUsXJa9">For example, although not used in the current study, the mobile app and Website of the Fitbit activity trackers allow users to have a virtual social community and share their PA data with others in the social community.</s><s xml:id="_wGHZN9B">Competing with important others such as family and friends may also increase their motivation for PA, as one participant (P9) in the present study indicated that "it is kinda like a game in a way because it encourages my husband and me to do more activity."</s></p><p xml:id="_nPwm85q"><s xml:id="_6WcxYn8">Although the current study demonstrates that the activity tracker-based intervention is promising in promoting PA in older adults, several limitations should be noted.</s><s xml:id="_qEYg7wB">First, participants in the current study were relatively well-educated and consisted of all White, which limits our generalizability of the study results.</s><s xml:id="_YUHCwy5">Including older adults with different race/ethnicities and educational backgrounds in future studies would contribute to more diverse opinions toward the use of activity trackers in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_nhSAbQz">Second, our findings regarding the significant intervention effect in increasing daily steps might be conservative for two reasons.</s><s xml:id="_2BshBxn">On the one hand, the activity tracker in the current study was both an intervention component and an assessment tool of baseline daily step counts.</s><s xml:id="_xFj6nGG">Therefore, participants might be inadvertently exposed to a certain extent of the intervention during the baseline measure of daily step counts.</s><s xml:id="_ePaBvZq">This might in turn lead to the underestimation of the intervention effect, although evidence shows owning the activity tracker alone is unlikely to elicit behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BYuyrZc">On the other hand, the current study did not exclude participants who were already physically active.</s><s xml:id="_edUmsCc">We suggest future studies target specifically inactive older adults and objectively measure the PA (e.g., using accelerometers) before the activity tracker is given to participants.</s><s xml:id="_AXmNhxU">Third, it is possible that participants may already hold a positive attitude towards the activity tracker before the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_egwCmS8">Future studies should seek to examine the effects of activity trackers on PA among older adults who have low interest in using wearable activity trackers.</s><s xml:id="_2yxxYWR">Fourth, we did not conduct follow-up evaluations regarding the long-term use of the activity tracker, especially after stopping providing the weekly feedback.</s><s xml:id="_F8k2bYj">Nevertheless, we believe it is promising for continuous long-term use of the activity tracker by the participants because all but two of them expressed intention of continuing using the activity tracker to monitor their activities.</s><s xml:id="_ADeuYHr">Last, the current study failed to include a control group.</s><s xml:id="_WeYG9An">Additional well-designed randomized controlled trials can help rule out confounders that may influence the efficacy and acceptability of using wearable activity trackers.</s></p><p xml:id="_DF39YjS"><s xml:id="_XUVmq67">Despite these limitations, the findings of the current study have important implications for policy and health promotion in the older population.</s><s xml:id="_cemVTZY">By conducting both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using wearable activity trackers in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_Ntr7SVx">Our study supported that older adults (even those 85 years or older) can utilize wearable activity trackers to effectively improve their PA levels.</s><s xml:id="_A3EXEWk">Given that the technology use among older adults is increasing rapidly <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, it is promising to integrate wearable activity trackers in large-scale health promotion programs.</s><s xml:id="_ezZ3DGK">Wearable activity trackers can be incorporated into healthcare systems and clinical practice to provide healthcare professionals with accurate and real-time information about older adults' activity levels.</s><s xml:id="_6DET8Z3">The
