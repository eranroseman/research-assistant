leading cause of disability worldwide with a global prevalence of 7.2%, 1 affecting 4 in 5 individuals in their lifetime. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_TzXCXb3">Clinical diagnosis of LBP is difficult due to its multifactorial etiology and in turn, 90% of cases are designated as non-specific with no clear underlying cause. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_42kcmvN">Given the uncertainties in diagnoses, localized LBP is treated with a broad variety of interventions including activity modification, physical therapy, pain medication, and spine injections.</s><s xml:id="_YTMcgkG">If symptoms do not improve, surgical intervention may be recommended.</s><s xml:id="_79gpK3b">In the US, the economic costs of LBP are the highest in the world exceeding $100B per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and this is in part due to the high rates of surgical intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_xuvjbd4">Health systems are not equipped to manage this growing population affected by LBP.</s></p><p xml:id="_MRagR5R"><s xml:id="_bhRnjtZ">Patients pursuing non-invasive treatments have better outcomes for reducing disability and returning to work compared to those pursuing surgical intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_tXYQGY3">In an evidence-based guideline, the American College of Physicians recommends to first pursue non-pharmacological conservative treatments for LBP because they are deemed less harmful. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_ceB35aX">While exercise, rehabilitation, and cognitive behavioral therapy are among the most effective non-pharmacological conservative care treatments for ameliorating LBP symptoms, implementations of such care from a traditional clinical model has, so far, revealed inconsistent results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_2r3hCcj">This is likely due to the high degree of patient engagement, commitment, and self-management needed to adhere and complete these time-intensive at-home treatment plans.</s><s xml:id="_RSsCrNm">The amount of patient engagement in a treatment plan is shown to directly relate to health outcomes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and is often an overlooked component in otherwise promising interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_TeActpG"><s xml:id="_YdmqBnQ">Digital health technology can provide care for a large population and improve outcomes for non-invasive treatments by allowing providers to monitor adherence and activate patients to engage in their recovery.</s><s xml:id="_3UXPJqB">A digital therapy approach can integrate multiple conservative care channels while also tracking outcomes and providing biofeedback.</s><s xml:id="_3AqjZfJ">The utilization of selfregulatory tools such as biofeedback as an engagement tool in non-specific LBP rehabilitation has been shown to promote greater than 80% adherence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_9yam6Wt">Biofeedback enables patients to better learn how to voluntarily control and track therapeutic exercise by converting physical movement into meaningful visual and auditory cues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_dXM5K3c">Biofeedback is believed to help patients gain awareness of their movement physiology and learn to selfregulate and even challenge themselves to make progress in response to the real-time feedback. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_85mUyk6">urprisingly, results from prior randomized controlled trials of digital intervention on managing LBP with conservative care are largely unconvincing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> with only one prior study demonstrating a positive effect from a 3-week cognitive behavioral therapy digital intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_x5UaVrX">Beyond the variability in theoretical underpinnings behind prior digital intervention studies, other issues may include the passive dissemination of content to patients and not assessing patient engagement.</s><s xml:id="_q9hGcpV">A digital care program (DCP) similar to the program tested here

the program.</s><s xml:id="_UJ8S3Mn">One possible limitation includes that the treatment in this RCT was non-blinded and while this is common within the field, it prevents us from knowing whether the effect of the trial may be in part due to the participant's expectation that their symptoms would diminish as they were assigned to the treatment.</s><s xml:id="_BxyT6kS">A second concern is due the remote nature of the program, participants were not assessed by a clinician, their medical records were not evaluated, and generally there was little coordination with the conventional healthcare system.</s><s xml:id="_cUhg9qQ">However, LBP is commonly diagnosed through self-report as done in this study.</s><s xml:id="_JbwbNn5">We also used standard questionnaires to screen for any complaints that may indicate specific conditions (red flags) and referred those to healthcare professionals.</s><s xml:id="_utEKUH9">This DCP was designed so participants could independently seek traditional care if desired.</s><s xml:id="_mAUdKQ2">Future studies will investigate the effect of the DCP on a clinical cohort and clinical status of participants will be followed.</s></p><p xml:id="_nBh5guM"><s xml:id="_hjqHPGg">Another concern is that participants in the control group would exaggerate their week-12 symptoms in an attempt to gain preferential access in the next round of the program.</s><s xml:id="_rPDjJrm">Though this is a possibility, we hoped to deter participants from overstating their symptoms by guaranteeing participation in the following round for those initially placed in the control group.</s><s xml:id="_76FZ4Wj">Additionally, if overstating symptoms was widespread, we would have expected scores across the board to substantially increase at week 12, however the per protocol scores either decreased or increased by a few points at most.</s><s xml:id="_5NaWURz">Finally, while this study found significant improvements in primary and secondary outcomes associated with the DCP, a last limitation is that our trial did not investigate outcomes beyond the first 12 weeks.</s><s xml:id="_VhVmYtF">Next steps include studies on outcomes from multi-year follow-up.</s></p><p xml:id="_4x45V9M"><s xml:id="_kmd3gx5">In conclusion, this RCT shows that care provided using a DCP substantially reduces pain, disability, and surgery interest in those living with LBP.</s><s xml:id="_BRAPUp9">In the per protocol DCP treatment segment, we found strong patient engagement.</s><s xml:id="_cqNfUxf">Care from the DCP was achieved through a program that was
