rhesus monkeys.</s><s xml:id="_9XJbQyD">He coined the term intrinsic motivation to describe his observation that these primates would persist in playing with mechanical puzzles even in the absence of external rewards.</s><s xml:id="_FqN8ZR3">Indeed, he observed that the introduction of rewards for playing led these primates to decrease their spontaneous manipulative explorations, relative to those not exposed to external rewards.</s><s xml:id="_dTjrVRT">These and related observations of spontaneous exploratory and play behaviors defied some behaviorist views that intentional behaviors are invariably controlled by reinforcement contingencies within the environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Skinner, 1953)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_FByM3tW"><s xml:id="_SWayykv">Early work with

that stem from physiological need deficits.</s><s xml:id="_RhRgqt3">Because intrinsic motivation often ensues in the absence and, on occasion, independent of such deprivations, it was poorly explained by traditional drive reduction accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(White, 1959)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q3ZpUQd">Early attempts to amend drive theory led researchers to postulate the existence of various exploratory drives as the basis for seemingly spontaneous curiosity, exploratory and manipulatory behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Butler, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr"

parsimony, this ''drive-naming'' approach could not be reconciled with the observations that exploratory activities do not resemble consummatory responses and that animals often behave to increase

extensive program of research has established that novel stimuli-on an a priori basis-represent potential sources of both punishment and reward, elicit tendencies for both avoidance and approach, and therefore often arouse anxious uncertainty and prompt cautious investigatory behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_nm9wEGv">The investigatory behaviors instigated by the septo-hippocampal system include risk assessment and scanning the environment and one's memory to resolve the motivational conflict, that is, to compute whether approach or avoidance should predominate.</s></p><p xml:id="_cRNWX7G"><s xml:id="_VCt8RWf">Intrinsically motivated curiosity, exploration and mastery behaviors, however, pertain to specific types of novel stimuli, namely, those that present optimal challenges or optimal

novelty produces to boredom.</s><s xml:id="_5HnhrrS">During intrinsic motivation, feelings of interest and positive excitement predominate over both anxiety and boredom.</s><s

the activity of the central nervous system and described it as ''what the neuromuscular system wants to do when it is otherwise unoccupied (e.g., by strong homeostatic drives) or is gently stimulated by the environment'' (p.321).</s><s xml:id="_ebSb7fV">According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">White (1959)</ref>, the satisfactions associated with the effectance motive are not tied to consummatory activities, but are instead intrinsic to the arousal and maintenance of the activities that stem from it.</s><s xml:id="_8K94pYQ">Along similar lines, DeCharms (1968) proposed that intrinsic motivation is based in people's ''primary propensity'' to experience themselves as causal agents, that is, to experience their own actions as having an internal perceived locus of causality.</s><s xml:id="_nPk4weB">DeCharms's (1968) insightful theorizing helped set the stage for the earliest experiments on the undermining effect as it suggested that external enticements and pressures that detract one from experiencing oneself as the center of initiation of their own behaviors-that undermine autonomy-can diminish intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Deci and Ryan, 1985)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_XU3QzYH"><s xml:id="_GpdKpkk">By the mid-1980s, numerous studies had examined the effects of various situational factors on the expression of intrinsic

target="#b103">Zuckerman et al., 1978)</ref> enhanced intrinsic motivation and that negative feedback (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Deci and Cascio, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vallerand and Reid, 1984)</ref>, deadlines (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amabile et al., 1976)</ref>, and other external impositions (e.g., surveillance; <ref type="bibr"

evolutionary thinking, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Ryan and Hawley (2016)</ref> reviewed empirical evidence that competence and autonomy satisfactions supply proximal supports for intrinsically

of personality functioning, intrinsic motivation provides the impetus for individuals to learn about particular subject areas and to differentiate their interests, fostering the development of
