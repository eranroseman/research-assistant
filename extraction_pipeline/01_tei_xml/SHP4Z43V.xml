<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_zPK3hyb"><p xml:id="_7tVNbaR"><s xml:id="_ZzWPZdW">To improve the completeness of reporting of mobile health (mHealth) interventions, the WHO mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group developed the mHealth evidence reporting and assessment (mERA) checklist.</s><s xml:id="_AGs9vth">The development process for mERA consisted of convening an expert group to recommend an appropriate approach, convening a global expert review panel for checklist development, and pilot testing the checklist.</s><s xml:id="_WJcbzec">The guiding principle for the development of these criteria was to identify a minimum set of information needed to define what the mHealth intervention is (content), where it is being implemented (context), and how it was implemented (technical features), to support replication of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_zCy3EG4">This paper presents the resulting 16 item checklist and a detailed explanation and elaboration for each item, with illustrative reporting examples.</s><s xml:id="_gGbNbxG">Through widespread adoption, we expect that the use of these guidelines will standardise the quality of mHealth evidence reporting, and indirectly improve the quality of mHealth evidence.</s></p><p xml:id="_CpeVbHe"><s xml:id="_yvuxEcR">Mobile technologies have the potential to bridge systemic gaps needed to improve access to and use of health services, particularly among underserved populations.</s><s xml:id="_FUt8rNB">mHealth-defined as the use of mobile and wireless technologies for health-aims to capitalise on the rapid uptake of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health system efficiency and health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_yZGgMq6">Over the past decade, global enthusiasm and the interest of development agencies, researchers, and policy makers have led to the rapid proliferation of mHealth solutions throughout developed and developing countries.</s><s xml:id="_ACy7CSE">The World Bank reported that there were more than 500 mHealth projects in 2011 alone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s xml:id="_RSKVufR">Despite the emergence of hundreds of mHealth studies and initiatives, there remains a lack of rigorous, high quality evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of such interventions. <ref type="bibr">2 3</ref> The current mHealth evidence is disseminated in multiple forms including peer reviewed literature, white papers, reports, presentations, and blogs.</s><s xml:id="_4ZBRNkr">The evidence base is heterogenous in quality, completeness, and objectivity of the reporting of mHealth interventions-thus making comparisons across intervention strategies difficult.</s><s xml:id="_pZKQKCS">This has led to a call for a set of standards that can harmonise and improve the quality of future research publications, to facilitate screening of emerging evidence and identification of critical evidence gaps.</s><s xml:id="_6kPqZNN">Such improvements in reporting of evidence can support policy makers in making decisions around mHealth intervention selection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_KmxhCFq">he value of standardised guidelines is well accepted and several tools exist to assess the quality and to standardise the reporting of scientific evidence.</s><s xml:id="_5GENQ9U">For example, the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach rates the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations, and is routinely used by international organisations such as the World Health Organization and Cochrane Collaboration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> In other fields, the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (CHEERS) statement provides reporting guidance for economic evaluations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_UCfGM6m">Other tools have also been developed to standardise the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (eg, preferred reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)), <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and assess their methodological quality or reliability (eg, assessing methodological quality of systematic reviews (AMSTAR)). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_XC76bTZ">The consolidated standards for reporting trials (CONSORT) statement provides a 22 item checklist for reporting of randomised controlled trials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_YQv4BrD">Other evidence reporting and synthesis approaches exist for meta-analyses of observational studies (eg, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies (MOOSE)), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> non-randomised designs (eg, transparent reporting of evaluations with non-randomised designs (TREND)), <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and observational studies (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE)). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_Zmw6apK">CONSORT-EHEALTH aims to provide guidance on reporting of trials involving web based interventions (eHealth) and mHealth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_stx7VGn">lthough CONSORT-EHEALTH is aimed at web based intervention trials, several mHealth interventions, especially in low and middle income countries, do not have an active web based component.</s><s xml:id="_yG4G3rR">Additionally, web based interventions do not necessarily have a mobile component (that is, use of a mobile phone or tablet).</s><s xml:id="_W4n3JY2">Lastly, given that the field of mHealth is still in its early stages, evaluations of such mHealth interventions typically use more descriptive and observational study designs in addition to randomised trials.</s><s xml:id="_JVQjQhJ">These existing tools (including CONSORT-EHEALTH) are study design specific and focus on methodological rigour.</s><s xml:id="_jzFYE6D">They do not provide recommendations for the reporting of technical details, feasibility, and sustainability of the intervention strategies, which further adds to the challenge of comparing digital strategies.</s><s xml:id="_WrTCF58">The template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist fills this gap by providing a guide to the reporting of interventions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_4QEeEQg">However, no reporting guidelines exist that capture the priority descriptors needed to adequately understand and potentially replicate ICT interventions for health.</s></p><p xml:id="_zRxmRRU"><s xml:id="_VPz2fFe">The quality of reporting on evidence on mHealth interventions has been varied.</s><s xml:id="_ps6FBMF">This is likely attributable to two factors: the multidisciplinary nature of mHealth, which combines different approaches from the fields of healthcare and technology, and the rapid pace of technology development, which often outpaces our ability to generate and disseminate quality evidence.</s><s xml:id="_uYZgM2Z">In the technology space, prototypes are usually assessed by proof of concept or demonstration studies with fast turnaround time for modification.</s><s xml:id="_xD7exPc">These results are generally disseminated rapidly in the grey literature, through white papers, conference papers, presentations, and blogs.</s><s xml:id="_N3G8jAF">By contrast, research and dissemination in global public health moves at a slower pace, beginning with formative research, followed by measuring efficacy, and then effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_pmaD9Pa">Each of these evaluation steps might require considerable resources and take long periods of time to implement and ultimately, publish.</s><s xml:id="_nJaShtT">The concise nature of peer reviewed literature also limits the reporting of technical details which describe the nature of what the mHealth intervention is; constraining efforts to effectively synthesise research on a particular intervention or technical strategy.</s></p><p xml:id="_8GMJ9M7"><s xml:id="_UFJGTXt">To address this gap, WHO convened a group of global experts working at the intersection of mHealth research and programme implementation, called the mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group (mTERG).</s><s xml:id="_EGfjMRE">mTERG identified the need for a tool that provides guidelines for the reporting of evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions.</s><s xml:id="_bawrqa3">The group recognised that the evaluation and reporting of mHealth and ICT interventions requires a unique lens, blending a combination of study designs and methods, as well as reporting that incorporates the description of the intervention and the context in which the intervention is implemented.</s><s xml:id="_aUsWcaH">The proposed mHealth Evidence Reporting and Assessment (mERA) checklist resulted from a series of consultations with the mTERG.</s><s
