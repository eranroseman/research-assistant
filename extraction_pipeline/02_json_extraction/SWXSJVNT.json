  "title": "Information in practice Email consultations in health care: 1-scope and effectiveness",
  "abstract": "Electronic communication promises to revolutionise the delivery of health care. In the first of two articles considering the potential for email consultations, Car and Sheikh summarise the evidence about their use for preventive health care, health education, and managing non-urgent conditions In 1971 Ray Tomlinson programmed and sent the first email message. Widespread public use began in the early 1990s and rapidly spread to the extent that email now represents an integral part of daily life for about 60% of the UK population (fig  1 ). The popularity of email stems largely from its user friendliness, efficiency, and versatility in facilitating asynchronous communication (see box 1).  1  Increased opportunities for electronic communication have revolutionised many industries and customer services, such as banking and retail, but email's promise for improving delivery of health care remains largely untapped. 1 2 In this two part review, we consider the use of email for communication in a clinical context. The first article explores the scope for email consultations for preventive health care, health education, and managing non-urgent conditions. Our second article summarises the evidence describing public and professional attitudes to using email in health care and considers how to ensure its safe use in routine clinical care. \n Information sources and selection criteria We used established systematic review methods to identify systematic reviews and original research studies evaluating the role of email communication in health care. w1  We searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Medline (from 1980 to 2003) and scrutinised bibliographies of identified articles in order to identify additional published material. We searched the internet using general and specialised search engines to identify \"grey\" literature from sources such as industry reports, legal and strategic documents, and official government healthcare websites. We also searched the National Research Register to identify commissioned research in progress. Wherever possible, we refer to findings from controlled trials for drawing conclusions about the clinical effectiveness of email delivered care. We have used case reports and case series to help understand recent developments and inform safety considerations.",

[3] [4] 4] [5]  Although there is currently no good quality evidence, the effect of email reminders may be similar. Email is potentially ideal for sending reminders as this can be automated (with inclusion of extra information, such as about the clinic or parking facilities). Email could also be convenient for patients as it offers the possibility of rescheduling or changing an appointment without the difficulties of \"getting through\" by telephone or the potential embarrassment of feeling obliged to explain the reasons for cancellation."

      "title": "Triage",
      "text": "Katz et al investigated a triage based email system in a randomised controlled trial in primary care.  6 Patients in the intervention arm were encouraged to use email to communicate with their doctors and clinic staff about appointments, health concerns, prescription renewals, referrals, and billing. All emails were automatically routed to a central resource account managed by a nurse \"navigator\" who then directed messages to appropriate staff. Doctors received copies of all messages but replied only to those requiring their input. The authors found that email increased the communication burden on clinicians and staff and did not substitute for telephone consultations. They concluded that email was of limited use in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical care. Though its conclusions were negative, this trial provides helpful insights into the nature of email consultations. For example, content analysis of patient emails revealed that almost all patient communications were judged to be appropriate in addressing patients' needs. The study clearly showed that face to face visits and telephone consultations remain patients' preferred modes of communication for many healthcare issues, especially those thought to be complex or sensitive. Patients endorsed the use of email for straightforward issues such as communication of cholesterol test results or a normal cervical smear test result. Furthermore, email was the preferred way of dealing with relatively minor problems such as a sore throat or back pain. This suggests that email communication addressed an unmet access need for some patients in primary care: it provided an additional means of communication for patients who might not otherwise communicate with their doctors about such issues as new symptoms or resolution of problems.\n\nThis study also suggested that patients who used email with their clinicians were a distinct group from those who used the telephone or made frequent visits. The former patients were generally younger, more educated, and healthier. Somewhat surprisingly, two thirds of the patients in the study felt uncomfortable with clinic staff triaging their messages, whereas doctors favoured this arrangement. This suggests that patients view email as a more intimate mode of communication than do many doctors, thus potentially limiting its usefulness as a triage tool."

      "title": "Directions for future research",
      "text": "The strong drive to incorporate email consultations into routine clinical practice should proceed on the basis of secure evidence. As this field is still in its infancy, the research agenda covers all aspects of email communication in health care. This needs to begin with a detailed understanding of patient and professional preferences for modes of communication and why; an appreciation of how email consulting can best be integrated with other modes of consulting; the influence of email consulting on the patient-doctor relationship (for example, clinicians may be more defensive and patients consult for more trivial problems than in traditional consultations); identification of populations most likely to benefit from email communication; and understanding of safety, training, security, and interface issues. Box 2: Potential disadvantages of email use in delivering health care\n\n\u2022 May widen social disparities by allowing preferential access to wealthier people and young middle class adults \u2022 Like other forms of written communication (such as letters and faxes), email does not easily provide the subtle emotive cues often gleaned from vocal intonation and physical demeanour that aid interpretation. Scope for non-verbal communication is currently very limited \u2022 Inability to examine the patient \u2022 Inability to use touch in the clinical encounter \u2022 May increase the risk of diagnostic or communication errors \u2022 Potential slow responses to messages that might require emergency actions \u2022 Threats to patient privacy (including unauthorised interception of unencrypted emails, receipt or retrieval of emails by unauthorised people, inappropriate physical security measures) \u2022 Providers may be overwhelmed by the volume and length of emails\n\nQuestions such as how clinicians can be patient centred in email consultations require innovative approaches to researching consultations that place emphasis on semantics (as written words are the sole conveyors of information). Because of the intricate ways in which email combines human communication and information communication technology, interdisciplinary research is essential.\n\nWe know that a large part of a verbal message's impact derives from the communication style and the clinician's \"image\" and appearance rather than the content. Will the user interface and the application's functionality (that is, the program design and layout) take this role in email consultations and become a critical element in the human-computer-human interaction? Examples of questions about interface design include, \"Should different interfaces be used for different populations considering factors such as age, preferred language, and (computer) literacy?\"\n\nAs email consulting increases, we need to ensure that those without email access to care are not unduly disadvantaged (see fig 2 and box 2). Mechanisms for ensuring equitable access to care for sections of the population who do not use email are essential."
