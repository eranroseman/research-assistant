  "title": "Systematic review of economic evaluations for internet-and mobile-based interventions for mental health problems",
  "abstract": "In view of the staggering disease and economic burden of mental disorders, internet and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) targeting mental disorders have often been touted to be cost-effective; however, available evidence is inconclusive and outdated. This review aimed to provide an overview of the cost-effectiveness of IMIs for mental disorders and symptoms. A systematic search was conducted for trial-based economic evaluations published before 10th May 2021. Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PSYNDEX, and NHS Economic Evaluations Database) were searched for randomized controlled trials examining IMIs targeting mental disorders and symptoms and conducting a full health economic evaluation. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. Cost-effectiveness was assumed at or below \u00a330,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Of the 4044 studies, 36 economic evaluations were reviewed. Guided IMIs were likely to be cost-effective in depression and anxiety. The quality of most evaluations was good, albeit with some risks of bias. Heterogeneity across studies was high because of factors such as different costing methods, design, comparison groups, and outcomes used. IMIs for anxiety and depression have potential to be cost-effective. However, more research is needed into unguided (preventive) IMIs with active control conditions (e.g., treatment as usual) and longer time horizon across a wider range of disorders.",

      "text": "Mental disorders (MDs) are highly prevalent worldwide  1  . Globally, every fifth person is affected, and roughly one-third of adults have experienced mental illness at least once  2  . MDs constitute a substantial burden for individuals and society. Meta-analytic evidence shows an elevated risk of mortality in people with MDs  3, 4  and low quality of life  5  . In addition, MDs appear to be correlated with several physical illnesses  6  such as stroke, pain, cancer, diabetes mellitus, asthma, heart disease, hypertension, and insomnia  7  . According to the World Health Organization, disease burden as expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with MDs is substantial and has remained constant over time and across countries  8  . In 2016, Vigo et al. argued that the \"true\" estimate of the global burden caused by MDs will double compared with earlier estimates and will account for 13% of total DALYs. Hence, the burden of MDs is comparable with those of cardiovascular and circulatory diseases  9  .\n\nMDs are associated with substantial economic costs for society. Associated productivity losses due to absenteeism and presenteeism, earlier retirement, and increased level of healthcare utilization have major influence on society. In 2010, the global costs associated with MDs were estimated at US$2.5 trillion  10  . Indirect costs, such as productivity losses or premature death, were twice as high as direct medical costs related to health service use. In the EU, MD-associated costs are estimated at \u20ac798 billion in 2010  11  . However, costs are expected to double by 2030  10  because of increasing demand and rising costs.\n\nDespite the availability of effective psychological interventions  12  , the majority of individuals with MDs remain untreated  13  or receive delayed treatment often initiated several years after MD onset  14  . The reasons are multifaceted. Attitudinal barriers, such as low perceived need or a stigma-related desire to handle one's problems seems to be more important than structural barriers, such as availability of treatment and expenses both for initiating and continuing treatment  15  . One promising approach to overcome these barriers of traditional psychological interventions are internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). IMIs can address these barriers, as IMIs are anonymous, effective, and accessible 24/7  16, 17  . Additionally, IMIs can be implemented as stand-alone self-help interventions, as blended care (a face-toface therapy extended with psychoeducation delivered via the internet) or as part of a stepped care approach in which the amount of support is adjusted to the patient's needs. IMIs were shown to be effective for treating common MDs across various settings and age groups  [18] [19] [20]  .\n\nAlthough the initial costs of developing IMIs can be substantial, the low marginal costs of providing IMIs to additional users can result in lower overall expenditure because of an economies of scale effect  16  . However, intervention costs largely vary based on the following four aspects: development phase (new product vs. modified version), scaling-up effects (small vs. large number of users), overestimation of costs (small number of study participants), and efficiency (improving productivity vs. additional costs when newly implemented)  21  . In addition, IMIs are likely to reduce healthcare costs compared with traditional face-to-face treatment, as IMIs reduce costs stemming from therapist's time and patient's travel to health services  22  . Hence, IMIs are often touted to be cost-effective despite the weak evidence base for their cost-effectiveness.\n\nSeveral systematic reviews have attempted to establish the cost-effectiveness of IMIs for MDs in comparison with various control groups. However, the presented evidence on whether IMIs for MDs provide good value for money is inconclusive because some reviews included only few internet-based studies: n = 3  23  , n = 4  24  , N = 12  25  , n = 1  26  , and n = 5  27  . In addition, 6 of 8 reviews can be considered obsolete today with the latest primary study stemming from 2016  [22] [23] [24] [25] 27, 28  , whereas many more studies have since been published, e.g., 26 identified ongoing costeffectiveness studies for major depression  25  . Moreo er, previous reviews used broad definitions of IMIs, e.g., any internet or web enabled platform for diagnosis, screening, treatment, prevention, training, education, or facilitating self-management of MDs  29  . Finally, previous reviews have not always included full health economic evaluations, but have reported costs and effects without relating them to each other  23, 29  , and if they did, they only focused on internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT)  22  . Likewise, there exist only a few economic evaluations for common treatment options (different types of psychotherapy, pharmacological interventions, such as antidepressants) for depression  30  and anxiety disorders  24  . Some evidence shows that psychotherapy might be cost-effective compared with pharmacological interventions.\n\nTherefore, a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art evidence of IMIs across MDs and symptoms including studies with good methodological quality and full economic evaluations are needed to enable better comparisons and obtain reliable conclusions on guidance, cost perspective, and psychological interventions other than iCBT.\n\nIn view of the disease and economic burden of MDs, first, we evaluated whether IMIs for the prevention and treatment of common MDs represent good value for money. Second, we assessed whether these interventions have a good methodological quality. In this respect, our review provides additional evidence to decision makers  31  to make informed decisions on the allocation of scarce resources to provide sustainable healthcare."

Three studies met all CHEC criteria  34, 43, 44  , whereas three studies showed average quality  41, 45, 46  . Common reasons for the lower quality were the lack of reporting on the generalizability of the results (n = 29), an insufficient time horizon (n = 16), or lack of sensitivity analyses (n = 8). All studies met the items on appropriateness of the economic study designs and outcome measurement.\n\nRegarding risk of bias (RoB), most studies showed good (n = 22), and only a few studies showed fair (n = 10) or poor (n = 4) quality (Fig.  2  and Table  3 ). Detection, attrition, and selection bias were low. By contrast, reporting bias (n = 9) and other biases were high (n = 14). Selective reporting may arise when outcomes for a CEA are not sufficiently described in study protocols and outcome paper. Other biases may arise when there are insufficient information or limitations because of the high complexity of assessing outcomes, e.g., the annualization of short term costs. The agreement for CHEC and RoB between the two raters with Cohen's kappa (\u03ba) = 0.90-0.91 can be considered almost perfect  47  ."

Depressive symptom severity at baseline had no recognizable effect on cost-effectiveness. One-third of the studies (n = 5) evaluated unguided IMIs based on CBT (n = 4) or positive psychology (n = 1  48  ). As for unguided IMIs compared with TAU (n = 3), results from the CUA conducted from the healthcare perspective after 1-2 years did not suggest an economic merit  40, 49  (at a WTP threshold of \u00a330,000, the probability of cost-effectiveness varied: CUA = 4-38%). However, findings from the societal perspective suggested that one IMI  50  had an acceptable likelihood of being cost-effective (at WTP = 0, CEA = 70%; at WTP = \u00a330,000; CUA = 55%). Compared with WLC or AC (n = 2), unguided IMIs from the societal perspective provided only little and unclear evidence for cost-effectiveness (at the WTP = 0, CEA = 20% 48 ; CUA was not reported  41  ).\n\nSix of the 15 studies evaluated guided IMIs based on iCBT (n = 4) or iPST (n = 2).

From the employer's perspective, one IMI was the dominant treatment option (WTP = 0, CEA = 55%)  52  .\n\nFour guided  [53] [54] [55] [56]  IMIs, compared with WLC, were considered cost-effective (<\u00a330,000 per QALY gained, probabilities ranging from 55  53  to 98%  55  ) from the societal and healthcare perspective. Results of the cost-effectiveness analyses were unclear  54  or showed a low likelihood of being cost-effective at a WTP of nil from a societal perspective (CEA = 30-38%  53  ).\n\nTwo studies compared similarly effective guided to unguided IMIs after 12 months. In one study, from the societal perspective, both IMIs generated less costs than usual care and were judged costeffective  57  (<\u00a330,000 per QALY gained, probabilities were not reported). In the other study, from the NHS' perspective, the guided IMI resulted in more QALYs gained at lower costs than the unguided IMI (considered cost-effective, at WTP = \u00a3 30,000, CUA = 55% 39 ).\n\nPrevention of MDD onset and relapse prevention. The remaining studies evaluating guided IMIs (n = 2) focused on the prevention  43  or relapse  44  of MDD in comparison with usual care. Findings from cost-effectiveness analyses employing a societal perspective suggested a moderate likelihood of them being cost-effective, with probabilities ranging from 38% to 40% at a WTP of nil. CUA showed a moderate (CUA = 40%  44  ) to acceptable (CUA = 60%  43  ; ICUR < \u00a330,000 per QALY gained) likelihood of them being cost-effective. From the healthcare perspective, one IMI  43  showed a small likelihood of being cost-effective per depression-free year gained (WTP = 0, CEA = 17%) but was considered cost-effective when below the cost-utility threshold (at WTP = \u00a330,000, CUA = 64%).\n\nAnxiety disorders or symptoms. Eight studies evaluated guided (n = 5) and unguided (n = 3) IMIs for anxiety disorders based on CBT compared with TAU, AC, WLC, group-administered CBT (gCBT), or iMA. The included studies targeted panic disorder (n = 1), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (n = 1), health anxiety (n = 2), social anxiety (n = 2), any anxiety disorder (n = 1), and PTSD (n = 1).\n\nThree studies comparing guided IMIs to AC or WLC in the short term (8-12 weeks) were judged cost-effective from the societal and healthcare perspectives (<\u00a330,000, per QALY gained, probabilities >90%  46, 58, 59  ). Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that the IMIs dominated the control group by generating less costs at higher effects from the societal perspective (at WTP = 0, CEA = 64 58 -95%  46  ).\n\nTwo studies comparing guided IMIs with gCBT after 6 months to 4 years provided good evidence for their cost-effectiveness. The first IMI was cost-effective from the societal perspective in the short and long term (<\u00a330,000 per QALY gained, CUA = 34 37 -79% 36 ). Results of the cost-effectiveness analyses showed that the IMI produced less costs at higher effects (WTP = 0, CEA = 81% 36 ) in the short term and increased costs with lower probability of being cost-effective in the long term (WTP = 0, CEA = 62%  37  ). From a healthcare perspective, the same IMI was cost-effective based on a CMA (WTP = \u00a330,000, CMA = 67%  38  ). The second IMI was likewise cost-effective from the healthcare perspective, being the dominant treatment option (WTP = 0, CEA = 75%  45  ).\n\nBy contrast, for two studies evaluating unguided IMIs, the results of the cost-utility analyses were considered cost-effective (yet no probabilities were reported), but the CEA did not support these findings. The first IMI  60  was compared with unguided iMA from a societal perspective, which resulted in higher costs per responder, showing low probabilities of being cost-effective (at WTP = 0, CEA = 8%), but being below the \u00a330,000 threshold per QALY gained. The second IMI generated less costs per QALY gained than WLC from both healthcare and societal perspectives  61  . A third unguided study compared an unguided IMI (self-help app) targeting posttraumatic stress  62  with TAU from a healthcare perspective and showed a low probability of cost-effectiveness (\u224827% at WTP = \u00a330,000 per QALY gained)."

The evidence for cost-effectiveness was contradictory regarding QALYs and moderate regarding clinical outcomes because of heterogeneous control conditions.\n\nFrom the societal and healthcare perspective, one IMI was costeffective compared with AC being below the acceptable threshold per QALY gained (at WTP \u00a330,000, CUA = 90-95%  63  ). By contrast, the IMI was judged not cost-effective per additional remission in the short term (at WTP = 0, CEA = 0-15%) nor per relapse Fig.  2  Risk of bias assessment.

One IMI was cost-effective compared with WLC and below the threshold per QALY gained (at WTP = \u00a330,000  34  , CUA = 99%) from the societal and healthcare perspectives. Cost-effectiveness analyses also showed a high probability of being cost-effective, dominating the WLC per additional treatment responder (CEA = 87%, employer's perspective  35  ) or symptom-free status (CEA = 94%, societal perspective  34  ), but generating higher costs from the healthcare perspective, leading to a low probability of cost-effectiveness (CEA = 6%  34  ).\n\nAnother IMI  67  was compared with gCBT from a societal perspective. Both treatments showed similar effects, and the IMI led to a high probability of cost-savings while trading off health gains (at WTP = 0, CEA = 95%) but generating more QALYs (at WTP = \u00a330.000, CUA = not reported).\n\nIMIs targeting adjustment or exhaustion disorder, or perceived stress, were mostly cost-effective compared with WLC. Based on findings of the cost-utility analyses, two IMIs were below the threshold of \u00a330.000, showing high probabilities of being costeffective from the societal perspective (CUA = 75 68 -79% 33 ). In addition, findings of the cost-effectiveness analyses showed that both IMIs dominated the WLC, yielding acceptable probabilities of cost-effectiveness at a WTP of nil from the employer's (CEA = 67%  69  ) and societal (CEA = 70% 33 ) perspectives, but not from the healthcare perspective (CEA = 12% 68 ) where higher costs were generated.\n\nThe only unguided IMI  70  targeting suicidal ideation dominated the WLC, generating a high probability of being cost-effective at a WTP of nil from the societal perspective (CEA = 92%).\n\nWorkplace setting. Cost-benefit analyses evaluating costs relevant to the employer yielded a benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) > 1 (1.6-3.1) and net-benefit greater zero (181-417), which indicates that guided IMIs were cost-effective when compared with TAU and WLC for the treatment of insomnia  35  , elevated stress  69  , and depression  52  .\n\nGuidance and comparators. The majority of studies evaluated guided IMIs (n = 24), which were mostly cost-effective, indicated by ICURs < \u00a330,000/QALY gained, irrespective of the types of control conditions. However, unguided IMIs (n = 11) showed little evidence of cost-effectiveness."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This review presents a comprehensive overview of trial-based economic evaluations providing evidence regarding the costeffectiveness of IMIs for the prevention and treatment of MDs and symptoms. This review identified 32 studies applying societal (n = 24), healthcare (n = 15), and employer's perspectives (n = 3) in 65 full economic evaluations (CBA, n = 3; CEA, n = 31; CMA, n = 1; CUA, n = 30).\n\nIn half of the CEAs (N = 14; MDD, n = 3; anxiety, n = 5; stress, n = 3; sleep n = 2; suicidal ideation, n = 1), the IMI was the dominant treatment option, which means that more health effects were generated at lower costs in comparison with control conditions. Of these, two did not report a WTP and five showed a high probability (\u226580%) of being more cost-effective than control conditions at a WTP of nil. For all CEAs, the range of probability at WTP of nil varied from 0 to 95%. Regarding cost-utility, most interventions were cost-effective, being either dominant (n = 13) and/or below the WTP threshold of \u00a330,000 per QALY gained (n = 26) compared with any control condition and often regardless of the perspectives taken. By applying the criterion that an IMI showed at least an 80% probability of cost-effectiveness at WTP of \u00a330,000 compared with a control condition (if reported), 11 IMIs were judged to be cost-effective. Cost-benefit analyses from the employer's perspective (n = 3) yielded positive net benefits representing the money gained after costs were recovered. In addition, the overall quality of studies (CHEC) was good (n = 30), only a few were excellent (n = 3) or average (n = 3). Reasons for a low rating were no discussion of generalizability, short time horizon, or lack of sensitivity analyses. Regarding RoB, most studies showed good quality (n = 22), and only few studies (n = 6) showed at least one item at high risk of bias.\n\nOur findings expand and strengthen the evidence base for the cost-effectiveness of IMIs. First, our findings support the evidence of cost-effectiveness of guided IMIs for depression and anxiety  24, 25, [27] [28] [29]  . Second, our review includes new evidence related to under-researched disorders such as OCD (n = 4), PTSD (n = 1), stress (n = 3), and sleep (n = 2). However, given the limited number of studies, more evidence is needed.\n\nThe strength of this review is related to the comprehensive and systematic search strategy in several electronic databases for common MDs and problems, and the resulting health-economic comparisons. The quality of studies was assessed on the methodology of cost-effectiveness analyses and RoB. To further improve comparability and clarity, economic outcomes were converted to Pound Sterling for the reference year 2020 and mapped to the quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane in which the mean ICER fell (as far as reported in the primary studies). Likewise, unified thresholds and transparent criteria proposed by the authors were used.\n\nHowever, the comparability of evidence across the studies was hampered by the high heterogeneity stemming from different study designs, methods, study populations, outcome measures, time horizons, comparators, economic perspectives, cost items, and their evaluation. As a case in point, the operationalization of societal costs and intervention costs varied widely. The costs of development and maintenance of the IMIs were often not included or incompletely reported, leading to a possible underestimation of intervention costs. Half of the studies (n = 16) did not report intervention costs or only valued the time for the therapist needed to support the participants.\n\nAnother limitation is the lack of interpretability regarding costeffectiveness, as the WTP for diagnosis-specific measures (e.g., symptom-free, reliable change) is unknown and the WTP threshold for QALYs is somewhat arbitrary, as universally accepted thresholds are unavailable  71  . For healthcare decision-making, several countries compared ICER to a reference value (generic cost-effectiveness threshold) that represents the maximum cost the health system is willing to pay for a health outcome. These generic thresholds vary largely depending on the methods (e.g., per capita income, benchmarking interventions, and leagues tables: ranking the ICERs of interventions given a specific budget) and setting  71  . An international survey assessing the individual WTP for one additional QALY gained showed that the thresholds vary between countries (e.g., Taiwan 2.14 times the UK's per QALY gained)  72  . Consequently, higher thresholds lead to interventions being adopted earlier than in countries with lower thresholds. Beyond the narrow cost-effectiveness arguments, other criteria of health technology assessment should also be considered for decision-making purposes (e.g., disease burden, prognosis, medical ethics, access, equity, feasibility of implementation and scale-up of the interventions, and acceptability of the intervention by its intended recipients)  73  . Furthermore, most health-economic evaluations alongside randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are not powered to detect differences in costs nor QALYs. This might result in non-significant differences in costs and QALYs, which can lead to wider uncertainty intervals surrounding the ICER estimates  74  . Moreover, some studies (n = 3) only collected data over a short period of the study duration and annualized effects and costs. In addition, in some studies (n = 6), the uncertainty surrounding the ICER point estimates was not clear because neither the CEA plane nor the cost-effectiveness acceptability where reported. As all studies were conducted in Western countries, especially in the NW Europe, the generalizability of results is restricted to these regions. In this regard, selection bias could have been introduced, as only studies published in German and English were included.\n\nThe results may lead to several clinical implications. The review could be important for decision-makers when allocating scant resources to meet the demands for the many in need of sustainable healthcare. With the increasing use of economic data in decision-making in public mental health and the increasing societal and economic burden of MDs, consideration of the cost-effectiveness of psychological preventive interventions and treatments is becoming increasingly important. IMIs might be an important way forward. Moreover, since the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing numbers of patients and health services had to shift toward IMIs for the receipt and delivery of mental healthcare. Thus, this may have paved the way for scaled-up uptake of IMIs.\n\nDespite the high heterogeneity stemming from intervention types and comparators of the included studies, some promising trends toward specific mental health targets were seen. Recommendations for policy makers and relevant stakeholders can be made, relating to existing NHS guidelines  75  for the application of low-intensity psychosocial interventions in depression and anxiety. Based on our results, guided IMIs for MDD and anxiety disorders should be offered as treatment option. The evidence regarding the costeffectiveness of under-researched disorders (e.g., OCD, sleep, and stress) and of unguided interventions is limited, and offering such interventions should rely on case-by-case decisions. However, unguided IMIs are scalable and easy to implement, showing a high potential to make an impact at a population level.\n\nBesides these recommendations related to financial aspects, the implementation setting, target population, symptom severity and disorders should be considered. In addition, knowledge about diverse stakeholders' views and values relevant to priority setting enables decision-makers to make better-informed decisions and appropriate judgments about allocation of scant resources.\n\nIn practice, most healthcare providers are receptive to the advantages of IMIs as part of their treatment. However, IMIs should meet the criteria of government reimbursement mechanisms, like the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) in the UK or the one for digital health applications in medical and psychotherapeutic care in Germany, to become sustainable. Such criteria include evidence on effectiveness, interoperability, safety, and data security  76  .\n\nFollowing this, we provide several recommendations for future research. First, various anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, GAD, and social anxiety were underrepresented, and disorders such as specific phobias were not found for this review. Moreover, studies were only conducted in resource-rich high-income countries. Hence, we recommend focusing on under-researched disorders and conducting research in low-and middle-income countries.\n\nSecond, we recommend publishing study protocols that adhere to economic evaluation guidelines (ISPOR 77 and CHEERS  78  ) and quality checklists  (Drummond 31  and CHEC  79  ), thereby minimizing biases and improving study quality (e.g., reporting of uncertainty, sensitivity analysis and combined reporting of disease-specific and generic health outcomes to facilitate comparability, and interpretation for decision-making).\n\nThird, the cost-effectiveness of IMIs for MDs and symptoms was frequently based on short term findings (6-16 weeks, n = 13), whereas the remaining studies reported findings based on moderate (6-12 months, n = 14) to long follow-up periods (2-4 years, n = 3). We recommend conducting economic evaluations over longer follow-up periods to better capture longer-term productivity losses and gains, especially in preventive interventions in remittent disorders, such as anxiety disorders.\n\nFourth, more research is needed on IMIs compared with active control condition across all disorders to establish the costeffectiveness of IMIs as possible alternative to face-to-face treatments.\n\nFifth, studies are needed to carefully choose the perspectives taken depending on the decision maker, target population, disorder, or setting. For employers, productivity losses are most important, whereas from a healthcare system's perspective, a high healthcare coverage for people affected by disorders is prioritized.\n\nFinally, the acceptability of an IMI among patients and relevant stakeholders is worth investigating to provide more insights pertinent for the implementation, uptake, and use thereof.\n\nIn conclusion, this systematic review provides an overview of economic evaluations of internet-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of MDs. Guided iCBTs for anxiety disorders and MDD showed a high probability of being costeffective. IMIs for insomnia, suicidal ideation, and stress had the potential of being cost-effective, whereas the evidence base for the cost-effectiveness of IMIs in OCD was not very firm. Although many studies were identified, more robust conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of IMIs could not be reached given the high heterogeneity across the studies with regard to methodologies, interventions, and comparators in a range of disorders and symptoms among various populations and age groups. More cost-effectiveness research is warranted in unguided and preventive IMIs that are proven to be effective, specifically in under-researched disorders and symptoms and preferably over longer time horizons. From a methodological perspective, future studies should more stringently adhere to existing healtheconomic guidelines to increase comparability and enhance their value for decision-making purposes in healthcare."
