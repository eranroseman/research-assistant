      "text": "Evidence synthesis: Twenty-f\u0131ve studies (27 comparisons) were included: 16 for physical activity, two for diet, and seven for combined interventions. Twenty of 27 comparisons found evidence for initiation of behavior change (14 of 17 comparisons for physical activity; two of two for diet; four of eight for combined interventions). Ten of 25 studies evaluated post-intervention maintenance of change, with three reporting that maintenance was achieved for at least 50% of outcomes. Dissemination studies were rare (n\u03ed3), as were dose-response (n\u03ed2) and cost-effectiveness analyses (n\u03ed2).\n\nConclusions: Given the strength of evidence for telephone-delivered physical activity and dietary change interventions, greater emphasis on dissemination studies is warranted.\n\n(Am J Prev Med 2012;42 (1):81-88) \u00a9 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine Context T he importance of regular physical activity and a healthy diet is widely recognized in the prevention and management of many prevalent chronic conditions, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.  1  In the context of an aging population, and concerns about increasing rates of overweight and obesity and lifestyle-related chronic diseases, effective and broad-reaching physical activity and dietary-change interventions are required. The evidence base for behavior change interventions targeting physical activity and healthy eating, in a range of settings and with a number of target groups, is well established, particularly with regard to its eff\u0131cacy in promoting short-term behavior change.  [2] [3] 3] [4]  Mediated (non-face-to-face) intervention delivery modalities, primarily print, Internet, and telephone, have the potential to offer a cost-effective means of providing the repeated contacts necessary to promote behavior change.  [5] [6] 6] [7]  Telephone delivery is one of the most accessible of these mediated approaches to intervention, and holds distinct promise for its potential for adoption by health agencies and other organizations that routinely operate telephone information and support centers.  5, 8 ver the past decade, an increasing number of RCTs of telephone-delivered physical activity and/or dietary behavior change interventions have been reported. A systematic review published in 2007 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found the evidence for these interventions to be strong, with 20 of 26 studies reviewed reporting end-of-intervention improvements in targeted behaviors.  5 Overall, the review concluded that there was a solid evidence base supporting the eff\u0131cacy of telephonedelivered interventions in promoting initiation of physi-cal activity and dietary behavior change,  5  but evidence for uptake into practice was limited.  9 It was recommended that future research be oriented to more explicitly inform translation into practice, including evaluation of the potential for telephone-delivered interventions to achieve maintenance of behavior change post-intervention; the optimal intervention dose (frequency and duration of telephone contacts); and cost effectiveness.  5 ike the broader health behavior change literature, in the f\u0131eld of physical activity and dietary change interventions, the science related to translating evidence-based programs with f\u0131delity in real-world settings lags far behind the science related to evaluations of eff\u0131cacy in controlled trials.  10, 11 If the current wealth of evidence from intervention trials is to inform practice, there is a pressing need to examine factors relevant to external validity and the generalizability of f\u0131ndings. This is an issue about which much has been written  12, 13  and around which evaluation frameworks such as RE-AIM  14  and reporting guidelines such as the PRECIS criteria recommended by the CONSORT Working Group on Pragmatic Trials have been developed.  15, 16 onsistent with this emphasis on the conduct of research that informs practice, this updated systematic review examines the recent evidence on telephone-delivered interventions for physical activity and dietary change. The impetus for this update was the increasing number of reports of such studies since the last review,  5  and the need to assess the extent to this rapidly growing evidence base is relevant to informing the translation of these interventions into viable and sustainable programs within community settings (such as government and nongovernment health promotion agencies). Four specif\u0131c research questions are addressed: (1) What is the evidence for the effectiveness of telephone-delivered interventions for physical activity and diet in producing both initiation and maintenance of behavior change? (2) To what extent are indicators of implementation (i.e., number and length of calls completed, delivery agent, staff training, and intervention f\u0131delity) being reported and are they associated with intervention outcomes? (3) To what extent are costs being reported and what is the evidence for cost effectiveness? (4) To what extent are study designs with increased potential to inform translation into practice (i.e., comparative-effectiveness and dissemination studies) being used?"

      "text": "For studies that met the inclusion criteria, detailed information on study design, intervention features, and behavioral outcomes was extracted and tabulated. Appendixes A-C (available online at  www.ajpmonline.org ) show the summarized data. Effect sizes for all physical activity and/or dietary behavior change outcomes were calculated as Cohen's d.  21 (Where possible, this was calculated as intervention minus control group change divided by the pooled baseline SD. Where change was not available, follow-up values for intervention and control were used instead). According to Cohen's guidelines, an effect size of 0.2-0.49 is considered a small effect size, 0.5-0.79 is considered a moderate effect size, and 0.8 or greater is considered a large effect size.  21  study was considered to have a positive outcome regarding initiation of behavior change if at least 50% of reported behavioral outcomes demonstrated a between-group difference in favor of the telephone intervention group at end of intervention. Similarly, a study was considered to have a positive maintenance outcome if at least 50% of reported outcomes demonstrated a between-group difference in behavior in favor of the telephone-intervention group at end of intervention and at follow-up (at least 3 months after completion of the intervention). For dissemination studies, similar criteria were applied to within-group behavior change. A criterion of 50% or more was chosen so that studies measuring fewer outcomes were not penalized.\n\nThe methodologic quality of eligible studies was reviewed according to Cochrane Review Guidelines, the CONSORT statement, and the PEDro scale.  [22] [23] 3] [24]  A methodologic quality score was calculated (such that one point was awarded for each of six criteria\n\nSee Commentaries by Pronk and by Reynolds and Trinidad in this issue. met), according to the following: (1) adequate randomization procedure (i.e., computer or other random sequencing); (2) group allocation concealment (i.e., the person who revealed the allocation had no means of influencing it); (3) use of validated behavioral measurement tools; (4) data collection staff blind to participant group allocation; (5) reporting on attrition; and (6) acceptable attrition (i.e., no more than 15% attrition at 6 months, no more than 20% at 12 months, and no more than 25% for interventions longer than 12 months).\n\nThe RCTs were rated on all six criteria, whereas dissemination studies included in this review all used pre-post designs and, thus, were rated on the three relevant criteria (i.e., use of validated tools, reporting, and level of attrition). Indicators of implementation were chosen consistent with the RE-AIM framework  25  and included reporting of the following: the number of intervention calls completed, the length of calls, the intervention delivery agent, training of interventionists, and intervention f\u0131delity monitoring."

      "text": "Just more than one half of studies reported on the number of calls completed by the end of intervention (13/25) and on the average length of calls completed (14/25). All studies reported on the intervention delivery agent(s), with approximately one half (12/25) reporting details of staff training. Methods for assessing intervention f\u0131delity were reported by just under one half of studies (12/25).\n\nNo studies experimentally compared interventions of different duration or varying number of calls. Two studies  35, 55  reported secondary analyses that examined associations of intervention dose with behavior change outcomes. Although such analyses cannot speak to causality, f\u0131ndings from both studies indicate that completion of a higher number of calls was associated with greater improvements in physical activity and/or diet. Also, specif\u0131c subgroups were more diff\u0131cult to reach, completing fewer calls across both interventions (i.e., younger age groups and those working full-time).\n\nUsing data from all studies in the review, end-ofintervention behavioral improvements were examined in relation to the length of intervention. Intervention length was categorized as follows: short, up to 5 months; medium, 6 -11 months; and long, \u054612 months. Improvements were seen in 7/12 outcomes of short-duration interventions; 22/40 for medium duration; and 37/50 outcomes of longerduration interventions, suggesting greater effectiveness for interventions of longer duration. Question 3. To what extent are costs being reported and what is the evidence for their cost effectiveness?\n\nOnly two studies  45, 56  reported on cost effectiveness. Both cost analyses led to the conclusion that the telephone-delivered interventions were cost effective. In one of these studies,  45  incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated to compare each intervention condition (i.e., telephone alone, print alone, combined telephone and print) to control and each other. Costs included both intervention delivery and participant-specif\u0131c. Effectiveness was based on the effect size for fruit and vegetable intake. Findings demonstrated that combining both print and telephone delivery was more cost effective for improving fruit and vegetable intake than either modality alone.\n\nThe other study  56  (which used Markov modeling to predict the progress of participants through health states relating to physical activity and dietary improvement for 10 years after recruitment) compared the costs and health benef\u0131ts of the telephone intervention to enhanced usual care and existing practice (real control). For the telephone intervention, all individual costs including workbooks and mailed information were attributed to participants. Costs incurred for jointly used resources were allocated across successful contacts such that counselor time, f\u0131xed overheads, and staff costs of managing the program were allocated to participants on the basis of number and duration of calls completed. Against what authors considered to be the most useful comparator of existing practice (i.e., real control), telephone counseling demonstrated a lower cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.  56 Further, two studies  41, 49  reported on intervention delivery costs."

      "title": "Question 4. To what extent are study designs with increased potential to inform translation (i.e., comparative-effectiveness and dissemination studies) being used?",
      "text": "Comparative-effectiveness studies. Six studies involved the comparison of a telephone-delivered intervention and another intervention arm to a control group: three  34, 39, 51  compared a telephone intervention and another intervention modality (i.e., print, Internet, faceto-face group) to a control group; two compared two telephone-delivered arms (i.e., telephone counseling delivered via human advice versus automated delivery  31  and brief telephone counseling versus longer motivational interviewing-focused telephone counseling  38  ) to a control; and one 45 compared two telephone arms (i.e., combined print and telephone group versus telephone only) to a print-based intervention arm and a control group.\n\nAcross the six studies, telephone, print,  34  and webdelivered interventions  51  were shown to be equally effective for initiation of physical activity behavior change. In the study that compared face-to-face group-based delivery to telephone delivery, the telephone-delivered intervention was more effective for both initiation and maintenance of physical activity.  39 Combined telephone and print delivery demonstrated benef\u0131t over either print or telephone delivery alone for initiation of dietary change but not physical activity.  45 Automated telephone delivery was shown to be more effective compared to control and equally effective as telephone counseling via human advice for physical activity.  31 Telephone counseling guided by motivational interviewing was found to be no more effective than brief telephone or control for walking.  38 ssemination studies. Only three studies  29, 40, 42  evaluated outcomes of telephone-delivered interventions in dissemination contexts, all of which were focused on physical activity. Of these, two were large-scale dissemination studies targeting older adults-the California Active Aging Community Grant Program  29  and Active for Life: Active Choices.  42 Both were effectiveness studies evaluating whether the intervention when delivered in a community setting could achieve outcomes comparable to those previously reported in controlled eff\u0131cacy trials.  52, 57 Participant recruitment and intervention delivery were conducted by staff in community centers. Further, necessary adaptations to facilitate implementation were carefully documented and reported.  29, 42, 58 The remaining dissemination study evaluated the feasibility of changing the telephone intervention delivery agent, from research staff used in the eff\u0131cacy trial  59  to trained volunteers.\n\nAlthough all dissemination studies were noncontrolled single-group designs, they were of sound methodologic quality. The two large-scale dissemination studies were published in high-impact preventive/behavioral medicine journals, with large and diverse samples (California Active Aging Community Grant Program: n \u03ed 548; Active for Life: Active Choices: n \u03ed 2503). All studies reported pre-post intervention improvements in physical activity consistent with f\u0131ndings from their original RCTs. The two studies that included a maintenance follow-up post-intervention also demonstrated that be-havioral improvements were sustained following a period of no contact.  42, 54, 59 scussion This systematic review updates an earlier review 5 of telephone-delivered physical activity and dietary intervention studies published in 2007. Of particular note is the increasing rate of publications, with this update identifying almost as many studies published within a 4-year period as the previous review, which included studies conducted over 4 decades. This update found continued strong evidence for telephone-delivered physical activity and dietary behavior interventions for producing initiation of behavior change, with 20 of 27 comparisons (from 25 trials) demonstrating end-of-intervention improvements in targeted behavior(s), compared to 20 of 26 studies in the earlier review.  5 t is encouraging that evaluations of maintenance of behavior change following the end of intervention are being reported with greater frequency, with just under one half of studies evaluating health behavior outcomes following a period of no-intervention contact, compared to two of 26 studies in the previous review.  5 Further, the length of time between end of intervention and the longest follow-up time point has increased from 1-3 months to 3-12 months. However, the present review provides only modest support for the ability of telephonedelivered interventions to maintain behavior change post-intervention, with around one third of studies with maintenance follow-ups achieving maintenance of behavior change.  2 t is important to note that the application of more-or less-stringent criteria to def\u0131ne successful initiation and maintenance is likely to lead to different conclusions. This is seen in the results of a recent review on the maintenance of behavior change following physical activity and dietary interventions (using any delivery mechanism, not only telephone delivery), which employed a less-stringent criterion than the one used here; a study was considered successful if at least one behavioral outcome was signif\u0131cant at post-test and maintenance. Results indicated strong support for the ability of health behavior change interventions to promote sustainability of change, with 21 of the 29 intervention trials included in the review deemed to have achieved maintenance.  2 Thus, the issue of how best to def\u0131ne success of interventions with multiple behavioral outcomes, particularly in terms of maintenance, requires further consideration. Future research on the ability of telephone-delivered interventions to promote maintenance of behavior change is also needed.\n\nOverall, reporting of intervention implementation was less than optimal. Approximately one half of studies did not report on the number and length of calls completed, staff training, and methods for assessing intervention f\u0131delity. As noted,  12, 13  this lack of attention to issues of external validity hampers the ability to translate a strong evidence base into population health policy and practice. However, an important f\u0131nding in the previous review, and replicated here, is the association of longer-duration interventions with improvements in behavior change. The current review used more-stringent criteria for def\u0131ning successful behavior change than the 2007 review and, as such, the evidence from this review suggests that interventions of at least 12 months' duration are associated with more-signif\u0131cant improvements in behavioral outcomes than those of shorter duration. This evidence is consistent with a shift in health behavior change interventions to longer-term intervention delivery  60 -62  and supports the use of the telephone as an effective delivery mechanism for longer-duration interventions.\n\nCost analyses were rare (two studies  45, 63  ) but, when conducted, f\u0131ndings supported the cost effectiveness of telephone-delivered interventions. As noted in a recent report,  12  an analysis of costs can be complex and often requires the addition of health economics expertise. However, at a minimum, costs to deliver the intervention should be systematically tracked and reported to inform uptake into practice.\n\nOnly a handful of studies comparing the telephone to other intervention delivery modalities were identif\u0131ed. Taken as a whole, f\u0131ndings from these six studies indicate that telephone delivery is typically similar in effectiveness to other delivery modalities, including in comparison to face-to-face delivery and when used in combination with other modalities (such as print materials). The addition of cost-effectiveness analyses to future trials would help to determine whether telephone delivery is preferable to other delivery modalities.\n\nOverall, there is limited literature on the dissemination of evidence-based telephone-delivered physical activity and/or dietary behavior interventions. To date, only two studies  30, 42  have reported on the outcomes of large-scale telephone-delivered physical activity dissemination studies, and none targeted diet alone or combined behaviors. Nevertheless, f\u0131ndings from these studies indicate that these interventions can be delivered successfully to achieve results comparable to those observed in controlled research settings, and in so doing, may even reach more diverse samples.  30, 42 Although using noncontrolled designs, these are seminal studies important to demonstrating the feasibility and success of translating such programs into practice. Of note, both dissemination studies reported the necessity of adaptations to the or-ginal interventions to meet the needs of adopting agencies."

      "title": "Conclusion and Recommendations",
      "text": "Findings from this updated review provide continuing strong evidence supporting the eff\u0131cacy of telephonedelivered interventions to promote physical activity and dietary change. In fact, the evidence is so strong that it supports the contention by Kessler and Glasgow, put forward recently in this journal,  12  that RCT designs (at least those comparing a telephone-delivered intervention to a no-treatment control) are no longer needed. What is needed is a concerted focus on research that may assist integration of telephone-delivered health behavior change interventions within healthcare and population health delivery systems.\n\nIn this regard, f\u0131ndings from this review reveal a number of important gaps, restated as recommendations for future research below:\n\n1. Evaluation of longer-term outcomes following the end of intervention is needed, with preference for follow-up assessment at least 6 -12 months post-intervention. 2 2. Related to the above is the need to develop and evaluate strategies to promote maintenance of behavior change. This might involve interventions of longer duration with continued telephone contacts as well as consideration of potentially more cost-effective strategies for enhancing maintenance (such as the delivery of brief \"booster\" contacts using SMS or email). 2 3. At a minimum, reporting on intervention delivery costs, including required infrastructure, staff training, and management support, is needed. Where possible, cost-effectiveness analysis should be undertaken and reported. 4. Comparative-effectiveness studies contrasting telephone to other broad-reach intervention delivery modalities such as tailored print and Internet-based programs will be particularly useful in informing appropriate use of resources. 5. Dissemination studies that elucidate whether evidence-based interventions can in fact be implemented in \"real-world\" contexts to achieve outcomes similar to those in controlled settings should be prioritized. More important than randomized designs in such studies is systematic tracking and reporting of indicators of external validity (i.e., setting and participant reach and representativeness, feasibility and f\u0131delity of implementation, and costs to deliver). Documentation and reporting of the processes by which interventions come to be taken up for delivery and potential adaptations necessary to enhance f\u0131t within community contexts is also needed to further inform translation into practice.  64 his study was supported by a Queensland Health Core Research Infrastructure Grant and NHMRC Program Grant funding (no. 301200).
