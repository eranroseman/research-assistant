  "title": "Cost-effectiveness of physical activity programs and services for older adults: a scoping review",
  "abstract": "Background: Evidence supporting physical activity for older adults is strongly positive. Implementation and scale-up of these interventions need to consider the value for money. This scoping review aimed to assess the volume of (i) systematic review evidence regarding economic evaluations of physical activity interventions, and (ii) of cost utility analysis (CUA) studies (trialor model-based) of physical activity interventions for older people. Methods: We searched five databases (January 2010 to February 2022) for systematic reviews of economic evaluations, and two databases (1976(  to February 2022) )  for CUA studies of physical activity interventions for any population of people aged 60+ years. Results: We found 12 potential reviews, two of which were eligible for inclusion. The remaining 10 reviews included eligible individual studies that were included in this review. All individual studies from the 12 reviews (n = 37) investigated the cost-effectiveness of structured exercise and most showed the intervention was more costly but more effective than no intervention. We identified 27 CUA studies: two investigated a physical activity promotion program and the remainder investigated structured exercise. Most interventions (86%) were more costly but more effective, and the remaining were costsaving compared to no intervention. Conclusions: There is a scarcity of reviews investigating the value for money of physical activity interventions for older adults. Most studies investigated structured exercise. Physical activity interventions were generally more effective than no intervention but more costly. As such an intervention could be cost-effective and therefore worthy of wider implementation, but there is a need for more frequent economic evaluation in this field.",

      "text": "Despite the well-recognised health benefits of physical activity  [1, 2] , participation remains low worldwide. Physical activity is defined as 'any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure' including during leisure time, for transport or as part of work  [3] . Exercise is a type of physical activity that is structured, planned and repetitive intended to improve or maintain physical fitness  [3] . Physical inactivity increases with age, directly impacting the independence, physical function and quality of life of older adults  [1, [4] [5] [6] . Only one in two older adults regularly undertake physical activity and fewer engage in multicomponent physical activity targeting balance and strength as recommended in the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour (2020)  [3, 7] . There is a substantial body of evidence investigating interventions to increase physical activity and physical activity programs/services for older people  [8] . A recent rapid review of 1,421 intervention studies evaluating physical activity programs/services for older adults showed positive impacts for overall activity, structured exercise and recreation/sport across several outcomes  [9] . Strategies to implement effective physical activity interventions in this population are urgently needed as there are now more than 1 billion people aged over 60 years worldwide and this number is expected to increase to 2 billion by 2050  [10] .\n\nIn light of the demonstrated benefits of physical activity for healthy ageing as well as the substantial physical inactivity across the lifespan, there is an urgent need for global action on physical inactivity. The WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity (GAPPA) describes four strategic policy objectives, namely Active Societies, Active Environments, Active People and Active Systems, as well as related policy actions that are applicable to all countries, aimed at addressing the cultural, environmental, social and individual determinants of physical inactivity  [3] . To enhance adoption of these policy recommendations across the world, WHO is developing ACTIVE  [11] , a technical toolkit with implementation guidance for key approaches, settings and population groups to support countries to adopt, tailor and implement the policy recommendations to achieve the global target of reducing physical inactivity by 10% by 2025 and by 15% by 2030.\n\nTo inform the development of ACTIVE and the direction of future research, WHO commissioned a scoping review on the availability and breadth of scientific evidence regarding physical activity interventions for older adults. This scoping review had two components: (i) determine the volume of evidence on the effectiveness of physical activity interventions for older adults, and (ii) determine the volume of evidence of economic evaluations of physical activity interventions for older adults. The results of the effectiveness component have been published elsewhere  [8] . The present manuscript focuses on economic evaluation.\n\nA primary goal of the health care system is to maximise health benefits given scarce and finite resources. Economic evaluations that estimate the incremental costs and effects of one strategy when compared to another are commonly used to guide health policy decisions  [12] . Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is a special type of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in which health effects are measured in terms of qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) gained  [12] . One advantage of using CUA is that QALY provides a common metric that allows comparison across conditions and populations.\n\nThe aim of this review was to conduct an overview of economic evaluations of physical activity interventions for older adults. The specific questions were:\n\n1. What is the volume of systematic reviews of economic evaluations of physical activity interventions for older adults? (review of reviews) 2. What is the volume of CUA of physical activity interventions for older adults? (review of CUA studies)"

      "text": "A search for systematic reviews of economic evaluations of physical activity interventions was conducted within the search results from the scoping review of physical activity interventions for older adults  [8] . We searched Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the\n\nCochrane Library from 1 January 2010 to 16 February 2022 for systematic reviews of physical activity interventions in people aged 60+ years using optimised searches (Appendix File 1 available in Age and Ageing online). Studies were selected according to the following criteria: \u2022 Population: adults aged 60+ years, of either sex, recruited from the general population or selected for pre-existing medical conditions. \u2022 Intervention: any intervention aimed at increasing physical activity levels or physical activity programs or services. Interventions delivered in an inpatient setting were excluded as well as multifactorial/multiple interventions where it was not possible to determine the effect of the physical activity intervention specifically. \u2022 Comparison: any comparison. \u2022 Outcome: incremental cost per additional gain in physical activity, QALY or other relevant outcome by the Cost-effectiveness of physical activity programs and services for older adults intervention compared with the comparator (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)). \u2022 Study design: reviews of economic evaluations. We excluded reviews of reviews but used those to perform hand searches.\n\nWe then searched the titles and abstracts of the reviews identified by the database search (n = 4,723 after removing duplicates) using the following keywords: economic, costeffectiveness, cost, ICER and net. The title and abstract of identified articles were screened by one reviewer (MP or WK) and the full text of the selected reviews were obtained and assessed for eligibility. A second reviewer (MP, BW or WK) checked the search and review selection."

      "text": "We searched the Tufts CEA Registry ( www.cearegistry.org ) to identify studies investigating the cost-utility of physical activity interventions for older adults. The CEA Registry is a database with detailed information on over 10,000 CUA published from 1976 to present  [16] . We used the following keywords to perform the search: 'physical activity', 'exercise', 'walking', 'steps' and 'rehabilitation'. The search was performed from 1976 to February 2022.\n\nThe CEA Registry is one of the most comprehensive databases indexing CUA studies. The methods used by the CEA Registry to search the literature and extract information have been described elsewhere  [17] . Briefly, it involves searching PubMed, Scopus and Embase using keywords such as 'QALY', 'quality adjusted life' and 'cost-utility' for English language publications that report on an original cost-utility estimate.\n\nWe used the same eligibility criteria used for Question 1 for Population, Intervention and Comparison. The additional criteria were also used:\n\n\u2022 Outcome: incremental cost per QALY gained by the intervention group compared with the comparator (ICER). \u2022 Study design: trial-based and model-based CUA.\n\nTwo independent reviewers (MP&BW or MP&WK or BW&WK) screened all titles and abstracts and the full text of each study that potentially met the inclusion criteria was obtained and independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers."

We used the first level of a physical activity intervention classification framework developed by our group to extract and summarise the data  [8] . The framework covers information to describe the study sample, intervention characteristics, comparison group and outcomes investigated. Intervention was classified in terms of type of program (physical activity delivered or promoted), type of physical activity (total activity, structured exercise, recreation, sport), provider (professional, volunteer, carer, none, mixed), supervision, who with (individual, group, mixed), delivery mode (synchronous/live, asynchronous/pre-recorded, mixed) and location (health service, workplace, community facility, residential care, assisted living, own home, faith-based, part/sports field, mixed). Outcomes are divided into: physical activity; social functioning (participation); physical functioning; cognitive and emotional functioning; well-being; quality of life and composite measures of functioning. Results are presented descriptively in tables and figures.\n\nTo provide an overview of results of the economic evaluations, we classified the economic analysis results according to the cost-effectiveness (CE) plane quadrants: NE (northeast) the new intervention is more costly and more effective; NW (northwest) the new intervention is more costly and less effective; SE (southeast) the new intervention is less costly and more effective; SW (southwest) the new intervention is less costly and less effective."

Only two reviews fully met our eligibility criteria  [27, 28] . The remaining 10 reviews only partially met our criteria as they were not explicitly focused on physical activity interventions  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , economic evaluations  [18, 19, 26]  or older adults  [25, 29] . However, these reviews included relevant individual studies that met our criteria and were then included in this review. For these reviews, we only extracted information relevant to the individual eligible studies. The two reviews that fully met our criteria were specifically focused on physical activity programs to prevent falls in older adults  [27]  and on exercise interventions for older adults The number of studies refer to the number of unique studies across each group of systematic reviews. OA: osteoarthritis living in the community  [28] . The flow chart of selection of reviews is shown in Appendix Figure  1  available in Age and Ageing online. Table  1  provides a description of the included reviews.\n\nThe reviews aimed to summarise the evidence on physical activity interventions for: fall prevention (n = 4), health promotion (n = 3), mental wellbeing (n = 1), frailty (n = 1) and disease specific symptoms (n = 3) (Figure  1  and Appendix Table  1  available in Age and Ageing online). Two reviews were conducted focusing on specific contexts: German healthcare system  [20]  and Nordic countries  [19] , while the other reviews did not specify a specific context.\n\nAll but two reviews  [25, 29]  included studies limited to older adults and all reviews included studies investigating older adults of both sexes. Three reviews included studies investigating older adults living in the community  [19, 22, 28] , three included studies investigating people living in the community and in care facilities  [20, 24, 26]  and six reviews did not specify the setting  [18, 21, 23, 25, 27] . Three reviews included studies of participants selected for preexisting conditions: chronic pain  [21] , neurological disorders  [29]  and hip and/or knee osteoarthritis  [25] .\n\nAll 37 individual studies included in the 12 reviews were conducted in high income countries (Appendix Table  2  available in Age and Ageing online). No reviews focused on disadvantaged/underserved populations, such as culturally or linguistically diverse populations, migrant or indigenous populations, socio-economically disadvantaged populations or rural/remote settings.\n\nNo included reviews were specifically focused on interventions that seek to enhance physical activity in older adults where physical activity was the main outcome of the study. All included reviews investigated the cost-effectiveness of structured exercise programs where the intervention was delivered (instead of just being promoted). No studies investigated other types of physical activity, such as sport, recreation or total activity (intervention focuses on increasing overall physical activity throughout the day that may or may not include structured exercise, recreation or sport). Studies investigated interventions with a mix of delivery modes, providers, locations and supervision levels (Table  1 ).\n\nThe most common health outcome of economic evaluations included in the reviews was physical functioning (n = 11) (Table  2 ). Only one review reported results for the following outcomes: physical activity (i.e. physical activity was an outcome of some included studies)  [23] , social functioning  [23]  and cognitive and emotional functioning  [26] . Eight reviews reported results for CUA  [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , where QALY was the health outcome (wellbeing, quality of life, overall functioning). Most studies revealed that the intervention was more costly but also more effective (i.e. in the NE quadrant of CE plane) (Table  2 )."

Only eight CUA studies investigated participants selected for preexisting conditions: intermittent claudication  [53] , vascular cognitive impairment  [40] , post-hip fracture  [49] , cancer  [50, 54] , vertebral compression fracture  [52]  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  [55]  and Parkinson's  [51] .

Most studies investigated a mixed sample of men and women, one investigated a sample of men only  [50]  and five studies investigated a sample of women only  [33, 47, 48, 52, 56] . All included CUA studies were conducted in high income countries and none focused on disadvantaged/underserved populations (Appendix Table  4  available in Age and Ageing online).\n\nThe type of program investigated by two studies was physical activity promotion, where participants were advised to increase their physical activity levels (overall activity)  [39, 55] .

Most studies compared a physical activity intervention with no intervention (n = 24) and three studies compared different types of exercise and/or different doses  [47, 48, 56] . Amongst the studies that compared physical activity interventions with a control (n = 24), a total of 30 physical activity interventions were investigated. In most cases (n = 25), the intervention was more costly and also more effective (i.e. in the NE quadrant of the CE plane), and five interventions were cost-saving (i.e. less costly and more effective, SE quadrant of the CE plane) (Figure  2A  and Appendix Table  6  available in Age and Ageing online). For the studies where complete information was available in the CEA registry (n = 13), we presented the ICER as additional cost in 2021 US dollars per additional QALY gained to allow comparison of results (Figure  2B )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This scoping review identified a lack of economic evaluations of physical activity interventions for older adults as we only identified 12 systematic reviews and 27 CUA studies. Only two systematic reviews fully met our criteria. None of the reviews targeted all physical activity interventions and all studies investigated physical activity programs or services. Only two CUA studies investigated a program where physical activity was promoted instead of delivered, with all the other studies investigating structured exercise programs. The aim of the structured exercise programs varied with few interventions aimed at increasing physical activity levels. Physical functioning outcomes were most commonly investigated. All included studies were conducted in highincome countries, and none were conducted with disadvantaged/underserved populations. In general, the interventions were more effective and also more costly when compared to no intervention.\n\nNo included reviews or CUA studies investigated physical activity interventions that would address the GAPPA objective 'Active Society' (such as mass media campaigns, and health professional training) or 'Active Environments' (such as environment planning). All the interventions investigated were structured exercise programs that would address the GAPPA  [3]  objective 'Active People'. Only one of the 12 systematic reviews (Question 1) reported physical activity as an outcome and most of the CUA studies did not investigate interventions aimed at increasing physical activity levels. This highlights the scarcity of reviews and individual studies investigating the value for money of interventions that are seeking to enhance physical activity.\n\nThe systematic methods and the coding framework were strengths of this scoping review. We mapped the body of evidence on economic evaluations of physical activity interventions for older adults and identified important gaps in the literature. However, this scoping review has some limitations. The search strategy used to identify reviews (Question 1) was not specifically designed to identify economic evaluation studies and therefore it is possible that we have missed important studies. The CEA registry only includes studies published in English. Therefore, we may have missed important studies that are published in other languages (Question 2). Additionally, only CUA studies are indexed in the CEA Registry. Although the interpretation of results of economic evaluations when other health outcomes are used (e.g. physical activity) can be challenging, these additional studies would provide additional information on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions. For Question 1, due to time constraints, only one reviewer searched and extracted data from the reviews. However, a second experienced reviewer checked the data.\n\nWhen a new intervention is both more effective and cost saving, it is referred to as an economically 'dominant' intervention. However, the most common scenario is that a new intervention improves outcomes (i.e. is more effective) at increased cost. Although some studies included in this review found the intervention to be dominant, most interventions were more effective and also more costly when compared to no intervention. In these cases, it was not possible to draw conclusions on whether interventions are cost-effective or not, since this decision depends on several factors, including the context and willingness to pay of the payer (e.g. health consumer, health service provider). Additionally, this was beyond the scope of this review as scoping review methodology is limited in its capacity to make recommendations about specific interventions but is rather focused on summarising the volume and breath of evidence  [13] . The included studies reported a wide range of willingness to pay, from $350 euros to 100,000 US dollars per QALY gained and 11 studies did not report a threshold. This should be considered when interpreting their results."

      "text": "This scoping review identified several gaps in the literature. Our review of reviews revealed a scarcity of reviews investigating the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions for older adults. Few CUA studies identified in review question 2 (9 out of 27) were also included in the reviews identified in review question 1 highlighting the lack of reviews in this field. Systematic reviews of individual studies, investigating all types of physical activity interventions in older adults, focused on identifying economic evaluations is recommended. Initial reviews could focus on programs where physical activity is delivered, as this is the area that our scoping review identified the largest body of evidence. At this stage it is unknown whether economic evaluations have not been performed to investigate other types of physical activity interventions for older adults or whether these were missed due to limitations in our search strategy. This future review of individual studies would also allow detailed data extraction, presentation of results in a standardised currency and base year (similar to what was conducted in Figure  2B  and a deeper analysis of the quality and context of the studies.)\n\nCost-effectiveness of physical activity programs and services for older adults"

      "text": "To enhance the interpretation of any future review of individual studies, results could be presented and discussed considering different thresholds of willingness to pay. Future reviews should also consider extracting and presenting information beyond the ICER, such as intervention costs, as these are crucial for implementation of interventions.\n\nFuture economic evaluations of physical activity interventions for older adults are urgently needed. Researchers conducting effectiveness studies of physical activity interventions for older adults are strongly encouraged to include an economic evaluation, particularly those conducted in lowand middle-income countries and/or targeted at disadvantaged/underserved populations. Future primary studies and reviews should follow standard economic evaluation bestpractice recommendations and reporting guidelines, such as the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement  [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] ."

      "text": "In summary, very few systematic reviews investigating the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions for older adults were identified and none were conducted investigating all types of physical activity interventions. Few economic evaluations of interventions that seek to enhance physical activity in older adults have been conducted. The vast majority of included reviews and CUA studies investigated structured exercise programs and, in general, the interventions were more effective and also more costly when compared to no intervention. Systematic reviews of individual studies are needed to summarise the evidence on value for money of physical activity interventions for older adults. Additionally, primary economic evaluations are needed, particularly in the areas where few studies were identified, such as promotion of physical activity, environmental and mass-participation initiatives. More studies are also needed in low-and middleincome countries and investigating disadvantaged/underserved populations."
