  "title": "A Wearable Artificial Intelligence Feedback Tool (Wrist Angel) for Treatment and Research of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: Protocol for a Nonrandomized Pilot Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in youth is characterized by behaviors, emotions, physiological reactions, and family interaction patterns. An essential component of therapy involves increasing awareness of the links among thoughts, emotions, behaviors, bodily sensations, and family interactions. An automatic assessment tool using physiological signals from a wearable biosensor may enable continuous symptom monitoring inside and outside of the clinic and support cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD. \n Objective: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using a wearable biosensor to monitor OCD symptoms. The secondary aim is to explore the feasibility of developing clinical and research tools that can detect and predict OCD-relevant internal states and interpersonal processes with the use of speech and behavioral signals. \n Methods: Eligibility criteria for the study include children and adolescents between 8 and 17 years of age diagnosed with OCD, controls with no psychiatric diagnoses, and one parent of the participating youths. Youths and parents wear biosensors on their wrists that measure pulse, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and acceleration. Patients and their parents mark OCD episodes, while control youths and their parents mark youth fear episodes. Continuous, in-the-wild data collection will last for 8 weeks. Controlled experiments designed to link physiological, speech, behavioral, and biochemical signals to mental states are performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Interpersonal interactions in the experiments are filmed and coded for behavior. The films are also processed with computer vision and for speech signals. Participants complete clinical interviews and questionnaires at baseline, and at weeks 4, 7, and 8. Feasibility criteria were set for recruitment, retention, biosensor functionality and acceptability, adherence to wearing the biosensor, and safety related to the biosensor. As a first step in learning the associations between signals and OCD-related parameters, we will use paired t tests and mixed effects models with repeated measures to assess associations between oxytocin, individual biosignal features, and outcomes such as stress-rest and case-control comparisons. \n Results: The first participant was enrolled on December 3, 2021, and recruitment closed on December 31, 2022. Nine patient dyads and nine control dyads were recruited. Sixteen participating dyads completed follow-up assessments. \n Conclusions: The results of this study will provide preliminary evidence for the extent to which a wearable biosensor that collects physiological signals can be used to monitor OCD severity and events in youths. If we find the study to be feasible, further studies will be conducted to integrate biosensor signals output into machine learning algorithms that can provide patients, parents, and therapists with actionable insights into OCD symptoms and treatment progress. Future definitive studies will be tasked with testing the accuracy of machine learning models to detect and predict OCD episodes and classify clinical severity.",

      "text": "Up to 3% of children and adolescents suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  [1] , which is characterized by repetitive, intrusive thoughts about threats of contamination, harm to self or others, loss of esteem, and committing moral transgressions, accompanied by repetitive or ritualized behaviors that can be time consuming, such as cleaning, checking, and ordering  [2] . These obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors lead to marked distress, avoidance, and negative emotion (eg, anxiety and disgust)  [2] . To regulate OCD-related distress, youths (individuals below the age of 18 years) may avoid situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions, perform rituals to neutralize feelings of incompleteness or magically remove the threat, or seek reassurance and help from others such as parents  [3] . Parents are biologically primed to be sensitive to distress signals from their children  [4, 5] . Thus, parents may become distressed when their children are distressed. Interactions between parents and youths with OCD can be conflictual when parents refuse to accommodate their children's symptoms  [6] . Youths may coerce or use verbal and physical aggression to elicit accommodation or parents may voluntarily provide family accommodation to regulate their own or their children's distress  [7] . Family accommodation refers to ways in which parents help their children with OCD perform rituals, avoid stimuli that trigger symptoms, and change their own routines because of their children's OCD symptoms  [8] . This reciprocal coordination of parent-child behavior is reflected in the parent's and child's physiology and may in part be facilitated by the oxytocin system  [9] . In short, OCD is characterized by distress, negative emotions, and behavioral repertoires in individual youths and their parents that can be directly observed or indirectly detected in behavior, facial expressions, speech patterns, and physiological signals.\n\nAutomatic, continuous detection of these OCD signals would facilitate close monitoring of patient treatment progress and allow for more targeted interventions. The first-line treatment for OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention (ERP)  [10, 11] . Continuous monitoring of distress levels and the function of distress during the treatment is essential for optimizing ERP  [12] . Currently, patients are asked to rate their level of distress throughout an ERP task. Machine learning (ML) models that detect distress levels would automate distress monitoring and enable passive collection of objective measures allowing therapists to adjust exposures accordingly. Automatic, continuous distress detection may also facilitate the monitoring of treatment response across therapy sessions as well as monitoring disorder progression in individuals with subclinical symptoms. Finally, an important part of therapy is increasing awareness of the connections between thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and bodily sensations  [13] . ML models that detect changes in mental states would facilitate increasing awareness of these connections.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that ML models can detect physiological, behavioral, and speech signals that may be relevant to youth with OCD and thus aid in developing objective, intelligent monitoring tools that will enable timely actionable insights and interventions supporting psychotherapy in and outside of the clinic. A previous study demonstrated that ML models using 3 minutes of physiological data from a wearable biosensor worn by 20 youths could predict aggressive behaviors in youths with autism spectrum disorders 1 minute prior to their occurrence with relatively high accuracy  [14] . Another study linked behavioral synchrony between 15 fathers and their 2-5-year-old children with Down syndrome to synchrony in the dyads' electrodermal activity (EDA) measured with wearable biosensors during a play session  [15] . Using speech features as input, ML models have classified the severity of depression  [16]  and differentiated between children with and without internalizing disorders  [17] . ML models that use speech features as input have also been utilized to gauge the quality of interpersonal interactions in a psychotherapy setting  [18] . Finally, ML models (ie, computer vision models) are also capable of analyzing data from videos to track movement; infer emotion from facial expressions; and estimate visual attention, engagement, and interpersonal interaction from gaze-tracking information  [19, 20] . A systematic review showed that computer vision studies have sample sizes as low as 2 participants, often in the range of 10-20 and with more than 50 participants in rare cases, to demonstrate the capabilities of computer vision as a clinical tool  [19] . To date, no artificial intelligence (AI) tools for monitoring clinically relevant parameters of OCD in youth are available and validated. Thus, Wrist Angel aims to develop AI tools capable of predicting OCD episodes, related (mal)adaptive parent behavior, and continuously monitoring OCD-related distress in youths and parents."

      "title": "Goal of This Study",
      "text": "The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed account of our study design and methods for data collection. The primary aim of the Wrist Angel pilot study is to test the feasibility of using a wearable biosensor to detect OCD-related events and monitor clinical severity in children and adolescents. Ultimately, we aim to develop algorithms for detecting OCD-relevant parameters using physiological, audio, and visual signals as input and assess their accuracy. Thus, important information from the pilot study will be whether it is feasible to collect enough data to develop such algorithms. Specifically, we will test the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants for brief experiments in the clinic and an 8-week observational study during which youths and parents wear a biosensor in their everyday lives. Feasibility will also be assessed in terms of biosensor safety and functionality, participant acceptance of the biosensor, and participant adherence to wearing the biosensor. We also explore methods for collecting ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for labeling data collected in the 8-week observational study, including a mobile app for data collection. Our primary hypothesis is that the study protocol will demonstrate sufficient feasibility to support subsequent larger studies.\n\nBiosensors are worn by youths and one of their parents, as OCD causes distress in youths with the diagnosis as well as their parents. Furthermore, efficacious psychotherapy approaches for OCD in youth intervene by working either exclusively with the child  [13]  or the parent  [21] . We also include measurements of oxytocin levels and response in youths and parents, as oxytocin may hold important information about how family dynamics interact with OCD symptoms and the optimal type of psychotherapy to address these interactions  [22] ."

Youths and their participating parent are asked to wear a biosensor daily during waking hours for 8 weeks. In comparison, previous studies have collected data from 7 hours to 10 days  [14] . To better understand these in-the-wild signals, we collect physiological signals and additional audio and visual signals under controlled conditions in the clinic.

Recruitment Patient participants are recruited from patients referred to the child and adolescent mental health center with probable OCD symptoms or a set OCD diagnosis. Potential patient participants' journals are first screened for eligibility. Case workers then ask patient families if our research group may contact them about our research project. The control group is recruited from the control group of the Treatment Effects of family based Cognitive Therapy in children and adolescents with Obsessive compulsive disorder (TECTO) trial  [32]  and schools in the catchment area. After obtaining permission from the school administration, flyers are posted in the school or the school intranet.\n\nPsychologists, medical doctors, and masters-level medical and psychology students screen and assess potential participants.\n\nFor previous TECTO participants, we use their clinical information from the TECTO trial to determine eligibility. Potential control participants who contact us are screened for intellectual disability and psychiatric diagnoses using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) criteria  [31] .\n\nThe recruitment period ranged from September 15, 2021, until December 31, 2022."

Following the manufacturer's manual, we inform the participants that they should not look directly at the light-emitting diode lights, that the biosensor tolerates splashes of water during handwashing and rain but not submersion, and that the biosensor should be stored at room temperature and out of direct sunlight.\n\nParticipants are asked to charge the biosensor at night. We demonstrate how to put on the wristband, how to turn it off and on, how to tag events, and how to click the charging cradle on and off the wristband. All participants received an abridged user manual that we translated into Danish.\n\nThe E4 (Empatica, Milan, Italy) wristband is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Class II device for adults and children  (FDA 2018 (FDA , 2019 ) and a European Union Class IIa device denoting that it is a noninvasive monitoring device  [35] . The E4 battery can last over 48 hours and can store up to photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor, an EDA sensor, a 3-axis accelerometer, and an optical thermometer. PPG uses infrared light to measure changes in blood volume (ie, blood volume pulse) calculated by an algorithm that uses light signals during red and green exposure, sampled 64 times per second, as input  [36] . The interbeat interval timings and heart rate are computed using the blood volume pulse signal as input to algorithms  [36] . Under conditions of slight movement (<30% of the time), it is possible to use the interbeat interval to compute heart rate variability. The EDA sensor measures skin conductance sampled 4 times per second  [37] . The accelerometer measures movement on three axes at a sampling rate of 32 times per second. The optical thermometer measures skin temperature at a sampling rate of 4 times per second  [37] ."

Medical journals are also used to obtain patient multiaxial diagnoses. During baseline testing, we ask participating parents to report probable or confirmed psychiatric diagnoses in the youths' first-degree relatives, and we ask youths about their current stage of puberty using the Tanner stages  [38] . After baseline testing, participating families are asked to complete a set of questionnaires online to provide demographic information and baseline measures of youth quality of life, family dynamics, and parent symptoms of affective disorders. The demographic questionnaire includes questions about age, sex, and country of origin for the youths and parents as well as parents' highest attained level of education. Youths and parents also complete a questionnaire that includes questions about menstruation, hormone medication use, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Information about hormones and puberty are collected as these are factors that may influence salivary oxytocin levels. Parents are also asked to complete the KIDSCREEN-52  [39] , Parental Stress Scale (PSS)  [40] , Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)  [41] , and the Family Environment Scale  [42] . Youths receive the KIDSCREEN-52  [39] . Parents of patients are also asked to complete a modified version of the Family Accommodation Scale-Parent Rated (FAS-PR)  [43, 44] .\n\nAt the 8-week follow-up, patients' OCD severity is assessed with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) before the experiments. After the experiments, all youth-parent dyads are interviewed for a maximum of 30 minutes about their experiences with the biosensor and their opinions about potentially using an app for data collection.

The timeline for the experiments is depicted in Figure  2 . The experiment starts with a 5-minute resting period, in which the youth and parent are left in a room and are asked to relax and refrain from speaking and touching each other for 5 minutes.\n\nPatients complete an exposure task for up to 15 minutes led by a mental health professional in the research team in the presence of the parent unless the patient prefers to complete the exposure without the parent. The preparation and delivery of the exposure exercise were inspired by a treatment manual for youth with OCD  [45]  (page 73). The clinical researcher delivering the exposure provides psychoeducation about OCD and explains the procedure and rationale behind the exposure. During this ERP preparation phase, patients are asked to report their expectation for what will happen to their distress level during ERP with a multiple-choice question: (1) distress will increase until it is unbearable, (2) distress will remain the same, (3) distress will decrease over time. Throughout the exposure, patients are asked to report their level of distress.\n\nControl dyads complete a physical activity task, in which they are shown an exercise dance video lasting approximately 10 minutes. The participants are not required to follow the video, but are asked to move their bodies in a way that increases their heart rate for the duration of the task. The physical activity task allows us to examine the performance of the biosensor under intense movement and measure salivary oxytocin reactivity following physical stress. In the final controlled condition, patient and control dyads complete a parent-child interaction task, in which they are asked to plan their best warm-weather (baseline) and cold-weather (follow-up) vacation together, inspired by previous work  [46, 47] . Saliva samples are collected from the youth and the parent after the resting period, exposure task, physical activity, and the parent-child interaction task.\n\nFor behavioral coding, the exposure and parent-child interaction tasks are video-and audio-recorded. Human coders will code the videos for interlocutor positive and negative affect, anxiety, arousal, affective touch, and synchrony, as well as parent sensitivity and youth engagement using the Coding Interactive Behavior manual  [48] .\n\nExposure sessions will also be coded for youth distress, avoidant/approach behavior, reassurance and proximity seeking, as well as parent accommodating behavior and discouraging avoidance, using items from the Exposure Rating Scale for Exposure and Response Prevention  [49]  and the Exposure Process Coding System  [12, 50] . Parent acceptance statements and confidence statements will be coded based on definitions in a treatment manual for OCD and anxiety disorders in youth targeting parents  [51] ."

In addition to reporting their emotional state, children and parents report whether they are in the company of the other, other family members, or friends to establish the context of EMA data, similar to previous studies  [55] .

First, OCD distress related to each current OCD symptom is rated before ERP sessions on a symptom hierarchy on a scale from 0 (no distress) to 10 (maximum distress). During ERP sessions, the clinical researcher asked youths to rate their current distress levels after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 minutes on the same scale as the symptom hierarchy. When OCD distress is rated during an ERP session, it is called subjective units of distress (SUDs)  [56] .\n\nDuring the in-the-wild observational period, OCD distress is a binary measure, with patients and their parents marking events of OCD distress. Control dyads mark occurrences of youth fear to compare clinical to subclinical distress."

      "title": "ERP Quality",
      "text": "Two major theories for mechanisms of change in ERP include emotional processing theory and inhibitory learning theory. According to emotional processing theory, ERP works by replacing an association between a stimulus and a feared outcome with a new harmless association  [57, 58] . Here, quality ERP sessions require habituation, defined as sessions in which distress levels decrease from the first measurement until the last measurement, and the decrease in distress occurs in the absence of avoidance, reduced task difficulty, and accommodation as defined previously  [12] . This theory also assumes that there is an optimal level of distress that is neither too low nor too high for conducting effective exposures  [59] . As subjective distress may not correspond to physiological levels of arousal, we will use both measures. Using SUDs and physiological measures of arousal, we will categorize low, medium, and high distress.\n\nAlternatively, the inhibitory learning theory states that successful exposures are characterized by reduction in expectancy of an aversive outcome by creating alternative harmless associations that compete with the feared expectations  [60] . A therapeutic expectancy violation occurs when an anticipated negative outcome fails to actualize and a benign or positive outcome occurs instead  [60, 61] . We will calculate distress-related expectancy violations in the baseline and follow-up exposure sessions in three ways. First, an expectancy violation occurs when the patient's expected distress trajectory as reported in the multiple-choice question before an ERP does not match the actual distress trajectory during ERP. Another way that we will define expectancy violation is by subtracting the actual maximum distress level during ERP by the distress level reported prior to an ERP session on the symptom hierarchy  [62] . The final way that we will define an expectancy violation is by subtracting the distress level reported prior to ERP on the symptom hierarchy by the actual distress level at the end of an ERP session  [62] ."

Items 1-5 can be summed to obtain an obsession severity score and items 6-10 can be summed to obtain a compulsion severity score. Change in OCD severity is calculated by subtracting the week 8 CY-BOCS score from the baseline CY-BOCS scores. Remission is defined as a 30% or greater reduction in the CY-BOCS score from baseline to follow-up. The CY-BOCS also contains information about types of OCD symptoms, such as those marked by anxiety or disgust.

Salivary oxytocin response is defined as a change in oxytocin levels measured before and after a condition (physical activity, exposure, parent-child interaction). We ask participants to refrain from eating 2 hours and drinking 30 minutes before collecting the first saliva sample. To collect one saliva sample, participants are asked to chew on a Salivette (Sarsted, Rommelsdorf, Germany) for 60 seconds. The saliva samples are frozen at -20\u00b0C. At the biochemistry laboratory, the samples are centrifuged twice with a 2-day interval at 4\u00b0C at 1500 \u00d7g for 20 minutes. The obtained liquid samples are lyophilized at -80\u00b0C/0.02 mbar overnight and stored at -20\u00b0C. On the day of the assay, the freeze-dried samples are reconstituted with assay buffer. The factor depends on the amount of saliva before freeze-drying. Samples are concentrated three times. The immunoassay is performed with the Enzo (NY, USA) oxytocin kit or a kit of comparable detection sensitivity. Measurements are performed twice, and the sample concentrations are calculated using WorkOut version 2.5 software that is provided with the enzyme-linked immunoassay reader according to relevant standard curves.\n\nMeasuring oxytocin in saliva is a noninvasive and easy way of estimating peripheral oxytocin levels  [68] . Salivary oxytocin is sensitive to manipulations of stress and social interaction, as demonstrated by increases in oxytocin levels after 10 minutes of physical exercise  [69] , anticipation of and engagement in a socially stressful condition  [70] , and a 7-minute parent-child interaction task  [71] . Higher oxytocin levels have been associated with parental synchrony and affect synchrony between parents and infants  [72] .

Confounding factors and important interactions will be included to the extent possible. These initial statistical results will mainly serve to estimate sample sizes for future studies. Substudies will focus on assessing automating behavioral observations using audio and video data from parent-child interactions and exposure sessions.\n\nWe will test the feasibility of developing AI tools that use signals from a wearable biosensor and audio and video recordings of human interactions. Audio and video recordings are collected at two time points for each participant dyad, which will increase power of these analyses. Furthermore, the exposure tasks last for over 20 minutes and will be sliced into different events: ERP preparation, ERP, ERP debrief. These events will be segmented in 5-minute slices for analyses, which will increase the number of observations. We will use ML models for classification and prediction of OCD-related and physical stress, as well as prediction of in-the-wild distress episodes.

    {
      "title": "Study Overview and Significance",
      "text": "One percent of children and adolescents will be diagnosed with OCD before their 18th birthday  [77] . Today, diagnosis and severity ratings depend on self-report and clinical observation, and no objective measures exist for OCD symptoms. ML models that detect distress levels would automate clinical severity monitoring and passively collect objective measures allowing therapists to adjust exposure treatment accordingly. Automatic, continuous distress detection may also facilitate the monitoring of treatment response across therapy sessions as well as monitoring disorder progression in individuals with subclinical symptoms. Finally, ML models that detect changes in mental states would facilitate increasing awareness of connections between thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and bodily sensations, forming an essential part of effective therapy  [13] .\n\nIn this protocol, we present the study design and methods of a pilot study that will evaluate the feasibility of using a commercially available wearable biosensor to monitor symptoms of OCD in youth from physiological signals. Embedded in our pilot longitudinal, case-control study are substudies of audio/visual signals and actively collected biochemical parameters from youths and parents with the goal of detecting and predicting episodes of OCD-related distress.\n\nPotential feasibility issues involve recruiting and retaining participants, biosensor safety and functionality, participant adherence to wearing the biosensor, and logistics of collecting and processing data. The size and design of the biosensor and the lack of a substantial clinical intervention may deter participation. User experience questionnaires and interviews explore themes of stigma attached to wearing a biosensor. A previous study demonstrated that a group of 16 youth, aged 10 to 17 years, participating in a study of similar length wore a similar biosensor for an average of 11 out of 30 days and one child managed to wear the wristband 5 days per week  [78] . The study aimed to develop a personalized weight management program with the E3 wristband and asked youths to wear the biosensor for at least 5 days per week for 3 months  [78] . No technical difficulties were reported for the wristband  [78] . Youth in the wristband condition reported a similar level of (dis)comfort as youth in the control condition  [78] . Nonetheless, the researchers speculated as to whether the youths did not wear the wristband due to concerns that it would attract unwanted attention from peers  [78] . Some participants expressed concern of being surveilled by the biosensor  [78] . To address potential concerns in our participants, we will thoroughly explain what the wristband is and is not capable of and coach the participants in informing others about their new accessory. The E4 wristband has been used to monitor arousal in 15 children as young as 2 years with Down syndrome during 7-minute parent-child interaction sessions  [15] . EDA data from children were deemed useable (90% of interactions tracked) for 27 out of 30 interactions; from parents, EDA data were useable for 23 out of 30 interactions  [15] . Missing data were due to 7 instances of software malfunctions  [15] .\n\nA byproduct of having up to two in-person meetings with participants to download biosensor data securely throughout the observation period may be an implicit reminder to wear the biosensor. We will examine whether participants were more likely to wear the biosensor on data collection days. Asking youths with obsessions, compulsions, and safety behaviors to tag OCD-related events may interact with or become a symptom. This theme is also explored in the user experience interview."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "The strengths of the protocol include the ecological validity of in-the-wild passively collected physiological signals; collecting physiological signals under repeated controlled conditions; the case-control design; and supplementing with multimodal signals from audio, video, and biochemistry. One limitation of the protocol is the small sample size. The sample size limits generalizability of the statistical and ML results. The ML models risk producing false-positive predictions. In the case of high individual variation, false negatives will also be a risk. Nonetheless, we have enough observations to evaluate the feasibility of making the proposed predictions. We have up to 8 weeks of physiological signal data per participant. Moreover, previous studies indicate that these physiological signals are sensitive to strong sustained stressors  [75]  such as those experienced in OCD."

      "text": "If the findings of this pilot study support our hypotheses of sufficient feasibility, subsequent larger studies will further develop and test ML models that can detect and predict OCD severity, distress, and related family processes that maintain OCD. Ultimately, these innovations will contribute to increasing knowledge about objective markers of OCD severity and OCD-related, clinically relevant family processes. Furthermore, the AI tools we aim to develop have the potential to assist in validation of assessments of the severity of psychiatric disorders and inform treatment decisions. Such AI tools would enable monitoring disease and treatment planning. For example, automatic clinical severity classification models could be applied in the therapy room or in the patients' everyday lives while youths are on treatment wait lists to monitor symptoms or between therapy sessions to monitor and support treatment progress."
