      "text": "Options for the continuous and non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure are limited. Cuff-based sphygmomanometers are widely available, yet provide only discrete measurements. The clinical gold-standard approach for the continuous monitoring of blood pressure requires an arterial line, which is too invasive for routine use. Wearable ultrasound for the continuous and non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure promises to elevate the quality of patient care, yet the isolated sonographic windows in the most advanced prototypes can lead to inaccurate or error-prone measurements, and the safety and performance of these devices have not been thoroughly evaluated.\n\nHere we describe validation studies, conducted during daily activities at home, in the outpatient clinic, in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and in the intensive care unit, of the safety and performance of a wearable ultrasound sensor for blood pressure monitoring. The sensor has closely connected sonographic windows and a backing layer that improves the sensor's accuracy and reliability to meet the highest requirements of clinical standards. The validation results support the clinical use of the sensor.\n\nBlood pressure (BP) is a measure of the force that blood exerts against the vessel walls per unit area  1  . Its changing characteristics reflect the status of the cardiovascular system in real time, making continuous BP monitoring essential for the optimal diagnosis and treatment of many cardiovascular conditions  2, 3  . Common methods for BP monitoring in the clinic provide accurate measurements but involve specific challenges (Supplementary Discussion 1). A cuff-based sphygmomanometer, typically comprising a stethoscope and an inflatable cuff wrapped around the upper arm, is effective in measuring systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). However, the time required for cuff inflation and deflation makes it unsuitable for continuous BP monitoring. Moreover, repetitive occlusion of the measured artery by the cuff causes irritation and interferes with daily activities, especially disturbing sleep when worn overnight  4  . The 'gold standard' for measuring BP, an arterial line (A-line), involves a catheter inserted into the artery to continuously monitor BP  5  . However, this we comprehensively assessed the intensity of the wearable ultrasound sensor. Finally, we evaluated its accuracy following international standards in relevant use-case scenarios. The sensor showed good agreement with clinical reference methods, with biases well within the accepted thresholds. This validation study underscores the potential of this state-of-the-art wearable ultrasound technology for accurate, continuous and non-invasive BP monitoring, and establishes an effective framework for the evaluation of future wearable BP monitors, thereby benefiting the healthcare system at large."

      "title": "Re-engineering of the wearable ultrasound sensor",
      "text": "We adapted the wearable ultrasound sensor to target the brachial and radial arteries to comply with common BP measurement practices (Fig.  1a ). Given the small size (2~5 mm in diameter) and shallow depth (3~20 mm) of these arteries  23, 24  , we used a linear transducer array with a central frequency of 7 MHz (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). This frequency provides a penetration depth of ~25 mm (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) that covers the brachial and radial arteries in almost all populations  23, 24  . The closely arranged 20-element array with a pitch of 0.5 mm yields a 10 mm wide combined acoustic window, providing full coverage of the target arteries and ample tolerance of device-artery misalignment (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). To enhance the accuracy of arterial wall tracking, a 500-\u03bcm-thick backing layer was used to reduce the transducer ringing effect (that is, redundant transducer vibrations after activation)  25  , thus shortening the spatial pulse length and improving the tracking accuracy (Supplementary Fig.  8 ).\n\nThe re-engineered ultrasound sensor shows outstanding wearability. Serpentine copper patterns were used as both the top excitation and bottom ground electrodes to interconnect the bilayer stacking of the transducer element and backing layer  [26] [27] [28]  . The re-engineered ultrasound sensor is only ~800 \u03bcm in total thickness (including the elastomer encapsulation), enabling its conformal integration with curvilinear surfaces of phantoms (Supplementary Fig.  9 ) and various human skin morphologies (Fig.  1b ). The device also shows excellent durability during various daily activities (Extended Data Fig.  1 ) and remains functional for re-use after sterilization, which supports its long-term monitoring capabilities."

      "text": "All medical devices must comply with safety regulations (Supplementary Discussion 3). We activated the ultrasound transducers with a voltage <20 V at a pulse repetition frequency of 1,000 Hz, ensuring that the maximum derated spatial peak temporal average intensity of all ultrasound transmissions was <5.76 mW cm -2 and the maximum mechanical index was <0. 29. These values are substantially lower than the maximum levels recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Track 1 for diagnostic ultrasound applications (720 mW cm -2 and 1.9, respectively)  29  .\n\nWe also conducted a thorough examination of thermal effects. Thermal imaging revealed a <1 \u00b0C increase in temperature when the device was attached to a human chest phantom for >48 h (Supplementary Fig.  10  and Supplementary Discussion 3). In addition, we evaluated the impact of prolonged ultrasound exposure on the internal tissue temperature by calculating the thermal index, which is the ratio between the incident acoustic power and the power needed to increase the tissue temperature by 1 \u00b0C (Supplementary Discussion 3)  30  . The soft tissue thermal index was 0.17. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine guidelines state that, for a thermal index \u22641.5, there is no specified time limit for adult ultrasound because the thermal exposure will not generate any negative biological effects  31  ."

      "text": "The ultrasound sensor monitors the vessel diameter and converts it into BP (Supplementary Discussion 4)  11  . Considering the exponential invasive technique can be associated with pain upon insertion and serious complications (such as vascular occlusion, haematoma and infection)  6  , and thus is usually reserved for critical care settings.\n\nAlternative approaches involve the derivation of BP from other haemodynamic parameters. Given their ability to estimate BP without disturbing the regular vascular system, marrying these approaches with wearable technology has the potential to enhance the patient's experience. For example, a wearable photoplethysmography device detects local changes in blood volume by measuring the light absorbed and scattered by red blood cells, which is correlated with BP  7  . Nonetheless, light can only penetrate <8 mm into tissue, which limits BP sensing to capillaries  8  . As blood propagates through the arterial tree, both the BP amplitude and waveform will change due to the different blood flow volumes and wall components of the vessels. Therefore, the parameters captured from capillaries by photoplethysmography are intrinsically different from those at clinical reference sites (such as brachial or radial arteries). Wearable mechanical sensors capture skin deflection above the peripheral arteries to estimate the BP  9, 10  , but those deflections are highly susceptible to internal factors (such as skin elasticity and subcutaneous fat) and external factors (such as temperature and humidity) that severely limit the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements. Wearable ultrasound sensors can sense clinically relevant arteries deep within the body due to the relative low attenuation of ultrasound waves through tissue  8  . Furthermore, ultrasound sensors, particularly high-frequency devices with high spatial resolution, focus directly on arterial pulsation rather than skin deformations. Therefore, their measurements are not affected by variations in skin characteristics, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the readings  11  .\n\nDespite the advantages described above, several major challenges still affect the performance of today's most advanced wearable ultrasound sensors  [11] [12] [13] [14]  . This device was designed as a 4 \u00d7 5 isolated transducer array, with a 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 mm\u00b2 transducer element size and ~3 mm array pitch (that is, the distance between the centres of adjacent transducers) (Supplementary Fig.  1 )  11  . First, because it was designed for large central arteries, its large transducer element size and array pitch inevitably isolate the acoustic window of each element, making it difficult to align with smaller peripheral targets such as the brachial and radial arteries, which are more clinically relevant (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Second, a backing layer (that is, a dampener to reduce redundant vibrations from the transducer) is needed to shorten the spatial pulse length of the received radiofrequency signals. The absence of this layer means that the prototype cannot accurately trace subtle dilations of arterial walls, particularly for stiff peripheral arteries with much less dilation than elastic central arteries. Third, the safety of the prototype has not been thoroughly assessed. Finally, its accuracy had not been rigorously validated to follow established standards  15  (Supplementary Fig.  3  and Supplementary Discussion 2). A candidate device needs to have minimal biases (such as mean difference and standard deviation of the difference) when validated under strict conditions for the collection and statistical analysis of the data (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Practical factors (such as white coat syndrome, daily activities and medications) can influence BP substantially, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive validation in diverse domestic and clinical settings  16  . Such considerations are often neglected during the development of wearable BP monitoring devices  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  .\n\nTo address these challenges, we redesigned the transducer array and incorporated a backing layer to the transducers in a re-engineered wearable ultrasound sensor (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). We also validated its safety and accuracy by adhering closely to established BP validation standards. This new compact linear transducer array provides a closely connected ~10 mm wide acoustic window (the transducers are closely arranged with a minimal pitch), which minimizes device-artery misalignment, enhancing the reliability of measurements (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Integrating a backing layer on each transducer substantially increases the accuracy of locating arterial walls. Using a hydrophone, stress-strain relationship for biomaterials such as arterial walls (Supplementary Fig.  11  and Supplementary Discussion 5)  32  , the changes in arterial diameter can be correlated with the BP waveform using an arterial stiffness coefficient (Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Discussion 4)  11  . Deviation from the initial calibration, caused by physiological fluctuations such as changes in stiffness and the cross-sectional shape of the artery (Supplementary Discussion 6), can influence the stiffness coefficient, potentially compromising the accuracy of measurement. Frequent recalibrations may thus be necessary, which can severely compromise the user experience  33  . Therefore, the need to recalibrate the ultrasound sensor should be minimized while maintaining accurate measurements.\n\nTo evaluate the long-term viability of the calibration, BP measurements from the ultrasound sensor were tracked alongside a cuff-based auscultatory sphygmomanometer for 1 year in four participants (Methods, Extended Data Fig.  2  and Supplementary Table  1 ). On day 1, the ultrasound sensor was calibrated on the basis of average SBP and DBP values from three sphygmomanometer measurements. Daily BP different skin surfaces, demonstrating its excellent mechanical compliance and robustness. An anisotropic conductive film (ACF) is used to connect the ultrasound sensor to the back-end control system. c, Ultrasound (US) sensor measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP, red line) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP, blue line) with respective sphygmomanometer measurements (black lines) for 1 year in participant 1 (see Supplementary Fig. 13 for the other three participants). The measurements were repeated three times for each time point. Error bars indicate 1 s.d. of the measurements. The insets show representative BP waveforms of the ultrasound sensor on days 1 and 15, and months 2, 4, 8 and 12.\n\nArticle  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-024-01279-3 measurements were then taken three times repetitively using both the ultrasound sensor and sphygmomanometer during the first month (3 \u00d7 30 paired observations per participant, including the calibration data on day 1). This was followed by weekly measurements during the second to sixth months (3 \u00d7 20 paired observations per participant), and monthly measurements from the seventh to twelfth months (3 \u00d7 6 paired observations per participant) (Fig.  1c  and Supplementary Fig.  13 ).\n\nThe aggregated data (all 3 \u00d7 55 paired readings from each of the four participants, excluding the first data point for calibration) were analysed using Bland-Altman plots to evaluate the agreement between the two devices (Supplementary Discussion 7). The mean differences and standard deviations between the ultrasound sensor and sphygmomanometer were 1.19 \u00b1 3.10 mmHg in SBP and 0.91 \u00b1 2.52 mmHg in DBP for participant 1, 1.85 \u00b1 3.48 mmHg in SBP and 0.51 \u00b1 3.02 mmHg in DBP for participant 2, -2.06 \u00b1 4.16 mmHg in SBP and 1.56 \u00b1 3.58 mmHg in DBP for participant 3, and 0.69 \u00b1 3.56 mmHg in SBP and 0.60 \u00b1 3.93 mmHg in DBP for participant 4 (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). The waveforms of the BP pulses for each participant showed similar contours throughout the measurement period (Fig.  1c  and Supplementary Fig.  13 ). These observations suggest that a single calibration with a sphygmomanometer can maintain accurate BP measurements by the ultrasound sensor for a duration of at least 1 year."

      "title": "Validation during various daily activities",
      "text": "BP changes dynamically in response to daily activities at home, so continuous BP monitoring can allow physicians to manage BP fluctuations more effectively  34  , encourage patients to take an active role in adopting a healthier lifestyle, and provide critical insights relevant to the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (Supplementary Fig.  15  and Supplementary Discussion 8).\n\nTo study the effects of daily activities on BP measurements, we used the ultrasound sensor alongside a cuff-based auscultatory sphygmomanometer to track BP changes from the brachial artery of seven participants. The ultrasound sensor was first calibrated using the sphygmomanometer while the participants were in a seated position (Methods). Then, the ultrasound sensor and sphygmomanometer were used to measure BP changes during various activities (Extended Data Fig.  2  and Supplementary Table  1 ).\n\nDifferent postures induce physiological responses due to changes in hydrostatic pressure within the cardiovascular system  35  . Specifically, compared with sitting, standing causes more blood to be pulled to the lower limbs due to gravity, causing a decrease in venous return and thus BP in the arm (Fig.  2a (i),(ii)). Conversely, in a supine position, the effect of gravity is reduced due to the minimal height difference of the blood across the entire body, which increases BP in the arm (Fig.  2a(iii) ). Passive leg raising decreases the venous reservoir volume in the lower limbs, increasing the venous return and thus BP in the measured arm (Fig.  2a (iv))  36  . Raising the measured arm, similar to standing, results in a larger gravitational venous return from the raised arm to the heart, substantially reducing BP (Fig.  2a(v) ).\n\nPressor tests and cycling cause arterial vasoconstriction and cardiac output increase. Mental arithmetic provides a direct cerebral stimulus that increases sympathetic nervous activity and leads to an increase in BP compared with a relaxed seated position (Fig.  2a (i),(vi))  37  . A local ice bath stimulates the peripheral vessels as well as pain and temperature receptors, also activating the sympathetic nervous system to increase BP (Fig.  2a (vii))  38  . Similarly, during isometric handgrip, a sustained muscle contraction elicits a fight or flight response and thus increases BP (Fig.  2a (viii))  39  . During cycling, to meet the demands of energy output, the growing cardiac output is the dominant factor causing a substantial BP increase (Fig.  2a (ix))  40  .\n\nIn contrast, BP usually decreases during relaxation, such as deep breathing and meditation. Slow and controlled breathing augments vagal activity and relaxes peripheral smooth muscles, causing BP to fall (Fig.  2a(x ))  41  . Similarly, meditation enhances baroreflex sensitivity to reduce sympathetic and increase parasympathetic nervous system activities, thus reducing BP (Fig.  2a (xi))  42  .\n\nBiochemical alterations can also influence BP. After a meal, carbohydrates are catabolized into monosaccharides, decreasing vasodilator nitric oxide levels and thus increasing BP  43  . In addition, sodium triggers water retention, thereby increasing the total circulating blood volume and consequently the BP (Fig.  2a (xii))  44  . Caffeine antagonizes the effects of adenosine receptors, increasing neuronal activity and stimulating the release of neural transmitters such as norepinephrine, which induces vasoconstriction, increasing BP (Fig.  2a (xiii))  45  . Participant 3 showed no obvious BP changes (that is, \u22645 mmHg) in this context due to their habitual caffeine intake and thus relative caffeine insensitivity.\n\nTo evaluate the tracking capability of the wearable ultrasound sensor in comparison to the sphygmomanometer, the 12 daily activities (excluding sitting) described above were analysed on four-quadrant plots (Fig.  2b-d ) to assess the concordance between the devices (Supplementary Discussion 9)  46, 47  . For both devices, the daily activities induced changes in both the direction and magnitude of BP relative to sitting. The four-quadrant plot provides a comprehensive representation of the agreement  46  (that is, the 1st and 3rd quadrants) and discrepancies (that is, the 2nd and 4th quadrants) between the BP measurements of the two devices (Supplementary Discussion 9). To ensure accurate and reliable statistical analysis, we removed measurement error, noise and clinically non-significant changes by applying an exclusion zone of 3 mmHg (Supplementary Discussion 9)  46  . The calculated concordance rates were 95.8%, 98.5% and 93.2% for SBP, MAP (mean arterial pressure) and DBP, respectively. These results demonstrate that the ultrasound sensor and sphygmomanometer achieved similar tracking capabilities for both the direction and magnitude of BP changes during different daily activities."

      "title": "Validation in the outpatient clinic",
      "text": "BP is routinely measured in the outpatient clinic with a cuff-based sphygmomanometer. In an outpatient setting, there is a need to evaluate the cardiovascular system's capability to maintain homoeostasis under various conditions  48, 49  . To this end, interventions such as changing body postures can be implemented (such as supine or sitting or standing). By measuring fluctuations immediately after posture change, physicians can diagnose cardiovascular disorders that may be associated with autonomic disturbances, helping understand the body's haemodynamic responses  49, 50  .\n\nWe chose to validate the ultrasound sensor against the cuff-based auscultatory sphygmomanometer using the IEEE Std 1708a-2019 standard (Supplementary Discussion 2)  51, 52  . Its comprehensive, three-tier validation framework comprises initial calibration, a static test, a test with BP change and a test after a certain period of time from calibration. We segmented the validation into three tests: supine, standing and supine 30 min after the first test (Fig.  3a , b , Extended Data Fig.  2  and Supplementary Table  1 ). For each test, we collected three repeated measurements from both devices simultaneously. A cohort of 85 adult participants was recruited following the criteria stipulated by the IEEE standard, including age, sex, height, weight, arm circumference and BP ranges (Table  1  and Supplementary Fig.  4 )  51, 52  .\n\nThe results are presented in histograms and scatterplots to display the broad distribution of variations in SBP and DBP under different magnitudes of BP changes across the three tests. Each dot represents a pair of BP measurements from both the sphygmomanometer and ultrasound sensor. The first test, conducted in supine positions after calibration, exhibited relatively small variations in BP (Fig.  3c ). The second test showed a large fluctuation in BP following a change from supine to standing (Fig.  3d ). A substantial BP drop from supine to standing typically manifests in patients with orthostatic hypotension, which could be due to medications, dehydration or an autonomic nervous system failure (Supplementary Discussion 8)  53  . In the third test, the participants' BP tended to return to normal after 30 min supine, but the range of variations was notably wider than that in the first test (Fig.  3e ), suggesting that the cardiovascular systems of some participants may require additional time to recover from relative orthostatic hypotension, or some participants are just more relaxed after lying for 30 min. Bland-Altman plot results agreed broadly with the highest IEEE Std 1708a-2019 standard requirements across the three different tests (Fig.  3f-h ). The mean differences and standard deviations in SBP were 1.89 \u00b1 2.33, 3.88 \u00b1 4.47 and 2.37 \u00b1 2.82 mmHg for the three tests, respectively (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). The corresponding mean differences and standard deviations in DBP were -1.26 \u00b1 2.00, 2.26 \u00b1 3.10 and -1.17 \u00b1 2.22 mmHg (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). When we took replicates of the same participant into account rather than assuming they are independent measurements, the standard deviations were similar (Supplementary Fig.  16  and Supplementary Discussion 10)  54  . These findings reveal small biases, underscoring the strong agreement between the ultrasound sensor and sphygmomanometer measurements.\n\nThe IEEE Std 1708a-2019 standard uses the mean absolute difference to grade the accuracy of a device  51  . This parameter weighs all intra-participant and inter-participant measurement differences equally  51  and can be calculated as follows: Test 1 +6.45 -1.96 s.d. -2.68 Mean +1.89 Test 1 Test 2 Test 2 Test 3 Test 3 Test 2 +1.96 s.d. +12.65 -1.96 s.d. -4.88 Mean +3.88 Test 3 +1.96 s.d. +7.90 -1.96 s.d. -3.16 Mean +2.37 -4 60 90 120 DBP difference (mmHg) DBP difference (mmHg) DBP difference (mmHg) -8 0 DBP average (mmHg) 4 8 -4 60 80 100 120 -8 0 16 DBP average (mmHg) 4 12 8 40 -4 60 80 100 120 -8 0 8 DBP average (mmHg) 4 Test 1 +1.96 s.d. +2.67 -1.96 s.d. -5.19 Mean -1.26 Test 2 +1.96 s.d. +8.35 -1.96 s.d. -3.82 Mean +2.26 Test 3 +1.96 s.d. +3.18 -1.96 s.d. -5.52 Mean -1.17 ). The approximate normal distribution of 255 measurements suggests that ~95% of measurements fall within 1.96 s.d. of the mean. f-h, Bland-Altman plots representing the biases in SBP and DBP measurements across the three tests ((supine (f), standing (g) and supine 30 min after the first test (h)). Solid blue lines show the mean differences between the two devices, solid red lines show 95% limits of agreement (that is, 1.96 s.d. above and below the mean differences), and black dashed lines represent zero difference between the two devices. The small mean differences and standard deviations between the measurements from the two devices indicate a strong agreement, validating the accuracy and reliability of the ultrasound sensor. where i is the paired measurement number, ranging from 1 to n, p i is the measurement from the ultrasound sensor and y i is the measurement from the sphygmomanometer. For the ultrasound sensor, the mean absolute differences were 2.46, 4.90 and 3.01 in SBP and 1.92, 3.10 and 1.96 in DBP, for the three tests, which qualifies as grade A (the highest grade with a mean absolute difference \u22645 mmHg; Extended Data Fig.  3 )  51  . There are three potential explanations for the relatively larger mean absolute difference when the participants changed to standing. First, the ultrasound sensor has a relatively larger bias in capturing such abrupt BP variations due to substantial variations in blood volume in the upper limbs, which can affect the relationship between arterial cross-sectional shape and BP  55  . Second, the observed disparities could stem from inaccuracies in the sphygmomanometer measurements  56  because the sphygmomanometer presupposes a stable BP throughout the duration of measurement. However, in the context of postural changes, BP fluctuates continually, potentially leading to measurement errors. Third, many patients recruited from the Movement Disorders Center at the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute have Parkinson's disease and orthostatic hypotension-approximately 30% based on our experience. Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a drop in SBP of 20 mmHg or more or a drop in DBP of 10 mmHg or more when standing after 3 min, may contribute to the observed differences."

      "title": "Validation in the cardiac catheterization laboratory",
      "text": "BP is one of the most important indicators used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory to monitor the patient's physiological status. During cardiac catheterization, BP can be monitored invasively by transducing the pressure from the tip of the A-line or the side port of an inserted femoral (or more commonly radial) arterial sheath. The acute effects of sedation, vasodilation, blood loss and haemodynamic fluctuations related to changes in cardiac output can be effectively recorded by the A-line system  57  .\n\nWe selected the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.iso.  org/standard/73339.html ) for validation in the cardiac catheterization laboratory for the following reasons. First, the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard uniquely allows validation using an invasive reference with a sample size exceeding 15, making it suitable for cardiac catheterization laboratories. Second, the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard is globally recognized and is the most recent to be endorsed by the FDA for BP device validation, ensuring wider acceptability and rigorous compliance (old protocols from British Hypertension Society and European Society of Hypertension are also endorsed by the FDA; Extended Data Fig.  3 ). Finally, the IEEE Std 1708a-2019 standard requires notable BP fluctuations for validation  51, 52  , a perilous condition that is not consistently observed during procedures. The ISO 81060-2:2018 standard does not have such a mandate.\n\nWe enrolled 26 patients to participate in the validation study. The ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ) requires all participant data to be excluded if the invasive reference SBP variation range is >20 mmHg or if the invasive reference DBP variation range is >12 mmHg, so we excluded data from five patients (Supplementary Fig.  17  and Supplementary Discussion 11). The demographics of the remaining cohort of 21 participants satisfied the ISO 81060-2:2018 stipulations ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ), including age, sex, race, height, weight and BP distribution (Table  2  and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). We positioned the ultrasound sensor on the distal brachial artery of the ipsilateral arm with the radial A-line (Fig.  4a  and Supplementary Table  1 ). The ultrasound sensor was calibrated using the A-line as a reference at the beginning of the procedure (Extended Data Fig.  2 ). We randomly sampled 10 consecutive cycles of the recorded BP waveforms from each patient following the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ), resulting in a total of 210 cycles that were later subjected to statistical analysis.\n\nHistograms were prepared to examine the frequency distribution of differences between BP measurements acquired using the A-line and ultrasound sensor in accordance with the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ) (Fig.  4b ). The approximate normal distribution indicated that ~95% of measurement differences were within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, which helps to exclude the influence of participant-related variations (Supplementary Discussion 7)  54  .\n\nBland-Altman plots revealed the agreement between the measurements from the two devices (Fig.  4c ). The mean differences and standard deviations were 0.34 \u00b1 3.90, -0.18 \u00b1 2.20 and -0.43 \u00b1 2.66 mmHg, for SBP, MAP and DBP, respectively (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). Additionally, to avoid inter-subject factors, the measurement agreement between participants was evaluated using the average of repeated measurements from each participant. The mean differences and standard deviations were 0.34 \u00b1 1.94, -0.18 \u00b1 1.09 and -0.43 \u00b1 1.59 mmHg for SBP, MAP and DBP, respectively (Extended Data Fig.  3  and Supplementary Fig.  18 ). Given criterion 1 for general agreement (mean difference \u22645 mmHg, standard deviation <8 mmHg) and criterion 2 for agreement between participants defined by the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.  iso.org/standard/73339.html ) (Extended Data Fig.  3 ), the results of these Bland-Altman plots indicated that the error ranges of the ultrasound sensor measurements were well within the specified boundaries. When taking replicates into account, the standard deviations become slightly smaller (Supplementary Fig.  19  and Supplementary Discussion 10)  54  . The results remain compliant with the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard, confirming the strong agreement between the measurements from the A-line and ultrasound sensor.\n\nThe pulse waveform contour is rich in cardiovascular information. As the pulsation travels through the arterial tree, it encounters numerous reflection sites. Each of these sites contributes a reflected wave with a unique time delay and amplitude, resulting in a complex, deformed BP waveform with different contours at different recording sites (Supplementary Discussion 12). Despite this distortion throughout the arterial tree, the ultrasound sensor, placed on the brachial artery, still achieved high-fidelity waveform monitoring, comparable to the waveform measured by A-line in the radial artery (Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Fig.  20 ). The degree of linear correlation between the BP waveforms captured by these two methods was evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), resulting in an average value of 0.977 (Fig.  4e ). The high degree of agreement between the paired BP\n\nTable 1 | Demographics and characteristics of the participants in the outpatient clinic Sex n (percentage) Male 44 (51.76%) Female 41 (48.24%) At the time of study Mean \u00b1 s.d.

      "title": "Validation in the intensive care unit",
      "text": "A-line is the gold standard in the intensive care unit for the continuous monitoring of haemodynamic changes  58  . However, a long-term indwelling A-line carries inherent risks, such as catheter-related thrombosis and associated tissue injury when the patient moves  59  .\n\nA cuff-based sphygmomanometer is often used alongside the A-line on the contralateral arm to validate BP measurements  60  . Repeated inflation and deflation on a single arm can be uncomfortable or even painful  61  . In addition, this dual system substantially limits patient mobility. Therefore, there is an unmet need in the intensive care unit for comfortable, non-invasive monitors that can track BP accurately over extended periods in response to different medical conditions  62, 63  or treatments  64, 65  . We used the ultrasound sensor and an indwelling A-line to monitor BP simultaneously and continuously in four consenting patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit for post-operative haemodynamic monitoring (Fig.  5a-d  (top) and Methods). The patients were in Fowler's position (Supplementary Fig.  22 )  66  , with the ultrasound sensor placed on the radial artery contralateral to the radial A-line (Methods). The first minute of A-line data was used to calibrate the ultrasound sensor and both devices were subsequently used to record SBP, MAP and DBP for up to 12 h (Fig.  5a-d  (top), Extended Data Fig.  2  and Supplementary Table  1 ).\n\nMAP is usually the most relevant haemodynamic metric for critically ill patients and is non-stationary (its properties change with time) due to the complexity of human physiology (Supplementary Discussion 13)  67  . To assess the correlations over time  68  , we analysed minute-by-minute MAP data using wavelet coherence, which allows statistical analysis of periodic compositional agreement between two signals in the same time domain (Supplementary Discussion 13)  69, 70  . We found in-phase (as indicated by the rightward black arrows) and high magnitude-squared coherence within the high-period region of the wavelet coherence spectrogram (Fig.  5a-d  (bottom) and Methods). The high coherence was consistent throughout the continuous monitoring session, indicating the successful detection of BP trends (Supplementary Discussion 13).\n\nTo evaluate the likelihood that the observed coherence levels occurred by chance, we estimated the confidence interval by bootstrapping (Supplementary Discussion 14)  71  . This technique generates random samples by replacing and shuffling data in the ultrasound sensor dataset (720 MAP values from the 12-h measurement) to construct a comparable new dataset. In this study, the ultrasound sensor dataset was bootstrapped 100 times while keeping the temporal resolution the same. Then, wavelet coherence was evaluated between the A-line and bootstrapped datasets for each participant (Methods and Supplementary Discussion 14). The results showed low magnitude-squared coherence and random phase difference (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). Maximum values of the magnitude-squared coherence were obtained for each minute for periods >60 min from both the ultrasound sensor and bootstrapped datasets (Supplementary Discussion 14). We excluded regions that might be susceptible to artefactual edge effects (that is, regions outside the white dashed lines; Methods and Supplementary Discussion 14). We calculated the mean maximum values of the magnitude-squared coherence of the ultrasound sensor and bootstrapped datasets over the entire duration of each measurement. Then, we calculated the z-scores (Methods and Supplementary Fig.  24 ). A z-score >2.58 corresponds to a confidence level >99%, indicating a significant difference between the ultrasound sensor and bootstrapped datasets. The mean maximum values of the magnitude-squared coherence obtained from the ultrasound sensor were consistently much higher than those from all bootstrap comparisons, resulting in z-scores of 11.02, 10.72, 8.11 and 11.81 for patients 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  24 ). These results suggest that the in-phase high magnitude-squared coherence within the high-period region was non-random."

A 500-\u03bcm-thick backing layer has been added to effectively reduce redundant vibrations and improve the arterial wall tracking capability of the transducers, thus substantially improving the accuracy of BP measurements. We evaluated the ultrasound intensity and safety of the device according to the FDA Track 1 guidelines  29  and the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine  31  .\n\nTable 2 | Demographics and characteristics of the participants in the cardiac catheterization laboratory Sex n (percentage) Male 13 (61.90%) Female 8 (38.10%) Race n (percentage) White 14 (66.67%) Asian 3 (14.29%) Black/African American 2 (9.52%) American Indian/Alaska Native 2 (9.52%) At the time of study Mean \u00b1 s.d.

The Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement of BP measurements from the two devices. The Bland-Altman plot quantifies the agreement between each pair of measurements rather than a group of measurements. This provides a clear and quantifiable measure of bias between each pair of measurements (Supplementary Discussion 7). The Pearson correlation coefficient provides a quantitative measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two signals, effectively assessing how closely they match. Unlike other methods that require exact alignment of the time series data, dynamic time warping can align waveforms that may be out of phase, capturing the true essence of the BP waveform patterns. This makes dynamic time warping invaluable for accurately comparing BP waveforms, ensuring that differences in waveform patterns are carefully considered. Wavelet coherence analysis was utilized to assess the agreement between BP measurements from the two devices over time. Unlike traditional statistical methods that neglect either temporal or frequency elements, wavelet coherence retains both local and global frequency information without compromising temporal information (Supplementary Discussion 13). This is particularly effective for analysing continuous measurements over extended periods.\n\nMean differences and standard deviations in BP measurements between the ultrasound sensor and standard clinical methods meet IEEE Std 1708a-2019 and ISO 81060-2:2018 standards. If the device is intended for use during periods of large BP fluctuations (that is, when the invasive reference systolic BP varies by >20 mmHg or the diastolic BP by >12 mmHg during or before the test, as outlined in ISO 81060-2:2018 6.2.4.d.1 ( https://www.iso.org/standard/71161.html) ), a specialized patient population-such as individuals with cardiovascular autonomic failure or critically ill patients-should be selected for validation. If not, all data from the participants shall be excluded. Adherence to this standard inherently promotes haemodynamic stability within the participant pool. Therefore, this stability is beneficial for validating the wearable ultrasound sensor, because it ensures that the BP readings are within a controlled variability range. The ultrasound and A-line waveform morphologies show a high linear relationship (r = 0.977) and degree of agreement. The sensor is physically robust during daily activities and calibration lasts for at least 1 year. The sensor performance is not influenced by the ageing skin (Supplementary Discussion 15). The user-friendly design of the sensor also encourages patient adherence to BP monitoring. The ultrasound sensor can reliably capture longitudinal BP trends over a period of 12 h in the intensive care unit. These collective features suggest that the ultrasound sensor is accurate and reliable for eventual at-home use and common clinical settings.\n\nThe ultrasound sensor captures transient yet clinically important BP fluctuations, which can be early indicators of cardiovascular diseases or complications. For conditions such as autonomic dysfunction and paroxysmal hypertension, sphygmomanometers often fail to detect tell-tale BP fluctuations  72  . For nocturnal hypertension, an important predictor of cardiovascular events  73, 74  , BP may not dip as expected during sleep and might go unnoticed  75  . In addition, this technology addresses challenges posed by traditional one-time BP measurements, which can be influenced by factors such as white coat hypertension, where patients register abnormally high readings due to the anxiety induced by clinical settings  76  , or masked hypertension, where patients show normal readings in the clinic but elevated BP elsewhere  77  . By offering continuous and comprehensive BP monitoring, this device provides a more accurate and detailed representation of BP trends. Moreover, it reveals how BP responds to daily activities, potentially highlighting specific triggers or patterns of cardiovascular diseases that can be treated. Continuous, ambulatory monitoring facilitates the early detection of anomalies, ensuring timely interventions and a more holistic understanding of cardiovascular health. The ultrasound sensor may also help assess the effectiveness of therapy. Healthcare providers can evaluate the need to adjust medications or treatments on the basis of the continuous data stream, facilitating personalized treatments and optimal patient outcomes. There are several promising directions for future improvements. First, in this study, we assumed a constant vessel stiffness coefficient on the basis of the initial calibration, but this coefficient can be affected by cardiovascular diseases. In the cardiac catheterization laboratory study, we observed less satisfactory comparative results between the A-line and ultrasound sensor on participant 12, with notable phase differences and variations in BP amplitude. These discrepancies can be attributed to the impact of severe irregular heart rhythms, which shift blood flow profiles from laminar to turbulent and cause stroke volume fluctuations. The viscoelastic properties of arterial walls during these irregular heart rhythms complicate measurements, because the stress-strain curve's hysteresis becomes more pronounced, potentially distorting BP readings. There is need for further research to understand arterial wall dynamics under irregular heart rhythms. Detailed studies of patient populations with specific arterial diseases (such as coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or arterial aneurysm) are also needed to investigate and refine the diameter-pressure relationship  78  . In addition, the physiological variances among different participant groups can influence the measurement results. The participants in the calibration duration studies comprised healthy individuals with stable haemodynamic profiles, which probably resulted in consistent vascular stiffness throughout the 1-year measurement period. In contrast, participants in the intensive care unit were recovering from surgical operations and thus more likely to experience haemodynamic instability, which might have led to vascular stiffness fluctuations. Therefore, while less frequent recalibration may suffice for the healthy cohort, the intensive care unit cohort may have benefited from more regular recalibrations to account for these variations for long-term monitoring. The pulse wave velocity can precisely reveal arterial stiffness in real time, and would help extend the calibration duration and potentially enable automatic calibration  79, 80  .\n\nSecond, the focus of this work is to validate the ultrasound sensor against the reference equipment (sphygmomanometer and A-line) and further iterate the device on the basis of the results and user feedback, but in future large-scale clinical trials, additional parameters such as intraclass correlation coefficient can be incorporated. The intraclass correlation coefficient would allow us to quantify the reproducibility of the measurements obtained by different operators (such as physicians, nurses and patients) using the ultrasound sensor, as well as the repeatability of the measurements made by the same operator. As the manufacturing process of the device becomes more industrialized and scaled up, conducting intraclass correlation coefficient analysis would be essential to assess its practicality and reliability in real-world clinical environments.\n\nThird, integrating machine-learning pulse wave analysis could reveal the intricacies of waveform patterns and their link to subtle anomalies  81  , facilitating the early detection of cardiovascular diseases, offering insights into their progression and enabling personalized interventions.\n\nFourth, recent work has demonstrated a fully integrated wearable system  14  , which marks a notable advance towards more practical daily applications. However, the continuous operation of the system places large demands on the battery. Replacing commercial, off-the-shelf chips with application-specific integrated circuits could substantially reduce the power consumption of the system. Furthermore, integrating wearable power-harvesting components could extend the operational life of the system  82  .\n\nFinally, seamless integration of the device with existing hospital systems to enable data uploading and synchronization is necessary to enhance patient care  83  . Medical facilities rely on robust and cohesive electronic health record systems to maintain data accuracy and streamline medical operations. Direct, automated data transfer from the device to the hospital's electronic health records would eliminate manual data entry, which not only reduces the workload on healthcare professionals but also minimizes potential human errors. This is particularly beneficial for time-sensitive situations where immediate actions are needed."

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of California San Diego (IRB 804119).\n\nProcedure. Due to environmental concerns in California, mercury sphygmomanometers are no longer used in clinical practice or research  84  . A reference sphygmomanometer (DS58, Welch Allyn) compliant with ISO 81060-2:2013 was used instead.\n\nTo mitigate potential fluctuations in BP that could be attributed to dietary intake or inherent circadian rhythms, all BP measurements were consistently conducted within a narrow time window from 9:00 to 12:00, following a minimum fasting period of 12 h. In preparation for BP measurements, the participants were instructed to sit and rest quietly for 15 min before testing. This preparatory step was critical in ensuring the stabilization of haemodynamic parameters, thereby providing a more accurate reflection of the participant's baseline BP. To further enhance the consistency and comparability of the measurements throughout the 1-year period, we employed the same ultrasound sensor, which was affixed to the right brachial artery during testing, while the sphygmomanometer was positioned on the left brachial artery, facilitating concurrent BP measurements (Supplementary Table  1 ). We took three measurements from the sphygmomanometer interspersed with a 30 s interval to prevent potential venous congestion  85  . For each sphygmomanometer measurement cycle, which included periods of both inflation and deflation, concurrent measurements from the ultrasound sensor were recorded. Then, the mean values of each beat over that cycle were averaged. Thus, three pairs of sphygmomanometer and ultrasound measurements were recorded.\n\nOn day 1, the ultrasound sensor was first calibrated. Then, BP measurements from the calibrated ultrasound sensor and reference sphygmomanometer were tracked for 1 year (daily measurements in the first month, weekly measurements in the second to sixth months, and monthly measurements from the seventh to twelfth months).\n\nData reporting. The average differences in SBP and DBP measurements from the ultrasound sensor and sphygmomanometer were calculated for each participant and measurement day."

      "title": "Validation during daily activities",
      "text": "Overview. Normotensive participants with no previous history of cardiovascular conditions consented to participate in the study. All procedures complied strictly with the protocol approved by the IRB of the University of California San Diego (IRB 804119). In the interest of the participant's safety (following the suggestions of the IRB committee) and to maintain the integrity of the comparative analysis, the ultrasound sensor was compared to a sphygmomanometer. Human posture affects commercial sphygmomanometer BP measurements due to the hydrostatic pressure difference between the measurement arm and heart level  86  . Thus, all measurements were obtained while the measurement arm was placed at the heart level except in the hand-raise test. Motion artefacts introduce noises that interfere with BP reading  87  . Therefore, all experiments were performed and compared between the sphygmomanometer and ultrasound sensor with the measurement arm in a stationary position. All activities were executed in the identical order for all participants to maintain procedural consistency.\n\nProcedure. The participants were instructed to fast for at least 12 h before the test and were asked to refrain from ingesting alcoholic and caffeinated beverages for 24 h. The test was performed in a lab environment. First, the participants sat and rested for 10 min to stabilize haemodynamic changes. Then, three reference BP measurements were recorded with the sphygmomanometer, each taken after waiting for 30 s. The average of the three reference measurements was used to calibrate the ultrasound sensor before it was placed above the brachial artery for recording. The placement of both the ultrasound sensor and sphygmomanometer was consistently on the right arm for the duration of all daily activities conducted (Supplementary Table  1 )  51, 52  . Each participant performed sitting and 12 different daily activities, and BP measurements were acquired in a stationary position within 5 min after each activity.\n\nPositional changes. First, after calibrating the ultrasound sensor in the seated position, the participant was asked to stand; the arm used for measurement was positioned at the heart level. After 5 min, BP was recorded. Subsequently, the participant transitioned into a supine position, utilizing a pillow to elevate the arm to the heart level, and waited 5 min for BP stabilization before measurements. Following this, the participant's legs were elevated for the passive leg-raise test; after 5-min stabilization, BP was measured. Finally, the participant returned to a seated position and waited for 10 min. Then, the participant raised the measurement arm for 5 min and BP was subsequently measured.\n\nPressor tests. The participant performed three different pressor tests (mental arithmetic, ice bath stimulus and isometric handgrip) in a seated position. Participants rested in a seated position for 10 min before each test to stabilize their BP. In the mental arithmetic test, participants were asked to solve 10 different mathematical calculations without a paper or a calculator within 10 min. BP was measured after the first question had been solved. For the ice bath stimulus test, the participants immersed their hands in an ice bath. After 1 min, BP was measured. Finally, a digital dynamometer (TL-LSC100, Trailite) was used to measure each participant's maximal voluntary contraction. Then, ~30% of the participant's maximal voluntary contraction was used to perform isometric handgrip with a handgrip strengthener (NIYIKOW), which offers an adjustable resistance, ranging from 5 to 60 kg  88  . This method ensured that the participants maintained muscular contraction that was substantial enough to engage the muscles effectively, yet not so strenuous as to cause rapid muscle fatigue or notable cardiovascular exertion. After 1 min of isometric handgrip, BP was measured.\n\nCycling. Before cycling, the participant was first in a seated position for 10 min. Then, participants performed 30 min of constant intensity exercise on a stationary bike. After 5-min cooling in a seated position  12  , BP was obtained.\n\nDeep breath. To minimize the effect of cycling, the participants rested in a seated position for 30 min. Then, the deep breathing exercise was guided by an audio recording according to a standardized approach ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWFaTxNOGnI ). The recording instructed the participants to adopt a rhythm of 6 s of controlled inhalation followed by 10 s of exhalation, creating a pattern that promotes parasympathetic activation and may contribute to cardiovascular relaxation. The participants were seated comfortably in a quiet environment, with their eyes closed and wearing noise-cancelling earphones (AirPods Pro, Apple) to minimize distractions. After an initial 5 min of deep breathing exercise, BP measurements were acquired.\n\nMeditation. After 10 min of rest, meditation was performed in a sitting position according to a commercially available meditation session with music ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8 ). The participants followed instructions from the meditation session. BP was measured 10 min into the session. Food intake. In Western diets, overconsumption of carbohydrates and sodium is a major cardiovascular risk factor and may cause spikes in BP. Thus, after 10 min of rest in the seated position, participants ate a Western meal and dessert (100 g of sugar-rich chocolate). After 30 min, BP was measured in a sitting position.\n\nCaffeine intake. Caffeine in coffee, tea or energy drinks is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance. To minimize the effect of the meal intake, the participants rested for 120 min before the caffeine test. Then, the participants drank a sugar-free energy drink with 200 mg of caffeine. After 15 min, BP was measured in a sitting position."

The study was approved by the IRB of the University of California San Diego (IRB 191527). We recruited 85 consecutive outpatient participants from the community and from the Parkinson & Other Movement Disorders Center at the University of California San Diego. Study visits took place at the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at the University of California San Diego (Table  1 ). All participants provided written informed consent for this study.\n\nThe actual effect of sphygmomanometer inflation and deflation on haemodynamics is unknown (Supplementary Video 1)  89  . Studies have suggested that BP changes can be attributed to muscle activity, as well as the increased anxiety associated with the awareness of BP measurement  90  . In addition, another factor to consider is the act of sphygmomanometer inflation itself, which, due to the potential discomfort it causes, may change the BP  91  .\n\nProcedures. The validation was carried out using contralateral arms simultaneously by a team of three professional medical observers and a supervisor, who were trained and experienced in BP measurements (Supplementary Table  1 ).\n\nAfter an initial 10-min rest period in a quiet, temperature-controlled outpatient clinic, BP was measured simultaneously at the heart level on both arms using the sphygmomanometer and ultrasound sensor. A reference BP value was given by the sphygmomanometer to calibrate the ultrasound sensor before the tests. Each participant underwent three tests (supine, standing and supine 30 min after the first test in this study), with three pairs of BP measurements taken for each condition.\n\nReference BP measurements were provided by two observers using the sphygmomanometer with a 'Y' connector. The cuff size was based on arm circumference measurement  92  . SBP and DBP measurements were captured using the Phase I and V Korotkoff sounds, respectively. If both measurements from the two observers were \u22644 mmHg apart, the mean value of the two measurements was used as the reference measurement. Otherwise, the BP measurement was repeated until the measurements were concordant within 4 mmHg. The third observer, a developer of the ultrasound sensor, was responsible for affixing the device to participants and ensuring correct alignment with the brachial artery. The ultrasound sensor was classified as a beat-to-beat BP measuring device. For each paired measurement, we calculated the mean value of all beats obtained from the ultrasound sensor during the measurement period of the sphygmomanometer. This period was specifically chosen to encompass the entire duration of sphygmomanometer inflation and deflation  51  . Three paired measurements were performed in this manner. The supervisor gave a verbal cue to the observers to initiate each measurement and record the results. A mandatory rest period of at least 30 s was given after each paired measurement to avoid venous congestion  85  .\n\nTo maintain objectivity, observers were single blinded by calling out the BP readings throughout the entire study. The participants' involvement was concluded when the three test conditions were completed satisfactorily.\n\nData reporting. The report included a participant characteristic table  (Table 1 ) and graphical representations for statistical analysis (Fig.  3c-h , Extended Data Fig.  3  and Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The characteristic table includes key demographic information such as age, sex, height, weight, arm circumference and BP. Charts (combined histogram and scatterplots, Bland-Altman plots) for statistical analysis were provided separately for the three tests. The mean absolute difference was calculated for each test to evaluate the ultrasound sensor."

The IRB of the University of California San Diego approved this study (IRB 191474). We recruited a cohort of 26 consenting participants but excluded data from five participants with BP fluctuations too large to meet the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard's criteria ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ) (Supplementary Fig.  17  and Supplementary Discussion 11). The final cohort of 21 participants had relatively stable BP throughout the measurement period. All participants were patients undergoing invasive cardiac catheterization to diagnose or treat cardiovascular conditions (such as invasive coronary angiography for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease; invasive haemodynamic assessment for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure) in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center at the University of California San Diego.\n\nProcedures. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ) using the same arm measure. The reference invasive BP monitoring equipment complied with the requirements of IEC 60601-2-34:2011. The arterial access sheath and transducer system (A-line) was flushed to remove air bubbles and thrombi before taking reference measurements. The transducer of the A-line system was examined for damping properties with a fast flush test and, if necessary, actions were taken to correct abnormal damping (Supplementary Discussion 1). The 6F Glidesheath slender arterial access sheath (Terumo Interventional Systems) was placed in the distal radial artery, and average BP readings from the initial three pulses were used to calibrate the ultrasound sensor. The sheath potentially affected flow in the radial artery lumen, which might increase arterial impedance and then distort in situ arterial wall dilation  93  . Therefore, the ultrasound sensor was used to measure BP in the distal brachial artery in the same arm to minimize positional bias (Supplementary Table  1 ). For each patient, BP readings were collected from both devices for 30 s following calibration. Therefore, measurements were not subjected to the haemodynamic effects of medications given clinically as part of the procedure. Ten consecutive cycles of BP waveforms were randomly selected for analysis following the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ).\n\nFollowing these measurements, the arterial access was used to perform the clinically indicated diagnostic and/or therapeutic cardiac procedures and the patient's involvement in the study was concluded.\n\nData reporting. The report generated a patient characteristic table  (Table 2 ) and graphical representations for waveform comparison (Supplementary Figs. 17, 20 and 21) as well as statistical analysis (Fig.  4b-d , Extended Data Fig.  3 , and Supplementary Figs. 18-20). These components adhere to criteria 1 and 2 stipulated by the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard ( https://www.iso.org/standard/73339.html ). The characteristic table includes key demographic information as well as the co-morbidities or habit records of the patients. In accordance with criterion 1, each BP measurement obtained from the ultrasound sensor was compared with its corresponding A-line measurement. The biases between SBP, MAP and DBP readings from both devices were calculated, using the mean difference and standard deviation. Criterion 2 involved the average of 10 measurements from each patient, and the mean difference and standard deviation between measurements from both devices were calculated. Charts (histograms and Bland-Altman plots) for statistical analysis were provided to evaluate the measurements' distributions and agreement.\n\nThe timestamps from each cardiac cycle were identified for waveform analysis.

This study aimed to use the ultrasound sensor for the continuous recording of BP changes in patients admitted to the intensive care unit for observation after planned surgical procedures at the Jacobs Medical Center at the University of California San Diego. All procedures in this clinical study were approved by the IRB of the University of California San Diego (IRB 805176). Patient 1 underwent lumbar decompression and instrumentation surgery, patient 2 received an endovascular aneurysm repair, patient 3 was admitted for neobladder reconstruction and patient 4 was admitted for a left subclavian-to-brachial artery graft. All patients gave written informed consent before the study.\n\nProcedure. The ultrasound sensor measured the radial artery of the opposite arm from the indwelling radial A-line for simultaneous BP measurements (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). Although inter-arm BP differences may exist, it is typically a rare phenomenon  94  . Contralateral BP measurements were employed due to the practical limitations imposed by the secured indwelling A-line, other sensors and wires (such as electrocardiogram and pulse oximeter) with associated taping (Supplementary Table  1 ). The patients were in Fowler's position with the bed tilted between 30 and 60 degrees, the standard of care in the intensive care unit. The first measurement from the A-line was used to calibrate the ultrasound sensor. Both devices recorded SBP, MAP and DBP every minute for up to 12 h following the A-line sampling rate. Both devices remained in place throughout the duration of the test.\n\nData reporting. The minute-by-minute SBP, MAP and DBP data are presented for the duration of the test for each patient.\n\nBecause MAP is the primary parameter of interest in the intensive care unit, we further analysed the MAP data with wavelet coherence for time-period domain analysis. We used the Matlab toolbox for signal processing and applied the built-in function 'wcoherence' to perform the wavelet coherence of the BP measurements acquired from the ultrasound sensor and A-line. This statistical analysis method allows the decomposition of the non-stationary measurements from the ultrasound sensor and A-line into time-varying period distribution (Supplementary Discussion 13).\n\nFurther analysis was based on the magnitude-squared coherence of the high-period region in the wavelet coherence spectrogram (Supplementary Discussion 14). To consider the sampling frequency of both devices and differentiate the tracking ability over long periods from any measurement variances (such as contralateral arm differences and body motion), the high-period region was defined as periods longer than 1 h. Within this high-period region, we evaluated the probability of coherence that might have occurred randomly. First, the ultrasound sensor data were bootstrapped 100 times, maintaining the same temporal resolution as the experimental data. Second, wavelet coherence was analysed between the bootstrapped and A-line data. Third, we excluded the regions susceptible to artefactual edge effects and extracted the peak values of the magnitude-squared coherence for each minute in the high-period region. The mean of the peak magnitude-squared coherence values over the entire time window was calculated for both the experimental and bootstrapped data. Finally, the z-score was calculated for the experimental data in comparison to the 100 bootstrapped datasets using the following equation:\n\nwhere x is the mean maximum value of the magnitude-squared coherence of the ultrasound dataset, \u00b5 is the mean maximum value of the magnitude-squared coherence of the bootstrapped dataset and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the maximum values of the magnitude-squared coherence of the bootstrapped data. A z-score >2.58 demonstrates >99% confidence that the experimental coherence data were not random."

The dashed red line represents an average r = 0.977, suggesting a strong linear relationship between the BP waveforms from the two devices."

Bottom: wavelet coherence spectrogram of MAP measurements between the ultrasound sensor and A-line on patient 1 (a), patient 2 (b), patient 3 (c) and patient 4 (d), respectively. The x axis represents the time of measurement, the y axis represents the period, and the colour scale represents the magnitude-squared coherence. Black arrows represent the phase difference between the two device measurements, where rightward arrows indicate inphase and leftward arrows indicate anti-phase. The white dashed line represents reliable statistical analysis regions, below which statistical analysis is unreliable due to artefactual edge effects. The wavelet coherence spectra share the same colour bar."
