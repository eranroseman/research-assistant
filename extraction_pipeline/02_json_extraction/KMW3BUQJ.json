      "text": "Governments and health systems are increasingly using mobile devices to communicate with patients and the public. Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support."

      "text": "'Digital health' is an overarching term for the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for health purposes. The term has more recently been used as \"a broad umbrella term encompassing eHealth, mHealth, as well as emerging areas such as the use of advanced computing sciences, 'big data,' genomics and artificial intelligence\" (WHO 2018).\n\nThe use of digital technology for health has emerged as an important innovation with the potential to strengthen health systems in many settings. This potential to address health system challenges and to improve the delivery of services has propelled significant investments into digital health, particularly in lowand middle-income countries (LMICs). Governments have access to a broad range of digital health tools, but there are gaps in the evidence on the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of digital health interventions (Aranda-Jan 2014; Gurol-Urganci 2013; Vervloet 2012).\n\nDigital health interventions have shown potential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health service delivery and health system functioning, the latter referring to digital tools for strengthening key health systems functions such as leadership and governance, finance, human resource, and health information systems, as well as equipment and medicine supply systems. This includes a wide range of applications for electronic monitoring and evaluation, clinical support decision-making tools, electronic diagnostics and prescribing systems, increased access to health services in remote areas, co-ordination and knowledge exchange between different cadres and levels of health workers, electronic management and administration systems, and for improving health service responsiveness and patient-orientated change interventions aimed at improved patient self-care and health awareness (Catalani 2013, Naghizadeh 2017).\n\nAmong the most common areas for digital health interventions (perhaps due to the high prevalence of mobile phone use globally, including in low-resource settings) is patient-orientated change aimed at improved self-care and self-management of health and illness, through for instance digital health reminders of appointment and general health promotion messaging (Gurol-Urganci 2013). Although there is increasing evidence that digital targeted client communication may improve patient adherence behaviour, less is known about the acceptability, relevance, and usefulness of these interventions from the perspective of the client population. This information is needed to inform practice and policy on optimising the design, implementation, and improvement of digital targeted client communication interventions."

      "title": "Description of the topic of interest",
      "text": "Within the field of digital health, there are a variety of ways digital technologies may be used for public health purposes. This review focused on digital targeted client communication (DTCC). Digital targeted client communication may be used to transmit health event alerts to specific population groups; deliver health information based on a known health status or demographic; alert and remind about a particular health behaviour; or transmit diagnostic results to clients  (WHO 2018) . Targeted communication can also be further customised according to an individual's specific needs, resulting in 'tailored client communication,' whereby message content, timing, and frequency are matched to the needs and preferences of an individual  (Hawkins 2008) . The communication can be unidirectional and bidirectional, but initial contact is from the health system, as opposed to on-demand information service and telemedicine, where the client initiates the first contact with the health system (WHO 2018). The purpose of the DTCC would be to improve health and well-being, healthcare services, and/or the functioning of the health system. Typical interventions include sending brief text messages as a reminder to adhere to health visits and medical treatment, to provide clients with health information, to monitor their progress, and/or to provide medical advice and support."

      "title": "Why it is important to do this review",
      "text": "Through the World Health Assembly Resolution on Digital Health, Ministries of Health recognised that digital technologies can potentially bring value to the health system, but called for a better understanding of best practices and the promotion of evidencebased digital health interventions and standards  (WHO 2018a) . This resolution also highlighted the need to ensure that \"digital health solutions complement and enhance existing health service delivery models, strengthen integrated, people-centred health services and contribute to improved population health, and health equity, including gender equality\" and noted the lack of evidence on the impact of digital health in these respects (WHO May 2018).\n\nTo address this need, the World Health Organization (WHO) embarked on developing evidence-based guidelines to inform government-led investments in digital health interventions for health system strengthening, including mechanisms to bolster access to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH) services. This qualitative evidence synthesis is among a series of systematic reviews informing the WHO guidelines on digital interventions for health system strengthening. The scope of this synthesis reflects the WHO's assessment of global intervention priorities in this area. In addition to contributing to the WHO guideline, the findings of this review will be of interest more generally to programme planners and policymakers when deciding if and how to implement DTCC via mobile device in their setting. This review will complement the two WHO-commissioned reviews that focus on the effectiveness of targeted digital communication via mobile device (Palmer Ongoing a, Palmer Ongoing).\n\nResearchers in this field have also suggested that to better understand barriers and facilitators of successful implementation of digital interventions, clients' and healthcare providers' perceptions of the safety of the interventions, potential harms, and adverse effects should be assessed and explored (Gurol-Urganci 2013). Barriers may include privacy concerns (Ahmed 2017), poor access to reliable network coverage, and poor integration into existing health systems (Aranda-Jan 2014). Perceptions that the technology empowers the user and improves communication may serve as facilitators to successful implementation of digital health interventions  (Ahmed 2017) . Reviewing and synthesising the qualitative evidence on perceptions and experiences of clients will not only complement the evidence emerging from the effectiveness reviews, but may also enhance our understanding of broader contextual, organisational, technical, social, and individual factors that may be shaping the development, implementation, and responses to targeted digital communication."

      "text": "We included studies exploring clients' experiences and perceptions of targeted digital communication (e.g. text messages and interactive voice response) accessible via mobile devices (see Table  1 ). This could include perceptions and experiences of the content of the message, the delivery mechanism itself, the sender, or other aspects tied to this form of communication.\n\nWe defined 'digital targeted client communication' (DTCC) as the transmission of targeted health content to a specified population, or to individuals within a predefined health or demographic group. This transmitted information can fall along a continuum of tailored (personalised to an individual person's condition) to standard, general, untailored communication. It can include the transmission of individualised notifications according to a specific individual's clinical care plan as well as the transmission of predetermined content developed for the identified population group  (Hawkins 2008) . Eligible individuals need to be identified and subscribed into a system that allows the transmission of the health information via digital device to a number they have requested. Additionally, the timing and content of the transmitted information should be determined by the health system, and not by a client seeking information on-demand."

Methodological limitations of included studies: the extent to which there are concerns about the design or conduct of the primary studies that contributed evidence to an individual review finding. 2. Coherence of the review finding: an assessment of how clear and cogent the fit is between the data from the primary studies and a review finding that synthesises that data. 3. Adequacy of the data contributing to a review finding: an overall determination of the degree of richness and quantity of data supporting a review finding. 4.

Our matrix explored whether potential implementation barriers that we identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the programmes evaluated in the related reviews of effectiveness.\n\nTo create the matrix we undertook the following steps: firstly, we selected the synthesis findings that we had assessed as having high or moderate confidence and that presented potential barriers to the implementation of targeted client communication programmes. Secondly, we created 10 questions reflecting these potential barriers, and placed these in a table. Finally, we assessed whether any attempt had been made to address these implementation barriers in the trials that were included in the two related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness.\n\nTo carry out this assessment, we examined the publications included in the two Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness (Palmer Ongoing a; Palmer Ongoing). We also performed a further search for additional publications that could be related to the trials. We did this by (1) examining the reference lists of the main trial publication; and (2) searching for each trial in PubMed, and doing an advanced search for 'Similar articles'. The advanced search for 'Similar articles' used the first author of the trial to identify possible related studies that had this author as a co-author, and selected any that appeared to be related to the trial."

Many studies from a variety of contexts and client groups presented data related to the range of participants' views regarding the acceptance of DTCC and the factors that influenced this acceptance (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Brown 2014; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cates 2015; Cornelius 2009; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013;Lau 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012; Mbuagbaw 2014; Menacho 2013; Missal 2016; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017; Willoughby 2017; Wright 2011). Many participants had not used mobile devices to access health information previously, but were open to and interested in the idea of digital health interventions being used to deliver up-to-date knowledge and information or reminders for appointments or medication (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Cates 2015; Evans 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jennings 2013; Lau 2014; Mbuagbaw 2014; Odeny 2014). Some participants felt that it was more personal than other methods of delivering health information such as posters and billboards (Gold 2010). Others perceived it as a way of boosting already-existing interventions or curricula, such as school-based HIV curricula (Cornelius 2009).\n\nHowever, some participants felt that DTCC delivered via mobile device were not acceptable for their setting and chose not to participate in the interventions. An example of this was seen in a family planning intervention in Sierra Leone where some husbands had a problem with their partner being called by the healthcare provider or their partner participating in the family planning intervention, or both (Jalloh-Vos 2014). Others felt that in some situations it was important to still have the opportunity to speak to a person on the phone or in person (face-to-face), for example if they were having a strong craving for a cigarette and needed support in that moment (Naughton 2013\n\n). Some participants felt that DTCC would be useful for certain population groups such as younger audiences (French 2016; Willoughby 2017; Wright 2011), youth just starting on HIV medication, patients not adhering to medication, and those with less education (Smith 2017). Familiarity with technology, especially SMS, was one reason that participants put forward for accepting digital health interventions (Brown 2014; Cornelius 2009; French 2016; Jennings 2013; Smillie 2014). Youth and pregnant women described using digital technology as something they already did frequently, that fit their learning styles, and was not a foreign approach (Brown 2014; Cornelius 2009; French 2016; Munro 2017). Others mentioned that they were already using SMS to request healthcare providers to call them back or to set up health appointments (Jennings 2013). Participants also noted that messages delivered through digital mechanisms were very convenient and in some cases costeffective. Some felt that they would be very beneficial for families who lived a long distance from the health facility and would save them time and money (Calder\u00f3n 2017). Messages were perceived as being quick and much easier than going to the health facility to get a pamphlet, going to a doctor's appointment (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Jennings 2013; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017), or searching for information online or in books (Lau 2014). Messages were perceived as easily accessible, providing immediate guidance or support, and not taking up much time or attention (French 2016; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Perry 2012; Sloan 2017). Clients also liked the fact that the messages were o en free. Challenges to convenience included the cost of receiving messages and phone calls and the difficulty of maintaining privacy and confidentiality in some settings when discussing sensitive information via call or SMS (Jennings 2013; Perry 2012). Participants liked that they could save and re-read messages as well as have control over receiving, keeping, or deleting the information (Brown 2014; Evans 2016; French 2016; Munro 2017). Others felt that the intervention gave them some control over their own care and health information (Jennings 2013; Munro 2017). Some participants felt that DTCC delivered via a mobile device was an acceptable way of providing reminders for medication taking or appointments (Curioso 2009; Lau 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012; Mbuagbaw 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015). However, others felt that these reminders were not necessary and could be detrimental to patient independence. Some participants only wanted them Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews sent to patient groups who needed help adhering to medication or when they were preoccupied or fatigued (Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Mbuagbaw 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015). Finally, some participants liked DTCC that delivered messages to their mobile phones, experiencing it as supportive and making them feel that someone was thinking of and cared about them (Greaney 2014; Lau 2014; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Rana 2015; Sloan 2017). Finding 2: In discussing the pros and cons of DTCC compared to in-person meetings with a healthcare provider, some participants perceived interacting with a healthcare provider as preferable, warmer, and something to which they were accustomed. Others also felt that people could receive a faster response using digital communication and that the messages were more convenient and less judgemental. However, some liked having direct access to both healthcare providers and DTCC (very low confidence). A few studies, from both LMIC and HIC contexts (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Nachega 2016; Naughton 2013; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014), described a range of participants' preferences for digital health interventions compared to in-person visits to healthcare providers. The majority of studies in this finding looked at the perspectives of pregnant and postpartum women and parents. Some clients liked having direct access to both healthcare providers and to digital health interventions, as each played a different role (Naughton 2013; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014). Some felt that the digital health interventions were more convenient, reliable, flexible, and faster and provided more frequent support (Nachega 2016; Naughton 2013; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014). Clients who were pregnant and trying to quit smoking o en preferred the SMS interventions, as they felt healthcare providers judged them and made them feel uncomfortable (Sloan 2017). Clients in some studies liked the digital health interventions but still felt it was important to have access to in-person visits with healthcare providers or speaking with someone when needed (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Naughton 2013; Smillie 2014).\n\nFinding 3: Participants said that they liked two-way digital communication as this allowed them to engage directly with a healthcare provider, which they trusted more; to receive answers to their questions and have opportunities for discussion; and to receive a more immediate response. However, some participants felt that for some topics they would feel uncomfortable talking to a healthcare provider through a digital channel, due to issues related to shyness and privacy, and would prefer to use SMS (very low confidence).\n\nSome studies from both LMIC and HIC contexts found that participants wanted or liked to have the option of engaging directly with healthcare providers through DTCC in order to receive answers to their questions (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cates 2015; Jennings 2013; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017; Willoughby 2017). In general, participants felt that these types of two-way communication options would be useful and provide them with answers to their questions when they needed them, as well as allow them to maintain contact with their healthcare providers in between appointments if questions or concerns were to arise (Rana 2015). One participant in one study stated that two-way communication would not be acceptable, as the person on the other end would then be informed of his HIV status (Rodrigues 2015).\n\nSome participants preferred voice calls for engaging with healthcare providers above communicating with them through SMS (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012). There were different reasons for this. Some participants felt that they could ask detailed questions and receive detailed answers as well as discuss the various problems or challenges they were facing (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Rodrigues 2015), or that the service could be more trusted because they spoke to someone directly (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012). Others thought that it would provide more opportunity for discussion and ensure that the message was well received by the intended recipient, and that they could receive an immediate response (Jennings 2013).\n\nHowever, some participants explained that they preferred SMS services, as they would allow the participants to be more open and to ask about issues they would be too shy to bring up when speaking directly with someone (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Smillie 2014). Some participants felt that they would not feel comfortable talking to someone in person, especially if that person was new or unknown to them (Smillie 2014). SMS was also viewed as advantageous for brief and relatively confidential receipt of information (Jennings 2013).\n\nFinding 4: Some participants expressed a concern that some people might view digital targeted communication from healthcare providers as a replacement to seeking appropriate medical assistance, which might have adverse impacts. While some saw digital health as a way to increase access to care, others noted that text messaging might be seen by poorer people as a cheaper or sufficient healthcare option, which might decrease appropriate health-seeking behaviour (very low confidence).\n\nParticipants in one study from the USA exploring college students' views on receiving SMS for sexual health promotion expressed concern that other people might become over-reliant on digital health interventions because they were seen as a cheaper option than going to the doctor (Willoughby 2017). There was a worry that people would use the digital communication intervention instead of seeking appropriate medical attention. The participants thought that this could especially be the case for people with few resources."

      "text": "('Summary of qualitative findings' table for Findings 5 to 9 is shown in Table  3 .)\n\nFinding 5: Participants reported varying degrees of access to network services, including cell networks (for calls and SMS) and the internet. In addition, some participants had poor access to electricity to charge their phones. These factors were reported to be barriers to using the DTCC (high confidence).\n\nStudies from a range of income settings found that issues related to network services and electricity acted as a barrier to people's use of\n\nDTCC (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Cornelius 2009; Flax 2017; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012; Mbuagbaw 2014; Smillie 2014). Lack of network or internet coverage meant that some participants could not participate in the intervention or did not receive some of the messages (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Cornelius 2009; Flax 2017; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012; Mbuagbaw 2014; Smillie 2014). For instance, when Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews network coverage was poor, some participants in a Nigerian study recommended that SMS was the best option as they were more likely to be transmitted when the network was unstable, whereas voice calls would not connect or would be dropped (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012). Participants in a study from Canada described living in mountainous areas with no network coverage (Smillie 2014). Participants in low-income settings also mentioned that not being able to charge their phone due to power outages or lack of access to electricity was a barrier to participating in digital health interventions (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Mbuagbaw 2014). Finding 6: Participants reported varying degrees of access to mobile devices. For instance, some participants had no phone; some had lost or broken their phone; some could not afford to purchase airtime; some had changed their number or sim card; or for some access to the phone was controlled by another person. These factors were reported to be barriers to using the DTCC (moderate confidence). Some studies, the majority from LMIC settings in Africa (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Entsieh 2015; Flax 2017; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013; Menacho 2013; Missal 2016; Rana 2015; Smillie 2014), found that access to functioning mobile phones was a barrier to participants' use of DTCC. Some participants reported not owning a phone (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Rana 2015), and others had lost or broken their phone (Flax 2017; Smillie 2014). For some, not owning a phone caused feelings of jealousy and unhappiness and forced them to borrow a phone if they wanted to participate in the digital health intervention (Jalloh-Vos 2014). Cost was also a barrier to participation for some participants, as they could not afford the airtime or credit needed to receive or send SMS or phone calls (Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013; Smillie 2014), although in some studies, participants received free airtime, which removed this access barrier (Hirsch-Moverman 2017). In other cases, participants changed residence, changed sim cards, or had multiple sim cards and were no longer able to be reached by the DTCC (Missal 2016; Rana 2015; Smillie 2014).\n\nFor some participants, their access to a phone was controlled by others. This could be because they could not afford to purchase a phone themselves (Jalloh-Vos 2014), or because physical access to the mobile phone was controlled by another person (see Finding 18) (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Rana 2015). This group was mainly comprised of women and adolescents, and this is discussed further in Findings 7 and 18.\n\nFinding 7: Some participants, particularly women and adolescents, had their access to phones controlled or restricted by others, especially if they had to share or borrow a phone. They noted that they would o en have to explain why they wanted to use the phone, and who they wanted to call, to allay suspicions about this communication. They mentioned that this was a barrier to accessing DTCC and made it difficult to keep their messages private (moderate confidence).\n\nA few studies from LMIC settings in Africa found that some participants, particularly women and adolescents, had their access to phones controlled or restricted by others, especially if they had to share or borrow a phone (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Flax 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Rana 2015). They mentioned that this was a barrier to accessing DTCC and made it difficult to keep their messages private. In some contexts, women had their mobile phone use controlled by their husbands or other family members. The women would o en have to explain why they wanted to use the phone and who they wanted to call (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Rana 2015), for example to allay suspicion that they were talking to their boyfriends or having an affair. For some women, this would mean having to find an alternative phone to use if they did not want their husband to know they were using a digital health service. For example, in one study, some women did not want their husbands knowing they were receiving information on family planning (Jalloh-Vos 2014). In some settings, women and girls were also viewed by their society as not having time to use phones due to greater domestic obligations than their male counterparts (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012). Youth in one study also reported facing restrictions related to using phones at school (Rana 2015).\n\nIn one study, women in a women's group all shared a single phone. They elected one group member to control the phone and share the messages. This group member was then responsible for distributing the messages from the DTCC. In this context, the majority of the participants accepted this form of phone sharing and believed it was functional (Flax 2017).\n\nIn all studies contributing to this finding, participants felt that sharing a phone or having access to their phone controlled by someone else delayed the delivery of the message (Flax 2017; Rana 2015), and decreased the privacy and confidentiality around their personal information (Akinfaderin\n\n-Agarau 2012; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Rana 2015). Finding 8: Participants believed that the cost of participating in DTCC should be free or very low, as cost could present a barrier to participation, particularly for young people and those on lower incomes. Participants felt that there should be little or no charge for costs such as joining the digital health intervention, downloading applications (apps), or for sending and receiving mobile messages/phone calls (high confidence). Participants in several studies felt it was important for digital health interventions to have little or no cost, as these costs could present a barrier to participation (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cornelius 2009; Menacho 2013; Mitchell 2016; Perry 2012; Rana 2015; Smith 2017). This was especially important to young people (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Perry 2012), and those with lower incomes (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cornelius 2009; Mitchell 2016; Rana 2015). If the intervention could not be offered at no cost to the client, then participants felt that the interventions should be very low cost and that cheaper options should be used, for example SMS instead of voice calls (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012). In some cases, messages sent to participants were free, but if a participant wanted to reply they had to use their own airtime. Some participants thought that this would prevent people from using the bi-directional functions within digital health interventions (Rana 2015). Finding 9: Participants' ability to access digital communication was sometimes limited by their language skills and their personal level of literacy and/or techno-literacy (moderate confidence). Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Some studies, the majority from LMIC settings (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Curioso 2009; Greaney 2014; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Mbuagbaw 2014; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014), found that participants' ability to access digital health messages was sometimes limited by their language skills (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Mbuagbaw 2014; Smillie 2014), or not understanding how to use the technology (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Curioso 2009; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014). One study from the USA found that Latina women needing cancer screening receiving interactive voice recordings as reminders understood how to access messages but that the language used in the messages was not familiar to them (Greaney 2014), as illustrated in the following quote. \"'If your response is 'yes', then press the star button.' 'Star' is what Americans say, but on the telephone there is no star; it is an asterisk. It all depends on who you are speaking with. If the person you are speaking with understands that that is a star then let's press the star, but if the person understands it's an asterisk then he/she will begin to look for a star\" (Greaney 2014). Participants with literacy issues o en preferred voice calls to SMS, as they could talk with the caller and ask for clarifying information (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Jalloh-Vos 2014). Participants in two studies said they had learned or were willing to learn how to text in order to participate in digital health interventions (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Smillie 2014). Communication delivery and format preferences ('Summary of qualitative findings' table for Findings 10 to 13 is shown in Table 4.) Finding 10: Participants o en had preferences for how o en health messages were sent, the time of day they were sent, and the duration of the DTCC. However, there was variation in what most participants felt was appropriate timing and frequency, and these preferences were o en linked to the health issue on which the messaging was focused; whether people had their own phone or had to share a phone; and the participant's particular circumstances. Participants were particularly concerned about being bombarded with too many messages; whether the timing of the messages was convenient for them; and/or whether messages arrived in connection with the behaviour the message was trying to target (moderate confidence). Many studies discussed and presented participants' preferences related to timing, frequency of messages, and duration of digital health projects (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cornelius 2009, Evans 2016; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Jennings 2013; Mbuagbaw 2012; Menacho 2013; Missal 2016; Mitchell 2016; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017; Ware 2016; Willoughby 2017; Wright 2011). However, within and across studies and client groups, there was no consensus as to the ideal timing, frequency, or duration, as this was linked to personal preferences, contextual factors (such as attending school), and the behaviour or information the text message was trying to target. With regard to frequency, participants did not want in general to feel pestered or bombarded by too many messages (Evans 2016; French 2016; Gold 2010; Willoughby 2017), but described a fine balance between feeling bombarded and not receiving enough information to reinforce the messages. For example, participants receiving medication reminders were open to receiving multiple texts a day, whereas those receiving more general/less tailored information wanted messages much less frequently. However, in a number of studies no clear consensus emerged on the optimal frequency of the messages (Evans 2016; Gold 2010; Rana 2015). Participants' preferences for message frequency could also be linked to owning a phone or having to share (Jennings 2013). Those who had to share a phone wanted messages only a few times a week with the ability to stop the messages if the phone owner was away, whereas those who owned their own phone were open to daily messages (Jennings 2013). With regard to the timing of delivery of the messages, preferences for timing varied among population groups. It was important to participants that messages arrive when they could be seen and accessed, for example not late at night, when they would not be seen until the next day (Rana 2015; Ware 2016). Some adolescents and young adults thought during school hours would be fine (Cornelius 2009; French 2016), whereas others believed that this could cause problems based on restrictions around phone use (Cornelius 2009; Rana 2015; Wright 2011). Some participants felt that it was important that the message arrive in connection with the behaviour it was targeting (French 2016; Gold 2010; Menacho 2013; Naughton 2013; Rana 2015; Ware 2016), or in good time before an appointment (Odeny 2014), for example on a Friday night before going out to remind them of condom use (French 2016). Participants also liked the option of tailoring the timing of messages to fit their lives (French 2016). With regard to duration, no consensus emerged on how long the intervention should last (Evans 2016). Finding 11: Participants had different preferences for various delivery channels available for sharing information through DTCC, including mobile messaging, interactive voice response, or speaking with a healthcare provider. These preferences were influenced by a number of factors including cost, convenience, the ability to store messages and re-read them, familiarity with the channel, personal preferences, the nature of the content being delivered, the nature of the topic, language and literacy considerations, and the ability to have a discussion with a reallife person (moderate confidence). Some studies presented data related to participants' preferences for the delivery channel used to share information for digital health interventions (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Cates 2015; Curioso 2009; Greaney 2014; Jennings 2013; Mitchell 2016; Missal 2016; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014; Willoughby 2017). Some participants believed that different delivery channels would meet different needs and have different purposes (Willoughby 2017). Participants from a number of studies had a preference for information delivered by SMS (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Curioso 2009; Jennings 2013; Mitchell 2016; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Rana 2015; Smillie 2014). Reasons for preferring SMS included lower cost for the participant (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012); the messages were brief (Jennings 2013; Naughton 2013); confidential and protected privacy (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Smillie 2014); could be kept for reference and re-reading later (Curioso 2009; Jennings Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013); were easier to share (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Naughton 2013); and to understand, for example due to literacy issues or not understanding the accent of the person calling (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Smillie 2014). However, participants in a few studies raised concerns with text messaging or preferred other delivery channels. They thought, for example, that text messages were more appropriate for younger audiences (Willoughby 2017), or that the highly convenient nature of the SMS was a negative that would only have a short-term impact, as people would delete them or ignore them (Naughton 2013; Rana 2015). Finally, others who were unfamiliar with SMS technology felt that they were too passive and unfamiliar and so they ignored them (Rodrigues 2015). A few studies presented data that participants preferred interactive voice response (IVR) to receive digital health interventions (Greaney 2014; Missal 2016; Rodrigues 2015). O en this was related to low literacy levels in a community or that participants found them easier, more interactive, and that they attracted more attention than an SMS, meaning that they would not be easily missed (Rodrigues 2015). However, some participants felt that they should be able to repeat or re-read the message at a time more convenient to them, for example through linked delivery on platforms such as voice, video, or SMS (Missal 2016). A number of studies presented data where participants discussed their preferences for speaking directly with a healthcare provider on the phone to other delivery platforms (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Greaney 2014; Jennings 2013; Odeny 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015). Participants talked about why they preferred speaking directly to a healthcare provider. These reasons included that phone calls were clear and could aid understanding in people with low literacy levels (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012); they trusted speaking to a healthcare provider (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012); they could engage in discussions (Jennings 2013); and they felt it was faster and more immediate to receive an answer to their questions (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Jennings 2013; Rodrigues 2015). Participants also discussed other delivery channels that they liked. These included an app (Mitchell 2016), written letters (Greaney 2014), voicemails, Facebook, and reminder alarms (Rana 2015). Finding 12: Participants appreciated personalised health information and discussed their preferences for options to make interventions more relevant to individuals. This could include sender-based personalisation or receiver-based options. Reasons for these preferences included engaging the user, enhancing credibility, increasing feelings of ownership, control over their personal information, and feelings of privacy. Preferences for tailoring included making digital health messages personalised by using an individual's name; allowing participants to choose the content, topic, and language of their messages; providing information relevant to the participant's setting (local information); allowing them to select the timing and frequency of the message; providing personalised reminders (e.g. for vaccination or medication); and allowing participants to have control over privacy settings (low confidence). Some studies discussed participants' thoughts about personalised or customised messaging and their preferences for options to make interventions more relevant to individuals (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Evans 2016; French 2016; Goldenberg 2015; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jennings 2013; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Sloan 2017; Ware 2016; Willoughby 2017). Some participants felt that if the messages were not tailored to individual users this could cause them to disengage from interventions or cause problems in their personal lives (Jennings 2013; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013, )\n\n. For example, participants in one study on HIV messaging in Kenya to prevent mother-to-child transmission suggested that two different sets of messages be developed for those who had and those who had not disclosed their HIV status to their partner. This would help women avoid risking disclosure of their status (Jennings 2013). Participants in another study discussed the importance of using personal pronouns to make messages more relevant to the user. They felt that naming functions within the digital health intervention as, for example, \" MY test plan\", would help participants to take ownership of these functions (Goldenberg 2015).\n\nParticipants in several studies mentioned ways in which the people receiving communication could personalise or customise digital health interventions that they believed would be important. These included the following.\n\n\u2022 Being able to request the time of day the message(s) would be sent (French 2016; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jennings 2013; Sloan 2017; Ware 2016; Willoughby 2017). \u2022 Being able to select the frequency of the messages (Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Willoughby 2017). \u2022 Being able to customise the app to meet personal needs, such as reminders and privacy settings (Goldenberg 2015). \u2022 Being able to select a preferred language (Jennings 2013; Ware 2016). \u2022 Being able to personalise or select message content (Jennings 2013; Sloan 2017; Ware 2016; Willoughby 2017).\n\nParticipants in a number of studies mentioned ways in which the people designing and sending communication could personalise or customise digital health interventions that they believed would be important. These included the following.\n\n\u2022 Using unique access codes in order to prevent children and other adults from unintentionally gaining entry into discussed personal health information (Calder\u00f3n 2017). \u2022 Using the individual's name (Evans 2016).\n\n\u2022 Delivering the message in different languages (Evans 2016).\n\n\u2022 Including community-specific information (Evans 2016; Munro 2017). \u2022 Being able to, for example, text \"STOP\" if they wanted to stop receiving messages (French 2016). \u2022 Explaining the reason for the appointment as well as the date (e.g. the specific vaccinations to be received on that day) (Odeny 2014).\n\nFinding 13: Participants mentioned various message formats that they preferred. These included a preference for short, concise, personalised, clear, and direct messages in a language they could understand and in full text rather than \"text speak\" (low confidence).\n\nA number of studies presented data related to participants' preferences for message format (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012;\n\n. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cates 2015; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Lau 2014; Menacho 2013; Missal 2016; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Rana 2015; Smillie 2014; Willoughby 2017). In general, participants liked or wanted short and concise messages that were easy to understand and factual, especially from text messages (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Lau 2014; Menacho 2013; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Rana 2015; Wright 2011). Most participants preferred text messages that were written out in full and did not use abbreviations or slang, as these felt more professional and were more representative of how they thought a health professional would write (Cates 2015; French 2016; Naughton 2013; Willoughby 2017).\n\nIn one study (Missal 2016), participants commented on their experiences with interactive voice response (IVR). Most found the content and language of the message useful. However, some found the message too fast, short, and sometimes the voice was not clear enough. They were unable to request for the message to be played again if they had missed or misunderstood the content."

Participants said they wanted a known, identified phone number; messages sent from a reliable, trusted, credible source such as health professionals or official sources; and in some cases to feel like the messages were sent by a person (even if sent from an automated service). However, some participants, such as those with stigmatised health conditions, preferred an unmarked sender to protect their privacy (moderate confidence).\n\nSeveral studies found that participants' perceptions of who the sender of the message was could influence their trust in and perception of the digital health intervention's credibility and value\n\n(Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Brown 2014; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cates 2015; Evans 2016; Greaney 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012; Menacho 2013; Missal 2016; Naughton 2013; Lau 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014; Willoughby 2017). Participants in many studies identified that the sender should be known and identifiable. If this was not the case many stated that they were more likely to ignore or delete the message (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Greaney 2014; Smillie 2014), as their phones were already receiving many messages linked with telemarketing (Menacho 2013; Missal 2016\n\n). If a sender was unknown, it was also felt that this would decrease the credibility of the message. However, some participants preferred an unmarked sender in order to protect their privacy. This was in the case, for example, of a stigmatised health condition such as HIV, where if the sender's phone number were identifiable, a person's HIV status may be inadvertently revealed (Rana 2015). These participants felt that a solution would be to allow participants to choose if they wanted the number or name of the sender to be attached to the message (Rana 2015).\n\nParticipants also wanted the messages to come from a reliable, trusted, and credible source (Brown 2014; Cates 2015; Evans 2016; Lau 2014; Willoughby 2017). They were interested in the credentials or education of the person creating or responding to the message. Many felt that it was important that the information be written and sent by health professionals and from official sources (Cates 2015; Greaney 2014; Lau 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012). In some cases, if this was unclear, this led them to worry about the accuracy of message content and the intentions of the proposed intervention (Calder\u00f3n 2017). If the participant knew and trusted the source, they also felt that their data would be protected (Evans 2016).\n\nMany participants felt that it was important that the messages felt like they were coming from an actual person rather than from an automated system ( Lau 2014; Naughton 2013; Rodrigues 2015; Willoughby 2017). Some participants felt that since the messages were written by a health professional, the computer's role in the automated sending of the messages was irrelevant (Naughton 2013). These participants suggested that messages which were not repeated and were delivered at various times of day using the participant's name would feel more like they were sent by a person (Naughton 2013).\n\nFinding 15: Participants said that the tone of digital health communication mattered to them. Their preferences varied but included a tone that was: motivational, friendly, encouraging, polite, respectful, congratulatory, personalised, upbeat, positive, humorous, and relatable. Some participants highlighted that they did not like feeling pressured, lectured, shamed, or frightened by digital health messages (low confidence). A number of studies, the majority from HIC contexts (Cates 2015; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; French 2016; Gold 2010; Jennings 2013; Menacho 2013; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Rana 2015; Sloan 2017; Wright 2011), presented data that discussed participants' preferences related to the tone of the messaging used in DTCC delivered via mobile devices. In general, there was consensus across studies that messages should be polite and respectful. Participants indicated that the tone of the message could influence their acceptance of the message (Cates 2015; French 2016; Jennings 2013); their trust in the message content (French 2016); the credibility of the message; and their engagement with the messages and the digital health intervention (Cates 2015; Curioso 2009; French 2016; Gold 2010; Jennings 2013; Menacho 2013; Munro 2017; Wright 2011). Participants liked when the tone of the message was, for example, motivational (Curioso 2009; Rana 2015), encouraging (Curioso 2009; Jennings 2013; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Sloan 2017), upbeat, positive, and reassuring (Evans 2016; Gold 2010; Munro 2017; Perry 2012), friendly (French 2016; Sloan 2017), polite and respectful (Evans 2016; Odeny 2014; Wright 2011), humorous (Gold 2010; Menacho 2013; Wright 2011), or supportive (Jennings 2013; Munro 2017; Odeny 2014; Sloan 2017). Participants did not like it when messages were used as a warning, to scare people, or were based in fear (Cates 2015; Evans 2016; Munro 2017), or if they felt pressured, told off, shamed, lectured, or patronised by the content (French 2016; Munro 2017). Finding 16: Participants had preferences regarding the content they receive through DTCC. They wanted varied content that provided new knowledge and reminders, as well as explanations, solutions, and suggestions about health issues. They were interested in content related to health, illness, Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and treatments and practical topics such as health facility location and transportation. They wanted this information to be relevant and acceptable to their personal circumstances and local setting (moderate confidence). A number of studies presented data related to participants' preferences regarding the content they received through digital health interventions (Brown 2014; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cornelius 2009; Entsieh 2015; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013; Mbuagbaw 2014; Mitchell 2016; Missal 2016; Munro 2017; Nachega 2016; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Sloan 2017; Smith 2017). Participants expressed preferences for varied content (Brown 2014; Entsieh 2015; Missal 2016; Perry 2012), that provided them with new knowledge (Brown 2014; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cornelius 2009; Entsieh 2015; French 2016; Gold 2010; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Missal 2016; Munro 2017; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Sloan 2017; Smith 2017), or a reminder to take a medication or to reinforce something they knew already (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Mbuagbaw 2014; Nachega 2016). Participants liked when the content of digital health interventions gave explanations, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (Brown 2014; Entsieh 2015; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Missal 2016; Munro 2017; Perry 2012\n\n). An example of such practical advice is the suggestion that mothers who struggled with breastfeeding (or the idea of breastfeeding) could pump their milk and give it to their infants in a bottle instead of switching to formula milk (Brown 2014), as expressed in the quote below from a teenage mother in the USA.\n\n\"I was kind of grossed out by actually breast feeding so I had decided to just use formula. I don't know why I was so grossed out, I just was. But then you said in one of the messages that you can pump and feed the breast milk through a bottle, and the baby still gets all those benefits. It makes sense, but I just never thought of it. Because of that message, I started to do that and my baby still gets breast milk, but otherwise I would have given up\" (Brown 2014).\n\nFinally, participants were interested in content related to health, illness, and treatments and practical topics such as health facility location and transportation (Brown 2014; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Greaney 2014; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013; Missal 2016; Mitchell 2016; Munro 2017; Perry 2012). Many wanted this information to be relevant and acceptable to their personal circumstances and local setting. For example, participants from a few studies expressed an interest in information related to the location of health facilities, including transport information, and contact information for the health facility closest to them to be included in the content (Greaney 2014; Mitchell 2016; Perry 2012).\n\nFinding 17: Some participants felt that including elements in the mobile-based platform in which participants are asked for a response (e.g. via knowledge quizzes or multiple-choice questions or a practical tool allowing access to additional information, such as a nutrition calculator) could increase the engagement of users with the intervention, its content, and provide additional information to them. In one study, participants suggested that it would be helpful if the response was quick, simple, and convenient (low confidence).\n\nParticipants in a few studies, all from HIC contexts (Cornelius 2009; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Wright 2011), felt that bi-directional communication or content that somehow engaged clients (e.g. using quizzes or replies) would be more useful than one-way communication. Participants mentioned that for this to be the case, the interaction should be made convenient and allow for quick and simple responses. Such interactive options would help keep participants' attention and prolong engagement with the intervention. Participants in one study from the UK, women who had smoked during a previous pregnancy and receive SMS support for smoking cessation, also felt that when the communication asked for a reply they would think more about the content of the messages they were receiving (Naughton 2013), as noted by one participant below.\n\n\"An interactive text inviting a reply would make 'you think more about the text message' otherwise 'you don't have to do anything with it so you read it and then forget about it'\" (Naughton 2013)."

However, this theme is also touched upon in a number of other findings including Finding 7.\n\nFinding 18: Some participants with health issues that are o en seen as stigmatised or very personal (e.g. HIV, family planning, and abortion care) worried that their confidential health information would be disclosed or their identity traced due to their participation in DTCC. In general, people's perceptions of information delivery channels (SMS, interactive voice response, voice call) were influenced by how confidential they felt the delivery channels to be (high confidence).\n\nA number of studies, the majority from LMIC\n\nsettings (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cates 2015; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; French 2016; Goldenberg 2015; Greaney 2014; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013; Mbuagbaw 2012; Mbuagbaw 2014; Menacho 2013; Mitchell 2016; Nachega 2016; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Smith 2017; Willoughby 2017), found that some participants had concerns about the extent to which their privacy and personal information were sufficiently protected. This was especially true for those who were dealing with health conditions that are o en seen as stigmatised or very personal. People participating in interventions related to HIV and AIDS expressed the strongest concerns, especially for interventions that sent HIV testing reminders or reminders to take medication (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; Goldenberg 2015; Jennings 2013; Mbuagbaw 2012; Mbuagbaw 2014; Menacho 2013; Nachega 2016; Odeny 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015\n\n). These participants worried that the SMS or phone conversation would reveal their status to people who picked up their phones or who overheard their conversations. However, in one study from Kenya, participants felt that receiving an SMS or phone call would protect their privacy more than a face-to-face appointment, as conversations in a health facility were easily overheard by others. Some participants in a family planning digital communication study in Sierra Leone feared that participating in the intervention would compromise their privacy because their husbands or family members would find out they were using family planning methods (Jalloh-Vos 2014). Similarly, a participant in a postabortion care intervention in Cambodia was worried that her medical history of abortion would be discovered by her family if she was to receive a phone call in"

Some adolescents participating in interventions related to sexual and reproductive health felt that if others saw the messages it might be embarrassing; it may cause their parents to ask them or they may be suspected of having a disease (Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Perry 2012; Willoughby 2017). Some participants had more general worries that their private information, such as banking details and personal health information, would be disclosed or shared (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Goldenberg 2015; Mitchell 2016).\n\nParticipants in a few studies expressed opinions on how confidential they felt different delivery channels were. Some believed that texting provided more privacy than receiving a voice call (Cates 2015; Curioso 2009; French 2016; Menacho 2013; Perry 2012). Some participants felt that text messages were easier, more confidential, and more readily available (Curioso 2009). Others felt that they had more control over text messaging as they could prevent the messages from appearing on their phone screens, could lock their phones, and could delete messages (French 2016).\n\nFinding 19: Some participants proposed strategies to address their concerns regarding confidentiality and privacy. These strategies for communication included neutral, coded, or discreet language; access codes; communication that does not disclose the sender; coming from a trusted sender; and the ability to tailor and control content, timing, and frequency of their messages (high confidence).\n\nIn some studies, many from LMIC settings\n\n(Calder\u00f3n 2017; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; French 2016; Greaney 2014; Goldenberg 2015; Mbuagbaw 2012; Menacho 2013; Odeny 2014; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Smith 2017; Willoughby 2017), participants presented strategies that could be implemented to address their concerns regarding privacy and confidentiality. Some participants felt that the best way to protect their privacy would be to use neutral or coded language (Curioso 2009; Goldenberg 2015; Mbuagbaw 2012; Menacho 2013; Odeny 2014; Rana 2015; Willoughby 2017). This was especially true for those receiving messages about sensitive topics such as HIV and family planning. Others felt that privacy could be protected by not disclosing the sender of the message and making sure the message was sent from a trusted source (Evans 2016; Greaney 2014). Some participants suggested that digital health interventions use access codes or passwords that participants would have to enter to gain access to messages (Calder\u00f3n 2017; French 2016; Goldenberg 2015; Rana 2015). Finally, many participants believed that some of their concerns about privacy could be addressed by allowing them to tailor and control various aspects of the interventions such as the content, frequency, and timing of their messages (Goldenberg 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Smith 2017)."

Reasons given for the changes in behaviour included receiving new knowledge; receiving strategies on how to initiate discussion with a partner or healthcare provider; being motivated or reassured by the intervention; and being reminded, for example, to take medication or make an appointment. Some participants who believed that the intervention did not have any influence on their behaviour found that the digital health interventions were not relevant to them (low confidence).\n\nA number of studies found that participants thought that taking part in DTCC had influenced their behaviour\n\n(Brown 2014; Entsieh 2015; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013; Lau 2014; Missal 2016; Munro 2017; Rodrigues 2015; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017; Ware 2016), while others felt that it had no impact.\n\nIn some studies participants felt that the targeted client communication had had a positive impact on their behaviour. New knowledge about child and maternal health such as vaccinations and breastfeeding and antenatal care, Brown 2014; Entsieh 2015, risk of sexually transmitted infections (Gold 2010), the husband's role and how he can support his wife during pregnancy and delivery (Missal 2016), and family planning methods (Smith 2017), had influenced participant actions, including for testing or choosing a particular contraceptive method.\n\nDigital targeted client communication also provided some participants with specific strategies, for example how to discuss a health topic with a significant other. Some studies found that this led to participants talking to their partners about testing for sexually transmitted diseases (French 2016; Jennings 2013); preparing for labour and delivery (Missal 2016); or discussing questions with a healthcare provider (Munro 2017). Participants felt that without these strategies they might not have taken the steps to have these conversations about their health.\n\nMessages also motivated or reassured participants about their health decisions. Some participants felt a sense of confidence in their parenting decisions, as the messages they received validated their parenting choices (Brown 2014); or made them feel like the difficult conversations about disease testing were the right thing to do (French 2016; Jennings 2013); or motivated them to quit smoking (Sloan 2017), or take their medications on time (Smillie 2014). Messages also made participants feel less apprehensive about procedures such as sexually transmitted infection testing (Gold 2010), or continuing contraceptive use a er side effects occurred (Smith 2017). In other cases the messages motivated women to visit the health facility more frequently (Jalloh-Vos 2014), or husbands to support their wives during pregnancy (Missal 2016).\n\nSome participants felt that the reminders delivered through digital health interventions helped them remember to take their medication (Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Smith 2017; Rodrigues 2015; Ware 2016); get tested (French 2016; Jennings 2013); improve their use of condoms (French 2016); adhere to or engage in treatment (Jennings 2013; Lau 2014); schedule or attend appointments (Greaney 2014; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Smillie 2014); or by just keeping sexual health \"up in their mind\" (Gold 2010). In some studies (Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014,), participants believed that the intervention had no impact on their behaviour, whether it be remembering to take medications (Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014); testing for sexually transmitted infections and using condoms (Gold 2010); or scheduling an appointment for screening (Greaney 2014). Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Finding 21: Some participants suggested that the effects of the messaging may not be sustained over time, as they and others would become bored with or fatigued by the messages, especially if the content was not varied enough (low confidence). Some studies found that some participants thought the effects of digital health messaging may not be sustainable, as they or other users might become fatigued by the messages (Curioso 2009; Cornelius 2009; Evans 2016; Gold 2010; Menacho 2013; Mitchell 2016; Rana 2015; Willoughby 2017). Participants thought that this message fatigue would most likely occur if the frequency, content, and topics were not varied enough (Evans 2016; Gold 2010; Menacho 2013).\n\nFinding 22: Some participants were concerned about becoming over-reliant on digital reminders and thought that this might make them dependent on digital targeted communication for undertaking some health tasks. They were concerned that, in the absence of these reminders, they would adhere poorly to care plans (low confidence).\n\nA few studies, from LMIC settings in Africa (Jalloh-Vos 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012; Rana 2015), found that some participants were concerned about over-reliance on digital reminders, and that in their absence adherence might become problematic. Two studies explored perceptions related to adherence to HIV medication, and another family planning and antenatal/postpartum care. These concerns were important to participants that mentioned the problem of reliance, as they believed that the digital health interventions would eventually end and people needed to remember themselves (Rana 2015). For example, in Sierra Leone, both women and men mentioned that if the nurse did not call to remind them about family planning they would forget, and that it was the nurse's job to remind them to come (Jalloh-Vos 2014). Two studies from LMIC settings found that participants believed that digital health interventions could potentially save them time and money by giving them access to health care through their mobile phones instead of having to go to the health facility (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Smith 2017). In Peru (Calder\u00f3n 2017), women over 18 who had at least one child believed that this would be useful to families living in resource-poor communities, where families o en cannot afford the cost or time related to transport to the health facility or the consultation. They felt that the intervention would be used more by families that live further away from a health facility, described as follows.\n\n\"People like me who work all day could use it, we have to use it, because they then already have someone to ask, you will not be with that doubt 'do I give or not give the medication to the baby?' or 'how much medication do I have to give him/her?' I don't know, so when we have someone to call or to send text messages to, you will not hesitate to do it as they say\" (Calder\u00f3n 2017).\n\nWomen in Cambodia also felt that the digital health intervention saved them time and money, as they could receive their family planning counselling over the phone instead of having to travel to the health facility. This saved them both the fees associated with transport and the consultation with the healthcare provider (Smith 2017).\n\nFinding 24: Some participants felt that digital health interventions provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages. A few participants felt that in some cases the sense of caring and support that they received from healthcare providers through digital health interventions had a positive influence on their relationship with their healthcare provider (moderate confidence).\n\nA number of studies, the majority from LMIC settings (Brown 2014; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Entsieh 2015; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Lau 2014; Mbuagbaw 2014; Munro 2017; Nachega 2016; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017; Ware 2016; Wright 2011), presented data related to participants' reflections around the caring and supportive nature of DTCC.\n\nIn some cases, the participants in these studies felt that someone was interested in their situation, was invested in their well-being, and cared about them. This led some participants to feel encouraged and to have increased self-confidence and feelings of self-worth. For others, the messages provided support, guidance, and information, o en giving a sense of direction, reassurance, and motivation to participants. Support was presented in various ways, for example to take medications or providing counselling. In some cases, this increased dialogue between healthcare workers and participants had a positive influence on their relationship, for example by making each group more aware of the other's expectations (Jalloh-Vos 2014; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017). Some studies found that participants shared messages they had received or thought they would share messages with friends, family, colleagues, or neighbours (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cornelius 2009; Flax 2017; French 2016; Jennings 2013; Perry 2012; Smith 2017; Wright 2011). Many participants felt that it was important to share this information, as they had found the messages helpful and believed the information would be useful to others (Calder\u00f3n 2017; Flax 2017; French 2016; Gold 2010; Jennings 2013; Perry 2012; Smith 2017). Participants in one study felt that sharing messages and experiences could help to create a sense of community (Wright 2011). In another study, participants were excited about the possibility of creating message content to share with friends and family (Cornelius 2009).\n\nFinally, one study sent SMSes to pre-existing community-based women's groups about maternal and child health topics. Not all of the women in the group were pregnant or had children. However, these participants mentioned that they still found the content interesting and discussed it with other group members, family, and neighbours (Flax 2017)."

      "text": "As described in the Methods section, we used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers that we had identified in our synthesis (see Table  8  below) had been addressed in the programmes evaluated in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness (Palmer Ongoing a; Palmer Ongoing).\n\nThe relevance of our synthesis findings to the reviews of effectiveness was strengthened by the fact that the studies included in the qualitative synthesis and those included in the effectiveness reviews came from similar settings. Around half of the studies in both the synthesis and the reviews were from low-income countries (primarily African countries), whilst the remaining studies where from high-income countries (primarily the USA). In addition, around 10 of the qualitative studies included in our synthesis appear to have been carried out to inform the development of some of the trials.\n\nTable  8  presents an overview of our matrix assessment (a more detailed version can be found in Appendix 5, and a list of all of the studies included in the analysis is shown in Appendix 6). In summary, we found that some of the included trials did describe efforts to address some of the potential barriers to implementation that we had identified in the qualitative synthesis. However, most of the trials referred to only a small number of barriers, and in some trials potential participants were actively excluded if they were dealing with these barriers.\n\nOne barrier identified in our synthesis was related to situations where the target group did not own a functioning mobile phone.\n\nIn more than half of the trials, trialists dealt with this barrier by making mobile phone ownership a condition for trial participation. Between 0.3% and 63% of eligible participants were excluded from trial participation because they did not own a phone or could not receive text messages. Some trialists did attempt to find solutions to this problem, however. For instance, some trialists only required that participants had access to a phone, for instance through family, friends, or neighbours (Brown 2016; Gibson 2017; Kassaye 2016; Odeny 2014); in other trials participants were provided with phones (e.g. Cook 2015; Ingersoll 2015); and in one trial, local healthcare providers were given phones to share with women who had no access to phones (Joshi 2015).\n\nOther barriers identified in our synthesis were tied to poor access to electricity to charge phones and poor access to network services. However, trialists rarely referred to these issues. If mentioned, this was usually because access to specific networks or to stable electricity was a condition for participation in the trial. Trials that did attempt to deal with these barriers included one trial based in the USA (Ingersoll 2015). Here, assessments carried out prior to the trial showed that many people had inconsistent cellular or internet service, but that they could usually receive text messages. The trialists therefore built a texting system rather than one that would require a consistent cellular signal or internet access (Ingersoll 2015). Another exception was a Kenya-based trial (Pop-Eleches 2011). As many participants in this trial needed to charge their phones at fee-based charging stations in nearby markets, the trialists provided financial support to cover these fees (Pop-Eleches 2011).\n\nAnother barrier was tied to the expenses associated with the trial interventions. This was also confirmed as a problem by some trialists, who described poor participation because of cost barriers (Ahlers-Schmidt 2012; Lester 2010; Norton 2014). Around one-third of the trials described efforts to address this problem in some way, for instance by offering vouchers to participants (e.g. Lund 2012; Omole 2018), or by offering participants free access to various internet sites in return for receiving mobile advertising (Gold 2011).\n\nOur synthesis also pointed to problems in receiving messages when people changed their phone numbers or sim cards. Again, this issue was rarely referred to in the trials. When mentioned, this was usually as an explanation for participant loss to follow-up or as a condition for trial participation. Examples of trials that did try to address this issue include a trial from India, where participants with new phones were able to update their contact details with their local health worker (Joshi 2015); a USA-based trial (Bull 2016), where participants were asked to update information about their phone number every month (Devine 2014); and a trial from Ecuador, where trialists gathered several different contact avenues to maximise their ability to contact participants (Maslowsky 2016).\n\nTwo related barriers were tied to situations where people had to share phones or had their phones controlled by others, and situations where these people, as well as people with their own phones, were concerned about privacy issues when receiving messages. Very few trialists discussed situations whereby people's phones might be controlled by others, and at least two-thirds did not refer to privacy issues. However, several trialists did describe efforts to address issues of privacy and confidentiality. These included trials targeting people about oral contraception (Castano 2012), or HIV treatment and prevention (Garofalo 2016; Mbuagbaw 2012; Ybarra 2016) where trialists ensured that messages did not refer to the recipient's name, their health status, or the name of the medication; encouraged recipients to delete messages; and gave them information about privacy settings on their phones.\n\nOther barriers identified in our synthesis were created by language problems, low literacy, or limited techno-literacy. At least a third of the trials made no reference to these issues. Another third actively excluded people who did not speak one or two mainstream languages, and several trials also excluded people who could not read these languages or who were illiterate. Some trialists described efforts to overcome these problems, including designing text messages so that they scored low on readability scales ( Bigna 2014; Stockwell 2014); offering text messages in the local language (Kassaye 2016); or sending voice messages or pictorial messages instead of text messages (de Costa 2012; Smith 2015).\n\nOur synthesis also found that people's trust in and perceptions of the information they received was influenced by their perceptions of the sender. Attempts to address this issue were rarely described by trialists. Exceptions included a UK-based trial, Cooper 2015, that highlighted in advertising materials that the intervention was supported by the National Health Service (NHS) (Emery 2018); and a USA-based trial (Bull 2016), where messages were linked to celebrities that the target audience said were most interesting to them (Devine 2014).\n\nThe final issue we assessed in our matrix was the extent to which the target group had been given an opportunity to offer feedback about their needs, preferences, and experiences regarding the intervention. More than half of the trialists described collecting user"

      "text": "The acceptability of digital targeted client communication (DTCC) is mixed. Some clients described DTCC in positive terms, as providing them with support and connectedness; giving them a feeling that someone cares about them; and, in some cases, having a positive influence on their relationship with their healthcare provider. However, clients who are dealing with health conditions that are o en stigmatised or very personal (e.g. HIV, family planning, and abortion care) worry that their confidential health information will be disclosed or their identity traced.\n\nClients' perceptions and experiences of DTCC can be influenced by a number of factors. Participants believed that there should be little or no charge to participate in digital health interventions. They wanted messages that were from a trusted sender and that were polite and encouraging. They did not like feeling pressured, lectured to, or frightened. They wanted varied information that arrived at a time and frequency that was convenient for them. Content preferences included new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues presented in a clear, short, and personalised way. In general, barriers to participating in digital health interventions included problems with network connectivity, access to electricity, device usability, and issues tied to data confidentiality and privacy. Some of our findings addressed issues related to gender, equity, and human rights. For example, access to healthcare services via digital devices may be particularly helpful to clients with caring or work responsibilities; clients who live far from health facilities; and poorer people. However, access to digital health interventions may be particularly difficult for others who speak minority languages or who have low literacy skills or low digital literacy skills, who for example do not know how to open, read, or send a text message. Participation may also be difficult for clients with poor access to network services, electricity, or ownership of mobile phones. For clients, particularly women and adolescents, who have to share or borrow a phone or who have phone access controlled by others, it can be difficult to receive messages or keep them private. Clients with stigmatised health conditions such as HIV were also concerned about what would happen if their privacy was not protected, for example if the fact that they were participating in the digital health intervention led to the disclosure of their HIV status."

      "title": "Overall completeness and applicability of evidence",
      "text": "The sampling approach we used in this review (see above) aimed to achieve a maximum variation of target populations, settings, delivery mechanisms, and content focus of the targeted digital health intervention.\n\nWe found studies that represented clients from all of the client groups included in the scope of this synthesis. However, studies from parents and pregnant and postpartum women and their partners were not as common. For example, we found very few studies researching DTCC for HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women. We are therefore less certain whether these client groups have the same perspectives and expectations of targeted digital health interventions.\n\nA majority of the studies covered topics related to sexual and reproductive health for young people and adults, with a focus on sexually transmitted infections and specifically HIV/AIDS. We are therefore less certain about whether participants receiving digital health interventions related to other topics have the same preferences for information and intervention delivery, such as vaccination and general child health.\n\nThe studies included in this review come from a wide variety of contexts and settings. There are a number of included studies from poorly resourced healthcare systems as well as high-income settings. The range of settings included in this review highlighted access issues as well as issues related to gender and equity across all settings.\n\nThe majority of the studies included in this synthesis looked at digital health interventions where the content was or would be delivered by SMS. We have only a few studies that explore perceptions related to other delivery methods such as interactive voice response (IVR).\n\nThe data collection methods and study designs of the included studies may in some cases limit the applicability and completeness of the data reported. One example of this is the large number of studies that presented hypothetical digital health interventions (18 studies), both with and without examples of content, and asked participants to reflect on their preferences if they would participate.\n\nIt is unclear whether these preferences based on hypothetical thinking would remain the same once the participant had actually experienced participating in the intervention and receiving the messages.\n\nAll of the included studies made use of individual or group interviews and focus group discussions as their main method of data collection.\n\nNone used long-term ethnographic methods or field observation. While interviews and focus groups allow researchers to collect data on what people say, observational methods also allow researchers to collect data on what people do and why. This would have been appropriate for understanding how clients engaged with and used the various digital health interventions and allowed researchers to compare actions with interview and focus group data. Interviews and focus group discussions seem to be the most commonly used research methods amongst qualitative researchers exploring issues related to health. This could be because they are less time-consuming than longerterm ethnographic methods."

      "title": "Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews",
      "text": "The review team identified one published qualitative evidence synthesis that had a similar scope to this review\n\n(O'Connor 2016). The O'Connor synthesis had a much broader scope and explored factors affecting client engagement and recruitment to digital health interventions. Also, these interventions did not have to be targeted at a specific audience and were open to any health intervention delivered by a digital technology. We are aware of an ongoing related qualitative evidence synthesis considering healthcare workers' experiences with and perceptions Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of targeted digital communication via mobile device (Odendaal 2015). A number of reviews of the effect of mHealth programs in general have been carried out (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Ahmed 2017; Aranda-Jan 2014; Catalani 2013; Cole-Lewis 2010; Free 2013; Free 2016; Gurman 2012; Krishna 2009; Lee 2016; Peiris 2014). Two overviews of systematic reviews looking at text messaging (Hall 2015), and the impact of mHealth interventions (Marcolino 2018), have also been done. However, many of these reviews and overviews address health issues beyond the scope of our synthesis, such as obesity and chronic illness (Bacigalupo 2013; Hamine 2015; Peiris 2014). In 2015, a review was published that explored the adoption of mHealth in low resource environments (Chib 2015). This review found that the majority of studies in these environments concentrated principally on pilot projects focused mostly on the introduction and implementation of new interventions. This finding is similar to the types of studies we found in this synthesis, where approximately half of the included studies were projects using hypothetical examples to develop targeted digital health interventions. A further six studies were pilot projects for new targeted digital health interventions. We only identified one study that explored client experiences related to an ongoing project at scale, Mobile Midwife in Ghana (Entsieh 2015). Other systematic reviews have identified a similar large number of pilot studies (Catalani 2013; Gurman 2012). In the absence of studies of largescale implementation (where the targeted digital communication has become a routine part of care), it is difficult to say if people's experiences and perceptions of smaller studies are transferable to interventions delivered at scale. Our qualitative evidence synthesis highlighted issues of access to mobile phone technology, networks, and electricity. Other studies have highlighted this issue as well (Aranda-Jan 2014; Bukachi 2007). As discussed in the findings of our matrix analysis, future trials should take these access issues into consideration when defining participant inclusion criteria. At this time, little is known about how targeted digital health communication interventions are used or perceived by those who do not have access to phones, networks, or electricity, as the large majority of existing trials and qualitative studies include participants who have phones and access to networks and electricity. Our findings highlight a potential lack of digital literacy among clients in many settings, which could also affect the feasibility and acceptance of targeted digital health communication interventions. Similarly, the O'Connor 2016 review concluded that \"more investment is also needed to improve computer literacy and ensure technologies are accessible and affordable for those who wish to sign up to them\". Finally, issues related to tailoring and personalisation of timing, format, content, and privacy were clearly described in the findings of this review. One other review, Gurman 2012, mentions that less than half of the interventions included described targeting or tailoring the content. A meta-analysis of tailored print health behaviour change interventions found that tailored interventions were more effective than non-tailored interventions for health promotion (Noar 2007). The O'Connor 2016 review also found that interventions that are personalised when possible should be a focus when creating digital health interventions. To support this thinking, research has found that successful intervention design demands a user-centred and iterative approach to developing new digital behaviour change interventions (Yardley 2016). Tailoring was also identified as a core interactive design feature in effective e-health interventions (Morrison 2012)."

      "title": "Summary of integrating the findings from this synthesis with the findings of relevant Cochrane effectiveness reviews",
      "text": "We used a matrix approach to explore how the findings from our synthesis related to, or could help to inform, the findings of the two related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness of DTCC (Palmer Ongoing a; Palmer Ongoing).\n\nOur synthesis and the two intervention reviews were designed to complement each other, and used similar inclusion criteria where possible. The included studies in the synthesis and the two reviews were therefore broadly similar in terms of population groups, delivery mechanism, setting, and publication date. All three syntheses/reviews included studies with the same population groups (i.e. adolescents and adults that are users or potential users of reproductive health services; pregnant and postpartum women, including women living with HIV; and parents of children under five). In all three syntheses/reviews, the majority of programmes used text messages to communicate with their target audiences. Slightly more than half of the 35 studies in the synthesis were from LMICs. Slightly more than half of the 68 studies in the intervention reviews were also from LMICs. The studies sampled in our synthesis were published between 2009 and 2017, whilst the trials included in the intervention reviews were published between 2006 and 2018.\n\nOur matrix shows that most of the potential barriers to implementation raised by participants in the qualitative research were not referred to in most of the trials. It is possible that trialists did attempt to find solutions but did not report these in their publications. It is also possible that our search strategy failed to identify all relevant publications, and that these solutions were reported elsewhere. For instance, many of the trialists did not describe how they dealt with privacy issues when participants received messages in the papers we examined. However, it is possible that some privacy issues were addressed to some extent during scientific ethics review and approval processes.\n\nSome of the included trials did describe efforts to address some of these issues. Where this occurred, it would be useful to explore the impact, transferability, and potential sustainability of these efforts. Some of the solutions described by trialists are likely to be sustainable, including efforts to increase accessibility of messages through audio, pictures, and local languages; or protecting people's privacy though anonymising messages. However, other solutions may be less sustainable outside of a trial context or may be unacceptable for other reasons. These include the distribution of free phones or covering the costs of recharging phones. Other solutions, such as sharing of phones, may also lead to concerns about privacy.\n\nIn several trials, trialists simply excluded participants who were dealing with the barriers we identified in our synthesis. The exclusion of participants who do not own their own phones; who are likely to change their phone number or sim card; or because of language, literacy, or techno-literacy issues is problematic. Whilst the size of these challenges varies from setting to setting, people that experience these challenges may be the same people who need health services the most, but who access them the least.\n\nInterventions that specifically aim to increase people's access to"

The synthesis was commissioned to inform a WHO guideline, specifically to address guideline questions regarding the acceptability and feasibility of digital health interventions. Three of us were key members of the WHO guideline technical team (TT, SL, CG). Some of us had been involved in primary research related to digital health interventions, whilst others (CG, HA) had no previous work experience on this topic. Before working on the synthesis, our viewpoints regarding digital health interventions ranged from being neutral to these types of interventions to a slight skepticism of digital interventions as a magic bullet in solving health issues. All of us started the process believing that the implementation of digital health interventions should be informed by robust evidence of effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility. Whilst working on the synthesis, we became more convinced of the importance of supporting evidence-based decision-making in digital healthespecially having seen from the studies included in this review, as well as from several other reviews commissioned for the WHO guideline, the range of challenges and constraints in implementing these interventions at scale, and in ways that protect the privacy of participants."

      "text": "These implications have been derived from the CERQual assessment and the overview of the studies included in this review.\n\nThere is a need for better reporting of context, sampling, methods, and researcher reflexivity in qualitative studies. Future qualitative studies should report their methods clearly and include reflection on the researchers' roles in the study and how this may have impacted on the process and results of the study. More detail concerning setting and participants is also needed to identify underlying cultural or social phenomena (shared values or beliefs) that mediate the influence of communications, as these need to be addressed when designing targeted digital health interventions.\n\nA better representation of the participant's voice in the data in the studies included in this synthesis could have improved our confidence in some of the findings. For example, in some studies quotes were not labelled with a participant identifier, so we were unable to determine if the quotes came from multiple participants or the same participant.\n\nResearch about digital targeted client communication should aim to include a broader spectrum of participants in relation to phone ownership, literacy, and ability to use a smartphone. Researchers could also focus on exploring why some digital health interventions do or do not influence participants' actions and behaviour. More research is needed on the public's preferences around the details of timing, amount, and content of digital health interventions from people who have actually participated in digital health interventions. There is a large body of hypothetical studies, and there are some studies that evaluate or discuss participants' experiences a er participating in a pilot project or a research trial. However, we found only one study that interviewed participants involved in a digital health intervention that was being delivered on a national scale, in Ghana (Entsieh 2015). Trials assessing the effectiveness of digital targeted client communication interventions should consider the issues identified in this qualitative evidence synthesis (Table 8 above) and should ensure that the design and assessment of the intervention are properly reported, for instance following existing reporting guidelines for digital health interventions (Agarwal 2016)."

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Finding Overall CERQual assessment Explanation for assessment Contributing studies 1 Overall, participants had a range of views regarding acceptance of the idea of receiving health information through their mobile devices. This was due to factors such as familiarity with the technology, convenience, control, being able to save and re-read messages later, cost, seeing it as a simple way of providing a reminder for medication or appointments, and the sense that someone was thinking about them and cared enough to send a message Low confidence Due to moderate concerns regarding methodological limitations and relevance Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Brown 2014; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cates 2015; Cornelius 2009; Curioso 2009; Evans 2016; French 2016; Gold 2010; Greaney 2014; Hirsch-Moverman 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Jennings 2013; Lau 2014; Mbuagbaw 2012; Mbuagbaw 2014; Menacho 2013; Missal 2016; Munro 2017; Naughton 2013; Odeny 2014; Perry 2012; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017; Willoughby 2017; Wright 2011 2 In discussing the pros and cons of digital targeted client communication compared to in-person meetings with a healthcare provider, some participants perceived interacting with a healthcare provider as preferable, warmer, and something to which they were accustomed. Others also felt that people could receive a faster response using digital communication and that the messages were more convenient and less judgemental. However, some liked having direct access to both healthcare providers and digital targeted client communication Very low confidence Due to minor concerns regarding methodological limitations and serious concerns regarding adequacy and relevance Calder\u00f3n 2017; Nachega 2016; Naughton 2013; Sloan 2017; Smillie 2014 3 Participants said that they liked two-way digital communication, as this allowed them to engage directly with a healthcare provider, which they trusted more; to receive answers to their questions and have opportunities for discussion; and to receive a more immediate response. However, some participants felt that for some topics they would feel uncomfortable talking to a healthcare provider through a digital channel due to issues related to shyness and privacy, and would prefer to use SMS Very low confidence Due to moderate concerns regarding methodological limitations and adequacy and serious concerns regarding relevance Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Calder\u00f3n 2017; Cates 2015; Jennings 2013; Rana 2015; Rodrigues 2015; Smillie 2014; Smith 2017; Willoughby 2017 4 Some participants expressed a concern that some people might view digital targeted communication from healthcare providers as a replacement for seeking appropriate medical as-Very low confidence Due to serious concerns regarding relevance and adequacy Willoughby 2017 Participants reported varying degrees of access to mobile devices. For instance, some had no phone; some had lost or broken their phone; some could not afford to purchase airtime; some had changed their number or sim card; or for some access to the phone was controlled by another person. These factors were reported to be barriers to using the digital targeted client communication."

They noted that they would often have to explain why they wanted to use the phone, and who they wanted to call, to allay suspicions about this communication. They mentioned that this was a barrier to accessing digital targeted client communication and made it difficult to keep their messages private. Moderate confidence Due to minor concerns regarding methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy, and relevance Akinfaderin-Agarau 2012; Flax 2017; Jalloh-Vos 2014; Rana 2015 8 Participants believed that the cost of participating in digital targeted client communication should be free or very low, as cost could present a barrier to participation, particularly for young people and those on lower incomes. Participants felt that there should be little or no charge for costs such as joining the digital health intervention, downloading applications (apps), or for sending and receiving mobile messages/phone calls.

However, there was variation in what most participants felt was appropriate timing and frequency, and these preferences were often linked to the health issue on which the messaging was focused; whether people had their own phone or had to share a phone; and the participant's particular circumstances. Participants were particularly concerned about being bombarded with too many messages; whether the timing of the messages was convenient for them; and/or whether messages arrived in connection with the behaviour the message was trying to target."

These preferences were influenced by a number of factors including cost, convenience, the ability to store messages and re-read them, familiarity with the channel, personal preferences, the nature of the content being delivered, the nature of the topic, language and literacy considerations, and the ability to have a discussion with a real-life person.

This was due to factors such as familiarity with the technology, convenience, control, being able to save and re-read messages later, cost, seeing it as a simple way of providing a reminder for medication or appointments, and the sense that someone was thinking about them and cared enough to send a message."

Implementation Science. BioMed Central, 2018; Vol.  13  Finding 5: Participants reported varying degrees of access to network services, including cell networks (for calls and SMS) and internet. In addition, some had poor access to electricity to charge their phones. These factors were reported to be barriers to using the digital targeted client communication. Finding 6: Participants reported varying degrees of access to mobile devices. For instance, some had no phone; some had lost or broken their phone; some could not afford to purchase airtime; some had changed their number or sim card; or for some access to the phone was controlled by another person. These factors were reported to be barriers to using the digital targeted client communication. Finding 9: Participants' ability to access digital communication was sometimes limited by their language skills and their personal level of literacy or techno-literacy, or both. Finding 10: Participants often had preferences for how often health messages were sent, the time of day they were sent, and the duration of the digital targeted client communication. However, there was variation in what most participants felt was appropriate timing and frequency, and these preferences were often linked to the health issue on which the messaging was focused; whether people had their own phone or had to share a phone; and the participant's particular circumstances. Participants were particularly concerned about being bombarded with too many messages; whether the timing of the messages was convenient for them; and/or whether messages arrived in connection with the behaviour the message was trying to target. Finding 11: Participants had different preferences for various delivery channels available for sharing information through digital targeted client communication, including mobile messaging, interactive voice response, or speaking with a healthcare provider. These preferences were influenced by a number of factors including cost, convenience, the ability to store messages and re-read them, familiarity with the channel, personal preferences, the nature of the content being delivered, the nature of the topic, language and literacy considerations, and the ability to have a discussion with a real-life person."

However, they may still have had experience with the communication channel outside of an mHealth programme that they could draw on. Finding 12: Participants appreciated personalised health information and discussed their preferences for options to make interventions more relevant to individuals. This could include sender-based personalisation or receiver-based options. Reasons for these preferences included engaging the user, enhancing credibility, increasing feelings of ownership, control over their personal information, and feelings of privacy. Preferences for tailoring included making digital health messages personalised by using an individual's name; allowing participants to choose the content, topic, and language of their messages; providing information relevant to the participant's setting (local information); allowing them to select the timing and frequency of the message; providing personalised reminders (e.g. for vaccination or medication); and allowing participants to have control over privacy settings. Finding 13: Participants mentioned various message formats that they preferred. These included a preference for short, concise, personalised, clear, and direct messages in a language they could understand and in full text rather than \"text speak\". Finding 15: Participants said that the tone of digital health communication mattered to them. Their preferences varied but included a tone that was: motivational, friendly, encouraging, polite, respectful, congratulatory, personalised, upbeat, positive, humorous, and relatable. Some participants highlighted that they did not like feeling pressured, lectured to, shamed, or frightened by digital health messages. Finding 18: Some participants with health issues that are often seen as stigmatised or very personal (e.g. HIV, family planning, and abortion care) worried that their confidential health information would be disclosed or their identity traced due to their participation in digital targeted client communication. In general, people's perceptions of information delivery channels (SMS, interactive voice response, voice call) were influenced by how confidential they felt the delivery channels to be. Finding 19: Some participants proposed strategies to address their concerns regarding confidentiality and privacy. These strategies for communication included neutral, coded, or discreet language; access codes; communication that does not disclose the sender; coming from a trusted sender; and the ability to tailor and control content, timing, and frequency of their messages."

Some participants who believed that the intervention did not have any influence on their behaviour found that the digital health interventions were not relevant to them.
