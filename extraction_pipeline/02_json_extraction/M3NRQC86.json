  "title": "Adapting a Text Messaging Intervention to Improve Diabetes Medication Adherence in a Spanish-Speaking Population: Qualitative Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Latino adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have higher rates of diabetes medication nonadherence than non-Hispanic White adults. REACH (Rapid Encouragement/Education And Communications for Health) is a text message platform based on the information-motivation-behavioral skills model that addresses barriers to adherence and was shown to improve adherence and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, but it is only available in English. Objective: This study aimed to report the multiphase, stakeholder-driven adaptation of the REACH barriers to diabetes medication adherence content to a Latino population (REACH-Espa\u00f1ol). Methods: This was a qualitative study using focus groups. We identified potentially eligible patients (\u226518 y old, Latino ethnicity, Spanish-language preference, and T2D diagnosis) using a Mass General Brigham Hospital query. Eligible patients were invited to participate in a focus group conducted in Spanish between April 13 and November 9, 2023. A total of 5 focus groups were conducted. Focus groups 1-3 centered on ranking 40 barriers to diabetes medication adherence (derived from REACH and the extant literature), whereas focus groups 4-5 centered on translation and cultural modifications of the original SMS text message content associated with each of the REACH barriers. Barriers were mapped onto informationmotivation-behavioral constructs. We used descriptive statistics to summarize participant characteristics. Focus groups were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and analyzed with thematic content analysis using NVivo (Lumivero). Results: In total, 22 participants attended the focus groups. The mean (SD) age was 63.2 (11) years, 55% (n=10/22) were female, and the mean HbA1c level was 8.5%. All participants were born in Latin America or the Caribbean and spoke Spanish as their preferred language, and 54.5% (12/22) had completed middle-school education or less. Among the top 10 ranked barriers, 50% (n=5) corresponded to information, 20% (n=2) to social motivation, 20% (n=2) to behavioral skills, and 10% (n=1) to personal motivation. Personal motivation barriers (medication burden and fear of side effects) and behavioral skills (forgetting to take medication) emerged as important themes in the focus groups.",

      "text": "Suboptimal medication adherence, generally defined as taking less than 80% of prescribed medications  [1] , is reported by nearly 50% of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D)  [2, 3]  and is associated with poor glycemic management  [1, 2, 4]  and higher risk of all-cause mortality  [5] . Rates of suboptimal diabetes medication adherence are higher in racial and ethnic minority populations  [6, 7] , particularly among individuals with lower English language proficiency  [8] . An estimated 60% of Latino adults with limited English language proficiency report nonadherence to diabetes medications, compared with 52% of Latino adults with English proficiency and 38% of non-Hispanic White individuals  [8] . Unique barriers to diabetes medication adherence have been reported by Latino adults with T2D  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , including negative perceptions regarding diabetes medication use (particularly insulin)  [9, 12, 18] , misunderstanding of the ongoing need for glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy once glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has improved  [17] , and challenges with regimen complexity even with the use of a Spanish-language interpreter  [8, 19] . While interventions that address patient-reported barriers to diabetes medication adherence can improve glycemic management  [20, 21] , interventions that address barriers to diabetes medication adherence of relevance to Latino adults with T2D are lacking.\n\nAmong numerous behavioral theories that explain medication adherence behavior  [22] , the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model is an important theorybased model for conceptualizing and addressing domains associated with diabetes medication adherence  [23, 24] . The IMB model is built on three key components that influence behavior change, that are (1) information (ie, accurate knowledge about the disease and medications), (  2 ) motivation (ie, beliefs and attitudes plus social support and social norms), and (3) behavioral skills (ie, objective and perceived abilities)  [23, 25] . When applied to diabetes medication adherence behavior, the IMB components allow for the identification of barriers to medication adherence in each domain  [25] . Several interventions that have incorporated this model to address self-reported barriers to medication adherence have shown improvements in diabetes medication adherence and glycemic management among adults with T2D, including among Latino adults  [21, 23] . However, patient-centered tools for Latino adults with T2D based on the IMB model that are scalable and that do not rely on in-person educational sessions, which can be resource-intensive, do not yet exist. REACH (Rapid Encouragement/Education And Communications for Health) is an innovative text message tool based on the IMB model that delivers text message content tailored to individual patient-reported barriers to diabetes medication adherence  [21, 26] . REACH delivers daily diabetes self-management 1-way texts, daily 2-way texts that ask about medication adherence, and weekly texts that provide adherence feedback and encouragement based on responses to 2-way texts. REACH was shown to improve diabetes medication adherence (by an average of one-third to one-half day per week over 12 months), reduce barriers to diabetes medication adherence (including cost-related barriers), improve dietary behavior and physical activity, and significantly reduce HbA1c at 6 months compared with usual care (0.74% reduction among patients with baseline HbA1c\u22658.5%) [21] . However, despite its efficacy, scalability, and high participant engagement  [27] , REACH has not been adapted to other contexts. REACH could serve as an important clinical tool to address barriers to diabetes medication adherence among Latino adults with T2D. In this study, we used a multistage, stakeholder-driven, iterative method of language adaptation to adapt the original REACH barrier content to a Latino, Spanish-speaking population with T2D, focusing on identifying barriers to diabetes medication adherence of relevance to this population."

      "text": "We conducted a qualitative study by carrying out focus groups at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Chelsea HealthCare Center, one of the MGH Community Health Care Centers that serve a patient population in the greater Boston area that is majority Latino or Spanish-speaking  [28] . Eligible participants had a T2D diagnosis (based on diagnostic codes, confirmed with electronic health record review), were \u226518 years old, were taking at least 1 glucose-lowering medication, and reported Spanish as their preferred written and spoken language. We excluded patients with auditory or communication difficulties."

      "text": "We searched the MGH Research Patient Data Registry to identify individuals who received care at MGH within the previous 2 years and who were \u226518 years old, had a diagnosis of T2D, and had registered Spanish as their preferred language. A total of 3709 patients met this criteria, of whom 500 lived in the city of Chelsea. We mailed out opt-out letters to 350 of these participants (selected randomly), followed by telephone calls to screen for the eligibility criteria described above. Among 30 eligible patients willing to participate in the study, 22 unique participants attended one of the focus groups 1-5. A total of 10 participants who attended focus groups 1-3 also attended either focus group 4 or 5. The reason for participation in multiple focus groups was to engage patients in the iterative process of content adaptation, which took place in two steps: (1) identification of barriers to diabetes medication adherence of relevance to the study population (focus groups 1-3) and (2) adaptation of SMS text message content addressing the relevant barriers. Enrollment occurred between March and November of 2023. Given that the original REACH content was created with input from communication experts who edited the text messages to be readable and understandable (ie, written at the sixth-grade reading level or below)  [26] , the adaptation of REACH barrier content was also guided by an emphasis on reading appropriateness for the study population. Thus, for eligible patients interested in participating in the study, we conducted a health literacy screening to tailor the focus group activities to the literacy level of the study population. We used the 1-item Brief Health Literacy Screening Tool (BRIEF) questionnaire (\"How confident are you filling out medical forms by yourself?\"), which has been validated for Spanishspeaking populations as a quick assessment of health literacy  [29] ."

The REACH study team conducted a thorough review of published studies describing patient-reported barriers to adherence to glucoselowering medications. The literature review yielded 68 barriers to taking oral glucose-lowering medications and 7 barriers to taking insulin; similar barriers were collapsed, resulting in 36 adherence barriers  [25] . A 2-step interactive procedure was subsequently used to rank these barriers among adults with T2D. Each of the 36 barriers was mapped to the IMB constructs, and content experts drew on identified studies to develop SMS text messages addressing each barrier  [26] . For instance, the barrier \"My daily medicine routine is too complicated to keep track of\" generated 21 SMS text messages to address this concern, such as \"to help keep things simple, take your medications at the same time you're doing something else, like brushing your teeth or eating meals.\""

This adaptation methodology aims to maintain the content, semantic, and technical equivalence. It is superior to the translation and back-translation method, which may not yield cultural equivalency of the content being translated, nor capture key sociocultural factors  [30] . In this study, two groups of bilingual stakeholders reviewed the SMS text message content being translated (1) a bilingual research team and (2) focus group participants.

Our screening for health literacy at recruitment showed that 33% of participants interested in attending one of the focus groups had low health literacy (\"not at all\" confident in filling out medical forms by yourself). Therefore, we tailored the focus group activities to a lower health literacy level by focusing on nonwritten activities and using visual props and cues to guide the discussion (Multimedia Appendix 3). We used a 2-step interactive process adapted from the original REACH barrier development process  [25] . In the first activity, we encouraged an open discussion by asking participants to think about \"things that make taking diabetes medications difficult\" and to share these with the group; we wrote each item on a whiteboard as the discussion progressed. In the second activity, we asked participants to rank each of the 40 barriers to diabetes medication adherence referenced earlier, according to personal relevance. To make the activity easy to follow, we used a \"traffic light\" model of 3 colored envelopes and asked participants to place each written barrier name (eg, \"I worry that taking diabetes medicines for a long time will be bad for me\") into a folder, based on its relevance to them (Multimedia Appendix 3): red (never), yellow (sometimes), or green (always). Focus groups were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed in Spanish."

We retained 23 barriers that were reported as relevant \u226533% of participants (mean proportion for all barriers was 32%) plus 1 barrier (regimen complexity) that emerged as an important theme in the focus groups. We then combined barriers with similar content (19 barriers) and removed 1 barrier (\"I think brand name medicine works better than generic medicine\") because of some recent recalls of generic glucose-lowering medications which may have affected perceptions at the time  [31] , resulting in 18 final barriers for REACH-Espa\u00f1ol."

[Male, 77 years old, Guatemala] The texts are helping to remind me to take my medications. When I look and I see the message [any of the messages], I run to take my medication. The texts are very clear. It's really helping me. [Female, 45 years old, Guatemala] The content is helpful. For example, learning about what food to eat to raise a low blood sugar.

In contrast, our thematic analysis showed that personal motivation barriers (medication burden and fear of side effects) were the highest concern for focus group participants, followed by behavioral skills (forgetting to take medications), and information barriers (difficulty or confusion with medication changes and frustration with diagnosis or lack of improvement). These findings suggest that using the IMB model as a framework to identify barriers to diabetes medication adherence is useful in this population and that different qualitative approaches (open discussion vs ranking exercise) can provide complementary data to inform the adaptation process of tailored interventions.\n\nBy engaging focus group participants in an interactive barrier ranking exercise conducted through card sorting, we were also able to select highly relevant barriers to diabetes medication adherence and exclude those with lower salience from the study. Through this exercise, we found that the priority of some barriers differed in this population compared with the original REACH intervention. For instance, \"I'm not sure what my diabetes medicine is supposed to do\" was reported as relevant by 61% (11/18) of participants in this study, whereas this barrier was relevant only for 16% (38/237) of participants in the REACH development study  [25] . Similarly, \"I am not sure why my doctor sometimes changes my dose or type of medicine\" was relevant to 50% (9/18) of participants in this study, whereas only 15% (36/237) of participants in the REACH development study reported that this barrier was relevant. These findings underscore the importance of stakeholder-driven adaptation approaches given that core intervention components (in this case, the list of barriers), differed across populations.\n\nWe also found that the iterative process of translating and modifying the original intervention content with stakeholder input (bilingual research team, focus group participants) enriched the adaptation process by incorporating language diversity and nuance. By eliciting input from participants through interactive focus group activities, we were able to capture both the thematic and linguistic or cultural relevance of the content being translated. For instance, we excluded certain text messages that did not resonate with the audience. We revised the language with modifications considered more broadly understood across Spanish-speaking Latin American and Caribbean populations. Choosing language wording with a broader reach was particularly important in this study given the heterogeneity of the Spanish language across Latin America and the Caribbean. Our observations are consistent with previous studies that have highlighted the importance of engaging bilingual stakeholders (including patients) throughout the language adaptation process  [30, 32, 33] .\n\nAlthough barriers to diabetes medication adherence have been previously reported in the Latino population  [8, 10, 11, 17, 19, 34] , most studies have not used a theoretical framework to identify such barriers. The IMB model has been empirically validated as a framework to identify barriers to diabetes medication adherence  [23] , but only 1 intervention based on the IMB model has documented its use in Latin American adults with diabetes  [35] . Our study supports the use of the IMB framework to better ascertain barriers to diabetes medication adherence among Latino adults, which can be helpful in the development of interventions to address these barriers. Our qualitative analysis also highlights the importance of treatment complexity in this patient population and underscores the need for interventions that can identify and reduce treatment burden and regimen complexity. Although these challenges to diabetes self-management have been well described  [36] [37] [38] [39] , scalable interventions that can reduce the treatment burden are lacking, particularly in the Latino population.\n\nDigital health technology can improve diabetes medication adherence behavior  [21, 40]  and HbA1c  [21, 40, 41]  and is recommended by the American Diabetes Association to support diabetes self-care  [42] . However, among the 90 (approximately) digital health apps currently available for diabetes self-management, only one-third are available in Spanish, of which 94% (90/96) have a readability level above that recommended for patient education material  [43] . Some digital medication adherence support platforms are currently under study in Latino and Spanish-speaking populations  [44, 45] . However, none of these platforms provide educational content tailored to patient-reported barriers to diabetes medication adherence. The REACH-Espa\u00f1ol platform adapted in this study offers this key innovation, in addition to health literacy-informed content, which could facilitate broader engagement of prospective participants and long-term medication adherence.\n\nOur study has the key strength of having adapted an intervention with iterative input from stakeholders who could be representative of the population most likely to use the intervention. This user-centered approach is recommended in diabetes digital health research  [46, 47]  to ensure that end user perspectives are represented in the development of interventions and content is tailored to user needs. However, our study also has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, although we achieved thematic saturation for barrier selection after conducting 3 focus groups. Second, we recruited participants from a single health center and did not have representation from every Latin American and Caribbean country, which could limit the generalizability of our findings. In addition, although the barriers to diabetes medication adherence selected in this study were based on relevance to the focus group participants, the order of relevance may differ in other Latin American populations living elsewhere in the United States or with a different insulin usage profile. For instance, \"I have trouble paying for my medicine\" was not a highly ranked barrier but this may be an important barrier in other areas of the country with lower insurance coverage. Thus, should the REACH-Espa\u00f1ol content be adapted to other contexts, using the IMB model to identify population-specific barriers could be helpful. Finally, the focus of this study was to adapt the barrier-specific text message content. While text message content pertaining to diet and physical activity was directly translated from English to Spanish, the content did not undergo the stakeholder-driven adaptation process described here, which will be the subject of a future study."

      "text": "In this study, we report the multiphase, stakeholder-driven adaptation of the REACH digital health platform text message content, which addresses barriers to diabetes medication adherence, to a Latino population with T2D. We found key barriers to diabetes medication adherence that were relevant to this population, largely related to information gaps. These findings can contribute to the fields of patient-important outcomes and treatment burden to guide respectful and meaningful patient engagement in the management of T2D. Furthermore, engaging a diverse group of bilingual stakeholders (bilingual research team, focus group participants) early and throughout the iterative adaptation process was integral to ensuring content and linguistic relevance of the text messages in the REACH-Espa\u00f1ol platform. The feasibility, acceptability, usability, and preliminary efficacy of REACH-Espa\u00f1ol is under study in a 6-month pilot randomized controlled trial, which could broaden our understanding of the role of tailored, digital health interventions on improving diabetes self-care among Latino adults with T2D."
