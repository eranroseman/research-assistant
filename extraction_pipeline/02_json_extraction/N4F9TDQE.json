      "title": "Chapter 1 Introduction",
      "text": "Why do we need a focus on context and what do we aim to achieve?\n\nPopulation health intervention research (PHIR) develops and evaluates policies, programmes and other interventions that seek to have an impact on population health and/or health equity by modifying the underlying determinants of health or by directly influencing health behaviours. Such interventions are sensitive to context, by which we mean any feature of the circumstances in which an intervention is conceived, developed, implemented and evaluated (see Chapter 2). Many population health interventions work to change the context within which health is produced and become part of the context for future health behaviours, interventions and outcomes. Understanding the relationship between interventions and contexts is critical to understanding implementation success and failure, how interventions achieve impact, why their impacts vary and whether interventions can be sustained or successfully translated from one context to another.\n\nConcerns that too little emphasis is placed on the relationships between interventions and contexts have been expressed for at least 20 years. Pawson and Tilley 1 identified lack of attention to context as a critical weakness of prevailing approaches to evaluation and a key motivation for developing an alternative 'realist' approach. Also writing in 1997, Birch  2  drew attention to the risk that the developing field of evidence-based medicine encouraged a focus on unbiased estimates of average treatment effects, at the expense of understanding how effects vary by population and health-care system characteristics. A 2002 review found that none of the 'checklists in common use to assess the quality of evidence for a public health intervention contain details on how the differential effect of context (however defined) could be taken into account'.  3 Other reviews of both substantive intervention studies and frameworks for interpreting public health evidence reached similar conclusions.  4, 5 nce then, an increasingly comprehensive body of guidance has been developed to help with the design, conduct, reporting and appraisal of PHIR and references to context have become more frequent. This increase has had a number of drivers. One is methodological interest in evaluation approaches that go beyond the identification of average treatment effects, including systems thinking,  6  process evaluation,  7  causal modelling  8  and implementation research.  [9] [10] 0] [11]  Another is substantive concern with health inequalities and the possibility that effective interventions (in the sense that they improve population health overall) may fail to reduce or may even widen health inequalities.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  A third is the failure to replicate initial trial findings when interventions are implemented more widely.  15, 16 A fourth is social theorists' critique of research that uses abstract representations of health risks and interventions that are not situated in time, place and social, cultural, political, economic and other circumstances.  17 cognition of the importance of context in principle has not yet been translated into widespread good practice. There have been a number of useful recent contributions to clarifying terminology and concepts,  18, 19  but there remains a lack of systematic guidance for producers, users and funders of PHIR evidence on how context should be taken into account. A 2015 review of intervention studies published in 10 leading public health journals found that, with a few exceptions, treatment of context was superficial, with cursory descriptions of a narrow range of contextual factors, largely treated as confounders or as obstacles to intervention delivery or fidelity.  20 Another study published in 2017 found that references to social context had become less frequent in health behaviour change intervention research since 2006 and called on research funders and other stakeholders to develop guidance on how to take account of social and cultural contexts.  18, 21 here is a need both to identify existing good practice and to move the field forward by extending existing perspectives and inviting new approaches that address the significance of context for population health interventions. This document seeks to pull together recent thinking and practical experience of addressing context within PHIR. Its intended audiences include: l established PHIR researchers as well as researchers new to the field, from all disciplines with an interest in contributing to PHIR and teaching l research funders and journal editors, who play a role in setting agendas, priorities and structures for how PHIR is conducted, peer reviewed and reported l peer reviewers of research funding applications and journal manuscripts, who shape what research is funded and disseminated and what capacity is built among those working in the field l users of PHIR, who need to infer from the evidence whether or not an intervention is applicable to their own context and what impacts they can expect were they to implement the intervention in its original or in an adapted form.\n\nRecent efforts to build and strengthen the field of PHIR have placed greater emphasis on context. This document builds on such work. Its basic premise is that, rather than treating context as a source of 'noise' or a barrier to implementation, understanding the relationships between interventions and their contexts is vital to determining how interventions work (or why they fail) and their applicability to different settings and populations. Our primary focus is on research that seeks to improve population health and reduce health inequalities through interventions that act on the underlying determinants of health or more directly on health behaviours,  22, 23  but the issues are also relevant across the whole range of public health and health services research.\n\nTaking context more fully into account in PHIR (and related fields) will improve the quality and usefulness of research evidence in four important and closely related ways. First, taking account of context in the development of interventions should lead to more appropriate, implementable, effective and sustainable interventions that either work well in a specific context or have sufficient flexibility built in to their design to work across a range of contexts. Second, understanding how interventions relate to context is key to understanding how they work. Failure to take account of such relationships is one reason why interventions shown to be effective in one setting fail to achieve similar impacts elsewhere, even if they are replicated faithfully and implemented successfully in the new setting. Third, understanding the relationship between intervention and context helps to explain why impacts vary and, in particular, whether an intervention is likely to narrow or widen inequalities in health, for example by ethnicity, gender or socioeconomic status. Finally, including adequately detailed accounts of context in reports of intervention studies will make them more useful to decision-makers interested in implementing, adapting, sustaining, transferring and scaling up interventions and to researchers developing theoretical models of change underlying improvements in public health.\n\nIn the following sections, we explain the origins of the guidance and the writing process and define some key terms. In Chapter 2, we provide a broad, working definition of context. We identify the features of context that are likely to interact with interventions in ways that cause variation in impact and help or hinder implementation, translation and scaling up. In Chapter 3, we outline how context should be taken into account throughout the PHIR process, from priority setting (see Defining the public health problem and associated research questions) and intervention development (see Developing and adapting interventions) to the design and conduct of evaluations (see Evaluating interventions) and to reporting, synthesis and knowledge exchange (see Reporting, synthesis and knowledge exchange). In Chapter 4, we summarise the key messages for producers, users and funders of PHIR and suggest priorities for future research. Chapter 5 contains summaries of the case studies that we draw on throughout the document.\n\nINTRODUCTION NIHR Journals Library  www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk Origins and development of the guidance Development of the guidance was initiated by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research -Institute of Population and Public Health (CIHR-IPPH) and the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Public Health Research (PHR) programme, two national research funding agencies that share an interest in advancing the evidence base for population health interventions. In 2014, the agencies commissioned two background papers that explored current understanding and use of context(s) in PHIR: one by Shoveller and colleagues 20 and one unpublished [Petticrew M, Moore L. What is this Thing Called Context (and Why Does it Matter for Evaluation)? London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; 2015]\n\n. The papers identified a range of ways in which the treatment of context could be improved and a lack of systematic guidance within existing documents. In response, the agencies convened a workshop in London, UK, in November 2015, involving 16 experienced population health researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The face-to-face workshop provided a forum to:\n\nl discuss and debate pitches and provocations about the relationships between context and population health interventions (implementation and outcomes) to identify key issues to be addressed in guidance l decide how best to build on and extend foundations provided by existing background papers and interest in developing guidance l scope an outline for what the guidance should look like and determine roles, responsibilities and timelines for its production and dissemination.\n\nFollowing the workshop a smaller editorial group convened to draft a guidance document for discussion at a second workshop in Ottawa, ON, Canada, in April 2016. The draft was then revised iteratively, first within the editorial group and then including comments from workshop participants and five independent reviewers."

      "text": "Population health interventions aim to improve health and reduce inequalities in health. They seek to reduce population health risk by changing underlying social, cultural, economic or environmental conditions  22  or by acting directly on health behaviours.  24 These interventions may involve one or more modalities and components and may be designed and developed in any sector of economic and social policy, including fiscal policy, urban planning, education, housing and employment, as well as health. PHIR uses a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative research designs and methods to identify, understand and measure the effects of these interventions, the processes by which they bring about change and the contexts in which they work best. Box 1 explains in more detail how we have defined PHIR for the purposes of this guidance document.\n\nPopulation health intervention research is a multidisciplinary effort and 'context' is one of a number of key terms that may mean different things to different sectors of the PHIR and wider research community. We discuss the varying meanings of the term 'context' in Chapter 2 and explain why we have adopted a broad definition that encompasses any feature of the circumstances in which an intervention takes place that is relevant to understanding how it is implemented, how it effects change or how it is responded to or engaged with. Understood in this way, context incorporates the commonly used term 'setting', but covers a broader range of dimensions. When terms have been defined in conflicting or overlapping ways in the literature, such as 'transferability', 'applicability' and 'generalisability', we define the sense that we are adopting the first time that we use the term. Other terms, such as 'interaction', which have both a specific or technical meaning (as in statistical interaction) and a broader meaning (e.g. social interaction), are used in the broader sense unless otherwise specified.\n\nINTRODUCTION NIHR Journals Library  www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk Chapter 2 Conceptual issues: what do we mean by 'context' and how do we identify its relevant features? What do we mean by 'context'? Existing definitions of context in PHIR and related literatures differ in detail, but share a number of key features (Box 2). First, they emphasise that population health interventions are social practices, created, delivered, adapted and experienced by people who influence, and who are influenced by, the social, cultural, political and economic circumstances in which they live. Second, they recognise that the features BOX 2 Definitions of context: examples Context refers to the social, political and/or organisational setting in which an intervention was evaluated, or in which it is to be implemented. The contextual characteristics that are relevant vary with the type of intervention. Rychetnik et al. 3 The local mix of conditions and events . . . which characterise open systems . . . whose unique confluence in time and space selectively activates . . . causal powers . . . in a chain of reactions that may result in very different outcomes depending on the dynamic interplay of conditions and mechanisms over time and space. Poland et al. 17 Context consists of a constellation of active interacting variables and is not just a backdrop for implementation. For implementation research, 'context' is the set of circumstances or unique factors that surround a particular implementation effort. . . . [W]e use the term context to connote this broad scope of circumstances and characteristics. Damschroder et al.\n\n9\n\nBy context we refer very broadly to a range of factors such as the study setting, existing health or other systems, payment mechanisms, available resources, social norms, community supports, relationships between different actors, political context, and many others, which can all have a critical impact on applicability. Burford et al.  25  Context refers to the broad setting in which trials occur, including socio-economic characteristics, culture, geography, legal environment, and service structures. Montgomery et al.  26  Context includes anything external to the intervention that may act as a barrier or facilitator to its implementation, or its effects. . . . Understanding context is therefore critical in interpreting the findings of a specific evaluation and generalising beyond it. Even where an intervention itself is relatively simple, its interaction with its context may still be highly complex. Moore et al.  7  Context is conceptualized as a set of characteristics and circumstances that consist of active and unique factors that surround the implementation. As such it is not a backdrop for implementation but interacts, influences, modifies and facilitates or constrains the intervention and its implementation.\n\nPfadenhauer et al. 18 DOI: 10.3310/CIHR-NIHR-01 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Third, they emphasise the importance of interactions between interventions and context in understanding both causal mechanisms and variation in effects. Fourth, they define context broadly, to include characteristics that vary between individuals in a population (such as income or ethnicity) and features of the environment that affect the whole population (such as water quality or the health-care system). Finally, they assume a distinction between intervention and context, although, as we have noted, many population health interventions are intended to modify contexts and thereby become part of the context in which health is produced in future. We acknowledge that a complete understanding of the relationships between intervention and context may require interventions to be conceived as 'events in systems',  6  although implementing such a research paradigm is demanding  27, 28  and useful insights may be gained from approaches with a more specific focus on particular dimensions of context.\n\nWe support a broad understanding of context, to include (1) factors sometimes categorised separately as contextual (applying to a whole population) compared with compositional (varying between individuals within a population); (2) features of the physical location or geographical setting of interventions, as well as cultural, social, economic and political aspects; and (3) factors affecting implementation (organisation, funding, policy, etc.), as well as those directly affecting outcomes. Accordingly, we use context to refer to any feature of the circumstances in which an intervention is implemented that may interact with the intervention to produce variation in outcomes. These features may include, but are not limited to, the following domains: co-interventions or 'treatment as usual'; the immediate and wider organisational setting of the intervention; geographical environment, both physical and human; demographic, epidemiological and socioeconomic characteristics of those delivering the intervention and the recipient population; cultural practices, beliefs and attitudes among those delivering the intervention and the recipient population; legal and ethical rules and conventions; broader policies within which the intervention is embedded; historical and political factors that affect the acceptability of the intervention;  29  and how or whether or not the targeted population engages with the intervention."

      "text": "Deciding how to conceptualise context, and which features of context should be addressed in a particular intervention study, should be seen as significant research tasks in their own right. A number of frameworks have been suggested to help researchers pose the relevant questions. Poland and colleagues  30  provide a framework for use with health-promotion interventions. This framework comprises 20 questions that can be used to identify salient features of context, organised into five categories: (1) diversity across and within categories of settings; (2) received knowledge; (3) localised determinants of health; (4) stakeholders and interests; and (5) power, influence and social change. The framework is designed to be used collaboratively, to improve stakeholders' as well as researchers' understanding of the context within which an intervention takes place. Importantly, it recognises the need to take account of the history of an intervention in a particular setting and the differing interests of groups of stakeholders.\n\nAnother potentially useful guide is the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research,  9, 31  which includes an 'inner setting' containing six constructs relating to characteristics of the implementing organisation and an 'outer setting' containing four constructs related to the organisation's operating environment, as part of a broader set of constructs for use in implementation research. Vanderkruik and McPherson 32 set out a contextual factors framework for public health that comprises four primary levels [(1) external environment, (2) organisation, (3) initiative (i.e. intervention) and (4) site/local team], each divided into a number of secondary levels, which in turn comprise a bundle of specific components. The Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions (CICI) framework 18 for taking context into account in health technology assessments and systematic reviews sets out a relatively comprehensive range of CONCEPTUAL ISSUES: WHAT DO WE MEAN BY 'CONTEXT' AND HOW DO WE IDENTIFY ITS RELEVANT FEATURES? NIHR Journals Library  www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk  domains of context (geographical, political, epidemiological, etc.) and suggests that for each domain researchers should ask:\n\nl Which [domain] characteristics influence the intervention, its implementation, its population reach and its effectiveness? l How do [domain] characteristics exert their influence on the intervention, its implementation and its outcomes? l How do [domain] characteristics interact with other domains of context? Although useful, none of the existing frameworks or typologies for characterising context is entirely satisfactory for the study of complex population health interventions. They have been developed for differing purposes (health promotion, health technology assessment, implementation research, evidence synthesis, etc.) and vary widely in the way that they distinguish between intervention and context, what dimensions are included, how the dimensions are defined and the weight given to each. Table  1  seeks to combine and consolidate the dimensions identified in these frameworks into a more comprehensive list of categories for PHIR purposes.

Understanding the wider social and political context of population health interventions is one area where PHIR can learn from social theory  34  (Box 3).\n\nMuch PHIR is policy driven in the sense that policy-makers identify and prioritise particular problems that then become the focus of research. Often, policy change creates opportunities for evaluation that researchers must work out how to exploit, rather than basic science driving innovations that are then tested through a series of efficacy, effectiveness and implementation studies. The design and conduct of population health studies is dependent on relationships among research funders, researchers, policy-makers, intervention providers and recipients, who may hold differing views of the need for or purpose of an intervention or of the evaluation. The UK government's Responsibility Deal, 44 launched in 2011, comprised a series of public-private partnerships, under which the commercial partners pledged to undertake voluntary actions to improve population health. The complexity of the scheme and weaknesses in the monitoring arrangements made evaluation difficult, but assessment of the pledges made by alcohol industry partners under the Deal"

      "text": "Population health intervention research can draw from contemporary developments in social theory that have a bearing on issues of context. Creating a deeper and more sustained relationship with social theory is one way for PHIR to strengthen its insights and build new directions for research.  20 Two particular areas of social theory and research with potential to inform current debates in PHIR are (1) social problem theory and governmentality research and (2) the emerging field of relational sociology.\n\nSocial problems theory was popularised by American sociologists in the 1970s in research exploring how drinking, smoking and other phenomena became recognised as social problems.  [35] [36] 6] [37] [38]  Governmentality research derives from French social theorist and historian Michel Foucault's insights into shifts in modern forms of governance.  39 Both fields offer insights that challenge taken-for-granted perspectives on how problems come to be identified. They direct attention to ways in which the activities and forms of knowledge used by researchers help to define a given phenomenon as a problem deserving of intervention. Social problems theory and governmentality research can heighten reflexivity within PHIR by calling attention to how population-level health problems are identified, by whom, through what processes and with what implications for the interventions that are designed to respond to them.\n\nRelational sociology refers to a movement in social sciences that rejects the shared assumption of rational choice theory, structuralism and statistical variable analysis that entities 'come first and relations among them only subsequently'.  40 Rather than conceiving of the social as pre-given static actors, substances or essences, relational sociologists emphasise that the social is always dynamic, unfolding, processual and networked.  41 For example, Bilodeau and Potvin 42 draw on actor-network theory to suggest a conceptualisation of public health interventions that emphasises how social and technical entities are linked in extended networks and how interventions and networks shape one another. Relational sociology offers insights from which to develop more complex, dynamic and networked understandings of interventions. Agent-based modelling, which involves 'simulation of large numbers of autonomous agents that interact with each other and with a simulated environment and the observation of emergent patterns from their interactions' has been advocated as one way in which theories about such dynamic relationships can be developed and tested.  43"

[45] [46] [47]  Understanding the historical context of a contemporary public health issue is particularly important in research involving indigenous peoples, recent migrants or minority cultures, who may have different views or understandings of what kinds of intervention are appropriate from those prevailing in the research community or among policy-makers (Box 4 and see Chapter 5, Case study 1).\n\nThe health behaviours, environments, organisational practices and policies targeted by population health interventions arise from social, cultural and political contexts. Even in a case such as smoking, for which the evidence of harms is unambiguous, and with a large proportion of smokers known to want to quit, taking full stock of the practices, policies, beliefs, norms, corporate influences and other factors that sustain smoking, and using theory to help understand how these elements are related, are essential to the identification of promising levers of change. Identifying who is in control of intervention development is key to understanding the eventual shape of an intervention, its potential impact on population health outcomes and the possibility of effective evaluation.\n\nIn 2007, the UK government began to regulate the marketing to children of foods high in salt, fat and sugar by restricting the advertising of such foods during children's television programmes (see Chapter 5, Case study 2). The regulation was developed by the UK television advertising regulator [the Office for Communications Regulation (Ofcom)] in consultation with a range of parties including the food industry and advertising industry, followed by a public consultation on specific proposals. Research on the strategies used by stakeholders during the Ofcom consultations showed that food industry responses appeared to have influenced the regulations more strongly than those from public health interests (Rizavi S, Adams J, White M. Do Commercial, Consumer, Health or Civil Society Organisations Influence Public Health Policy and If So, How? Qualitative Study of Responses to The Ofcom Consultation on Regulation of TV Advertising to Children of Foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar. MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge; 2017). Ofcom's evaluation 51 claimed success, but an independent evaluation showed that, although the regulation reduced the advertising of foods high in salt, fat and sugar during children's television programmes, overall exposure increased, notably during prime-time programmes, many of which are watched by children as well as adults. 52 The importance of understanding the historical and political context in which interventions are developed and tested is also illustrated by the MINCOME guaranteed income experiment conducted in Manitoba from 1974 to 1978, but not properly analysed until three decades later. Rising costs and a changing political BOX 4 Ethnic and cultural context: research with indigenous communities\n\nRelationships between ethnic and cultural groups are often strained by racism, ethnocentrism and the cultural oppression of some groups by others. These tensions shape the structural determinants of health (i.e. distribution of political, social and economic power and resources)  48  and influence virtually every human pursuit, including research. Without attention to cultural context, those who control the design and implementation of intervention research run the risk of failing to improve population health through interventions that are irrelevant, inaccessible or unachievable for a particular cultural group. Intervention researchers who are working across cultures must engage with participants on their own cultural terms, which means moving beyond superficial understandings of cultural diversity towards entrenching both research and intervention processes within specific cultural contexts.\n\nIn some countries, a history of colonialism has created a legacy of distrust in political structures, including institutions of research. Previous attempts to strengthen research capacity in formerly colonial countries have often been tokenistic.  49 Recent moves in Canada to ensure that indigenous communities have the right to control the process and products of research about, with and for them  50  are beginning to establish trust between researchers and indigenous peoples, but it will take time and effort to fully develop the necessary relationships, processes and research capacity for formerly disempowered peoples to conduct research, rather than being the subject of studies conducted by dominant groups.\n\nDOI: 10.3310/CIHR-NIHR-01 \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

The initial motivation for MINCOME, and for the earlier negative income tax experiments in the USA, was to test the effects of improving income security on labour supply. Interest in health inequalities grew over the next 30 years and later researchers were able to exploit improvements in data infrastructure to explore a wider range of social and health impacts by matching MINCOME participants with control participants from elsewhere in rural Manitoba. The research found a substantial reduction in hospitalisations and in primary care consultations for mental health problems and a marked increase in the proportion of students continuing into grade 12 and graduating from high school.  53, 54 commendations Why and how a public health issue has been defined as a problem, the need for and appropriateness of intervention and what counts as success may be perceived in markedly different ways by the populations affected, stakeholders with a commercial or a political interest, public health and other practitioners and the research community.

      "text": "In what contexts is the intervention expected to be applied?\n\nIn what ways are the causal mechanisms and modes of delivery context dependent?\n\nWhich dimensions of context are being taken into account and how are they being defined?\n\nTaking careful account of the context in which an intervention is to be applied is a prerequisite of good intervention design. The Six Steps for Quality Intervention Development (6SQuID) framework for intervention development encourages researchers to consider explicitly which contextual factors are modifiable, on the grounds that 'Most interventions take place within systems (e.g., healthcare, education, criminal justice) and exert their influence by changing relationships, displacing existing activities and redistributing and transforming resources'.  55 tervention developers should therefore think about how the intervention interacts with the system in which it is implemented and whether or not that system also needs to be modified.\n\nTo do this well requires a good practical as well as theoretical understanding of the context. Hawkins and colleagues  56  set out a framework that emphasises the involvement of practitioners and other stakeholders in developing and prototyping interventions, to ensure that they can be adopted, implemented and maintained in the contexts for which they are intended. In developing an intervention to improve nursing care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in four low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), Edwards and colleagues  57, 58  identified the exclusion of nurses from guideline development and workplace policy-making processes as a reason for the weakness of such policies (see Chapter 5, Case study 3). They engaged nurses and those living with HIV/AIDS directly in the establishment of leadership hubs, where they worked alongside district decision-makers and other health professionals to improve clinical practices and workplaces for the care of patients with HIV/AIDS and their families.\n\nIdentifying prospectively all of the important contextual factors is likely to be difficult for novel interventions. Development of a 'theory of change' (ToC) that identifies the key dependencies between intervention and context may be helpful.  59 ToC is one of a number of closely related terms that are used more or less interchangeably in evaluation research to refer to a conceptual model of how an intervention is intended to\n\nTAKING ACCOUNT OF CONTEXT IN THE POPULATION HEALTH INTERVENTION RESEARCH PROCESS NIHR Journals Library  www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk  achieve its impact. A ToC may draw on broader social or behavioural theories about how change occurs but is specific to the intervention being evaluated. De Silva and colleagues 60 characterise a ToC as:\n\na theory of 'how and why an initiative works' which can be empirically tested by measuring indicators for every expected step on the hypothesized causal pathway to impact. It is developed in collaboration with stakeholders and modified throughout the intervention development and evaluation process.\n\nIt is useful to represent ToCs graphically, to clearly identify the causal pathways through which impacts are expected to occur.\n\nA recent review of the use of ToCs in public health evaluation found only a few studies in which contextual factors had been incorporated as possible explanations of variation in intervention delivery or outcomes.  61  guide their 'theory-based evaluation' of the Scottish government's alcohol strategy, researchers at NHS Health Scotland developed a ToC that took into account components of the strategy and external factors affecting delivery and outcomes  62  (Figure  1a ). External factors addressed in the evaluation included income trends and deprivation patterns, the possible existence of a 'vulnerable cohort' in the Scottish population, reflecting earlier socioeconomic trends, previous alcohol policies, Scotland's drinking culture and the nature of the alcohol market.\n\nA series of studies was undertaken to assess the impact of these factors, alongside studies of the impacts of components of the strategy, and the results were combined into a revised ToC (see Figure  1b ).

[67] [68] 8] [69]  A qualitative, ethnographic needs assessment identified features of the social, political and interpersonal contexts that were exacerbating the epidemic in South Africa: the apartheid legacy; patriarchal culture; macro-level sociocultural changes that threaten traditional parental roles, especially advocacy of children's rights; fractured leadership; children's schooling outstripping their parents' educational level; harsh parenting; poor parent-child communication; parental ignorance about HIV; and death of relatives. The AmaQhawe programme was adapted to take account of these factors by (1) incorporating sessions on stigma and bereavement; (2) adding a session on parent and child rights and responsibilities; (3) using cartoon narratives to address sexual topics that cultural taboos made sensitive to discuss; and (4) facilitating a more health-enhancing community context through building social competence and collective efficacy.\n\nLikewise, to develop the babyClear intervention to prevent smoking in pregnancy (see Chapter 5, Case study 5), researchers wanted to understand why services that were effective in other populations were not working well for pregnant women. Accordingly, they focused on the interactions between pregnant smokers and midwives, rather than just on the choices made by the pregnant women. They found that midwives were reluctant to raise the issue of smoking for fear of damaging their relationship with their patients,  70  so training for midwives and other staff was incorporated into a new care pathway.  71  develop the Football Fans in Training (FFiT) intervention (see Chapter 5, Case study 6), intended to help overweight men lose weight and adopt a healthier lifestyle, Hunt and colleagues  [72] [73] [74]  drew on sociological theories of masculinity as well as on evidence for the design of behaviour change interventions. A key feature of FFiT was the use of a setting (professional football clubs in Scotland) that might attract and retain participants who would find traditional weight loss programmes unappealing. The gender-sensitised intervention successfully helped the men to lose weight and a process evaluation showed how the football clubs provided a physical, symbolic and social context in which the men felt comfortable addressing issues of weight loss and lifestyle change. The FFiT intervention is now routinely implemented in many professional football clubs across the UK and its potential for wider implementation is now being tested in a wide range of other sports and non-sport settings, countries and population groups.\n\nIn contrast, underestimation of the importance of context, or a failure to take account of all of the relevant contextual dimensions, can lead to difficulties with implementation or a lack of effectiveness, even if an intervention can be implemented successfully in a new context. The Nurse Family Partnership had been shown in a number of US trials  [75] [76] [77]  and one European trial  78  to be effective in improving a range of pregnancy, parenting, maternal health and social outcomes before it was implemented in the UK as the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP). A large well-conducted trial of FNP found that, despite successful implementation, there was no improvement across the four primary outcomes.  79 The report concluded that benefits could not be assumed in 'different health-care settings and . . . service populations, even when objective programme fidelity from US trials was maintained'.  79  accompanying editorial suggested that the lack of any additional benefit associated with receipt of the FNP reflected the inclusion of all teenage mothers, rather than only the most disadvantaged, and the relatively high standard of usual care provided by the UK's comprehensive health visiting service.  80 In this case, a concern with fidelity as the key to effectiveness appears to have overshadowed consideration of how impacts may vary according to features of context, such as population composition and the quality and intensity of treatment as usual, even though the heterogeneity of effects in the earlier trials suggested that factors other than programme fidelity were important sources of variation in effectiveness.\n\nUnderstood as 'events in systems',  6  interventions operate through complicated networks of causal pathways. Even when the importance of context is recognised, identifying and taking account of all of the relevant features of context is difficult. The MEMA kwa Vijana ('Good things for young people') programme, a multicomponent community-based intervention operating through schools and health facilities, was developed to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy among young people in rural Tanzania.  81 A process and outcome evaluation found improved sexual health knowledge, fewer reported sexual partners and more reported condom use, but no reduction in HIV or herpes infection or in pregnancy.  82, 83 The programme designers had tried to address important features of the local context, such as lack of electricity, long distances to understocked health centres, transactional sex, poor training of school teachers, health workers' judgemental attitudes towards adolescent sexual activity, cultural inhibitions about discussing sex, stigmatisation of condom use and opposition to condom education for school pupils. The failure of the programme can be interpreted partly as a consequence of an underestimation of the importance of the wider cultural, social and economic factors, such as women's dependence on men and on earnings from sex work, and partly as the consequences of poverty for the quality of schooling and understanding of reproductive biology.\n\nAnother example of the difficulty of anticipating all of the relevant features of context is the 'Lucky Iron Fish', a small fish-shaped iron ingot placed in a pot while cooking or boiling drinking water. Providing the ingots has been shown to be an effective way to reduce iron deficiency anaemia in women in some communities in rural Cambodia.  84 The intervention was carefully developed to be effective and sustainable in this setting and population. The ingots could be produced locally, at lower cost than conventional nutritional supplements, and making them fish-shaped encouraged uptake because fish are considered lucky by Cambodian villagers. Even so, an earlier trial had found that short-term improvements in iron status were not sustained, because seasonal changes in water supply reduced the dietary availability of iron from the cooking water.  85 A subsequent trial in a different region of Cambodia also found little benefit, because anaemia in this region was primarily due to inherited problems with haemoglobin production, rather than dietary iron deficiency.  86 ese examples illustrate both the importance of a good understanding of context for developing an effective intervention or adapting an existing intervention for a new context and the effort and skill required to address context adequately and identify all of its salient dimensions."

Deciding which dimensions of context need to be included is an exercise in judgement, but any of the dimensions listed in Table  1  may be relevant. To adapt interventions to new contexts, it is useful to compare the old and the new contexts along those dimensions and to focus on those for which there is most discordance. Optimising an intervention known to be effective in one context for implementation in a closely related context may require attention only to features of the new setting or to the characteristics of a different recipient population.

No method is preferable in all cases. Approaches that seek to minimise bias and allow strong causal inference need to be complemented by methods to understand the processes involved and to determine how context specific or generalisable the findings are. Interest in context has been heightened by a number of recent methodological developments in the evaluation of population health interventions, as well as by engagement with social theories, such as those summarised in Box 3. These methodological developments include realist approaches to evaluation, process evaluation and complex causal models linking context, mechanisms and outcomes. In Developing and adapting interventions, we addressed the issue of which aspects of context should be taken into account in the development and adaptation of interventions. Use of an explicit categorisation of context, coupled with a ToC that identifies the key contextual dependencies, is also critical to the evaluation of interventions. In this section we describe ways in which realist approaches, process evaluation and causal models can further help researchers evaluate contextual influences on the implementation and outcomes of population health interventions."

      "text": "Realist approaches to evaluation have focused attention on the importance of context for understanding effectiveness. In a realist framework, interventions are thought to achieve impact through context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations: 'it is not programs that make things change, it is people, embedded in their context who, when exposed to programs, do something to activate given mechanisms, and change'.  1  Although realist evaluation was originally characterised as an alternative to randomised trials, the principles are evident in many trials of complex public health interventions  87  and 'realist trials' have recently been formally proposed as a way of combining the benefits of trials (minimisation of bias, relatively straightforward causal inference) and realist methods (understanding what works for whom, in what circumstances and why).  88 Jamal and colleagues  89  suggest that realist trials have three key stages. The first is to develop a ToC that identifies the CMO configurations through which the intervention is expected to achieve impact. The second is to conduct a qualitative process evaluation to refine the CMO hypotheses. The third is to test the hypotheses formally 'via quantitative analyses of effect mediation (to examine mechanisms) and moderation (to examine contextual contingencies)'.  89 e goal of this approach is to investigate 'which interventions work best for which people and in which settings'.  89  achieve the combination of unbiased estimates of impact and a detailed understanding of how and why impacts vary, Bonell and colleagues  88  suggest that 'a more strategic, co-ordinated approach to testing the effects of interventions and their components in different contexts using consistent measures' is needed. They acknowledge that such co-ordination is rare and that a more 'joined-up' approach to research funding would be required to achieve it. In the meantime, there is a growing number of both trials and non-randomised evaluations that adopt elements of a realist approach, including paying careful attention to context."

Understanding context is central to the Medical Research Council's (MRC) guidance 7 on process evaluation (Figure  2 ), which emphasises the importance of context to understanding the implementation process, mechanisms of impact and outcomes. That guidance emphasises the need to use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to explore all of the relevant interactions, including documentary analysis, stakeholder interviews, qualitative observation and quantitative analysis of hypothesised moderators. The following two examples illustrate how process evaluation can help with the interpretation of effects identified in a trial or a natural experimental evaluation, by identifying features of context associated with variation in effectiveness or uptake of an intervention."

Consideration of context was used to develop the sampling and randomisation strategy, for example to include stratification by factors such as source of funding, size and geographical location, and also to prespecify subgroups for the quantitative analysis of outcomes. The trial showed that the intervention was effective across a wide range of schools but worked particularly well in communities that were served by a single secondary school.\n\nBelaid and Ridde,  92  De Allegri and colleagues  93  and Ridde and colleagues  94  (see Chapter 5, Case study 8) conducted a mixed-methods natural experimental evaluation of Burkina Faso's policy of subsidising the costs of giving birth in a health facility. Quantitative studies showed that the policy led to greater use of health facilities for deliveries and substantially reduced women's health expenditures, but there was wide variation in the extent and timing of improvement within and between districts and health centres. Mixed-methods research to identify contextual factors that could explain variation in uptake found that the quality of local leadership was important and that distance and household income remained significant barriers to the use of health facilities, thereby limiting the reach of the intervention, even when health-care costs were subsidised."

      "title": "Causal modelling",
      "text": "Quantitative analysis of the way that contextual variables can moderate or mediate the effect of an exposure on an outcome is increasingly widely used in epidemiology and has begun to attract attention in PHIR. Contextual variables are typically moderatorsvariables that capture features of the context in which an intervention is implemented that may alter the magnitude or direction of its effects. In the causal chain linking an intervention with outcomes, they occur prior to exposure to the intervention. Mediators are variables that are intermediate between an exposure and an outcome that capture a hypothesised mechanism. However, interaction between the two may also be important: the effect of a mediator may vary according to the values of a moderating variable (moderated mediation) or the effect of a moderating variable may operate through a specific mechanism (mediated moderation). Context may, therefore, be implicated in both mediation and moderation of an intervention's effects.\n\nIn the iConnect  95  and Commuting and Health in Cambridge  96  studies of the impacts of new infrastructure for walking, cycling and public transport on travel and physical activity behaviour (see Chapter 5, Case study 9), Panter and colleagues  96, 97  and Prins and colleagues 98 used path regression to identify which putative causal mechanisms triggered by the interventions were related to and interacted with their context. Rather than specifying and testing a single mediating relationship, the investigators hypothesised a more complex set of causal mechanisms, involving changes in perceptions of the physical and social environments and use of the new routes, as well as constructs of the theory of planned behaviour. They found that the majority of the behaviour change attributable to living closer to the interventions was mediated by use of the new routes rather than changes in cognitions or perceptions.  97, 98 These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that behaviour change can be promoted by altering environmental cues, without explicitly encouraging the target behaviours or directly addressing people's cognitions. As with all mediation analyses, however, the lack of evidence for certain hypothesised causal pathways could also reflect limitations in the sample size available for analysis and in the selection and measurement of the mediator variables.\n\nStratified path regression models were used to identify different causal pathways in groups of people with higher or lower levels of activity prior to the intervention.  97 Analyses also showed how, in a particular context, an intervention could reduce the physical activity of some commuters by shortening the length of their cycle route to work or by increasing the attractiveness of the competing public transport service.  98 n both studies, complementary qualitative and mixed-method analyses elicited plausible causal processes in which altering perceptions of the environment may have been important for triggering behaviour change in different groups and at different intervention sites.  99, 100 These findings helped explain some conflicting findings of the main outcome analyses and helped to interpret them for users in other contexts.\n\nThe ability to quantify the role and mechanisms of action of contextual variables has obvious attractions for understanding how interventions achieve impact and why their impact varies between contexts. However, identifying mediation and moderation requires specialised statistical techniques. The validity of the findings depends on a correct specification of the underlying causal model and accurate measures of all of the relevant variables. These are challenging requirements and, to date, there are few applications of these techniques in PHIR and some controversy over the extent to which they mark a practical advance over more traditional methods.  8, 101 Causal inference in public health often entails making judgements about various assortments of 'ragged evidence' and it would therefore be unwise to rely entirely on a single, statistical method for inferring causal relationships.  102"

Use of a formal categorisation such as that in Table  1  may also be helpful in deciding which features of context an effectiveness study should address. For natural experimental studies, in which intervention development is out of the hands of researchers, it may still be useful to go through the process of considering these dependencies and setting them out in an explicit ToC. Whatever the evaluation design, researchers should be prepared to revise their ToC in the light of study findings, as recommended in Developing and adapting interventions. Although randomised trials conducted within a particular context, by their nature, control for features of that context, realist approaches suggest a number of ways in which context can be taken into account in the design of trials. They include the incorporation of a thorough process evaluation and stratifying the sample to allow preplanned subgroup analyses stratified by context. If it is feasible to measure the key variables comprehensively and accurately, and to specify the underlying causal model correctly, then causal modelling methods may provide additional insights. Evaluation studies incorporating these elements can go beyond providing overall estimates of effectiveness to show how and why implementation and impact vary within the target group and by context."

A more appropriate goal than broad generalisation is to aim for better understanding of the factors driving variation in implementation and effectiveness and the applicability of findings from one context, or range of contexts, to another. Edwards and colleagues  103  and Green and colleagues 104 followed up their natural experimental evaluation of free bus travel for young people with a qualitative study aimed at identifying the contextual factors and other preconditions necessary for the intervention to achieve its effects.\n\nAlthough existing reporting guidelines provide some pointers to how information about context should be presented, there is no equivalent of the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) framework for describing interventions  105  that can be used to guide the reporting of context.

      "text": "Given the importance of interactions with context for understanding the feasibility and effectiveness of population health interventions, it seems unrealistic to expect broad generalisability in the conclusions of a systematic review, in the sense that the findings will be applicable to any context. Even interventions such as smoke-free public places legislation that have been shown to be effective in a range of contexts may have widely varying effects.  113 If there are strong dependencies between intervention and context, an intervention that is beneficial in some contexts may even be harmful in others. A systematic review found that a single course of corticosteroids administered to women at risk of preterm birth could substantially reduce neonatal mortality.  114 All 18 trials included in the meta-analysis were carried out in high-or middle-income countries. The recommendation that steroids be used more widely in preterm births in poorer countries was questioned on the grounds that such births tend to take place outside hospitals, where there is a greater risk of infection. 115 A subsequent large cluster-randomised trial in six LMICs found no reduction in mortality among premature babies when a corticosteroid was used, but an increased risk of neonatal mortality and maternal infections in the intervention clusters.  116 king account of context can help explain systematic review findings, as well as defining the limits of applicability. For a systematic review of welfare-to-work interventions for lone parents, Gibson and colleagues 117 extracted data on the political and economic contexts in which the trials were conducted. Many of the trials included in the review were undertaken at times of welfare retrenchment and favourable labour market conditions. This led to high rates of exit from welfare benefits among control groups, which the authors identified as one reason for the small effects observed in the trials. Although useful, taking account of context in systematic reviews is difficult given the lack of reporting of context in primary studies. Langford and colleagues'  118, 119  Cochrane review of trials of interventions based on the WHO's Health Promoting Schools framework found that only two of the 67 eligible studies reported data on school attainment or attendance or how effects vary according to pupils' gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (see Chapter 5, Case study 10). The review found that process evaluations tended to focus on implementation fidelity, which is just one of three important functions of process evaluation (alongside understanding of context and mechanisms; see Evaluating interventions), with little attention paid to the social, political or cultural contexts in which the interventions were implemented. Despite the substantial number of trials found in the review, there was therefore little useful evidence to support judgements about the applicability of the framework to other countries or contexts.\n\nThe Cochrane Collaboration's 2007 guidance for systematic reviews of public health interventions 120 notes the importance of taking account of context and the weakness of existing reporting practice in primary studies. It recommends that, in the absence of good information about intervention contexts in reports of evaluation studies, reviewers should be cautious about generalising from one context to another, but should note the presence or absence of context-related information to guide interpretation. The guidance sets out a range of questions for reviewers to use in assessing the applicability and transferability of interventions from one policy or practice context to another.\n\nLikewise, Burford and colleagues  25  note that synthesising evidence with reference to context is difficult because of poor reporting in primary studies, but recommend that systematic review authors should provide information on the following aspects of context to enable users to assess the applicability of the evidence to their own decision-making:\n\nl descriptions of study settings (geographical, health system, etc.), time periods and populations l factors affecting intervention implementation identified in the included studies l baseline prevalences of the health issues of interest in the study populations/settings l evidence of differential effects across sociodemographic or other groupings l data from the included studies on the resources required to implement the interventions.\n\nPublic health policy-makers and researchers have expressed frustration with systematic reviews that focus on narrow questions and the application of strict quality assessment criteria at the expense of relevance to decision-making.  121, 122 Methods have been developed to aid the synthesis of evidence from natural or quasi-experimental studies using a range of research designs.  123 Other synthesis approaches such as realist reviews and meta-ethnography can further help address this gap. Realist reviews provide more explanatory evidence by unpacking the mechanism(s) of how and why complex interventions work or do not work, for whom and under which contextual circumstances.  124 Meta-ethnography regards interpretations in primary qualitative research studies as data and relates, translates and synthesises these 'data' sources by following a series of steps.  125 Campo and colleagues 126 conducted a realist review to shed light on how and why unemployment insurance policies impact on poverty and health in different welfare state contexts. To identify the initial theory and mechanisms of action, the authors searched the peer-reviewed and grey literature, but found few relevant articles. Qualitative and quantitative studies that provided in-depth descriptions of mechanisms (i.e. how mechanisms resulted in the outcomes and any related contextual influences) were given more weight. The policy context in each relevant welfare state was explicitly appraised. To supplement the gaps in the literature, the authors conducted key informant interviews with policy-makers, researchers and advocates with knowledge of unemployment insurance policies. This example highlights how a realist review methodology can be rigorously applied to synthesise knowledge from diverse disciplines about upstream policies to reduce inequalities in health with sensitivity to context.\n\nJamal and colleagues 127 conducted a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies to understand the processes whereby the school environment influences the health of young people. They adapted Noblit and Hare's 125 approach to meta-ethnography, extracting relevant data from qualitative studies, including information about context. The authors concluded that schooling shaped young people's health through several levels of context, including state education policies, features of the school setting such as staff-student relationships and the use of surveillance technology and pupils' peer networks and socioeconomic backgrounds.  127 This example highlights how a theory-driven synthesis of qualitative research studies can elucidate context-sensitive findings about how the school environment affects students' health. Further examples of reviews that explore contextual variation in intervention effectiveness include McGill and colleagues' 128 review of socioeconomic inequalities in the impact of healthy eating interventions and Forrest and colleagues' 129 review of socioeconomic inequalities in lung cancer treatment."

There are many useful pointers in existing guidance, but they are thinly spread across a wide range of documents. We have tried to pull together the key insights and frameworks and to illustrate, with real examples, how they can be applied. We recognise that this is a first step and that more work is needed to develop comprehensive guidance. In the meantime, we offer the following recommendations.\n\nResearchers should systematically incorporate considerations of context at all stages of the development and evaluation of PHIR interventions. Use of a comprehensive categorisation of features of context will help to identify those relevant to understanding processes of change. This understanding can be used to develop a ToC and to guide process evaluation, sample design and analysis. Given the difficulty of anticipating all of the relevant interactions between intervention and context, researchers should be prepared to revise their ToC as the evaluation proceeds. Process evaluation, context-specific sampling schemes and subgroup analyses should be standard features of evaluation designs. When effects are expected to vary significantly according to context, samples may be stratified to allow preplanned context-specific subgroup analyses. Reports of intervention studies will be most useful if they identify the contextual factors associated with implementation success or failure and with variation in outcomes and make explicit statements about the applicability or otherwise of the findings to different contexts. Reviews of PHIR should seek to identify the contextual factors of importance in primary studies, use methods that can capture context-specific change processes, constraints and enablers of implementation and draw conclusions about the applicability of findings accordingly.\n\nChanges to the ways that context is considered in PHIR need to be supported by publishers and funders of research. Some of the issues that we have identified are longstanding and improvement is unlikely to come about by the unaided efforts of researchers. Journal editors can help by considering the publication of linked series of papers to help ensure that findings about impacts can be clearly linked to information about context. Journals should emphasise in their guidance for authors and reviewers the requirement for comprehensive and explicit reporting of context. We encourage research funders to recognise the importance of adequately resourced process evaluation and to support replication studies that evaluate intervention effectiveness in novel contexts. Funders should recognise that, in some circumstances, for example when a promising intervention has been tested in only one highly specific context, replication studies may be a more efficient use of funds than research to develop and test novel interventions. Development work for such studies should include explicit consideration of how the new contexts will shape implementation and outcomes and of whether or not and how the intervention will need to be adapted. Funders should also support methodological work on context, including the development of reporting templates to facilitate accurate, comprehensive and systematic reporting of context, approaches to evidence synthesis that can capture contextual variation adequately and modelling methods that can leverage the accumulating evidence on contextual variation to predict the reach, implementation and effectiveness of promising interventions in new contexts.\n\nThese are first steps. A comprehensive understanding of interventions in context implies the adoption of a complex systems perspective. It is no accident that 'rhetoric urging complex systems approaches to public health is only rarely operationalised in ways that generate relevant evidence or effective policies'.  27 ar-reaching changes to the way that PHIR is funded, conducted and published may be needed to implement such approaches, but a better grasp of the range of aspects of context that need to be taken into account, and of the ways that they shape implementation and effectiveness, is a an essential stage of the process."

Over many years, concern has been raised about the consumption of such foods by children, leading to calls for restrictions on their promotion and marketing to children. In 2006, the UK government initiated a process to introduce regulation of the extent of marketing of such foods to children on television by regulating advertising of such foods during programming watched by children. The intervention was developed by the UK television advertising regulator (Ofcom). The regulator developed proposals in consultation with a range of parties, including the food industry and the advertising industry, culminating in a public consultation on specific proposals. The resultant regulations were implemented between 2007 and 2009.\n\nOfcom's own evaluation of the regulation claimed that it had been successful.  51 An independent evaluation of the impacts on children's and adults' exposure to the advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar showed that, although the regulation had led to a reduction of exposure during children's television programmes, there had been an overall increase in exposure, in particular during prime-time television programmes, many of which are watched by children as well as adults.  52 re recent research has explored the strategies used by different stakeholders in responding to the Ofcom consultation and the extent to which these were associated with the final form of the regulations. Food industry responses appeared more likely to have shaped the regulations, whereas those from health interests may have carried less weight (Rizavi S, Adams\n\nJ, White M.

Semistructured interviews with participants and staff, focus groups with participants and observations of delivery during the pilot and full-scale trials were used to explore the extent to which the physical and cultural context of FFiT attracted and engaged high-risk men and supported them in making lifestyle changes to support weight loss.\n\nFootball Fans in Training was effective in achieving weight loss and lifestyle changes at 12 months.  74, 141 elivering FFiT within the physical context of professional football clubs proved successful in attracting men across the socioeconomic spectrum who were at high risk of ill health or future ill health and provided a symbolic and culturally appealing context for these men. Taking part in FFiT in this context with other men who were perceived to have common interests and common physical/health challenges also promoted a relational context in which men were able and willing to assimilate new health information, support each other to make lifestyle changes and renegotiate health practices that were congruent with their daily lives and valued performances of masculinity.  72, 73, 142 FFiT is now routinely implemented in many professional football clubs across the UK and its potential for wider implementation is now being tested in a wide range of other sports and non-sport settings, countries and population groups. How did the research address context?\n\nTrials in which randomisation takes place within a single context cannot identify contextual influences on delivery or outcomes. If sampling and randomisation are stratified by context, such influences can be explored through preplanned subgroup analyses. In this pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial,  90  stratified sampling and randomisation across the trial arms ensured representation of a wide variety of different contexts and enhanced the applicability of the findings. Prespecified subgroup analyses were used to examine differential intervention effects according to important contextual factors. An embedded process evaluation  143, 144  was used to assess how key stakeholders and the target population engaged with the A Stop Smoking in Schools Trial (ASSIST) programme; whether or not the intervention was delivered consistently and how that might be related to context; and whether or not the intervention worked in accordance with its underlying theory."

      "text": "The ASSIST programme was evaluated in a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in 59 schools in south-east Wales and south-west England.  90 Thirty schools were randomised to receive the ASSIST intervention in addition to their usual smoking education provision and 29 schools were randomised to continue with their usual smoking education only. The main outcome measure was weekly smoking at both the school and the individual level.\n\nThe focus on context led to a stratified sampling and randomisation strategy to ensure that a wide variety of schools was recruited, including state and privately funded schools, co-educational and single-sex schools, different-sized schools, Welsh-medium and English-language schools and schools in England and Wales. The quantitative analysis took account of context by including a series of subgroup analyses to explore whether or not the intervention had differential effects. These analyses showed that the intervention worked particularly well in tight-knit communities, such as those in the south Wales valleys, served by a single secondary school where peer supporters were in regular contact with their peers.\n\nThe process evaluation  143, 144  revealed that peer supporters worked in a context-specific way, making pragmatic decisions about which of their peers they would be able to persuade not to take up smoking and focusing their efforts on them. This, and the particular success of the intervention in schools in the Welsh valleys, suggested that the ASSIST programme was working in a way that was consistent with diffusion of innovation theory, which underpinned the intervention design.\n\nCase study 8: a national subsidy policy for birth deliveries in Burkina Faso"

      "text": "This mixed-methods natural experimental evaluation showed that, although the policy increased the use of health facilities, uptake varied widely and inequalities persisted between districts, health centres and women. Contextual factors that affected uptake included household income, distance from a health facility, staff-patient power relations and the effectiveness of local leadership.\n\nThese analyses showed that the majority of the behaviour change attributable to living closer to the interventions was mediated simply by use of the new routesthus, confirming the causal attribution of the main effectsand found little statistical evidence that changes in cognitions or perceptions contributed to mediating of the effects.  97, 98 These findings could be regarded as being consistent with a hypothesis that behaviour change can be promoted by altering environmental cues, without explicitly encouraging the target behaviours or directly addressing people's cognitions. As with all mediation analyses, however, the lack of evidence for certain hypothesised causal pathways could also reflect limitations in the sample size available for analysis and in the selection and measurement of the mediator variables.\n\nCausal inference in public health often entails making judgements about various assortments of 'ragged evidence' and it would therefore be unwise to rely entirely on a single, statistical method for inferring causal relationships.  8, 145, 146 In both studies, for example, complementary qualitative and mixed-method analyses elicited plausible causal processes in which altering perceptions of the environment may have been important for triggering behaviour change in different groups and at different intervention sites (i.e. in different contexts)  99, 100  and stratified path regression models identified different causal pathways in groups of people with higher or lower levels of activity prior to the intervention.  97 Analyses showed howin a particular contextan intervention could reduce the physical activity of some commuters, by shortening the length of their cycle route to work or by increasing the attractiveness of the competing public transport service.  98 age 4: reporting, synthesis and knowledge exchange\n\nCase study 10: a Cochrane systematic review of the World Health Organization health-promoting school framework"

      "text": "The review synthesised evidence from cluster randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of interventions using the Health Promoting Schools framework for improving the health, well-being and educational achievement of school students.  118, 119 xty-seven studies were included in the review. The review found evidence of small intervention effects, indicative of public health benefit, for physical activity, physical fitness, fruit and vegetable intake, BMI, tobacco use and being bullied. There was limited evidence of intervention effectiveness for standardised body mass index (zBMI) and none for fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, mental health, violence and bullying others. Only two studies conducted cost-effectiveness evaluations. Data on academic attainment was rarely collected and so the review could not come to any conclusion about the impact of Health Promoting Schools interventions on this important outcome.\n\nThe review drew attention to important aspects of context missing from the included studies and made recommendations about this should be addressed in future. Strikingly, although the context for these interventions was school, only two studies reported outcome data on school attainment or attendance, even though such data are likely to influence any decision to scale up implementation of Health Promoting Schools interventions. Process evaluations tended to be dominated by issues of implementation fidelity and, to a lesser extent, acceptability, with few considering the social, cultural or political contexts surrounding implementation, making judgements about the extent to which interventions would be transferable to other countries and school contexts difficult. Only eight included studies had been conducted in LMICs. Very few studies assessed the impact of interventions according to important equity criteria such as gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
