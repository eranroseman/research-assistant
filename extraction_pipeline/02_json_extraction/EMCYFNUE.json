  "abstract": "pilepsy, one of the most common chronic neurological diseases, affects 50 million people around the world, 1 including about 9 million people in China. 2  The current management of epilepsy needs to be improved. 3,4  In an earlier study, we described an intervention package that enhanced medical compliance and improved seizure control in patients with epilepsy in resource-poor rural communities. 5  Given the widespread use of smartphones, mobile phone applications (apps) and online communities have emerged as tools for managing some chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. [6] [7] 7] [8] [9]  We have previously established that people in China with epilepsy and their caregivers are willing to use smartphone apps.  [10] [11] 1] [12]  As there have been few investigations of the feasibility and efficacy of epilepsy-specific apps in resource-poor countries, we developed and undertook the preliminary validation of the Chinese Epilepsy Self-Management Scale (C-ESMS) for assessing the quality of self-management.  13 e also designed an app prototype and enrolled participants to test its practicability and effectiveness in a pilot study, the results of which we report in this article. \n Methods The primary research question was whether a practical intervention based upon a smartphone application (app) would improve self-management and improve seizure control in adults with epilepsy. \n Trial setting and participants Our study was undertaken in Chengdu, western China. People with epilepsy were consecutively recruited at the Epilepsy Center of the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Epilepsy was diagnosed in accordance with the recent International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria.  14 We included adult patients (more than 18 but less than 60 years of age) with epilepsy of more than one year's duration who had had more than three seizures during the 6 months preceding recruitment; participants also needed to reside in the study area, be proficient in the use of smartphones, and have provided written consent to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were severe intellectual and developmental impairment, neurologic disease, psychosis, or other severe medical conditions (eg, tumours, fractures); illiteracy or mental incompetence; and current participation in another research project. \n Trial design and procedure (randomisation and blinding) The trial was undertaken between December 2017 and August 2018; participants were recruited between December 2017 and February 2018. A total of 612 people from the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital epilepsy registry database were assessed for eligibility; 380 (62.1%) met our criteria for participation and were enrolled and assigned to the app and control groups (1:1) using permuted blocked randomisation. One investigator (YN) generated block randomisation sequences (block size of four); one of the block",

At 6 months, the mean overall C-ESMS score for the app group was significantly higher than that for the control group (125.4 [SD, 1.5]; P < 0.001). The proportion of patients who were seizure-free at the 6-month follow-up was larger for the app than the control group (54 of 190, 28% v 22 of 190, 12%), as was the proportion with reductions in frequency of between 75 and 100% (22 of 190, 12% v 8 of 190, 4%).

Each participant of a particular age and sex was randomised to the app or control group and the next enrolee with the same characteristics was automatically assigned to the other group. To minimise the predictability of the allocation process, the randomisation sequence was concealed from all investigators until all patients had been assigned (Box 1).\n\nBaseline demographic information, clinical characteristics, C-ESMS score, and baseline seizure frequency (most recent 6 months) were collected in face-to-face interviews prior to randomisation. After randomisation, the participants were observed for 6 months, after which final evaluations of C-ESMS score and seizure frequency were undertaken. Before the intervention commenced, the participants in the app group were trained by a staff member in how to use the app; the participants in the control group received only a routine clinic consultation. Participants in the control group were asked to report their seizure frequency each month by phone call, email, or in person at the clinic. The seizure frequency of participants in the app group was recorded by online self-report in the app and confirmed by the same methods as for the control group. All participants were asked to complete the C-ESMS at the end of the 6-month follow-up in face-to-face interviews in the clinic. The study schedule (intervention allocation) was not revealed to the research staff who collected and analysed the data; participants were asked to not reveal their allocation to the interviewer who undertook their follow-up assessments."

We undertook both intention-to-treat and per protocol (completer) analyses; in the intention-to-treat analyses, we assumed no change for participants who did not complete the follow-up assessments.\n\nFactors associated with changes in C-ESMS score were assessed by linear regression, including demographic (sex, age, education level), clinical (seizure frequency, C-ESMS scores), and app activities as variables; association between changes in seizure frequency and C-ESMS score was assessed by Spearman rank correlation. P < 0.01 (Bonferroni-adjusted) was deemed statistically significant for comparisons of scores on the five C-ESMS subscales; for all other comparisons; P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.\n\nIn accordance with an earlier publication  16  and our pilot baseline data, a sample size of 150 subjects in each group was adequate for detecting a change in C-ESMS score of 6 points (C-ESMS standard deviation, 15 points) with 90% power (two-tailed \u03b1 = 0.05; \u03b2 = 0.1)."

      "text": "Supporting self-management by people with chronic diseases facilitates expanding the provision of health care from doctors to the patients themselves.  17 Clinic-based mobile health decision support for enhancing self-management by adults with epilepsy  18  and WebEase, an online epilepsy self-management program that assists people with medications, managing stress, and improving sleep quality, have been described in the literature;  19  an internet-based psychosocial intervention was reported to have improved self-management and self-efficacy in American veterans with epilepsy.  16 Our findings suggest that a mobile phone app can have a substantial effect on epilepsy selfmanagement and may reduce seizure frequency.\n\nThere were no important baseline differences between the intervention and control groups that would have influenced our results. All patients in our study had experienced at least three seizures during the preceding six months. A positive effect of app use on seizure frequency was expected, although some participants had drug-resistant epilepsy, which may have reduced the efficacy of the intervention. Further, most of our participants were younger people (under 50 years of age), a group more likely to be willing to use mobile phone apps.\n\nThe 6-month C-ESMS completion rate (86%) was higher than for similar studies (about 40%).  16, 20, 21 Possible explanations include the fact that eligible participants were carefully enrolled and supervised during follow-up; a recent uncontrolled seizure may motivate a patient to attend follow-up; a friendly doctor-patient relationship was developed during the clinical consultations; and most of our participants were well educated younger patients who had agreed to participate in the study and were therefore inclined to adhere to the treatment program. However, satisfaction with outpatient management and with the app were not formally assessed.\n\nStatistically significant improvements in self-efficacy and selfmanagement measures in American veterans with epilepsy were achieved with an online psychosocial intervention over six weeks (POEM study);  16  another recent study similarly reported that an epilepsy self-management program improved ESMS scores.  22 In our study, self-management, as assessed by C-ESMS scores, also improved for patients using the app, but the magnitude of the change was considerably greater than in earlier studies. One possible explanation might be the lower baseline scores in our study. Whereas the greatest improvement reported in the POEM study was in the domain of information management,  16  we also found statistically significant improvements in medications and safety management. These differences may have several reasons: the lower baseline C-ESMS scores in our study allowed greater increases during the intervention; the app intervention included a component of active patient engagement that strengthened medical compliance, rather than passively providing educational materials alone; and the younger age of our participants may have been associated with better acceptance of the app and more active participation.\n\nWith regard to specific app functions (see Supporting Information for item numbers), the medication calendar may improve information (item 7), seizure (11, 15), and medication management (16,   24, 27, 28, 30); the online educational forums and blogs component could improve lifestyle (2, 13, 14, 18, 22, 33), safety (6, 17, 23, 29, 34, 36), medication (8, 9), and seizure management (10, 32); prompt online reports of seizure attack and consultation could improve information (1, 3, 5), seizure (12), safety (31), and medication management (25); and the online survey questionnaires component could help assess other user characteristics, such as mood state and sleep quality.\n\nAlthough no association between improved C-ESMS score and reduced seizure frequency was found, short term seizure amelioration in the app management group was apparent. It is probable that improved self-management had an effect on seizure control, as many C-ESMS factors are relevant to seizure recurrence. Epilepsy is a complex disorder: the effects of quality of life and factors such as emotion on the predisposition to\n\n3 Outcomes at 6-month follow-up for participants in the intervention (app) and control groups: intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (completer, PP) analyses Outcomes App group Control group P Chinese Epilepsy Self-Management Scale (C-ESMS) score, mean (SD) Total score (ITT) 144.4 (10.0) 125.4 (11.5) < 0.001 Total score (PP) 146.6 (5.9) 125.6 (11.5) < 0.001 Subscales Information management (ITT) 20.7 (2.8) 14.8 (4.9) < 0.001 Information management (PP) 21.2 (1.6) 14.5 (4.9) < 0.001 Lifestyle management (ITT) 21.3 (3.3) 19.9 (3.9) < 0.001 Lifestyle management (PP) 21.5 (3.2) 19.9 (3.9) < 0.001 Medication management (ITT) 47.1 (2.8) 40.7 (3.0) < 0.001 Medication management (PP) 47.8 (1.5) 40.9 (3.0) < 0.001 Safety management (ITT) 32.0 (2.8) 27.1 (3.2) < 0.001 Safety management (PP) 32.6 (1.5) 27.3 (3.0) < 0.001 Seizure management (ITT) 23.4 (3.2) 22.8 (4.1) 0.17 Seizure management (PP) 23.5 (3.1) 23.0 (4.0) 0.19 Reduction of seizure frequency (ITT) < 0.001 100% 54 (28%) 22 (12%) \u2265 75% and < 100% 22 (12%) 8 (4%) \u2265 50% and < 75% 21 (11%) 60 (32%) < 50% 93 (49%) 100 (53%) Reduction of seizure frequency (PP) < 0.001 100% 54 (31%) 22 (15%) \u2265 75% and < 100% 22 (12%) 8 (5%) \u2265 50% and < 75% 21 (12%) 60 (40%) < 50% 79 (45%) 61 (40%)\n\nseizure recurrence deserve investigation. Moreover, our participant group included people with drug-resistant epilepsy, which may have influenced our results. Overall improved seizure control in the intervention group may be related to a number of app functions that encourage constant engagement with selfmanagement and communication between patient and doctor. Indeed, it may not be the app per se that achieved improved outcomes, but rather that patients were invited to use the app in this manner."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "The randomised controlled design minimised confounding by extraneous factors, so that comparing the two groups did not require complex statistical analyses. Nevertheless, our study had several limitations. First, the demographic characteristics of the participants may not reflect those of all people with epilepsy in western China; we selected smartphone users, skewing our selection to younger people. Second, the primary outcomes were based on self-report, which could increase information bias; further, if interviewees unintentionally exposed their allocation, the blinded nature of the study would be compromised. Third, follow-up may not have been long enough to gauge longer term changes. Fourth, the app focused on medication use rather than other health behaviours or psychological factors such as stress and depressive symptoms. Fifth, determining which app functions contributed more to the measured outcomes will require its refinement and analysis."
