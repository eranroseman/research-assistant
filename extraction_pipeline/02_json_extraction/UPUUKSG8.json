  "title": "Accuracy of Blood Pressure Measurement Devices in Pregnancy A Systematic Review of Validation Studies",
  "abstract": "H ypertension is one of the most common medical disor- ders complicating pregnancy, occurring in up to 10% of pregnancies.  1  Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension.  1 omplications associated with hypertension in pregnancy include placental abruption, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, maternal death secondary to stroke and eclampsia, as well as future risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  Blood pressure (BP) control is recommended to help prevent maternal-fetal adverse outcomes.  1, 7 However, the optimal BP goal for pregnant women with hypertension is uncertain.  8 Prior and ongoing randomized trials are investigating the effect of more intensive BP control in pregnant women with hypertension.  7, 9 Because hemodynamic and vascular changes occur during pregnancy, guidelines recommend validating BP measurement devices in pregnant women.  10, 11 he Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (ANSI/AAMI/ISO), British Hypertension Society (BHS), and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) have published protocols to validate BP measurement devices and ensure that their accuracy is comparable to the reference standard, a mercury sphygmomanometer.  [10] [11] 1] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]  These protocols were developed to standardize the procedures for validating BP devices,  17, 18  and strict adherence to an individual protocol is necessary for accuracy and statistical validity.  19 iven the importance of measuring BP accurately in pregnancy, we undertook a systematic review of published studies assessing the validity of ambulatory, home, and clinic BP measurement devices in pregnant women to evaluate the methodology and quality of the published validation data. Abstract-The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) in pregnancy is essential to guide medical decision making that affects both mother and fetus. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the accuracy of ambulatory, home, and clinic BP measurement devices in pregnant women. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL EBSCO, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and dabl from inception through August 3, 2017 for articles that assessed the validity of an upper arm BP measurement device against a mercury sphygmomanometer in pregnant women. Two independent investigators determined eligibility, extracted data, and adjudicated protocol violations. From 1798 potential articles identified, 41, that assessed 28 devices, met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (n=32) followed a standard or modified American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization, British Hypertension Society, or European Society of Hypertension validation protocol. Several articles described the results of validation studies performed on >1 device (n=7) or in >1 population of pregnant women (n=12), comprising 64 pairwise validity assessments. The device was validated in 61% (32 of 52) of studies which used a standard or modified protocol. Only 34% (11 of 32) of the studies wherein the device was successfully validated were performed without a protocol violation. Given the implications of inaccurate BP measurement in pregnant women, healthcare providers should be aware of and try to use the BP measurement devices which have been properly validated in this population.

      "text": "Two reviewers (N.A. Bello and J.J. Woolley) independently abstracted all data using standardized data abstraction forms. The data extraction results were compared and discrepancies were resolved by a third investigator (D. Shimbo). Information was extracted on sample size, trimester of pregnancy, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) at study entry, and arm circumference, as well as the validation protocol(s) used and specific procedures followed during the protocol, including details on (1) the BP device being evaluated; (2) the arm used for measurement by the device and reference; (3) the sequence of device and reference measurements; (4) the number of BP comparisons between the device and reference obtained; (5) the timing of observer comparisons (sequential versus simultaneous); and (6)  final SBP and DBP validation grades for the device. The device type (ambulatory, home, clinic, and home/clinic) was based on the authors' reported description. If the authors did not specify the device type, it was categorized based on other authors' classification or the device manufacturer's specification. If an article reported the validation of >1 device, or 1 device in >1 population of pregnant women (eg, those with and without preeclampsia), the results are reported separately for each device and population. For the purposes of this systematic review, a population is defined as a unique group of pregnant women described in an article which had data on BP and validation grade. A study is defined as the testing of a BP device within a population."

There has been controversy and a lack of consensus on whether K4 or K5 should be used to define DBP in pregnancy.  22 Consistent with the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy, we chose to use K5, the point at which all Korotkoff sounds disappear, to define DBP in the current study.  23 Several articles report both K4 and K5 as DBP. In this situation, DBP is presented as K5. There were 2 studies in which only K4 was reported as DBP.  24, 25"

In addition to extracting the authors' reported SBP and DBP grade for the devices, we independently determined the SBP and DBP grades for each device using data in the published articles. Similar to the classification system used to examine BP devices in other reviews, protocol violations were adjudicated and classified as major or minor, as defined in Table  S1  in the online-only Data Supplement.  18, 26, 27 In some articles, the authors report additional grades based on a second validation protocol. In this situation, we extracted the reported SBP and DBP grade for each device and independently adjudicated grades. For articles that used a nonstandard protocol to perform the validation study including 2 for which only K4 was reported for DBP,  24, 25  no grades or violations are reported."

      "text": "In this systematic review, we found that the majority of BP measurement devices passed a validation protocol in pregnant women, but that only one-third of these devices did so without any protocol violations. The most common major protocol violation was the inclusion of too few pregnant women when a population was examined, so that too few comparisons were obtained between the device and the reference standard. The most common minor violations were related to arm circumference and SBP and DBP ranges. Of the 11 categories of protocol violations, only 2 did not occur: the use of the same/opposite arm (major) for device and reference standard, and inclusion of at least 10 women in each of the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (minor).\n\nAlthough not considered a violation, in 1 article  31  the authors followed a modified BHS 1990 protocol,  16  but evaluated the results using grading criteria from the BHS 1993 protocol.  10, 15 The BHS 1993 protocol is more lenient than the 1990 BHS protocol, requiring fewer participants, examining a narrower range of BP, and requiring less stringent grading criteria to pass validation. Additionally, all studies which undertook the 1993 BHS protocol 10 reported a letter grade for SBP and DBP despite the recommendation that grading should not be attempted in special groups such as pregnant women.\n\nSubstantial hemodynamic changes occur during pregnancy, including increased blood volume, stroke volume, heart rate, and consequently cardiac output along with a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance  67, 68  Thus, guidelines recommend BP devices intended for use in pregnant women should be validated in this population.  10, 11 Accurate measurement of BP enables the timely diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.  68 However, it is important to note that although validation protocols provide reassurance that a device has been validated for use in a population, the device is not necessarily accurate in all individuals. When possible, devices should be tested against a traditional sphygmomanometer in individual patients to confirm accuracy before clinical use. Obstetric guidelines 1 suggest frequent monitoring of BP in the clinic and at home for pregnant women with poorly controlled BP and those at high risk of developing preeclampsia. Preeclampsia, the concurrent development of elevated BP after 20 weeks of gestation accompanied by proteinuria or organ dysfunction, is a significant contributor to maternalfetal morbidity and mortality.  23 In light of the evidence that the treatment of preeclampsia can reduce maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently updated its preeclampsia screening guideline to recommend BP measurements be obtained during each prenatal care visit (grade B).  70, 71  Several devices have undergone validation studies (n=17) among pregnant women with preeclampsia. These included 4 studies of ambulatory BP monitors,  39, 54, 65  8 studies of home BP devices,  32, 33, 35, 44, 57, 63  and 5 studies of clinic BP devices.  33, 36, 42, 57, 62 Of these studies, no ambulatory device passed validation; 5 of the home devices (Microlife 3BTO-A,  63  Microlife WatchBP Home,  32  Omron M7 and MIT,  35  and Omron MIT Elite  33  ), and 3 clinic devices (Dinamap ProCare 400,  36  Omron MIT,  42  and Omron MIT Elite  33  ), the latter 2 of Table 2.

None of the 17 studies testing ambulatory, home, or clinic BP devices among pregnant women with preeclampsia was performed without a protocol violation. The finding that many studies wherein devices were validated had protocol violations is consistent with published studies conducted in nonpregnant women and men.  18, 27, 72, 73 n a systematic review of BP devices validated using the ESH-IP, Stergiou et al  18  found protocol violations in 23 of 78 studies. Similarly, Hodgkinson et al  27  found that of 28 validation studies of ambulatory devices performed in a general adult population, 42%, 11%, and 0% that followed the ESH-IP, AAMI, and BHS, respectively, adhered to the specified protocol without violations. The proper execution of a BP device validation study with strict adherence to the specified protocol is a complex undertaking with several opportunities for violation which may lead to improper performance and result in a detrimental effect on the study's power.  74 All violations, whether classified as major or minor,  18, 27  have the potential to effect the results of a validation study, and when noted the results of a validation study should be interpreted with caution.\n\nStandardized validation protocols (AAMI, BHS, and ESH-IP) were developed to demonstrate statistical equivalence between new devices and the gold standard mercury sphygmomanometer.  19 Although the ESH-IP was designed to simplify validation studies and has been the most widely used protocol since 2006 among nonpregnant women and men,  18  some have questioned whether it is sufficiently powered to demonstrate equivalence.  18, 19 In the current systematic review, 3 articles (testing 4 devices)  28, 57, 58  used the ESH-IP as the primary validation protocol. The BPLab ambulatory monitor  28  was the only 1 of the 4 devices to pass the ESH-IP in pregnant women. The Microlife 3BTO-A, Omron M7, and Welch Allyn Vital Signs 300 failed the ESH-IP validation.  57, 58 ngoing efforts by an AAMI-ESH-ISO collaboration to create a standardized sufficiently powered universal protocol that will replace all previous protocols should simplify the performance and analysis of future device validation studies among both nonpregnant and pregnant populations.  74  strength of the current study is the use of a comprehensive search strategy of multiple databases and websites and the manual review of reference lists of all included articles, without limitations on language. Additionally, we evaluated the available validation data on ambulatory, home, and clinic devices. Data from systematic reviews of the validation of BP devices in pregnant women are sparse, and the results of our study address important knowledge gaps in this area.\n\nTable 4.

First, we excluded studies (n=18) that used a reference device other than a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (Table  S4 ). Although this approach may exclude potentially important studies, the majority of validation protocols require mercury sphygmomanometer as the reference standard,  10, 11, 15, 16  with the exception being the ANSI/AAMI/ ISO which has an alternative direct intra-arterial reference option.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  Second, we cannot exclude the possibility of publication bias. Although we found many published studies describing device validation failures, there may be situations in which validation failures were not published. Additionally, although several studies tested the same device, we did not attempt to perform a meta-analysis because of the small number of studies in which these devices were validated without protocol violations. Last, for the 11 studies that followed a nonstandard validation protocol,  24, 25, 29, 30, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53]  we were unable to adjudicate grades or assess violations and cannot comment on the validity of the devices examined. The majority of devices included in this review were oscillometric and use proprietary algorithms to calculate SBP and DBP. Without knowledge of the algorithms, further evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the performance of an individual device compared with another is limited."

Of the 28 devices examined, 2 ambulatory devices (BP Lab  28  and Welch Allyn QuietTrak 60 ), 2 home devices (Microlife WatchBP Home  32  and Omron MIT  35  ), 4 clinic BP devices (A&D UM-101,  34  Dinamap ProCare 400,  36  Nissei DS-400,  37  and Omron HEM907  34  ), and 1 home/clinic device (Omron MIT Elite  33  ) passed a validation study in at least 1 population of pregnant women without any protocol violations. As results from validation studies not adhering to the protocol specifications or those without sufficient power cannot be assumed to be valid, future validation studies of devices in pregnant women are needed to ensure the accurate measurement of BP in pregnancy.\n\nGiven the potential consequences of inaccurate BP measurement in pregnant women, healthcare providers should use BP devices that have been proven accurate and valid in this population."
