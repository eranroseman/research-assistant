  "title": "Fetal growth restriction and risk of cerebral palsy in singletons born after at least 35 weeks' gestation",
  "abstract": "The objective of the study was to improve the understanding of etiological paths to cerebral palsy (CP) that include fetal growth restriction by examining factors associated with growth restriction that modify CP risk. \n STUDY DESIGN: In a total population of singletons born at or after 35 weeks, there were 493 children with CP and 508 matched controls for whom appropriateness of fetal growth could be estimated. Fetal growth was considered markedly restricted if birthweight was more than 2 SD below optimal for gender, gestation, maternal height, and parity. We examined maternal blood pressure in pregnancy, smoking, birth asphyxia, and major birth defects recognized by age 6 years as potential modifiers of CP risk in growth-restricted births. RESULTS: More than 80% of term and late preterm markedly growthrestricted singletons were born following a normotensive pregnancy and were at statistically significantly increased risk of CP (odds ratio, 4.81; 95% confidence interval, 2.7e8.5), whereas growth-restricted births following a hypertensive pregnancy were not. Neither a clinical diagnosis of birth asphyxia nor potentially asphyxiating birth events occurred more frequently among growth-restricted than among appropriately grown infants with CP. Major birth defects, particularly cerebral defects, occurred in an increasing proportion of CP with increasing growth deficit. The factor most predictive of CP in growthrestricted singletons was a major birth defect, present in 53% of markedly growth-restricted neonates with later CP. Defects observed in CP were similar whether growth restricted or not, except for an excess of isolated congenital microcephaly in those born growth restricted. The highest observed CP risk was in infants with both growth restriction and a major birth defect (8.9% of total CP in this gestational age group, 0.4% of controls: odds ratio, 30.9; 95% confidence interval, 7.0e136). \n CONCLUSION: The risk of CP was increased in antenatally growthrestricted singletons born at or near term to normotensive mothers. In growth-restricted singletons, a major birth defect was the dominant predictor, associated with a 30-fold increase in odds of CP. Identification of birth defects in the growth-restricted fetus or neonate may provide significant prognostic information.",

      "text": "S uboptimal fetal growth is associated with a heightened risk of a range of adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including antenatal or neonatal death, neonatal encephalopathy, perinatal stroke, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. The association of fetal growth restriction (FGR) with cerebral palsy (CP) has been especially robust.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Defined as a birthweight greater than 2 SD below optimal, FGR contributes a larger proportion of CP in term and late preterm singletons than do potentially asphyxial birth events or inflammation or a combination of those risk factors.  9 ch of the literature has considered FGR as a unitary entity, varying chiefly in severity and gestational duration at onset. The etiology of FGR is known to be varied, however,  10  and some reports distinguish growth deficit arising in normotensive from that in hypertensive pregnancies.  [11] [12] ] [13]  Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), which includes preeclampsia, is a recognized antecedent of growth deficit and an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and fetal loss, but it is not clear whether PIH is an important antecedent of CP in FGR births. Maternal smoking is the most frequent antecedent of FGR in population studies,  14  but whether it influences CP risk differently from FGR associated with other antecedents is not known.\n\nGiven the paucity of information on whether differing antecedents of FGR influence neurological outcome, we examined the data of a large populationbased study of births from 1980 to 1995 for a relationship between CP with FGR and its major known risk factors: PIH, smoking, acute asphyxial birth, and major birth defects. We focused on singleton births after at least 35 weeks' gestation because, although they contribute to 75% of all CP, their outcomes have received less attention and because the rates of term and late preterm CP have not changed since these data were collected."

      "text": "The population-based case-control study providing the data for this report was designed to investigate factors associated with risk of CP,  9, [15] [16] [17]  defined as a disorder of movement and/or posture and motor function because of a nonprogressive interference/lesion or abnormality of the developing brain. Persons registered with the Western Australian Register of Developmental AnomalieseCerebral Palsy 18 were selected if born between Jan. 1, 1980, and Dec. 31, 1995, excluding those whose CP was acquired postneonatally or resulted in minimal motor impairment.\n\nControls and perinatal deaths were selected from the 380,918 births between 1980 and 1995 registered on the Maternal Child Health Research Database, which links statutory birth and death registries with statutory pregnancy and delivery information and includes more than 99.5% of registered births in Western Australia. Neonatally surviving controls not registered as CP were individually matched to CP cases for gestational age (within 1 week), date of birth (within 12 months), and plurality. Representative samples of intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal deaths (live births dying within 28 days) were selected by taking 7 and 4 year birth cohorts, respectively,  9  distributed within the 1980-1995 period.\n\nInformation was sought concerning pregnancy, delivery, neonatal, family, and maternal obstetric history from medical records of the hospitals of delivery and neonatal care and private obstetricians or general practitioners who provided antenatal care. These data were recorded by trained midwives or neonatal nurses.  16 Analyses of FGR included singleton births and focused on children with CP and controls born after at least 35 weeks' gestation.\n\nAppropriateness of fetal growth was assessed with the proportion of optimal birthweight (POBW). This method compares the index birthweight with the median estimated weight of fetuses of the same gestational age subsequently live born at term to women without recorded exposure to common factors known to affect fetal growth and of the same height and parity as the index mother.  14, 19 etal growth was categorized as mild if POBW was less than 85% (about the 10th percentile of all Western Australian live births) and marked if POBW was 77.3% or less (2 SD below the median of the optimally grown population, approximately the fifth percentile of all Western Australian live births) or, to minimize false-negative results, had been diagnosed neonatally as growth restricted.\n\nPIH was defined as blood pressure reaching or exceeding 140/90 mm Hg, a systolic rise of 20 mm Hg, or a diastolic rise of 15 mm Hg during pregnancy. As found with other adverse perinatal outcomes,  20  the presence of proteinuria did not affect the risk of CP associated with PIH and was not considered further.\n\nWomen were classified as smokers in pregnancy if they were reported to smoke after 20 weeks' gestation; this datum was missing for about one-third of study subjects. The number of cigarettes smoked daily before and after 20 weeks' gestation was also recorded if available (83% of smokers). Alcohol and recreational drug use was noted if recorded, but gross underreporting is likely.\n\nData concerning defects present at birth and recognized at any time before 6 years of age were obtained by linking with the Western Australian Register of Developmental AnomalieseBirth Defects,  21  which records up to 10 diagnoses of birth defects together with the age at which each diagnosis was made. For this analysis birth defects were categorized hierarchically as cerebral defects; cardiac defects; other major defects; and deformational defects and minor defects (which included cosmetic defects and those unlikely to affect physical quality of life). Major defects excluded exclusively minor defects. Because CP is defined by motor disorders not present at birth, it was not considered a birth defect. Recorded teratogenic exposures and chromosomal or genetic defects were classified separately.\n\nSentinel events were defined as intrapartum events likely to enhance the potential for fetal asphyxia and included significant intrapartum hemorrhage, cord prolapse, uterine rupture, a tight nuchal cord, shoulder dystocia, and maternal collapse. A clinical diagnosis of birth asphyxia or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in the medical record was noted.\n\nThe risks of CP were estimated for each growth, PIH, and maternal smoking stratum for singleton births after at least 35 weeks of gestation. Associations were sought between CP within high-risk strata for major birth defects, sentinel events, a clinical diagnosis of birth asphyxia, and recreational drug use."

There were 493 singleton children with CP, 508 matched controls, and 176 perinatal deaths born at 35 weeks' gestational age or later and 167 singleton children with CP, 148 matched controls, and 319 perinatal deaths born before 35 weeks for whom appropriateness of growth could be assessed.\n\nOne quarter of controls (25.9%), 22.9% of CP, and 14.9% of perinatal deaths who were classified as markedly growth restricted were so classified on the basis of a neonatal diagnosis of growth restriction and did not have a birthweight more than 2 SD below their estimated optimal. Five of the 19 CP thus categorized infants were diagnosed as congenitally hydrocephalic. For the others, weight was either low relative to length, particularly in CP, or, more rarely, the length was low relative to the head circumference. With the exception of 2 CP infants with marked congenital hydrocephaly, all had birthweights below their estimated optimal.\n\nAssociation of FGR with risk of CP In term and late preterm infants, the odds of CP for those with marked FGR were increased almost 9-fold compared with infants of appropriate birthweight for gestational age (AGA) (odds ratio [OR], 4.16; 95% confidence [CI], 2.5e6.8). mild FGR there was no significant increase in CP risk (Table  1 ).\n\nNormotensive and hypertensive FGR Among markedly FGR singletons, about half of controls and children with CP born before 35 weeks, but a much larger proportion of controls, 81% (22 of 27), CP, 88% (69 of 78), and 71% (34 of 48) perinatal deaths born at or after 35 weeks, experienced normotensive pregnancies (Figure  1 ). Marked FGR in normotensive gravidae was associated with statistically significantly increased risk of CP, whereas that in hypertensive gravidae was not (Table  1 ). In AGA neonates born of hypertensive pregnancies, there was a relatively small elevation of CP risk of marginal statistical significance.\n\nThus, the large majority of term and late preterm infants with marked FGR who developed CP were products of normotensive pregnancies."

      "title": "Maternal smoking",
      "text": "Maternal smoking data were missing for 34.6% of controls, 33.3% of CP, and 26.3% of perinatal deaths. In those with available data, there was no increase in CP risk associated with maternal smoking that was not accompanied by marked FGR (Table  1 ).\n\nTo test the hypothesis that the marked growth restriction in CP births to smoking mothers resulted from greater exposure to cigarette smoke, we compared the quantities smoked between those with marked and those with mild or no growth restriction. The mothers of CP births and perinatal deaths with marked growth restriction did not smoke more than those with mild or no growth restriction: mean (SE) of the number of cigarettes smoked daily after 20 weeks' gestation was 12.2 (1.2) in those with a marked restriction and 13.3 (1.0) in those without. This suggests that the excess of markedly FGR infants born to smoking mothers of CP births and perinatal deaths may be attributable to some characteristic of the woman or her environment that is associated with smoking in pregnancy rather than with smoking itself. Substance abuse and social disadvantage are possible candidates for a factor associated with smoking in pregnancy that raises risk for adverse outcome. In those with nonmissing data, as anticipated, alcohol use was associated with smoking: in controls (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8e6.9), CP (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0e3.9), and perinatal deaths (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2e9.9). Fetal alcohol syndrome was identified in 4 CP cases (and no controls), 2 of whom were known to be born to smoking but none of whom met criteria for either mild or marked FGR.\n\nRecreational drug use (primarily heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, and marijuana) was prospectively reported for 8 of 293 controls (2.7%), 16 of 300 CP (5.3%), and 6 of 122 perinatal deaths (4.9%) and was also associated with smoking but more strongly in CP (OR, 17.9; 95% CI 4e80) than in controls (OR, 3; 95% CI, 0.7e12) or perinatal deaths (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.5e13). Five of seven CP but only 1 of 6 perinatal deaths born to women who smoked and were reported to use recreational drugs were markedly FGR.\n\nOf the total of 28 CP, 4 controls and 10 perinatal deaths who were both markedly FGR and born to mothers known to smoke, major birth defects were observed in 18 of the 28 CP but no control or perinatal death. Excluding 2 CP infants with congenital TORCH infection (toxoplasmosis, other [hepatitis B], rubella [German measles], cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus) (and no reported recreational drug use), the distribution of the type of defects in the 4 for whom recreational drug use was reported was similar to the 12 for whom it was not, with half of each group sustaining a cerebral defect."

Figure  2  also shows the increasing proportion, particularly of cerebral defects, with an increasing growth deficit in CP, whereas in controls the sole cerebral defect was seen in an AGA birth. The proportions with defects were similar between CP with and without marked FGR for cardiac defects (w3%) and male genital defects (w2.3%), lower in the markedly FGR CP for deformational defects (1 of 83 [1.2% in FGR] vs 12 of 410 [2.9%]) and higher for cerebral defects (26 of 83 [31.3%] vs 79 of 410 [19.3%]) and other major defects (12 of 83 [14.5%] vs 33 of 410 [8.1%]).\n\nWe accepted registered microcephaly as a birth defect only if it was diagnosed at birth with a head circumference more than 3 SD below the optimal or a proportion of the optimal head circumference at least 0.5 SD below the z-score for proportion of optimal birth length and weight. The only individual defect to occur statistically significantly more frequently in CP with FGR than without was congenital microcephaly in the absence of recognized cerebral structural defects (9 of 83 [10.8%] in FGR vs 2 of 410 [0.5%]; OR, 30.9, 95% CI, 7.0e136).\n\nTeratogenic exposures, probably underestimated on the birth defects register, were reported more often in CP following marked FGR (8.4% [4 congenital CMV, 1 congenital rubella, 1 valproate, and 1 recreational polydrug use]) than following mild FGR (4.7% [4 CMV]) or AGA (2.8% [5 CMV, 4 alcohol]). Genetic or chromosomal defects were found more often in CP following marked FGR (13.25%) and following mild FGR (11.8%) than following AGA birth (5.2%). Thus, recognized teratogenic or genetic factors preceded 21.7% of CP born markedly FGR, 16.4% of CP born mildly FGR, and 8.3% of CP born AGA."

      "title": "COMMENT",
      "text": "The major observations of this study are that at or near term, FGR occurs chiefly in normotensive pregnancies, that it is in this group that CP risk is increased, and that the dominant risk factor for CP in FGR singletons in this gestational age group is the presence of major birth defects.\n\nOthers have also observed that much growth deficit in term and near-term infants arises in pregnancies uncomplicated by PIH.  2, 11, 22, 23 In this study and in 2 other large population-based studies  2, 22  with a total of more than a million births, hypertensive FGR was not significantly associated with a CP risk. Despite its relationship with other adverse outcomes in mother and infant, hypertensive FGR appears relatively benign with respect to risk of CP.\n\nBirth asphyxia is often suggested as the link between poor fetal growth and CP risk, with the hypothesis that the lack of energy reserves makes the FGR fetus especially vulnerable. This hypothesis is not supported by this and 2 other population-based studies, which observed that FGR infants who developed CP did not have asphyxial births more often than children with CP who were AGA.  2, 24 Stoknes et al  24  further observed that the risk of CP was higher among FGR infants whose 5 minute Apgar scores exceeded 3, again suggesting that the additional CP risk with FGR is not explained by birth asphyxia.\n\nWith maternal smoking, the risk of CP concentrated in markedly FGR infants and was not related to how heavily gravidae smoked. We cannot identify the origin of this association, but suspicion falls on recreational drug use prospectively reported by a very small proportion of women but more often by women who smoked during their pregnancy and subsequently bore markedly growth-restricted infants later described as CP.  25  We observed that the combination of marked FGR with a major birth defect was associated with significant increase in CP risk and that this combination contributed approximately half of CP born markedly FGR, with congenital microcephaly particularly Proportion of singleton term and late preterm controls and CP with major birth defects by appropriateness of intrauterine growth and site of defect.

Infections, malnutrition, microvascular dysfunction, immunological disorders, and many toxins including alcohol, pesticides, and mycotoxins can harm both somatic growth and brain and also cause birth defects. Furthermore, much remains to be learned about normal and aberrant biology underlying somatic and brain growth and development.\n\nThe major strength of this study is that it is population based, including all CP not postneonatally acquired, and that detailed data were collected directly from the medical records and birth defects data by linkage with the populationbased birth defects register. The possibility of biased ascertainment of birth defects remains because children with CP undergo more frequent and intense medical examination; however, our previous study estimated that this bias was responsible for only 6% of the increased frequency of noncerebral birth defects in CP.  27  An important limitation of this study is its inability to include information on placental structure and function, widely considered to be key to FGR. The most common histological lesion of the placenta in normotensive FGR is chronic villitis of unknown origin,  28  a disorder many believe to be chiefly immunological. Several reports link chronic villitis with neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  [29] [30] 0] [31] [32]  Our study also does not include Doppler flow studies or results of amniocentesis or biophysical profiling because these were not routinely performed during the years of births in this study.\n\nFurther comments \"[D]ifferent pathophysiologic mechanisms of FGR are probably associated with different clinical perinatal outcomes and recurrence risks in subsequent pregnancies.\"  33 The usual clinical workup for FGR  10, 34  does not attempt to identify etiological subcategories in normotensive FGR, yet these subgroups may suggest valuable therapeutic or preventive opportunities. Careful evaluation of the poorly growing fetus for birth defects, histological examination of the placenta, and investigation of possible environmental or genetic influences would do much to achieve such identification.\n\nSuch information is not only likely to improve clinical care but also enable a more informed prognosis for this child and for future pregnancies of the mother and contribute to a better understanding of the important relationship between aberrant fetal growth and adverse neurologic outcome."

First, most FGR in singletons at or near term is normotensive, and marked normotensive growth restriction is a risk factor for subsequent CP. Second, in term and near-term singletons, growth restriction is associated with an excess of major birth defects. Third, the dominant risk factor for CP in term and near-term singletons is the presence of a major birth defect, the risk further increased in the presence of growth restriction. And finally, detection of birth defects in the fetus or neonate with growth restriction may provide significant prognostic information. -"
