      "text": "Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which accounts for approximately 1 in 5 deaths in the US.  1  Nearly half (47%) of all US adults, or 116 million individuals, have hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure [SBP]\u0546130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure\n\n[DBP]\u054680 mm Hg). Only 24% of those with hypertension have their condition under control.  2, 3 cial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in hypertension prevalence, awareness, and treatment persist. Notably, population-based studies have shown that Black and Hispanic adults have lower BP awareness and control despite a higher overall burden of hypertension compared with non-Hispanic White individuals.  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Emerging research has shown digital health technology to be a promising avenue for managing uncontrolled hypertension, particularly in underserved populations impacted by barriers to accessing care. Current digital health approaches for hypertension management typically involve text message reminders for medication adherence,  [9] [10] [11]  remote BP monitoring,  12, 13  and virtual behavioral coaching.  14, 15 There is also growing evidence for the value of tailored, multicomponent approaches for hypertension management.  16, 17 Home monitoring can identify \"white-coat hypertension\" (BP measurements are high in the clinic but normal at home) and masked hypertension (BP measurements are normal in the clinic but high at home) and empower patients to take more control over their health.  12, 18 When combined with a centralized medical team to respond to elevated home BP readings, home monitoring has potential to significantly improve BP control.\n\nDespite the intended benefits of home monitoring and other digital health interventions for hypertension control, there are varying effects on cardiovascular risk factor control, potentially because of the need for technology support and remote engagement.  [19] [20] 0] [21] [22]  Studies that incorporate a social determinants of health framework in the development and implementation of digital health interventions could prevent further widening of the digital divide and existing health disparities.  23 cordingly, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between digital health interventions and BP changes among populations experiencing health disparities. It also aimed to characterize the diversity of contemporary strategies used to meet the needs of populations experiencing health disparities."

      "text": "A systematic search of the literature was conducted by a medical librarian (A.A.G.) in the Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases to identify relevant articles published from the earliest record in the respective database to October 30, 2023. Databases were searched using a combination of controlled vocabulary and free-text terms for digital health, hypertension, social determinants of health, and demographic and/or socioeconomic disparities. The search was not limited by publication type, language, or year. The search was peer reviewed by a second medical librarian using Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies. Details of the full search strategy are listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.\n\nCitationChaser was used to search the reference lists of included studies and to retrieve articles that had cited the included studies to find additional relevant studies not retrieved by the database search.\n\nIncluded studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or cohort studies that investigated digital health interventions for managing hypertension and were conducted in adult populations (age \u054618 years). Studies were not excluded based on the type of digital health intervention used. Included studies presented change in SBP and/or baseline and follow-up SBP levels as primary or secondary outcomes. Studies were excluded if they possessed the following characteristics: review articles, abstracts, editorials or letters, animal studies, or case reports. Conference abstracts were excluded given that detailed information was required on follow-up BP levels, participants' sociodemographic characteristics, and an in-depth description of the digital health intervention being assessed.\n\nAdditionally, given the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the outcomes of digital health interventions in populations experiencing health disparities, the studies that were included at the full-text review stage were required to possess any of the following characteristics: (1) a clear emphasis on social determinants of health and/or health disparities, (2)   study eligibility criteria focusing on the exclusive or predominant recruitment and enrollment of marginalized populations that have historically been underserved and underrepresented in medical and public health research, (3) study design and conduct approaches involving intentional community partnership and stakeholder engagement, and (4) digital health intervention strategies that were culturally and/or linguistically tailored to the populations they were meant to serve. It was not feasible to include these criteria as part of the first stage of eligibility determination because this information is frequently not included in a study's title or abstract, thereby necessitating full review of the methods and results.\n\nCitations from all databases were imported into an EndNote 20 library (Clarivate Analytics).\n\nDuplicate citations were removed using the Yale Reference Deduplicator. The deduplicated results were imported into Covidence for screening and data extraction. Two independent screeners (M.E.K., R.M.) performed a title and abstract review, and a third screener (E.S.S.) resolved disagreements. The full texts of the resulting studies were then reviewed for inclusion by 2 independent screeners (M.E.K., R.M.), with a third screener (E.S.S.) resolving disagreements.\n\nthe SD value for the BP outcomes or reported IQR or SE values instead, we used several algebraic conversions to produce the proper SD measure of variation to integrate into our meta-analysis.  25 e methods of the meta-analysis were established prior to data extraction. Mean differences in BP between treatment and control groups were analyzed with random-effects meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood method. Analysis was stratified by follow-up duration in months.\n\nStudy heterogeneity was evaluated using Higgins I 2 statistics with thresholds of 25%, 50%, and 75%, corresponding with low, moderate, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively.  25 If the I 2 value was 50% or greater, we explored heterogeneity using leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and metaregression for outcomes with at least 10 studies. Subgroups included studies that tested remote BP monitoring in the intervention arm, focused on Black or Hispanic individuals, were pilot studies, identified BP as the primary outcome, and were limited to patients with controlled BP at baseline. Metaregression included the same subgroup variables and the proportion of study participants who were female, were Black or Hispanic, and/or had a lower level of completed education. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/BE, version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC). Two-sided P < .05 was considered significant."

Our systematic review and meta-analysis included a diverse sample of participants and a breadth of culturally tailored strategies seeking to integrate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic determinants into the study design and intervention delivery. We found statistically significant and clinically relevant mean differences in SBP at 6 months (-4.24 mm Hg) and SBP changes at 12 months (-4.30 mm Hg).\n\nOnly 3 studies  30, 36, 55  assessed BP changes beyond 1 year of follow-up.\n\nThis study found evidence of BP improvements in populations experiencing health disparities, strengthening the case for digital health as an efficient and effective tool for hypertension management in these groups. At 6 months of follow-up, individuals who received a digital health intervention had a 4.24 mm Hg greater reduction in SBP compared with those in a control group.\n\nImportantly, these results are consistent with findings from meta-analyses that focused on digital health interventions to lower BP levels in the general population.\n\n17,56-58 One systematic review conducted among 4271 participants from 11 RCTs demonstrated net changes of -3.85 mm Hg in SBP and -2.19 mm Hg in DBP in the combined digital health intervention group, 56 which are similar to the mean differences observed in the current study.

While this systematic review and meta-analysis focused on populations experiencing health disparities and assessed digital health interventions for culturally tailored components, we found that 17 studies were specifically focused on enrolling a large proportion of Black and Hispanic individuals.  29, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [39] [40] 0] [41] [42] 44, 46, 49, 50, 53, 54  However, subgroup analysis based on whether studies were limited to specific racial or ethnic groups had little effect on statistical heterogeneity. Black and Hispanic adults and individuals with low income and lower level of completed education experience a disproportionately higher burden of hypertension and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality associated with CVD.  2, 59, 60 Moreover, individuals without insurance have been shown to have worse CVD outcomes.  60, 61 These inequities may be driven by individual-, relational-, and system-level inequities. For example, lifestyle behaviors (ie, physical activity, diet, and sleep quality), interpersonal and structural racism and implicit bias, and differences in access to high-quality care can impact BP control rates.  62 Black and Hispanic\n\nindividuals face an increased level of discrimination, which has been associated with hypertension.  63  recent years, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals in the US have shown a stagnation and even a decline in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control, with widening gaps in BP control.  5, 6, 64 veral of the included studies addressed these challenges. For example, we observed a diverse range of recruitment strategies and culturally tailored interventions, ranging from faith-based community partnerships to motivational coaching based on personal belief frameworks. While nearly all of the studies included a combination of home BP monitoring with synchronized digital cuffs, medication adherence messaging, or motivational reminders, 21 studies made these reminders linguistically and/or culturally tailored to their patient population.  29, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [45] [46] [47] [48] [52] [53] [54] [55]  In the Cholesterol, Hypertension, and Glucose Education (CHANGE) study focusing on non-Hispanic Black patients with diabetes, nurses underwent cultural sensitivity training that provided information on the unique challenges that non-Hispanic Black individuals face in their community.  34 Additionally, there was a diverse set of community-engaged aspects of the study design and conduct, including the integration of community health centers, involvement of local church leadership for faith-based recruitment and intervention delivery, and participation of community health educators and patient advisory councils.  29, [31] [32] [33] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  Community-based interventions have been shown to ease the psychosocial stressors often associated with clinical settings, such as white coat syndrome, along with building trust between research staff and study participants. 17 In recent years, research has shown that hypertension management and control are low across all Hispanic and Latino groups, with rates lower than those among non-Hispanic White individuals and lowest among Hispanic adults without health insurance.  65, 66 The integration of CHWs has been\n\nJAMA Network Open | Cardiology Digital Health for Hypertension Management in Populations With Health Disparities JAMA Network Open. 2024;7(2):e2356070. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.56070 (Reprinted) February 14, 2024 11/17 Downloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 07/11/2025 a well-studied and validated approach to increasing health care access in these groups. Previous evidence has shown that CHWs who provide technical support, engage in participant recruitment, and are knowledgeable about community resources collectively aid in improving the adoption and acceptability of a digital health intervention. 67 In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a subset of studies specified whether an intervention was available in the participants' native or preferred language and whether culturally sensitive messaging was present, both of which would further enhance access to digital health interventions. In particular, Still et al 32 partnered with nurses from the Cleveland Council of Black Nurses, who, similar to CHWs, served as a bridge between underserved communities and their health care needs. While the intervention and control groups did not have significant differences in BP control at 3 months, clinically relevant BP reduction was observed in the intervention group. Additionally, in the TIME Study, Vaughan and colleagues 35 incorporated CHW-participant mobile health communication, CHW-led diabetes group visits, and CHW-physician diabetes training and support via telehealth in a population of Hispanic and Spanishspeaking individuals. Compared with control participants, those enrolled in TIME had significant BP improvement (SBP: -6.89 mm Hg vs 0.03 mm Hg; DBP: -3.36 mm Hg vs 0.2 mm Hg)."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The findings from our systematic review and meta-analysis should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, this study was limited in its ability to examine comprehensive, patient-level data on BP changes beyond 1 year. With few studies reporting longer-term follow-up data and the proportion of individuals with controlled hypertension at the end of the study period, the outcomes that were sufficiently powered both overall and for subgroup analyses were limited. However, despite this limitation, statistically significant and clinically meaningful data for SBP changes at 6 and 12 months were identified. Second, since there was inconsistently reported information on sociodemographic characteristics and studies used different definitions for specific subpopulations experiencing health disparities, our literature search may not have captured all studies of digital health interventions conducted in these populations. For example, studies conducted in rural areas may not have been identified if not cataloged as such. To improve our capture of studies, we used a snowball approach, identifying studies referenced by articles that did meet our search criteria.\n\nThird, several studies involved significant investment in community partnerships, patient engagement, and digital health interventions. While questions related to cost, sustainability, and scalability were beyond the scope of this study, they remain important challenges that should be considered in future interventions to address disparities in hypertension control. Last, given that many of the digital health interventions possessed multiple components, we were unable to isolate the effects of each component. Future scoping reviews may be particularly helpful in assessing the breadth of and heterogeneity in digital health intervention components. Relatedly, the control or standard care groups varied widely across included studies and may have impacted the observed effects accordingly."

We also\n\nidentified a breadth of interventions and community engagement strategies, such as participant recruitment and educational programming through faith-based organizations and community centers; however, few studies were conducted beyond 1 year. With the increased use of digital health technologies in medicine, it is important that researchers, clinicians, and public health professionals continue to adapt digital health interventions to meet the needs of demographically and socioeconomically diverse populations with different challenges to improving BP control. More personalized approaches to remote BP monitoring may help to eliminate inequities in hypertension management and outcomes.

      "text": "Given our aim to characterize approaches to tailoring digital health intervention delivery for populations experiencing health disparities, we have provided several examples to help inform future work seeking to expand access to these strategies. The Reach Out Churches study by Skolarus et al 33  was conducted across community centers and places of worship. The community-based participatory research intervention was designed by community and academic leaders to address needs such as food insecurity, cost-related medication nonadherence, poverty, and health literacy in a majority Black neighborhood. Although BP reduction was not statistically significant in that pilot trial, high participation and engagement provided evidence for the feasibility of community-based programs to focus on high-risk groups that are otherwise difficult to reach via traditional medical avenues. Additionally, in the Fostering African American Improvement in Total Health (FAITH!) trial, Brewer and colleagues 40  developed and analyzed a community-informed mobile health intervention (FAITH! app) for promoting ideal cardiovascular health among African American individuals in faith communities. In addition to organizing an advisory board composed of diverse community stakeholders to provide study oversight and ensure community centeredness, the research team convened joint congregation community recruitment kickoff events and developed educational materials incorporating practical strategies to overcome barriers from social determinants of health."

      "description": "Given our aim to characterize approaches to tailoring digital health intervention delivery for populations experiencing health disparities, we have provided several examples to help inform future work seeking to expand access to these strategies. The Reach Out Churches study by Skolarus et al 33  was conducted across community centers and places of worship. The community-based participatory research intervention was designed by community and academic leaders to address needs such as food insecurity, cost-related medication nonadherence, poverty, and health literacy in a majority Black neighborhood. Although BP reduction was not statistically significant in that pilot trial, high participation and engagement provided evidence for the feasibility of community-based programs to focus on high-risk groups that are otherwise difficult to reach via traditional medical avenues. Additionally, in the Fostering African American Improvement in Total Health (FAITH!) trial, Brewer and colleagues 40  developed and analyzed a community-informed mobile health intervention (FAITH! app) for promoting ideal cardiovascular health among African American individuals in faith communities. In addition to organizing an advisory board composed of diverse community stakeholders to provide study oversight and ensure community centeredness, the research team convened joint congregation community recruitment kickoff events and developed educational materials incorporating practical strategies to overcome barriers from social determinants of health."
