      "text": "In the United States, more than 700,000 citizens died from drug overdoses between 1999 and 2017, about two-thirds of them due to opioids  [1, 2] . Addiction to opioids, especially to pharmaceutical opioids, poses a major public health threat  [3, 4] . These pharmaceutical opioids are typically prescribed for post-operative pain management  [5] . According to the World Drug Report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 2019 (UNODC)  [4] , appropriate pain management strategies must be developed and implemented to respond adequately to this threat. These pain management strategies particularly rely on effective physician-patient communication  [6] . With advancing digitalization, however, this communication has to be increasingly provided through telemedicine  [7] . According to Lu et al.  [8] , mobile instant messaging applications (MIM), as well as short message services (SMS) offer major potential, whereby SMS is more frequently utilized. SMS communication provides a variety of features and proven benefits for healthcare applications  [9, 10] . To address this opioid epidemic, pain management combined with SMS as a communication medium could be viable, whereby the postoperative phase seems to be particularly decisive. Therefore, this paper aims to structure the current state of the literature regarding postoperative pain management via SMS. To our knowledge, there is currently no specific literature review on SMS-based pain management and no synthesized results."
