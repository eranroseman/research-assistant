  "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a personalised telehealth intervention to support dietary self-management in adults with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Design Mixed-methods process evaluation embedded in a randomised controlled trial. Participants People with stage 3-4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]15-60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). setting Participants were recruited from three hospitals in Australia and completed the intervention in ambulatory community settings. Intervention The intervention group received one telephone call per fortnight and 2-8 tailored text messages for 3 months, and then 4-12 tailored text messages for 3 months without telephone calls. The control group received usual care for 3 months then non-tailored education-only text messages for 3 months. Main outcome measures Feasibility (recruitment, nonparticipation and retention rates, intervention fidelity and participant adherence) and acceptability (questionnaire and semistructured interviews). statistical analyses performed Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. results Overall, 80/230 (35%) eligible patients who were approached consented to participate (mean\u00b1SD age 61.5\u00b112.6 years). Retention was 93% and 98% in the intervention and control groups, respectively, and 96% of all planned intervention calls were completed. All participants in the intervention arm identified the tailored text messages as useful in supporting dietary selfmanagement. In the control group, 27 (69%) reported the non-tailored text messages were useful in supporting change. Intervention group participants reported that the telehealth programme delivery methods were practical and able to be integrated into their lifestyle. Participants viewed the intervention as an acceptable, personalised alternative to face-face clinic consultations, and were satisfied with the frequency of contact. Conclusions This telehealth-delivered dietary coaching programme is an acceptable intervention which appears feasible for supporting dietary self-management in stage 3-4 CKD. A larger-scale randomised controlled trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the coaching programme on clinical and patient-reported outcomes. trial registration number ACTRN12616001212448; Results. .",

With the incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) growing, there is a pressing need for preventative action.  2  This includes the provision of pragmatic, person-centred interventions to support dietary behaviour change.\n\nDiet is a modifiable risk factor for the progression of CKD to ESKD.  3 4  Typical dietary advice given to people with CKD includes restricting individual nutrients, such as sodium, protein, potassium and phosphate. However, there is little evidence regarding the adherence to, and efficacy of, nutrient-specific dietary advice in CKD populations.  5 Recent evidence suggests that following a healthy dietary pattern, as a whole food-based dietary pattern is associated with a reduced risk of death in people with CKD.  6  A focus on foods rather than single nutrients may also facilitate increased adherence to dietary change in people with CKD  6 7  strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This study used a pragmatic design which enhanced its feasibility. \u25ba Mixed-methods captured both quantitative and qualitative data to determine multiple aspects of feasibility and acceptability. \u25ba Interview data to determine the intervention's acceptability were not captured in control group participants.\n\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies."

To determine whether increasing diet quality (through dietary pattern) may attenuate the progression of CKD and elevated cardiovascular risk on a sufficient scale for a randomised controlled trial (RCT), alternative modalities that are effective in supporting dietary management are needed. Telehealth modalities, particularly telephone-based and text message coaching, present an opportunity to overcome barriers and challenges that people with CKD encounter in accessing healthcare services.  8 10 Telehealth interventions may facilitate an increased frequency and quality of contact between the patient and healthcare professional  11 12  which may improve acceptability, uptake and adherence to interventions  13  and better align with a patient-centred model of care and reflect the needs of people with CKD.  10  While clinical trials of telehealth-delivered dietary interventions conducted specifically in CKD are lacking, trials conducted in the broader chronic disease population have shown telehealth-delivered dietary interventions are effective at supporting behaviour change to reduce chronic disease risk, including improving diet quality, fruit and vegetable consumption and reducing dietary sodium intake, compared with face-to-face modalities.  11 his may be due to the flexibility that both telephone and text messaging interventions provide in time and location, and the opportunity to offer more intensive dietary coaching that may not be feasible with traditional care models.  [14] [15] 5] [16]  Text messaging has been used to 'extend contact' after an intervention and has been shown to maintain clinical outcomes and minimise intervention decay.  17    18  A systematic review of text message health interventions highlighted the need for better evidence on the relative effectiveness of text-based interventions including the level of tailoring of text message delivery (incorporating frequency and timing), level of interaction (ie, response and feedback) and impact of additional interventions (such as a combination with telephone, face-to-face, video or internet).  19 hile dietary patterns aligned with a higher diet quality are associated with lower mortality in CKD,  6  the level of tailoring and individualised coaching required to achieve and support dietary self-management is unknown. Non-CKD trials have demonstrated effectiveness for minimally tailored text messages,  20  information-only text messages and tailored interactive text messages.  21 owever, no approach has been shown to be superior and no study has investigated such questions in the CKD population. To determine the level of tailoring, and the delivery method that is most feasible and acceptable for patients with CKD, this pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth-delivered dietary coaching to support dietary self-management in stage 3-4 CKD."

The first call was scheduled for 45 min and five subsequent calls for approximately 30 min. Each call was based on established protocols and call scripts. The telephone call content was guided by the workbook topics, structured according to the 5A's framework (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange),  27  and individually tailored to participants using relevant educational strategies, and in consideration of the participant goals and comorbidities. Where required, 24 hours dietary recalls were undertaken during coaching calls to track adherence and progress with goals. Coaches used Microsoft Excel  28  to document progress of each call and log information including goal setting, implementation intentions, self-monitoring tools, call attempts and durations, and text message preferences.\n\nIn addition, participants in the intervention group received two to eight text messages scheduled between coaching calls with the actual number and time of day determined by each participant's preference. Text categories included: educational, self-monitoring and goal setting. The schedule of text messages for the intervention and control group in phases 1 and 2 is detailed in online supplementary table  2 . The text messages were sent using a web-based, semiautomated text message management platform (Propelo,  www. propelo. com. au ), developed and administered by The University of Queensland's School of Public Health.  29 The investigators, in consultation with local nephrologists, dietitians and evidence-based practice guidelines, designed the library of text messages which were then reviewed for comprehension by a group of patients, nephrologists and members of the investigator team. The text message library was imported into the software platform which was designed to tailor text messages based on: participant's name, individual goals, barriers to achieving goals and participant-identified solutions to overcoming those barriers. These tailoring variables were collected and modified as required by the coaches following the initial and subsequent coaching calls.\n\nAs shown in online supplementary table 2, participants in the intervention group could receive one 'goal check' per goal (total two goal checks) per fortnight in phase 1 and up to two goal checks per goal (total 2-4 goal checks) per fortnight in phase 2. These goal checks required the participant to respond to the text with a 'yes' or 'no' which prompted the software to send a predetermined response. An incoming text reply outside protocol (ie, not a 'yes' or 'no' response) was classified as an 'unrecognised response'. This triggered an email to the participant's coach and was only responded to where participants expressed considerable risk to their health (eg, symptoms needing medical attention).\n\nParticipants in the control group received no coaching or text messages between the baseline visit and 3 months (phase 1). The control group continued to receive standard care under their treating nephrologist (typically one clinic visit every 3 months) and were encouraged to work through the ENTICE-CKD workbook at their own pace."

Intervention group participants chose text message frequencies (4-12 text messages per fortnight) for the Open access same types of texts that they received in phase 1 (educational tips, self-monitoring, goal checks). Participants in the control group received non-tailored education-only text messages (described in online supplementary table 2) at the commencement of phase 2 of the trial.

Participants agreed (responses for 'agree' and 'strongly agree') that the text message component: supported their dietary self-management (intervention 100%; 69% control, p=0.003); provided motivation to change their diet (intervention 75%, control 50%; p=0.03); and led them to a healthier diet (intervention 81%, control 61%, p=0.06). There were no other differences observed in the utility of the text messages between the groups. The majority of text messages were saved and not deleted (77% overall), and 62% were shared with family, friends or healthcare providers across the two study groups. Acceptability of the text messages was assessed as high with 78% of all intervention and control participants reporting that the characteristics of the text messages (language, frequency, programme length, time of delivery) were satisfactory."

Overall, participants had positive experiences with the ENTICE-CKD trial. Attributes of the discussions are described in nine categories within components of acceptability and feasibility (table  5 ). The acceptability categories discussed by participants were: acceptable alternative to clinic, preference for voice communication, regular contact via text message and personalised messages valued. The categories described under feasibility were: programme integrated into lifestyle, diverse delivery modes, social accountability, responding to dietary advice and infeasible elements beyond intervention. Participants emphasised the importance of social accountability; all participants expressed benefit from the relationship built with their coach. Participants identified benefits from telehealth delivery of the intervention, with the majority expressing preference for telehealth over face-to-face interventions. They appreciated the personable, bidirectional conversation of the telephone calls. The degree of usefulness of text messages was rated with some variability, although no participants described the content or delivery of text messages negatively in the semistructured interviews.

      "text": "This mixed-methods process evaluation study within an RCT evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the ENTICE-CKD telehealth coaching programme to promote healthy eating among people with moderate CKD. The ENTICE-CKD programme was a feasible intervention that was delivered according to protocol and enabled participant adherence. The tailored telephone calls and text messages were acceptable to intervention participants in this pilot. In contrast, the acceptability varied for those in the non-tailored education-only text message (control) group. The ENTICE-CKD programme made participants feel supported and motivated for dietary self-management. However, this was more strongly indicated by participants who received the tailored intervention programme, as opposed to the control group who received non-tailored education-only text messages. These results suggest that a tailored approach to text messaging may be important to people with CKD, as it may facilitate the support and regular interaction for dietary changes.  8 Participants felt that the frequent contact via calls and text messages reinforced rapport and built a supportive relationship between participant and coach which, in turn, enabled stronger social accountability and progressive dietary change.\n\nThe successful recruitment and retention of participants enrolled in the ENTICE trial demonstrated feasibility. Although it is important to consider the trial only had a 35% recruitment rate, the feasibility was strengthened by the successful recruitment in the anticipated  including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. . by guest on July 16, 2025  http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 29 January 2019. 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024551 on BMJ Open: first published as Open access 6-month recruitment period and very low attrition rate (5%) at 6 months. Attrition is a common problem in studies of self-management in CKD which is reported as between 11% and 39%, and which reduces the generalisability of findings, particularly given the often underpowered sample sizes of trials of lifestyle interventions in CKD.  35 he intensive coaching intervention had a high call completion rate (90%) and high intervention adherence. This is similar to the 90% call completion rates reported in other telehealth studies in weight management,  36  breast cancer,  17  younger adults in the general population,  37  and CKD studies.  38 A study involving 436 participants with CKD in the UK, who received a combination of interactive web-based resources and telephone follow-up demonstrated successful recruitment, retention and intervention satisfaction.  38 There was no specific dietary education provided to participants in that study, however the community support intervention, provided through a workbook, online portal and telephone follow-up demonstrated a 69% recruitment rate, and had 85% retention at the 6-month follow-up. Participants reported over 80% usefulness for the workbook, 62% for the telephone calls and 23% for the interactive website.  38 Considering the limited evidence on lifestyle interventions in CKD specifically, the findings from this trial support the feasibility of using telehealth coaching to support dietary self-management of CKD. The major difference between the study conducted by Blakeman and colleagues  38  and the ENTICE-CKD study was that recruitment occurred in general practices compared with tertiary hospitals in our study. Our patient-engagement work highlighted the desire of people with CKD for preventative diet and lifestyle advice in the early stages of CKD, before it became a clinical issue.  10 This possibly explains the higher recruitment rate in the primary care study by Blakeman and colleagues (69%) compared with our study in the tertiary hospital setting (35%).\n\nOverall, there is limited evidence on the acceptability of telehealth dietary interventions in CKD.  39 A pilot study in 47 CKD participants demonstrated over 80% user adherence and satisfaction with a smart-phone self-management support programme to support the self-monitoring of blood pressure, medications, symptom recognition and biochemistry.  40 In contrast, another study found that text-message-based interventions were the least preferred telehealth intervention for medication monitoring by CKD participants, compared with web-based or personal digital assistant-based applications.  41 The Effects of Sodium Modification on Outcome (ESMO) study, a 3-month self-management intervention in 138 adults with CKD which provided one-to-one sessions and telephone support, demonstrated relatively high (63%) satisfaction from participants. It has been postulated that a key factor for the high acceptability of the ESMO intervention was the patient-engagement used in the design of the trial.  42 his was an approach also taken in the ENTICE-CKD study. We have previously found that patients with CKD have been confused by dietary advice and need more frequent contact to support dietary change.  10 They were willing to participate in telephone calls and receive text messages, as these were viewed within their comfort zone and levels of digital literacy, 10 but also raised concerns about the credibility, safety and lack of personalisation in mobile apps and internet modalities. The ENTICE-CKD programme was developed from the key results in this focus group study which assured a patient-centred approach.  43 revious thematic synthesis has shown that people with CKD experience many challenges in relation to achieving their dietary and fluid recommendations. People express a preference for regular coaching, feedback and monitoring to help them understand dietary information and become confident in their ability to self-monitor and manage such changes.  8 The ENTICE-CKD programme was designed to foster incremental dietary advice, with each individual call being dedicated to a separate topic. Each call was also tailored and flexible to participants' goals for dietary change. These attributes may also help explain the difference observed in the acceptability compared with the non-tailored education only (control) intervention.\n\nThere are limitations to this study. As we had a 35% recruitment rate, the feasibility and acceptability only relate to the participants enrolled in this pilot, thus the feasibility for the uptake of the programme and its generalisability in clinical practice are unknown. Furthermore, the baseline health literacy was 'good' in over 90% of our participants which is likely greater than the health literacy of the wider CKD population.  44 While other demographics of the people who participated in the ENTICE-CKD study were broadly representative of the CKD demographic reported in international comparisons,  [45] [46] [47]  we note that previous work has shown that approximately 20%-25% have low health literacy,  48  while only 10% of our study's participants had low health literacy. We speculate that it is possible that our estimate of health literacy may be inflated due to the singleitem questionnaire having poorer sensitivity for people with marginal reading ability.  49 Future studies should consider the use of a skill-based health literacy questionnaire, such as the Newest Vital Sign, which might better detect poor levels of health literacy in this population.  50 We also acknowledge that we captured the individual participant adherence to the intervention using qualitative methods rather than validated surveys. However, given the primary outcome of feasibility, qualitative methods were used to minimise the over-use of self-report surveys and participant burden and this was an exploratory measure of intervention adherence only. Using this method, we were able to capture to reasons for adherence (and non-adherence). We also did not recruit children into the ENTICE-CKD study, so our results are not generalisable to children with CKD. Finally, we did not interview participants in the non-tailored education-only (control) group, and thus could not ascertain the reasons for lower acceptability compared with the intervention group."

      "text": "There are several adaptations which should be considered for a future trial based on the findings of this feasibility and acceptability study. First, the generalisability of the study sample could be improved by recruiting participants from primary care (including general practices) and public and private nephrology units. This may improve the recruitment rate, targeting people who are potentially more motivated to change their diets compared with those who have been in the nephrology service for many years. There is also more opportunity for people to consult with a dietitian in specialised nephrology services, evident by 6% of people who declined to participate doing so because they were already seeing a dietitian. Second, the number and structure of the coaching calls could be modified. All participants who completed call 1 went on to complete at least four calls, however reasons for missing the final two calls did vary and these calls were most commonly used for check-in and review of participant goals only. This could therefore be done at the participant's discretion and to give participants more flexibility which was a key reason for the ENTICE-CKD programme's acceptability. Lastly, due to the unexpectedly large volume of over 1000 'unrecognised' text messages sent by participants, a larger trial would be required to adapt the programme to provide an automated response in these instances.\n\nIn conclusion, the ENTICE-CKD dietary coaching programme is a feasible and acceptable intervention for adults with stage 3-4 CKD. The programme facilitated self-monitoring and encouraged the adoption of goal setting throughout the intensive coaching period. Findings from this study are promising for the use of telehealth to modify dietary practices in future clinical practice and research. However, longer-term studies are needed to determine the safety, clinical effectiveness and sustainability before the wider implementation of the ENTICE-CKD programme is appropriate. This process evaluation can be used by clinicians to inform frequent and structured contact through telephone-based and text-message platforms to support the complex dietary self-management required for people with CKD."
