  "title": "Developing tailored theoretically informed goal-setting interventions for rehabilitation services: a co-design approach",
  "abstract": "Background: Several active ingredients contribute to the purposes and mechanisms of goal-setting in rehabilitation. Active ingredients in the goal-setting process include, interdisciplinary teamworking, shared decision-making, having meaningful and specific goals, and including action planning, coping planning, feedback, and review. Clinicians have expressed barriers and enablers to implementing these active ingredients in rehabilitation teams. Interventions designed to improve goal-setting practices need to be tailored to address context specific barriers and enablers. Attempts to understand and enhance goal-setting practices in rehabilitation settings should be supported using theory, process models and determinant frameworks. Few studies have been undertaken to enhance goal-setting practices in varied case-mix rehabilitation settings. Methods: This study is part of a larger program of research guided by the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework. A multisite, participatory, codesign approach was used in five sites to address three stages of the KTA. (1) Focus groups were conducted to understand barriers and enablers to implementing goal-setting at each site. Following the focus groups three staff co-design workshops and one consumer workshop were run at each site to (2) adapt knowledge to local context, and to (3) select and tailor interventions to improve goal-setting practices. Focus groups were analysed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and informed the selection of behaviour change techniques incorporated into the implementation plan. Results: Barriers and enablers identified in this study were consistent with previous research. Clinicians lacked knowledge and understanding of the differences between a goal and an action plan often confusing both terms. Clinicians were unable to demonstrate an understanding of the importance of comprehensive action planning and review processes that extended beyond initial goal-setting. Interventions developed across the sites included staff training modules, a client held workbook, educational rehabilitation service flyers, interdisciplinary goal-based case conference templates, communication goal boards and a key worker model. Implementation plans were specifically established for each site. Conclusions: Rehabilitation teams continue to struggle to incorporate a truly client-centred, interdisciplinary model of goal-setting in rehabilitation. Whilst clinicians continue to lack understanding of how they can use aspects of goalsetting to enhance client outcomes and autonomy in rehabilitation settings.",

      "text": "The Australian Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine (AFRM) recommend that \"the patient and the rehabilitation team work together to establish meaningful and achievable treatment goals\" in rehabilitation services  [1]  (p.6). Goal-setting has been defined as the establishment or negotiation of rehabilitation goals  [2]  and is recognized as a complex process that has the potential to enhance client outcomes and autonomy  [3] . The Medical Research Council (MRC) highlight that to understand how a complex intervention works, one must first identify the 'active ingredients'  [4] . Whilst purposes and mechanisms for goal-setting in rehabilitation are varied  [5] , active ingredients in the goal-setting process include, interdisciplinary teamworking  [6, 7] , shared decisionmaking (SDM)  [8] , setting specific and meaningful goals  [9]  and incorporating action planning, coping planning, feedback and review  [10, 11] . Furthermore, these active ingredients are required to be implemented collaboratively by large teams of diverse professionals, clients, and families  [5, 12] . Evidence to date demonstrates that not all active ingredients in rehabilitation goal-setting are consistently implemented in clinical practice  [11, [13] [14] [15] . A previous study in this program of research found that rehabilitation clinicians set poorly defined goals as individual disciplines, and included limited action planning and review of goal progress  [11] .\n\nThe evidence practice pipeline by Glasziou and colleagues  [16]  highlights reasons why evidence is not implemented into clinical practice. Firstly, implementation can only occur if clinicians are aware of and accept the evidence. In rehabilitation, clinicians have previously demonstrated a lack of knowledge about the evidence for goal-setting in rehabilitation  [17] . Secondly, clinicians must accept the evidence is relevant to their practice and have the capability to implement the evidence  [16] . In rehabilitation, clinicians have demonstrated differing beliefs about the importance and timing of goal-setting and demonstrated a lack of skill in implementing aspects of goal-setting such as shared decision-making  [8, [18] [19] [20] . The final step in the evidence practice pipeline  [16]  is for clinicians to act on and implement the evidence with clients who have the capability of adhering to the recommendations  [16] . Factors affecting clinicians' ability to implement goalsetting in rehabilitation settings include nursing shift work  [8, 21] , staff turnover  [21]  and competing priorities such as discharge planning  [21] . Furthermore, changes to a client's cognitive and communication abilities influence clinicians' beliefs about the capability of rehabilitation clients to participate in goal-setting  [8, 20, 21] . Research into barriers and enablers to implementing goal-setting in rehabilitation has predominantly been conducted with condition specific population groups in the UK, Europe and New Zealand limiting the generalisability of findings to varied casemix rehabilitation services in Queensland. It has been proposed that tailoring interventions and addressing context specific barriers and enablers improves the likelihood of successful implementation of evidence into practice  [4] .\n\nImplementing evidence into clinical practice requires careful planning using structured process models and determinant frameworks to support clinicians to change their practice  [22] . The Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework is one process model that is simple to operationalise and aligns with existing quality improvement cycles within healthcare  [23] . Phases of the KTA can occur iteratively and include, synthesising the evidence base, determining the evidence-practice gap, identifying barriers and enablers, adapting knowledge to context, selecting and tailoring interventions, monitoring intervention implementation and evaluating and sustaining the change. At the centre of the KTA framework, lies the development and synthesis of knowledge. Several systematic reviews on goal-setting in rehabilitation have already been published  [2, 8, [24] [25] [26] . Moving to the seconds stage of the KTA framework the first study in this program of research used medical record audits and client interviews to highlight evidence practice gaps in goal-setting practices across varied case mix rehabilitation services in Queensland  [11] . Evidence-practice gaps included limited shared decisionmaking, a focus on therapist-led goal-setting within a multidisciplinary model, limited inclusion of meaningful activity and participation goals, limited specificity of goal statements and limited action planning, feedback and review  [11] .\n\nThe subsequent three stages of the KTA framework: identifying barriers and enablers, adapting knowledge to context, selecting and tailoring interventions, are the focus of this study. There are several determinant frameworks that support analysis of barriers and enablers including the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)  [27] . The TDF was originally designed to understand health professional's behaviour and promote understanding of barriers and enablers to implementing evidence  [27] . The TDF is often used in conjunction with the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework that identifies the intervention functions (intervention functions include a broad range of categories by which an intervention can change behaviour) and behaviour change techniques (BCT) (an active component of an intervention designed to change behaviour)  [28]  that are likely to overcome specific barriers to implementation. How an intervention is developed may impact the uptake and implementation of an intervention in clinical practice. Incorporating both clients and clinicians into the co-design of research may improve intervention uptake through enhanced awareness, acceptance of the evidence and ownership of the intervention  [29] . Therefore, unlike previous goal-setting studies, a participatory co-design approach was used to develop the interventions in this study.\n\nIn addition to how an intervention is developed it is important to consider how an intervention will be implemented ensuring it is clear exactly what behaviour needs to change i.e. who, will do what, when, where and how  [30] . To address known barriers, and to implement a clearly defined behaviour, behaviour change techniques such as facilitation, prompts, audit and feedback promote problem solving and enhance uptake of interventions in the clinical setting  [31, 32] . Facilitation roles involve individuals with the appropriate skills and knowledge to support clinicians through change, these roles can be both external (i.e. external researchers) or internal (i.e. local team leaders)  [32] . Audit and feedback may be more effective when delivered by a colleague or supervisor and when action plans are developed to act on the feedback provided  [31] .\n\nIncorporating facilitation roles, audit and feedback within implementation plans can ensure interventions are implemented as intended, that implementation is closely monitored and that clinicians are supported to agree and act on the evidence with clients  [33] .\n\nThis study uses a theoretically informed conceptual framework  [11] , following an implementation process model (KTA) and determinant framework (TDF) to progress previous research  [11]  and support the understanding of barriers and enablers in varied casemix rehabilitation services. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse site specific barriers and enablers to implementing goal-setting and to co-design tailored interventions and implementation plans to address the evidence practice gap surrounding inclusion of goal-setting 'active ingredients' across five varied casemix rehabilitation services in Queensland, Australia. This study will clearly describe the detail of intervention development to allow clinicians to replicate this research in clinical practice  [34] ."

Focus groups were predominantly facilitated by the primary researcher, as the primary researcher is a novice qualitative researcher, a second experienced researcher was present to assist in facilitating the discussions and collecting field notes. Each focus group was conducted in person and a topic guide was developed to support the focus groups (Supplementary material). The questions investigated the clinician's perspectives of the meaningfulness of goal-setting, the current goal-setting practice and the perceived barriers and enablers to implementing goal-setting in each service.

Despite discussing the importance of client-centred goal-setting, rehabilitation clinicians were often unable to demonstrate how clients were involved in the goal-setting process beyond initial goal-negotiation. Furthermore, clinicians expressed concern about conducting goal-setting discussions with clients when the area of goal focus lay outside their specific discipline skillset.\n\nNursing staff were often not directly included in the goal-setting process but could identify the value that they would add \"because we carry out what everyone else plans for them\" (Site 1) (Social and professional role and identity, TDF). However, some nurses voiced that they had limited training in goal-setting (Skills, TDF) and it was not traditionally part of their role.\n\nHaving a structured process for case conferences, strong leadership and chairing enhanced interdisciplinary goal-setting (Environmental Context and resources, TDF). However, clients were not included in case conference discussions and no clinicians thought it was possible that the client could be involved in the case conference. A structured goal-setting process was identified as an enabler by clinicians. However, clinicians highlighted the need for these structures to be flexible to accommodate client needs, specifically in inpatient rehabilitation, when the length of stay between clients with different diagnosis varied considerably."

In focus groups, clinicians highlighted the importance of having the knowledge and skills to facilitate goal-setting discussions. Enablers of client-centred goal-setting interactions included motivational interviewing skills, active listening skills, skills to break longer term goals into shorter term goals and skills to support clients to create action plans to facilitate goal achievement (Knowledge and/or skill, TDF). Clinicians questioned the effectiveness of goal-setting early in inpatient rehabilitation expressing that both clinicians and clients were unprepared to set goals on admission to rehabilitation.\n\nTable 1 Focus group participants Site Disciplines represented Sex Average Age Average years of experience in the profession Average years of experience in rehabilitation Site 1 (n = 7) (n = 1 missing data point) Dietetics, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Rehabilitation Consultant, Speech Pathology 100% female 34.17 (\u00b1 SD 6.40) 11.17 (\u00b1 SD 6.55) 7.17 (\u00b1 SD 4.31) Site 2 (n = 9) (n = 1 missing data point) Neuropsychology, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Rehabilitation Consultant, Social Work, Speech Pathology 100% female 41.38 (\u00b1 SD 9.52) 16.88 (\u00b1 SD 9.40) 12.63 (\u00b1 SD 8.55) Site 3 (n = 7) Neuropsychology, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Rehabilitation Consultant, Speech Pathology 29% male 37.43 (\u00b1 SD 9.88) 13.71 (\u00b1 SD 9.34) 9.86 (\u00b1 SD 6.23) 71% female Site 4 (n = 13) (n = 2 missing data points) Allied Health Assistant, Dietetics, Neuropsychology, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Speech Pathology 8% male 38.82 (\u00b1 SD 10.41) 12.18 (\u00b1 SD 10.82) 7.82 (\u00b1 SD 5.74) 92% female Site 5 (n = 8) Dietetics, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Social Work, Speech Pathology 12.5% male 41.75(\u00b1 SD 9.62) 17 (\u00b1 SD 10.44) 12.52 (\u00b1 SD 10.44) 87.5%female ) \"I think the challenge is always trying to find one process, and one tool that everyone is going to use\u2026 but if we really want to be person-centred, then we need to be flexible about how we do our goal-setting\" (Site 4)\n\nThe case conference forum (. a\n\n)\n\ncase conference is a good opportunity where we come together and feedback to each other about what goals we've been working at, and then formulate a sort of more shared goal\" (Site 1) Electronic and paper-based record keeping systems \"I spend more time doing paperwork than I actually do client work\" (Site 5) \"then every outcome measure is\u2026put into a database and there' s a lot of crosschecking\" (Site 5) Beliefs about consequences Lack of client involvement in case conference (. b ) \"it' s fragmented though, through EMR [electronic medical record]\u2026plus each therapist will write up what their goals are, so there' s no actual framework where they're all in one\" (Site 3) \"we probably don't-in this service-have a platform where we all get together as an MDT with the patient and actually look at their goals and how they're progressing\" (Site 3)  ) \"we will have their goals up on the wall and we will tick them off and its, it' s exciting for nurses and patients to see\u2026. or well anyone who helps that patient\u2026 to see that it' s been ticked off, is a big achievement on everyone' s behalf\" however staff identified this was a \"more reactive than proactive\" approach (Site 1) \"So, if we're grappling with it and we're expecting them to have some kind of concept, it's really hard \u2026 to do it so early\" (Site 3). \"So actually, is the goal-setting with them futile or not effective, because we're doing it at the wrong time for that particular patient\" (Site 1) (Beliefs about consequences, TDF).\n\nClinicians found it difficult to facilitate goal-setting discussions when clients had cognitive and communication impairments or lacked motivation and confidence to participate. Whilst some clinicians demonstrated awareness that they may require additional training to facilitate goal-setting with clients who have cognitive and communication impairments (Skills, TDF), other clinicians believed it was not possible for these clients to set goals; \"by its very nature it is beyond the capacity of some of our clients\" (Site 5) (Beliefs about capabilities, TDF).\n\nThe time taken to facilitate shared decision-making goal-setting sessions was highlighted as a barrier. This was further hampered by lengthy assessments in one community rehabilitation service and constraints of both paper-based and electronic medical record keeping systems in all services (Environmental Context and resources, TDF). The inflexibility of electronic medical record keeping systems impacted the feasibility of setting common goals and actions as a rehabilitation team. Furthermore, including the client in team goal-setting discussions was considered too time consuming. Advantages of working in a community context meant that clinicians could segregate time specifically for goal-setting discussions.\n\nUsing measurement tools and structured questionnaires to prompt goal-setting discussions was an enabler that promoted client involvement (Environmental Context and resources, TDF). Clinicians highlighted that additional training may be required to use the tools, specifically when this was not common practice within their role; \"I actually find that MGAM [multidisciplinary goal attainment measure] really hard to do, to explain for people to understand how they can rate it\" (Site 5) (Skills, TDF)."

      "title": "Meaningful and specific goals",
      "text": "Whilst all clinicians felt it was their role to set goals with clients in rehabilitation, they also felt obligated to set goals that aligned with the role of their service, and this was most obvious in inpatient rehabilitation (Social influences, TDF). Clinicians in one community rehabilitation service wanted to set hope or dream-based goals with clients but were concerned this could negatively reflect on the service, which used goal achievement as a service outcome measure (Beliefs about consequences, TDF).\n\nClinicians believed that goal-setting could motivate patients and potentially impact client outcomes; \"[goalsetting] encourages motivation; patients are more motivated to participate in therapy, so we get better results\u2026 and potentially quicker throughput\" (Site 1). Conversely, other clinicians felt that goals set by rehabilitation clients needed to be realistic; \"cause otherwise you're setting them up to fail\" (Site 1) (Beliefs about consequences, TDF).\n\nThe rehabilitation setting was perceived to have an impact on the type of goals that were set (Environmental Context and resources, TDF). Community rehabilitation services highlighted how more meaningful goals could be established once discharged from an inpatient service when the client had been able to experience living back in a real-world environment. Whilst inpatient rehabilitation services highlighted a focus on getting clients out of hospital and the perception of organisational pressure to reduce lengths of stay. \"it's very clinician-driven in the inpatient setting\u2026in the community setting, \u2026 they're back at home, it's more empowering, because they're back in their normal environment\" (Site 4)."

      "text": "There was limited knowledge and understanding demonstrated by clinicians on the difference between a goal and an action plan or task list (Knowledge, TDF). Clinicians lacked an understanding of the importance of client actions versus staff actions. Clinicians focussed on how they personally would assist goal achievement for the client with little consideration to empowering client's goal pursuit through developing client action plans, appraisal of client actions and the delivery of feedback to the client. Two sites (Sites 2, 5) initiated a key worker role (prior to this research) as a primary point of contact, providing feedback for the client, albeit inconsistently, as clinicians reported they often forgot to feedback to the client. (Memory, attention and decision-making, TDF). Clinicians highlighted that review of goals was most often conducted to 'measure' goal-setting outcomes (predominantly for the benefit of the service), but clinicians didn't highlight the value of reviewing client action plans or providing feedback about performance or results to clients.\n\nCharts on walls to communicate patient goals were an enabler at one site (Site 1) (Environmental Context and resources, TDF). Charts were used to communicate the client's goals to all members of the rehabilitation team, facilitate reinforcement of actions and demonstrate progress when goals were 'ticked off ' throughout the admission. Whilst using charts on walls was reported as a valuable strategy by clinicians, the charts were not used consistently and relied on individual clinicians identifying that a client needed further encouragement and support from the team to participate in rehabilitation activities."

How? When? And where? Process mapping activities conducted by the primary researcher during the co-design workshops assisted clinicians to identify individual tasks, roles and responsibilities for the implementation plan. Wherever able tasks in the implementation plan were incorporated into existing processes, prior to changing processes or adding additional processes. Data collected from each co-design workshop was in the form of researcher field notes.\n\nOne consumer group consultation session was run between staff co-design workshops 2 and 3 to facilitate feedback on consumer resources that clinicians had suggested. Not all consumers could attend the codesign workshop in person and further feedback was received via email.\n\nA local site facilitator was funded (8 h a week) at each service to facilitate the implementation of interventions and was supported by the primary researcher. Local site facilitators planned to conduct regular audits of the interventions being implemented, provide prompts and feedback to the rehabilitation clinicians, provide education and revise interventions as required throughout implementation."

The interventions co-designed to address these areas across the five sites included staff education and training modules, a key worker model, interdisciplinary goal-based case conference templates, communication goal boards, a client held workbook and educational rehabilitation service flyers. Table  4  outlines the content of co-designed interventions, the active goal-setting ingredient addressed, the TDF domain addressed within each intervention, the intervention functions identified, and the behaviour change techniques to be incorporated in each intervention  [42] . The interventions were designed to allow each site to tailor relevant sections to their setting. Detail of the interventions developed are published online  [42] . Clinicians at Site 1 chose to implement changes to case conference and to utilise formal client goal boards. Site 2 chose to implement all interventions and embed many of these within their existing key worker role. Clinicians in Sites 3,4 and 5 chose to implement the client held workbook and designed specific templates for team goal-setting and action planning. Site specific implementation plans were developed to support uptake of selected resources and strategies (Table  5 )."

Case conferences were conducted at all sites and are used as a forum for discussing client's current function, progress and discharge planning. Two sites (Site 1 and 2) adopted changes to case conference. Both sites felt that the case conference forum, presented the best opportunity to develop a common goal focus. However, neither site chose to involve the client in case conference due to concerns about the time involved and challenges arising when having difficult conversations in front of clients. In response, Site 1 nominated clinicians to provide feedback to clients following the case conference and ensure goals reflected individual client preferences, whilst Site 2 chose to utilise the keyworker role as a client advocate in case conference and to translate information discussed at case conference with the client."

One community rehabilitation service suggested development of a mobile phone application to facilitate client goal-setting and action planning across the team however this was beyond the resources of this study. Site specific processes to implement the client workbook were developed based on clinicians' roles and responsibilities (see Table  5 ). Each site requested slightly different goal-setting and action planning templates and therefore six templates were designed that could be further tailored and inserted into the goal-setting workbook. Plans were made at each site to define who would print the workbooks, where they would be kept, who would give them out to clients and who was responsible for completing specific sections (Table  5 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Barriers and enables to implementing active goal-setting ingredients aligned with a range of TDF domains. Firstly, and most prominently, the environmental context and resources of workplaces was identified as both a barrier and enabler. Clinicians also demonstrated a lack of fundamental knowledge about the different components of rehabilitation goal-setting, specifically the difference between goals and actions. This was complicated by tensions between clinicians perceived obligations to set goals that aligned with organizational priorities rather than the priorities of the client. Other keys barriers and enablers related to clinician skills to implement shared decision-making and some clinician's beliefs about the consequences associated with goal-setting. The interventions developed and the site-specific implementation plans in this study were influenced by these identified TDF domains, which were mapped against the BCW intervention functions and behavior change techniques. All sites chose to include staff training and education sessions into their implementation package. Education and training sessions were targeted to enhance clinicians' knowledge, specifically focusing on understanding the components of goal-setting including action planning, feedback and review and ensuring that clinicians had the skills to set specific and meaningful, client centred goals. Clinicians in this study frequently misunderstood the difference between a goal and an action, often identifying staff actions as rehabilitation goals. The confusion of actions and goals may reflect a clinicians focus on health system expectations rather than client's goals  [19] . When clinicians discussed goals, these were often framed to reflect the needs of the organisation rather than the client; i.e. 'getting them out of hospital' rather than 'the client going home to live with their family' .\n\nIn keeping with previous research  [19] , clinicians in this study also spoke of the pressure to be able to accurately predict recovery to set realistic goals with clients. Conversely, consumer voiced literature emphasises the need for clinicians to include hope and dream based goals in rehabilitation to enhance the motivational aspects of goal-setting  [44] . Whilst some clinicians acknowledged that goal-setting can be motivational they still felt that goals should be realistic. If clinicians continue to only set 'realistic goals' with clients and not include aspirational goals, it is likely that goals will remain subjective to the clinician's expectation for recovery and therefore unlikely to enhance the motivational aspects of goal-setting that may impact client outcomes.\n\nThe focus on setting goals to meet perceived organisational needs and the inflexibility in clinicians' perspectives of including aspirational goal-setting led to clinicians demonstrating a therapist led model of goalsetting. The therapist led model of goal-setting has been seen previously in Queensland rehabilitation services  [45] . To move forward from a therapist-led model of goal-setting, education and training should focus on supporting clinicians to engage clients in shared decision-making to set client-centred goals and to clinically reason to support inclusion of tangible short-term goals and longer term aspirational goals across the rehabilitation journey. In this study, the client workbook and case conference templates were designed to facilitate setting of longer-term aspirational goals and allow shorter term goals to be broken down from these longer-term goals.\n\nThe client workbook was designed to ensure a common client centred goal focus was established among the team (including long term and short-term goals) and that components of action planning and review were included in the goal-setting process. The client workbook was designed to provide information to clients to enhance their knowledge and to assist clinicians to develop skills to structure their goal-setting discussions with clients. Therefore, the client workbook was developed to target both client and clinician behaviours. Developing interventions to target both the client and clinician is a novel approach in rehabilitation research with previous studies suggesting that it may enhance shared decision-making more than targeting only one group  [36] .\n\nOf interest in this study was the way in which rehabilitation teams chose to work together and include the client to achieve an interdisciplinary common goal focus. The case conference format was redesigned to include a common goal focus rather than discipline specific reporting and to include specific staff and client actions. In this study two sites chose to use the case conference forum (including feedback to the client) to achieve a common, team goal focus. Interdisciplinary models of rehabilitation involve clients as a member of the team however, clinicians in this study were unwilling to involve the client with the team in goal-setting discussions within the case conference. There is limited literature about the inclusion of clients in rehabilitation case conference meetings. One study reported that goal-setting ward rounds that include the client were more beneficial than meetings without the client  [46] . However, previous studies have found barriers to including clients in team meetings including; a lack of clinician skill and confidence to facilitate team discussions in goal-setting meetings with the client present  [21]  and a belief that this approach would be too time consuming  [47] . When reviewing the time commitment involved in including the client in goal-setting meetings one study showed that clinicians spent over 4 h longer each week in goal-setting meetings that included the client than those without the client  [47] . To ensure goal-setting is truly interdisciplinary the client should be considered a member of the rehabilitation team and be included in shared decision-making at each point in the goal-setting process. How this can be achieved in a cost-effective manner with or without the client attending team meetings requires further research. One strategy suggested in this study was to introduce a further expansion on the key worker role to ensure dedicated time was set aside to relay goal-setting information discussed in the case conference with the client.\n\nThree sites implemented or built on existing key worker roles to enhance communication and include feedback channels to clients. A lack of time was reported as the biggest barrier to implementing the key worker role. Clinicians across all sites were concerned that adding specific these roles to their clinical practice may detrimentally impact their workloads. In this study clinician's suggested strategies such as pre-population of the client goal boards to reduce time spent repeating documentation, whilst case conferences were monitored to evaluate time taken to introduce the changes. In Site 2 the client workbook was given on admission to give clients time to read the resource and ensure key worker discussions could be facilitated quicker. Concerns about a lack of time to conduct goal-setting activities has also been reported in many other rehabilitation goal-setting studies  [8, 21, 25, 48] . Clinicians in this study demonstrated a perception that organisational priorities and length of stay presented a barrier to having more time for engaging clients in goal-setting discussions. Some clinicians referenced their lack of staff resourcing as a reason for being time poor in rehabilitation settings. A previous study undertaken in the United Kingdom found staffing ratios as well as time spent in information exchange and in non-clinical activities significantly impacted the face-to-face therapy delivered to stroke survivors  [49] . Whilst many Queensland rehabilitation services have staffing levels below recommended national benchmarks  [50, 51] , how Queensland rehabilitation services are structured and how clinicians structure their day-to-day clinical practice to maximise time for goal-setting discussions is unclear.\n\nSupporting the need for a co-design approach clinicians at all sites stated that they had different requirements for goal-setting interventions and needed to tailor interventions to their service delivery models and different service settings. Also of interest is the number of interventions sites chose to implement with some sites choosing one intervention in addition to education and training and another site choosing to implement all interventions to complement each other. There is little evidence to support implementation of multifaceted interventions over single interventions.\n\nThe co-design process was hypothesised to engage staff and to enhance ownership over goal-setting interventions. Sites within this study demonstrated differing levels of engagement and required different levels of direction to design and tailor goal-setting interventions. All teams in this research study required substantial facilitation throughout the co-design workshops to define solutions to intervention challenges, to develop implementation plans and allocate roles and responsibilities to individual team members. Healthcare services should consider the need for funding, as well as the level of facilitation skills required by individuals to support change when aiming to develop holistic, theoretically informed co-designed healthcare interventions. Further research to explore the impact of these interventions in clinical practice and how teams go about implementing the interventions is warranted."

      "text": "Strengths of this study include the use of a holistic conceptual framework for goal-setting in rehabilitation  [11]  and the use of co-design alongside an implementation process model (KTA) and determinant frameworks (TDF and BCW) to support intervention development and provide a guide for implementation plans  [52] . Overall, the barriers and enablers to implementing the active ingredients of goal-setting in Queensland rehabilitation services are consistent with internationally published research. The framework presented for developing the specific interventions and tools throughout this study can support other teams to evaluate their goal-setting practices and enhance the active ingredients of goalsetting that have the potential to impact client outcomes and autonomy in rehabilitation."
