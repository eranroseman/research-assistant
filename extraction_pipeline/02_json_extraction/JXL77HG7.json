  "title": "Text Messages to Improve Medication Adherence and Secondary Prevention After Acute Coronary Syndrome: The TEXTMEDS Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: TEXTMEDS (Text Messages to Improve Medication Adherence and Secondary Prevention After Acute Coronary Syndrome) examined the effects of text message-delivered cardiac education and support on medication adherence after an acute coronary syndrome. \n METHODS: TEXTMEDS was a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of patients after acute coronary syndrome. The control group received usual care (secondary prevention as determined by the treating clinician); the intervention group also received multiple motivational and supportive weekly text messages on medications and healthy lifestyle with the opportunity for 2-way communication (text or telephone). The primary end point of self-reported medication adherence was the percentage of patients who were adherent, defined as >80% adherence to each of up to 5 indicated cardioprotective medications, at both 6 and 12 months. \n RESULTS: A total of 1424 patients (mean age, 58 years [SD, 11]; 79% male) were randomized from 18 Australian public teaching hospitals. There was no significant difference in the primary end point of self-reported medication adherence between the intervention and control groups (relative risk, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.84-1.03]; P=0.15). There was no difference between intervention and control groups at 12 months in adherence to individual medications (aspirin, 96% vs 96%; \u03b2-blocker, 84% vs 84%; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, 77% vs 80%; statin, 95% vs 95%; second antiplatelet, 84% vs 84% [all P>0.05]), systolic blood pressure (130 vs 129 mm Hg; P=0.26), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2.0 vs 1.9 mmol/L; P=0.34), smoking (P=0.59), or exercising regularly (71% vs 68%; P=0.52). There were small differences in lifestyle risk factors in favor of intervention on body mass index <25 kg/m 2 (21% vs 18%; P=0.01), eating \u22655 servings per day of vegetables (9% vs 5%; P=0.03), and eating \u22652 servings per day of fruit (44% vs 39%; P=0.01). \n CONCLUSIONS: A text message-based program had no effect on medical adherence but small effects on lifestyle risk factors.",

Simple and low-cost methods that are scalable may help address the implementation gap. More than 4.7 billion people own mobile phones and the use of text messages is ubiquitous. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of text message-delivered smoking, physical activity, weight loss, and blood pressure-lowering intervention.  [1] [2] ] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  TEXT ME (Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages)  3  was a single-blind RCT of a 6-month lifestyle-focused text messaging intervention that showed effectiveness, including cost-effectiveness,  11  compared with usual care on cardiovascular risk factors (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], systolic blood pressure [BP], body mass index [BMI], smoking, and physical activity). TEXT ME and several other texting intervention trials have demonstrated small but positive effects on objective measures of cardiovascular risk factors (eg, LDL-C, BP, smoking cessation, and weight) in patients with coronary heart disease  3, 9, 10  and more recently in overall cardiovascular risk factor control in people without coronary heart disease. 11a  Other text message-based intervention studies have demonstrated improved medical adherence in patients with chronic health conditions.  12 he TEXTMEDS intervention (Text Messages to Improve Medication Adherence and Secondary Prevention After Acute Coronary Syndrome), designed to examine whether such a model could be scaled across multiple sites, was implemented after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) admission to improve secondary prevention targets of medical adherence and risk factors. The main aim of the study was to determine in an RCT of patients with ACS the effect of a semipersonalized secondary prevention support program sent by mobile phone text message on the primary outcome of self-reported adherence (the proportion taking appropriate medications at 6 and 12 months) and other risk factor levels at 12 months. We also evaluated adherence using linked administrative data, defined as having purchased a medication supply of 5 or more months separately over the 0-to 6-month and 6-to 12-month periods. We also aimed to determine the acceptability and usefulness of the intervention."

However, intervention participants were more likely to achieve a normal body mass index and to eat guideline-recommended servings of fruit and vegetables. \u2022 Qualitative analysis demonstrated high levels of acceptability, usefulness in being a unified source of information, high program engagement, and emotional support, especially during times of uncertainty.\n\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?\n\n\u2022 Customized and personalized text message-based prevention programs are a scalable and low-cost means of delivering consistent education and support to patients after hospitalization for acute cardiac events. \u2022 The lack of effect on medical adherence, despite better adherence with healthy lifestyle practices, suggests that external factors, such as cost, may strongly influence medical adherence and may need addressing in addition to education programs to improve medical adherence. \u2022 Whereas most new technologies increase overall costs, the linked data analysis found no increased costs and fewer primary care visits and some cardiac tests. This could indicate that such programs could be cost-saving but needs formal evaluation."

The message development,  14  the software development,  15  and the intervention  13  have been described in detail elsewhere. Both groups received usual care after ACS, defined as secondary prevention as determined by the treating team. Intervention participants also received a customized and personalized text message program. The control group did not receive any regular text messages, but both groups received a welcome message that let them know their group allocation, a message at 6 months indicating they would be called for follow-up soon and to not reveal their allocation, and a similar message at 12 months. The intervention program was customized on health data including aspects of their diet, physical activity capacity, and types of medications they were taking. It was personalized by incorporating the participant's preferred name and the hospital at which the participant was treated. The majority of text messages provided information or support on medications and lifestyle modification. The program was structured such that content was roughly split into 3 modules: lifestyle, medications, and general secondary prevention. Hence, approximately one-third of the bank of messages were on lifestyle (diet, exercise, and smoking if relevant), with many of these from the TEXT ME study,  3  another one-third of messages were on cardiovascular secondary preventative medications, and the remaining one-third of messages were on general secondary prevention topics (eg, BP or cholesterol targets, mental health, places and services providing help, and barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence). The medication messages included information on how medications worked, common side effects, and tips on taking medication regularly. Examples of messages include the following: \"Antiplatelet meds (eg, clopidogrel) work with aspirin & prevent blood clots & decrease risk of repeat heart events, <name>, \" and \"Have you started new medications, <name>? Try to understand exactly what your medications do by talking with your Dr or pharmacist. \" Further messages are detailed in our previous study design article.  13 The program aimed to be suitable for low health literacy at the start but increased in complexity over the 12-month program. A dedicated staff member, called a health counselor, based at the central coordinating center reviewed all responses from participants and responded to participants' replies from across Australia. Randomization was in a 1:1 allocation ratio stratified by site through a computerized randomization program. A text message sent after hospital discharge to the patient informed the patient of his or her allocation. The research team was blinded to treatment allocation and the participants were advised not to share their allocation information with the research team. The randomization program was connected to the software program delivering messages, hence minimizing data reentry or sharing of allocation information."

      "title": "Outcomes",
      "text": "Study visits were at baseline, 6 months by phone, and 12 months in person or by phone. The primary outcome was self-reported medication adherence to the 5 classes of medications indicated for secondary prevention after ACS. The 5 classes of medications were angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, statin lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, and adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists. Adherence was measured through asking participants to self-report on how many days in the past 30 days they missed a medication; this was asked for each of the 5 classes of medications at 2 separate time points (6 and 12 months). For the primary end point of self-reported medication adherence, patients were defined as adherent if at both 6 and 12 month time points the proportion of indicated medications taken was >80% (>24/30 days in the preceding 1 month) if not otherwise contraindicated. That is, to meet the primary outcome definition of adherence, data from 10 separate assessments of medical adherence were combined (5 medication classes each at 5 time points). Therefore, we would expect this calculation of overall adherence to give a lower measure of adherence compared with separate assessment of each medication's adherence. If patients reported a class of medication was contraindicated, then this was removed from the denominator. To validate outcomes, we replicated this analysis using linked data from the PBS extract received on May 22, 2020. Adherence was defined as having purchased supply of 5 or more months separately over the 0-to 6-month and 6-to 12-month periods. These data were obtained through extraction of linked data available from government repositories and with a separate participant consent. The PBS is an Australian Government program that subsidizes medicines to make them more affordable and the PBS data set captures national information about prescription medications dispensed from community and hospital pharmacies.\n\nSecondary outcomes were proportion of patients adherent to separate drug classes, LDL-C, systolic BP, diastolic BP, obesity (BMI and waist circumference), a composite of risk factor control (LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L, BP <140/90 mm Hg, exercising regularly [at least 5 days a week for \u226530 min/d of moderate activity], not smoking, and BMI <25 kg/m 2 ), separate behavioral and psychosocial risk factors, cardiovascular events, hospitals readmissions, and all-cause mortality. A formal end point adjudication process was implemented.  13 This comprised a Clinical End Point Adjudication Committee, consisting of independent specialist physicians with clinical and research expertise, adjudicating all potential clinical events according to predefined criteria. End point adjudicators were blinded to the patient's treatment group and were not provided with baseline characteristics. Events were adjudicated by 2 clinically qualified and trained personnel independently, with disagreements reviewed by a third person. The outcomes that underwent adjudication included cardiovascular deaths, noncardiovascular deaths, and undetermined cause of death and cardiovascular hospitalization occurring after registration (ie, signing informed consent) and within 30 days after termination of follow-up. We used linked Medicare Benefits Scheme data to examine health care service use and cost in intervention compared with control groups."

After randomization, 54 participants receiving the intervention requested the text messages be stopped at varying times during the 12-month follow-up period and 1 withdrew consent. Reasons for stopping are listed in Figure  1 .

Downloaded from  http://ahajournals.org  by on July 2, 2025 18 urban or rural centers in Australia in a multicenter RCT. The study found no significant effect on the primary outcome of medication adherence by self-report or on exploratory analyses through pharmaceutical dispensation data. There was no effect on objective measures including LDL-C, weight, waist circumference, or BP. Similar to a previous trial using a similar intervention, intervention participants were more likely to eat guideline-recommended servings of fruit and vegetables. The intervention was safe and did not increase, and may have decreased, health care use.\n\nThere was no significant effect on the primary outcome measure of medical adherence to 5 medication classes, but this study was powered to detect a difference of >10%, which we had hypothesized to be clinically meaningful. To help put the results in context, an RR of 0.93 for our primary outcome (7% difference) would need a sample size of \u22489000 to have \u224890% to detect this difference. There is no consensus on assessing medical adherence and pragmatism and accuracy usually need to be balanced in deciding on the best approach. Adherence is usually reported as a percentage of the prescribed dose taken over a specified time period, but there is no consensus over what constitutes adequate adherence and methods used to measure adherence vary between studies.  17 In this study, we validated the self-reported medication adherence approach taken in the study with concurrent linked data from the PBS, which is a comprehensive data source for all prescribed medications in Australia. We confirmed no significant difference in medication adherence but also demonstrated that self-reported adherence appeared to systematically overestimate prescription refill-confirmed adherence. Self-reported medication adherence questionnaires are convenient, inexpensive, and easy to administer, can provide an immediate assessment of adherence, and is the method that most reflects clinical practice. However, self-report is susceptible to recall and acceptability bias. Furthermore, the variety in self-reported methods used to assess medication adherence in research can introduce significant heterogeneity between clinical trials,  18  which makes comparisons difficult. Objective quantifiable measures of medication adherence, such as pill counts and prescription refill rates, may be more reliable. Although these measures appear simple and objective, they assume that supply equates to ingestion.\n\nWe also found that despite our messages having relatively fewer lifestyle-focused texts and more medication adherence texts compared with our previous programs,  [19] [20] [21] [22]  intervention participants were still more likely to report adherence to healthy lifestyle practices than to have better medication adherence. A possible explanation is that there are external factors affecting intentional (eg, cost) and nonintentional (eg, forgetfulness) medication adherence that were not possible to address with TEXTMEDS. These include social and economic factors such as medication costs,  23  patient-doctor relationship,  24, 25  fixed health beliefs,  26  belonging to an ethnic minority, depression, and reduced social support.  27 n addition, side effects,  28  pill burden/treatment complexity,  29  and treatment of asymptomatic disease  30  can adversely affect adherence and are more difficult to target with mobile health methods. Other possible reasons for no significant effect on medical adherence is that these patients were enrolled soon after discharge and in this setting medical adherence is usually good and hence there is limited room for improvement. There also is a possibility that an intervention on healthy lifestyles may give patients a feeling that if they have a healthy lifestyle they can take fewer medications. Many major pharmacy groups in Australia offer a complimentary text message (or app-based) prescription reminder service, which may have reduced the chances of finding a significant difference between intervention and control groups. We did not acquire data on the proportion of patients who used this or other text message reminder services. In contrast, these external factors may be less applicable to lifestyle behavior change and thus more easily targeted with text messaging, as has been seen in previous studies.  4 TEXT ME showed a greater effect on lifestyle risk factors including improvement of LDL-C and BP compared with TEXTMEDS; however, the TEXT ME and TEXTMEDS programs are fundamentally different. Although we used some lifestyle-focused messages from TEXT ME, the medication adherence context was expanded and the lifestyle content was not the main focus.\n\nOur findings differ from a meta-analysis of 16 RCTs assessing text messaging for medication adherence\n\nTable 3.

When a patient's dosage per day stated at baseline was not available, we assumed 1 refill is a 1-month supply, except for metoprolol tartrate (3.2 months). Adherence was defined as having purchased supply of 5 or more months separately over the 0 to 6 months and 6 to 12 months periods.\n\n\u2021Denominator is the number of patients self-reporting that they have been prescribed the medication and with PBS records available over the first 6 months of the intervention.\n\n\u00a7Denominator is the number of patients self-reporting that they have been prescribed the medication who have not indicated they have stopped taking it at 6 months and with PBS records available over the second 6 months of the intervention.\n\n\u2225Self-reported adherence was defined as taking medication for >24 days out of the previous 30 days at 6 or 12 months. The denominator excludes participants for whom adherence by self-report was missing. Downloaded from  http://ahajournals.org  by on July 2, 2025 in adults with chronic disease. This showed that in a pooled analysis of 2742 patients, participants receiving text messages were more than twice as likely to adhere to medications (OR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.52-2.93]; P<0.001).  12 However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies, median sample size was small (97 participants [range, 21-538]), and the median intervention duration was short (12 weeks [range, 4-48]). In contrast, TEXTMEDS included patients with recent ACS (which may represent more motivated patients because of the recent event as well as being eager to enroll in a clinical trial), had a significantly larger sample size than the individual studies across 15 sites in Australia, and had long-term follow-up. Median age was also low compared with TEXTMEDS (39 vs 58 years) and the included studies evaluated various chronic diseases, with only 5 of the 16 assessing cardiovascular disease. A recent systematic review showed that younger and older patients may have higher rates of nonadherence compared with middle-aged adults.  27 ost new technologies introduced into health care increase overall patient costs, but here the linked data analysis found no increased costs and fewer general practitioner visits and some cardiac tests. The finding is consistent with the cost savings demonstrated in previous text message-based intervention programs,  11  suggesting that the overall costs of health care use do not increase with implementation of this digital health program, but this needs to be formally evaluated in a costeffectiveness analysis.\n\nThe process of implementation evaluation that complemented this study demonstrates the technical success in implementation of this program across Australia. The implementation also demonstrates that providing unified messaging that is perceived helpful by patients improves the patient experience and engenders feelings of support after ACS using a low-cost technology intervention. Further iterations of the program and generations of smartphones have increased the ability for the quality of the content to be enriched with images and videos and not limiting accessibility to participants through existing mobile networks. The descriptive analyses of TEXTMEDS indicated that participants were engaged in the program, with a high number of responses to messages and good overall feedback with respect to program acceptability and perceived usefulness. Separate analyses indicated that supportive and informational messages in particular elicited more message replies.  31 here are several limitations to our study that need to be considered. The study intervention, although evaluated in a randomized design, was not able to be blinded. The primary outcome was self-reported, although there was validation of the primary outcome performed among those who consented to the linked data for medications. Participation in a clinical trial could have caused people in both arms to be more adherent to their medicines.\n\nWe did not assess baseline medical adherence because many participants would not have been on the secondary prevention medications for 30 days at the time of recruitment. There was evidence of cultural diversity in the study population, but only one-fifth of the participants were women, which is consistent with other studies of patients with ACS. The pathology results used in secondary outcome assessments were those drawn from routine care and hence were not centralized and the dates of the tests were unable to be strictly stipulated by study staff because the study had a limited budget and did not include costs of study bloodwork. The study sites represent a broad range of sites across urban and rural Australia and included a culturally diverse population. There was good consistency with respect to the outcomes and findings in terms of overall acceptability of messaging across major regions. This suggests the findings are likely to be generalizable to other regions. Ongoing studies are assessing whether digital health interventions for medication adherence would be effective in different chronic diseases, including heart failure and diabetes.  32 he TEXTMEDS text message-based program to provide education and support to patients with ACS was feasible to implement across 18 centers and 3 time zones in Australia. The program implementation was not associated with increases in the primary outcome of medical adherence, measured by self-report or linkage to medication dispensing, or changes in LDL-C or BP control. Whether customized and personalized text message-based education and support prevention programs offer a means of delivering consistent education and support to patients after hospitalization for acute cardiac events remains uncertain."
