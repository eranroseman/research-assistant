  "title": "Understanding and overcoming barriers to digital health adoption: a patient and public involvement study",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital health (DH) technologies provide scalable and cost-effective solutions to improve population health but face challenges of uneven adoption and high attrition, particularly among vulnerable and minority groups. Purpose: This study explores factors influencing DH adoption in a multicultural population and identifies strategies to improve equitable access. \n Methods: Using a Patient and Public Involvement approach, lay facilitators engaged adults at public eateries in Singapore to discuss motivations and barriers to DH adoption. A semi-structured guide facilitated discussions, followed by an optional socio-demographic survey. Data were analyzed through inductive thematic analysis and mapped to behavior change theory to identify mechanisms of action (MoA) and behavior change techniques (BCTs) to support adoption. Results: Facilitators engaged 118 participants between November 2022 and February 2023. Five key themes were identified from the discussions: (a) awareness of DH solutions, (b) weighing benefits against burdens, (c) accessibility, (d) trust in DH developers and technology, and (e) the impact of user experience. These themes were mapped to 13 MoA and 26 BCTs, informing five key strategies to enhance DH adoption: community-based promotion of credible DH solutions and digital literacy training, brief counselling at opportune moments in healthcare settings, variable rewards tied to personal values, policies ensuring accessibility and regulation, and gamified, user-friendly designs emphasizing feedback and behavioral cues. \n Conclusion: Designing and implementing DH solutions that are accessible, trustworthy, and motivating-integrated within healthcare services and promoted through community efforts-can address barriers to adoption by diverse communities and may help to narrow the digital divide. \n Lay Summary Digital health (DH) solutions, such as mobile health apps and wearable devices, have the potential to improve population health in a scalable and cost-effective way. However, the use of DH is uneven, with minority groups often facing more barriers to adoption. This study aimed to understand why people do or don't adopt DH solutions and find ways to make them more accessible to everyone. Between November 2022 and February 2023, trained community facilitators spoke with 118 people at public food centers across Singapore. Conversations explored people's awareness of DH, their experiences using them, and the challenges they face. Five main themes were identified: awareness of what DH solutions offer, balancing benefits against the effort required, accessibility, trust in the developers and technology, and the importance of a positive user experience. Based on these findings, we identified five strategies to improve DH adoption: (a) promoting DH solutions through trusted community channels with digital literacy support, (b) providing brief counselling in healthcare settings to help people see the value of DH, (c) offering personalized rewards linked to individual goals, (d) ensuring health apps are accessible and properly regulated, and (e) designing user-friendly, engaging tools that motivate long-term use. These approaches could help make DH more accessible and reduce health inequalities.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The development and proliferation of digital health (DH) technologies have shown promise in revolutionizing the way people access health information, adopt healthier behaviors and manage their health. From telemedicine and wearable devices to mobile apps and AI-driven tools, these innovations have the potential to support widespread health promotion and improve population health outcomes at scale  [1] . Indeed, DH solutions that target lifestyle behaviors for the prevention or management of noncommunicable diseases are plentiful. Yet, their adoption remains unevenly distributed, often leaving behind those who are disadvantaged by health, economic, cultural, or social conditions but who stand to benefit the most  [2, 3] . For example, factors such as limited internet access, lower technology confidence, language barriers, and mistrust contribute to their under-representation in DH adoption  [4] . Even among those who adopt, for example, health apps, sustaining long-term engagement and adherence remains a critical challenge  [5, 6] . Research indicates that while initial uptake may be high, usage often declines sharply, possibly due to loss of motivation, lack of personalization, and poor user experience  [7] [8] [9] . Addressing these challenges is essential for maximizing the long-term impact of DH solutions and ensuring that they reach those who need them.\n\nCurrent evidence on DH adoption is largely from highincome Western countries where social, cultural, and environmental influences on health behaviors differ significantly from other regions, such as Asia  [5] . The evidence on user preference and satisfaction with DH solutions also comes from small-scale or controlled trials with narrow eligibility criteria rather than large-scale public health programs that serve more diverse populations, making it difficult to generalize findings or assess acceptability in real-world contexts. Moreover, DH research often underrepresents socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable populations  [10, 11]  limiting our insights to the \"worried well\" and exacerbating the digital divide  [12, 13] .\n\nSingapore offers a unique setting to explore DH adoption. Firstly, smartphone penetration is among the highest globally at 97%  [14] , therefore most of the population has lived experiences using mobile technology. Additionally, as part of its \"Smart Nation\" initiative, Singapore has integrated technology into nearly every aspect of life-business, health, transport, urban living, and government services-exposing its residents to high levels of technology engagement  [15] .\n\nSecondly, preventive health is a priority for the government  [16] , giving residents access to numerous health promotion programs, both online and offline, often free or at low cost  [17] . Finally, Singapore's diverse, multicultural population provides insights into how social and cultural factors, including language, dietary habits, and religious beliefs, shape daily lifestyle choices and health behaviors.\n\nThis study aims to explore the factors influencing DH adoption in a diverse and multicultural population and propose strategies to improve the accessibility and adoption of DH across Southeast Asia. Our work is grounded in the belief that DH, with its ability to transcend geographical and temporal barriers, should play a central role in the future of health promotion for all."

      "text": "A Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) narrative approach  [18, 19]  was used to engage the local community and capture the voices of people from a broad range of backgrounds. This approach reduces barriers to research participation, ensuring valuable insights from all members of the public are heard. The study was conducted between November 2022 and February 2023 and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Singapore (NUS-IRB-2021-956). The study conforms to standards for reporting qualitative research (Supplementary file 1)."

Facilitators were all female university students, who spoke a variety of local languages (English, Malay, Tamil, and Chinese, including Mandarin, Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese) and received hourly wages for their participation. To ensure consistency and adherence to study protocols, they underwent training on study procedures and interview techniques. They were also actively involved in developing the interview topic guide and data capture template.\n\nAll had an interest in DH, but none had any relationship with the participants in the study."

      "title": "Participants",
      "text": "The target sample included Singapore residents aged 21 years or older. Nonrandom sampling was used to facilitate the inclusion of diverse perspectives. Locations were chosen based on the proportion of residents with lower socioeconomic status, the number of dining outlets catering to ethnicity-linked dietary requirements (such as Halal), and proximity to places of worship frequented by ethnic minorities. Inclusivity was favoured over proportional population representation based on age, gender, and ethnicity. Therefore, lay facilitators were instructed to over-sample certain groups (e.g. Malay and older adults) when necessary. Visits occurred at different timings in the morning-noon (9:00AM-12:00PM) and late afternoon-evening (5:00PM-8:00PM) periods on weekdays and weekends to include both working and nonworking participants."

      "text": "Insights from relevant health behavioral change models  [21] , similar exploratory studies on health behaviors and disease prevention  [22, 23] , and lay facilitator perspectives were used to construct an interview topic guide (Supplementary File 2) and corresponding data capture template. Questions covered participants' health-related needs and routines, familiarity with existing DH programs and apps, motivations and barriers to DH adoption, and suggestions to improve uptake and sustained use.\n\nFollowing the PPI Hawker method outlined by Luna Puerta and colleagues  [18] , pairs of lay facilitators approached people at hawker centres to discuss DH, ensuring only individuals who were not eating were approached. The pairing of facilitators was flexible based on their availability for each session. Following a brief study overview and obtaining verbal consent, participants were asked about their familiarity with a range of popular DH programs and apps in Singapore (Supplementary File 3). The conversation flow then varied based on the participant's experience, typically falling into: (i) current DH user, (ii) previous DH user, (iii) aware of DH but never used, or (iv) unaware of DH solutions. One facilitator led the discussion using a semi-structured interview guide, while the other took notes. Conversations lasted between 5 and 10 minutes, followed by an optional anonymous sociodemographic questionnaire available in English and Mandarin (Supplementary File 3). For participants who declined to complete the questionnaire, facilitators estimated their age group, sex (male or female), and ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, Indian, or other). As a token of appreciation, participants were offered a free beverage for their time.\n\nFollowing each session, facilitators reviewed their notes, reflected on their interactions, and added any necessary details. Their notes were discussed with the research team, along with any feedback on the process. This collaborative review allowed the team to reach consensus on the depth and breadth of the discussions, refine questions for future sessions, and ensure data quality. Data saturation was determined using three criteria: (i) a comprehensive understanding of emerging topics, (ii) a sufficiently diverse range of perspectives, and (iii) three consecutive sessions in which no new topics were identified  [22] . Additional prompts were iteratively introduced to ensure thorough coverage of DH, particularly regarding diet management and mental well-being apps, and to elicit more detailed insights into participants' needs and decision-making when engaging with DH programs and apps."

      "title": "Data analysis",
      "text": "All discussion content was recorded in a standardized field note template and linked to the corresponding demographic questionnaire using a unique ID. Notes were organized under the four predetermined categories of DH experience, with some participants contributing to more than one category (e.g. discussing a health app they currently use while also reflecting on one they had stopped using).\n\nSociodemographic data were coded and summarized using descriptive statistics. Facilitator field notes were digitized and analysed using qualitative analysis software (ATLAS.ti, version 24.0.1). We employed a hybrid approach to analysis whereby relevant themes were identified through inductive thematic analysis  [24] , and then deductively mapped to behavioral change theory using the Theory and Techniques Tool  [25] . The analysis was conducted from an essentialist/ realist viewpoint  [26] , aiming to provide clear and straightforward descriptions of the phenomenon of interest, using language closely aligned with the collected data. Firstly, field notes were read several times before codes were generated by one researcher (JLM) and sorted into potential themes in collaboration with a second researcher (JH). Initial themes and results were presented to lay facilitators during a debrief to validate the findings and identify any misinterpretation or missing information. Codes and themes were further refined and mapped to MoA using the Theory and Techniques Tool to identify potential behavioral change techniques (BCTs) that could support DH adoption. One researcher (JLM) conducted the initial mapping which was reviewed by a second researcher (JH) to ensure accuracy and consistency. Only BCTs with empirical evidence linking them to the identified MoA were included, and their relevance was cross-checked against the themes derived from the data. Based on this mapping, one researcher (JLM) formulated potential strategies for implementing these BCTs in a way that could activate the corresponding MoA and address the identified themes. As patterns emerged, these strategies were grouped and refined to develop five key recommendations for enhancing DH adoption. For narrative flow, quotes from the facilitators' notes are presented in the participants' voices."

There was an even distribution of people with experience using DH technologies (N = 76; n = 53 current users, n = 23 previous users) and those without experience (N = 80; n = 51 aware of DH but do not use, n = 29 not aware of DH solutions) [some participants' fell into more than one category due to their experience with different DH solutions]."

    },
    {
      "title": "Awareness of what DH solutions offer",
      "text": "Lack of awareness of available DH programs and apps was one of the most common reasons for not using them. Participants suggested that people are \"not aware of the programs because people are not exposed enough\" (P77, Male, Chinese, aged 31-40 years) or they \"don't know the benefits of the app, so more promotion can be done to promote apps and their benefits\" (P71, Female, Chinese, aged 41-50 years). Despite many praising the government for their efforts to promote healthy living and offer DH programs, some felt the \"government needs to have more campaigns to raise awareness\" (P130, Male, Chinese, aged 31-40 years). Strategies to increase awareness were suggested, including promotion in the community, such as in shopping malls, transport stations, community centres and church groups, as well as more traditional radio or television advertising because an \"oldfashioned way of advertising can give a lot of exposure to everyone (especially older generations)\" and \"apps need to go viral [on social media] before people will notice them\" (P89, Female, Chinese, aged 51-60 years). One of the most common reasons for DH uptake was referral from a trusted person, Understanding digital health adoption such as a family member, friend, employer, or health professional. This could be in the form of a recommendation to use an app (\"my wife encouraged me to use the [Healthy365] app\" P36, Male, Indian, aged 61-70 years), the gifting of a wearable device (\"I got an old version of the Fitbit tracker from a friend and noticed it was good, so I invested in a new one\" P61, Female, Malay, aged 41-50 years), encouragement to participate in a program or challenge with others (\"family member heard [of National Steps Challenge] from a friend and wanted the entire family to try together\" P80 Male, Chinese, aged 21-30 years), or based on health advice from a doctor (\"told by my doctor to lose weight and exercise more\" P35 Female, Chinese, aged 61-70 years)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Weighing of benefits and burdens",
      "text": "A key driver of DH uptake and sustained use was the perception that \"people will only be inclined to use an app if they are aware that it benefits them somehow\" (P74, Female, Malay, aged 21-30 years). Apparent in the data was the phenomenon of a constant \"weighing\" of perceived needs, benefits, and burdens and whether one sees overall value in using a DH program or app. In other words, \"do I want this?,\" \"does it fulfil my needs?,\" \"what do I get out of it?,\" and \"is it worth the effort?.\" Firstly, a key consideration in the uptake of a DH solution is whether individuals perceive their basic need for \"good health and wellbeing\" as already fulfilled. For example, participants who perceived themselves to be leading a healthy lifestyle did not see the need for a health app; \"I don't track calories as I know what I'm eating and I don't need it\" (P68, Female, Chinese, aged 31-40 years), \"I exercise every day at home and do not feel the need to use any applications to track my exercise\" (P3, Male, Chinese, aged 51-60 years), \"I don't need any mental health apps since I don't have issues regarding mental health\" (P115, Male, Chinese, aged 31-40 years). For others, using a DH solution is borne out of a desire to monitor and receive feedback on their health behaviors, such as step counts, exercise, calorie intake, sleep, or heart rate, as well as progress towards predefined goals over time. This could be motivated by a concern for one's health status (e.g. \"my device tracks sleeping patterns to monitor how I sleep because I have irregular heartbeat. If there is anything wrong, I can check immediately\" P69, Female, Chinese, aged 31-40 years) or a perceived need for support in maintaining healthy behavior (e.g. \"it provides a visualization of daily workouts to motivate me\" (P8, Male, Chinese, aged 61-70 years). While such information can be helpful to some, it can have the opposite effect on others: \"it is unhealthy\u2026I became obsessed about counting calories\" (P56, Female, Other, aged 21-30 years) and \"health apps can make users paranoid as they are worried they will not achieve the goal\" (P90, Female, Malay, aged 41-50 years). The desire to use DH could also be dynamic, in the sense that the technology may serve a purpose for some time, but once behavior change has occurred or health status improved, it may no longer be needed; \"once I knew how to do meditation, I didn't need the app anymore\" (P118, Female, Chinese, aged 61-70 years).\n\nAnother important driver of uptake is whether the perceived benefits of a DH solution outweigh the perceived costs of using it. Benefits could be intrinsic, such as health monitoring and receiving feedback (as described above), or extrinsic in the form of incentives (e.g. free activity trackers) and rewards (e.g. exchanging points for shopping or transport vouchers), while costs were largely centred around time burden, financial considerations, or the effort required to engage with an app.\n\nThe initial process of downloading and registering to use a health app, including getting access to activity trackers (even when offered for free), was often perceived as \"too tedious\" (P89 Female, Chinese, aged 51-60 years), and some were unmotivated to even start the process: \"I'm lazy to go and get the free activity tracker as the process takes time\" (P130, Male, Chinese, aged 31-40 years). For many, the technology itself is a barrier. Participants cited a perceived \"lack of time to use health apps\" (P13, Male, Indian, aged 31-40 years) or that they \"refrain from using technology\" because they \"assume a lot of effort is needed to use the apps\" (P16, Female, Indian, aged 61-70 years). Even for those currently using DH, it was noted that \"[apps] can be helpful if used, but it is troublesome to keep using them, and you need to find time to do it and open the app\" (P92, Male, Malay, aged 21-30 years). In such examples, the perceived costs of use outweigh the benefits, therefore people do not adopt them.\n\nFor others, however, the perceived burdens are worth the effort. For example, many people \"track steps to collect points and get vouchers\" (P41, Female, Chinese, aged 51-60 years) with some highlighting this as a \"competitive edge\" over other health apps (P48, Male, Chinese, aged 51-60 years) and that they \"would not use the apps if no rewards are given\" (P132, Male, Chinese, aged 21-30 years). However, monetary incentives need to be \"attractive enough\" (P89, Female, Chinese, aged 51-60 years) to different people to motivate health app use, and if it \"takes too long to accumulate enough points for redemption\" (P80, Male, Chinese, aged 21-30 years) or incentives are \"insufficient\" (P26, Female, Chinese, aged 51-60 years) it can lead to abandonment of the app. Finally, for sustained use, appraisal shifts towards whether the expected benefit is realized and is worth the actual effort involved. For example, one participant explained, \"I started to use [app] because I know the good effect about meditation, but found it hard to see benefits, so I quit\" (P114, Male, Chinese, aged 21-30 years)."

      "title": "Accessibility",
      "text": "Poor digital literacy was frequently identified as a barrier to the adoption of DH. For instance, one participant stated she \"does not know how to use a [smart]phone\" (P126, Female, Malay, aged 61-70 years), while another described herself as \"not app-savvy\" (P58, Female, Indian, aged 51-60 years). Another participant expressed disinterest in learning how to use apps, stating, \"I'm afraid I will forget\" (P27, Female, Chinese, aged 71-80 years). It was suggested that \"health apps should be made to cater to any age group -making it easier to use, especially for the really old and young age groups\" (P76, Female, Malay, aged 41-50 years). Additionally, the language barrier was noted as a significant issue, as many apps are primarily available in English. Participants suggested that offering apps in \"multiple languages, such as Mandarin\" (P19, Male, Chinese, aged 21-30 years), and providing multilingual informational leaflets for older users would help improve accessibility and increase adoption.\n\nThe digital divide is further evidenced by the upfront and ongoing costs associated with using DH solutions. Certain apps are only accessible to users who own specific devices, such as an Apple Watch, or smartphones with sufficient storage capacity, or who have data plans robust enough to use an app without relying on WiFi. For example, health apps that require syncing with a specific smartwatch or wearable tracker exclude those who \"cannot afford an Apple Watch\" (P73, Male, Malay, aged 21-30 years). Even without the need for connected wearables, some people would \"hesitate if [a health app] costs money\" (P111, Male, Filipino, aged 41-50 years) and are reluctant to make \"unnecessary purchases in the name of wellbeing\" (P70, Female, Indian, aged 61-70 years). Several individuals highlighted that their decision to participate in Singapore's National Steps Challenge was based on the free wearable activity tracker that was offered. However, the quality and durability of this free device influences their continued participation because participants are unwilling to \"spend money if the watch spoils\" (P87, Male, Malay, aged 41-50 years) to repair or replace it. Moreover, continued use of an app is often hindered by ongoing or additional costs, particularly in freemium models where basic features are free, but premium features require payment. One participant mentioned discontinuing the use of an app because \"the features I wanted to use required a subscription\" (P122, Female, Chinese, aged 21-30 years)."

    {
      "title": "Trust",
      "text": "Trust in the individual recommending a DH solution and in the technology itself (whether it looks like a legitimate product or not) influences whether one feels it is safe to download a health app and enrol in a DH program. Some participants are \"very cautious and sceptical about apps, and won't anyhow download apps\" (P105, Male, Chinese, aged 61-70 years) and find that \"some apps can be fake\" and \"should have more security\" (P64, Female, Chinese, aged 31-40 years). However, if one trusts the person or organization promoting an app, then the likelihood of uptake is higher. For example, many participants started using a DH solution because they were \"recommended by many friends\" (P43, Male, Chinese, aged 51-60 years) or their \"family introduced the app\" (P33, Female, Chinese, aged 61-70 years [estimated]). Uptake is also enhanced if referred by an authoritative figure such as a health professional or even the government; one participant stated \"I follow my doctor's orders strictly. If the doctor recommends an app to me, I will use it\" (P28, Female, Malay, aged 51-60 years), while another \"will consider trying digital health apps if they are being promoted by the government\" (P117, Female, Chinese, aged 31-40 years). Additionally, trust in the accuracy of the health tracking data provided by a DH solution appears to be crucial for continued use. For example, discrepancies in step count between different apps, inaccurate distance tracking, and glitches with data syncing properly, were among some of the reasons for app abandonment."

      "text": "Sustained use of a DH solution is largely influenced by a continuous appraisal of the perceived benefits versus the associated burdens or costs. This appraisal process is ongoing, and key factors shaping it over time include issues related to compatibility, usability, and performance. Many users noted that not owning a wearable tracker or not having the correct type of tracker limited their ability to use certain apps. In addition, some participants found the process of syncing apps with trackers overly complex. As one user remarked, \"the design and interface for pairing devices should be more user-friendly and compatible with a wider range of devices\" (P32, Male, Chinese, aged 21-30 years). Usability concerns were primarily centred on poor functionality and the need for more intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. Performance problems also contributed to dissatisfaction, with participants complaining about \"laggy\" apps and \"frustrating\" autologouts (P80, Male, Chinese, aged 21-30 years). These technical problems were significant barriers to sustained use.\n\nIn addition to these factors, gamified user experiences emerged as a key element that could facilitate sustained DH use. One participant emphasized the appeal of \"daily challenges that are different every day and relate to various behaviors\" (P121, Female, Chinese, aged 21-30 years). The concept of maintaining a streak was also highlighted as crucial for keeping users engaged, with some describing it as essential for \"keeping momentum\" (P61, Female, Malay, aged 41-50 years)."

Effective evidence-based BCTs that could therefore be used to increase uptake of DH include, for example, \"providing information about health consequences\" through community-based and interactive channels, delivering \"prompts and cues\" through mediums that have high user interaction and in areas with high footfall, and promoting \"social support\" through refer-afriend incentives to increase the likelihood of trusted referrals through word-of-mouth. The weighing of benefits and burdens with respect to the adoption of DH is largely influenced by one's knowledge, beliefs about consequences, and motivation. In turn, BCTs that may be effective include those related to natural consequences (e.g. information about health and emotional consequences, anticipated regret), comparison of behavior (e.g. pros and cons), and reward and threat (e.g. material incentives), which could be collectively addressed through opportunistic brief counselling, such as during routine health screening in, for example, a primary care setting. Beliefs about capabilities, skills, and environmental context and resources underpin accessibility. Here, providing \"instructions on how to perform the behavior\" and practical \"social support\" in a community setting, for example by providing digital literacy training as well as affordable access to DH solutions, through means tested or reimbursement schemes, may assist in broadening the adoption of DH in harder to reach communities. Finally, social influences and one's attitude towards the behavior underpin trust in DH programs and apps, therefore ensuring that only \"approved\" solutions are promoted by a \"credible source\" (e.g. a trusted organization or person) could be achieved through enhanced policies and regulatory process to ensure only legally compliant and evidence-based solutions are made available."

Developers should integrate components that deliver these techniques into DH program and app design. Since the appraisal of benefits versus burdens is a continual process, it is essential to leverage knowledge, feedback processes, motivation, and reinforcement to ensure perceived benefits continue to outweigh the costs. Techniques like goal setting, self-monitoring, biofeedback, and feedback on behavior and outcomes align well with DH capabilities and should also be prioritized in their development. Furthermore, offering varied rewards and incentives that resonate with different core values may encourage continued engagement, since not all users respond to the same incentives. Implementing DH solutions and health monitoring tools within the healthcare system and linking them with electronic medical records will also allow healthcare professionals to enhance brief counselling and feedback processes leading to better integrated care and better management of health. One's general attitude or belief about the trustworthiness of a DH solution influences its continued use. Ensuring that the data accurately reflects the individual and their situation is crucial, and efforts must be made to guarantee the credibility and accuracy of information and feedback. Finally, emotion is a mechanism of action that can underpin user experience, which is closely tied to engagement and, in turn, the potential recommendation of a DH solution to others. As such, ensuring high user satisfaction with DH programs and apps and \"avoiding negative emotions\" such as frustration, disappointment, or anxiety should translate to good long-term engagement and more word-of-mouth recommendations."

      "title": "Uptake of DH solutions",
      "text": "A lack of awareness of available DH solutions remains a significant barrier to their uptake, even in Singapore, where digitalization is high. Our findings indicate a need for more extensive promotion and campaigns in the community to increase knowledge around available DH programs and apps and what benefits they can offer, especially using \"offline\" approaches among the older generations. Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting health-related behaviors and our findings align with evidence that longer and more intense campaigns with message framing around social norms and targeting specific groups, may increase their effectiveness  [27, 28] . Additionally, as shown elsewhere  [29] , we found social influences play a critical role in raising awareness and building trust in DH. Recommendations from family, friends, employers, or healthcare professionals can have a substantial impact on an individual's decision to adopt a DH solution. Leveraging this influence through strategies such as \"refera-friend\" initiatives, corporate social responsibility partnerships, or brief counselling within routine healthcare could be an effective means of promoting DH uptake. However, implementing such strategies would require coordinated, cross-disciplinary efforts to ensure that systems and partners are prepared to support these initiatives  [30] . Moreover, the barriers experienced by healthcare providers in prescribing or promoting DH programs and apps to patients, such as workflow adjustments, inadequate reimbursement, and lack of training  [31] , must be addressed, and regulatory frameworks may be needed before DH solutions can be promoted in the healthcare setting.\n\nOur findings also reinforce the importance of keeping barriers to uptake extremely low. Health behaviors are challenging for individuals to adopt and sustain, particularly when motivation is low  [32] . Additional negative attitudes or ambivalence towards using DH technologies, despite their proven effectiveness in facilitating health behavior change and improving health outcomes  [33] , could further complicate uptake, especially within certain population groups. Individuals also constantly balance the perceived benefits of a DH solution against the effort or burden of using it. Research shows that perceived disease threat and health consciousness influence attitudes towards DH technologies and intentions to use them  [29] , at least initially. Thus, communicating the benefits of a DH solution at key decision-making moments and aligning with an individual's perceived needs and benefits could ensure appraisal in favor of DH adoption. Monetary incentives and rewards can also reduce the perceived burden and promote uptake, as seen in studies from Singapore \u2022 Ensure alternative reward options that appeal to different people, such as reinvestment in public facilities or charity donation, and non-financial rewards such as tree planting, are available."

Nevertheless, unless policy shifts towards greater investment in preventive healthcare, financial reward schemes might not be sustainable in the long-term. Moreover, our findings indicate that monetary rewards may not appeal to everyone, therefore alternative reward structures that align with personal goals, values, and aspirations  [36] , such as charitable donations or tree planting, could increase the appeal and effectiveness of these incentives. Data-driven insights into user behavior and reward preferences could further optimize these systems in a cost-effective way. Finally, our findings underscore the importance of addressing accessibility barriers, particularly concerning upfront costs, digital literacy, and language diversity, when developing new DH programs and apps or refining existing ones. Similar uptake barriers have been identified in a recent systematic review of DH use in culturally diverse populations  [4] . Caution should also be paid to developing apps that rely on data syncing with wearable devices. Even when devices are offered free of charge (as in Singapore), access barriers remain, which limits their uptake. While the adop-tion of wearable devices will grow, they should not be a prerequisite for DH access."

      "title": "Sustained use of DH solutions",
      "text": "Sustaining adherence to DH programs and apps remains a significant challenge. One systematic review of mental health apps \"in the wild\" showed a rate of decline of more than 80% in the first ten days following app download and 30-day retention rates of only 3.3%  [6] . There is evidence to explain the determinants of health app use and factors influencing adherence, such as personalization, integrity, utility, user-friendliness, technical stability, app design, and social and gamification features  [5, 29, 37, 38] . However, our findings go one step further to explain why these factors are important and what strategies may be used to prevent disengagement.\n\nWe found that continued engagement with health apps hinges on factors such as user experience, app design, gamification, rewards, and accurate health monitoring. Decisions to adopt an app are strongly tied to satisfaction, as outlined in technology acceptance models  [39, 40] . Users prefer simple, user-friendly apps, while complex ones lead to frustration and quick abandonment. Studies show that people form initial impressions of apps within four seconds, based mainly on design aesthetics and usability  [41, 42] . Although, factors like perceived usefulness and compatibility may take longer to assess, they are also critical for sustained use. Aligning these aspects with individuals' perceived needs and benefits, personalized health insights, and actionable feedback is crucial. Moreover, digital literacy is a moderating factor to consider  [5, 43] , and ensuring a person has the necessary skills to use the technology and understand the feedback it provides could be vital to their evaluation and adoption of an app. The issue of sustained use extends beyond user experience alone. When the primary goal is interaction with the technology, principles of technology acceptance predominate, and usage is facilitated when tasks are made as effortless as possible-such as passive step tracking. However, when DH solutions serve to promote \"offline\" health behaviors, different factors come into play. Here the relationship between DH use and behavior change is not necessarily causal and can be moderated by individual  [29]  and time-varying factors  [44] . For instance, participants in our study reported discontinuing app use when they felt they no longer \"needed\" the app or when they did not \"see the benefit.\" While such disengagement is concerning for content delivery, it does not necessarily indicate failure, especially if the app has already fulfilled its purpose in facilitating behavior change.\n\nAnother consideration is that an individual's motivation and health needs fluctuate over time  [45] . Participants in this study highlighted that health tracking, reminders, gamification, and rewards together form an effective strategy for sustained engagement with DH solutions, aligning with findings from systematic reviews  [5, 46]  and engagement theories such as the \"Hooked Model\"  [47] . Leveraging longitudinal health tracking data collected through apps and wearables can offer insights into behavioral patterns  [48] , enabling more precise, personalized, and predictive interventions  [49] , especially when adopting machine learning and large-language model approaches. Using these data to send just-in-time adaptive interventions-delivered at moments when users are most receptive and in need  [50] [51] [52]  -may further enhance engagement, especially when connected to personally relevant goal-directed activities in everyday life  [53] . Gamification strategies, such as streaks and challenges, have been shown to enhance motivation and encourage continued use, making DH programs and apps more effective  [54] . Financial rewards appear to be highly effective in stimulating initial uptake if they are 'worth the effort' to the user, but their effectiveness in sustaining engagement is still debated  [23] . While there is some evidence that people do respond to this strategy  [35] , more research is needed to better understand the effects of differentiated incentive and reward schemes on long-term DH engagement  [55] .\n\nFinally, financial considerations, such as the cost of wearable devices and ongoing subscription fees, also emerged as significant barriers to sustained use, highlighting the importance of affordability in ensuring equitable access to and use of DH. Despite the widespread use of freemium business models in the health and wellness industry  [56] , participants in this study were dissatisfied with apps that adopted the approach, citing it as the reason for their disengagement. Other research has also highlighted the ethical issues caused by withholding health-related support to those in needparticularly concerning mental health-based on financial payment  [56] . Such practices may contribute to health disparities. The introduction of certification, quality assurance, and approvals of DH solutions from regulatory bodies leading to reimbursement through the healthcare system may make such paid-for services more accessible."

These varied viewpoints, especially from those who are not using DH, offer valuable insights into the reasons for non-adoption and potential strategies to address them. It should be noted that, when contrasting our sample characteristics with Census data, we may have over-sampled younger people (aged 21-40 years) and under-sampled those without formal secondary education or with higher household incomes (>$10 000 SGD). Furthermore, the findings should be considered alongside the highly digitized landscape in Singapore which may limit generalzability to other countries.

Support should be personalized where possible, based on biofeedback, electronic medical records, and health monitoring data, and embedded within the healthcare system to ensure integrated care; (3) variable incentives and rewards: provision of incentives and rewards that appeal to different core values and can be sustained long term and are easy to redeem; (4) policy and regulatory processes: introducing regulatory processes whereby only DH solutions that are approved and legally compliant (by relevant authorities and standards) can be made available to consumers; and (5) prioritizing user experience: following principles of user centred design and prioritizing the inclusion of digital components that facilitate self-regulation of health and behaviors as well as gamified elements that link to rewards."
