  "title": "The Effectiveness of Self-Management of Hypertension in Adults Using Mobile Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Effective treatment of hypertension requires careful self-management. With the ongoing development of mobile technologies and the scarcity of health care resources, mobile health (mHealth)-based self-management has become a useful treatment for hypertension, and its effectiveness has been assessed in many trials. However, there is a paucity of comprehensive summaries of the studies using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Objective: This systematic review aimed to measure the effectiveness of mHealth in improving the self-management of hypertension for adults. The outcome measures were blood pressure (BP), BP control, medication adherence, self-management behavior, and costs. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using 5 electronic databases. The snowballing method was used to scan the reference lists of relevant studies. Only peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2010 and September 2019 were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by 3 researchers independently, adhering to the validation guideline and checklist. Both a meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis were carried out. Results: A total of 24 studies with 8933 participants were included. Of these, 23 studies reported the clinical outcome of BP, 12 of these provided systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) data, and 16 articles focused on change in self-management behavior and medication adherence. All 24 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. According to the meta-analysis, a greater reduction in both SBP and DBP was observed in the mHealth intervention groups compared with control groups, -3.78 mm Hg (P<.001; 95% CI -4.67 to -2.89) and -1.57 mm Hg (P<.001; 95% CI -2.28 to -0.86), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed consistent reductions in SBP and DBP across different frequencies of reminders, interactive patterns, intervention functions, and study duration subgroups. A total of 16 studies reported better medication adherence and behavioral change in the intervention groups, while 8 showed no significant change. Six studies included an economic evaluation, which drew inconsistent conclusions. However, potentially long-term financial benefits were mentioned in all economic evaluations. All studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Conclusions: This review found that mHealth self-management interventions were effective in BP control. The outcomes of this review showed improvements in self-management behavior and medication adherence. The most successful mHealth intervention combined the feature of tailored messages, interactive communication, and multifaceted functions. Further research with longer duration and cultural adaptation is necessary. With increasing disease burden from hypertension globally, mHealth offers a potentially effective method for self-management and control of BP. mHealth can be easily integrated into existing health care systems.",

      "text": "Hypertension is the underlying cause of around 20% of deaths globally  [1] . The causes of hypertension are largely lifestyle related  [2] . Poor control is known to be related to failure to diagnose cases and inadequate treatment  [3] . On average, in high-income countries, around 67% of hypertension sufferers are diagnosed, with 55% treated and 28% achieving control. In contrast, in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), around 37% of the hypertensives are diagnosed, of whom 29% are treated, with 8% achieving control  [4] . The annual worldwide costs to the economy of hypertension are estimated at US $370 billion  [5] . Considering unequal health care resource coverage, mobile health (mHealth) presents exciting potential in developing self-management for patients with hypertension with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP)  [6] ."

      "title": "Self-Management",
      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines self-management as the capability of individuals to manage their own health conditions, with or without the support of health care providers  [7] . The methods of self-management include education for patients, self-monitoring of clinical data, and behavior (eg, diet, exercise, smoking, and drinking), self-titration of medical management, and support for medication adherence as per prescribed regimes  [8] . A systematic review conducted by Barlow et al  [9]  documented that education on self-management can not only improve patients' knowledge of hypertension but can also allow for early detection of high BP. Another study reported that the self-management of hypertension enables patients to correctly self-titrate medications and irreversibly change the dynamics between doctors and patients  [10] . mHealth is emerging as a vital platform to perform self-management, especially for chronic diseases  [11] ."

      "title": "Mobile Health",
      "text": "mHealth is the use of mobile devices-such as mobile phones, patient-monitoring devices, and wireless devices-for medical support and the delivery of health management  [12] . The use of mobile devices has increased exponentially, worldwide-over 7 billion mobile device subscriptions were reported in 2015  [13] . This clearly facilitates the feasibility, generalizability, and replicability of mHealth. WHO first defined the term mHealth in 2010. Since then, mHealth technology has been more widely available and sophisticated  [14, 15] . mHealth employs a variety of different features, including SMS text messages, emails, phone calls, and mobile phone apps  [16] . The benefits of mHealth are widely acknowledged. It can contribute to achieving universal health coverage by overcoming geographical barriers, increasing access, and the provision of health services to remote populations and underserved communities. Clinical data monitoring and educational information communications, between physicians and patients, cost less than in-person services, as the implementation of mHealth does not utilize any further resources  [17] . mHealth stands at the crossroads of communication technologies and personalized health care  [18] ."

A few others have examined the content of the intervention, the study population, and economic evaluation  [20, 21] . Further research has investigated the effects of mHealth self-management intervention in relation to the adherence and self-titration of medication of diabetes  [22] . Results were consistent in that mHealth-enabled self-management solutions could provide benefits for chronic conditions, increasing access to health care, as well as improving health care quality and patient involvement  [23] ."

      "title": "Research Gap",
      "text": "There is limited literature looking at the effectiveness of mHealth in hypertension self-management. A systematic review narratively synthesized the evidence for using mHealth devices to support hypertension self-management. The study reported lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the intervention group compared with usual care  [24] . Only using quantitative methods, a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted by Lu et al  [25]  concluded that mHealth is an effective tool for BP control. We know of no other reviews that examined the relationship between long-term self-management and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, further exploration of the relationship between mHealth-enabled hypertension self-management and clinical outcomes needs to be conducted. This would enable relevant stakeholders to weigh the potential benefits and limitations of adopting mHealth into health care services. Thus, we aimed to determine whether mHealth is effective in improving the self-management of hypertension for adults. We systematically reviewed the existing evidence to analyze the effectiveness of mHealth-enabled self-management among hypertensive adults with the following 3 objectives:\n\n1. 1. To measure whether the use of mHealth-enabled self-management improves the control of BP among patients with hypertension.\n\n2. 2. To assess whether self-management education of hypertension delivered by mHealth interventions improves medication adherence and promotes lifestyle change. 3 . 3. To analyze the costs of self-management support for the delivery of mHealth interventions for hypertension in adults."

Patients with hypertension with SBP lower than 140 mm Hg and DBP lower than 90 mm Hg were considered to have adequate BP control  [27] . Review Manager of the Cochrane Collaboration (RevMan 5.3, Cochrane Organization) was used to perform the meta-analysis.\n\nFor continuous outcomes, the effect size was defined as the mean differences (MDs) in BP between intervention and control groups. For dichotomous outcomes, the effect size was defined as the odds ratio (OR) of the proportion of patients with controlled BP between intervention and control groups. OR and MDs were derived from Manzel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods, respectively. A random-effect model was utilized to generate pooled estimates of the overall effects and reported 95% confidence intervals with all measures of effect. The I 2 statistic was used to examine inconsistencies across studies (I 2 =0%-100%; more than 50% is considered as substantial statistical heterogeneity). We defined subgroups in advance to further evaluate the relationship between intervention characteristic and the clinical effect on SBP and DBP controlling for (i) frequency of reminders (tailored frequency according to the health status of participants or fixed frequency as planned);\n\n(ii) interactive patterns (interventions with a patient-provider loop interaction or without); (iii) intervention functions (single and multifaceted); and (iv) duration of trials (longer or equal to was performed by excluding each study sequentially to determine the influence of any single study on the robustness of the results.\n\nOwing to the heterogeneity in the nature of interventions and diverse outcomes of effects of self-management, we have also presented a narrative review of the findings, including structured tabular summaries according to medication adherence, change in self-management behavior, and costs."

RL, FB, and NL independently assessed the risk of bias and quality of the included studies. A consensus meeting was held to enable the comparison of notes from the selection of papers used within this review. An agreement was reached on conflicting points.\n\nThe risk of bias was assessed according to guidance in the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias handbook for RCTs  [28] . Risk ratings of \"low,\" \"high,\" and \"unclear\" were assigned to each bias based on the presence of the following items: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. If any element was rated as high risk, the overall risk of bias was high. Funnel plots were used to detect publication bias if over 10 articles were involved in the meta-analysis. When the description of the interventions or procedures was not sufficiently detailed to judge the risk of bias, researchers contacted the study author for further information.\n\nThe quality of the included studies was evaluated by the Mobile Health Evidence Reporting and Assessment (mERA) Checklist [29]. This checklist was developed from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth (CONSORT-EHEALTH) checklist and has been extended to a wide range of mHealth interventions. It consists of 2 separate assessments: (1) essential criteria for mHealth, which comprise 16 items that identify the content, context, and technical features, to ensure the quality and generalizability of mHealth research. (2) methodological criteria, which include 26 items that are based on existing study design and study-reporting guidelines. The result was displayed by using the rate of reported items."

Heterogeneity was moderate (\u03a7 2 9 =18.11, P=.03; I 2 =50%).\n\nSubgroup analyses were generally consistent with the main finding, showing significant reductions in SBP and DBP in the intervention groups for all subgroups analyzed (Table  1 ). Trials with a tailored frequency of reminders  [32, 37, 41, 42] , a patient-doctor interactive loop  [31, 32, 38, 41, 42, 47, 49] , and multifaceted functions  [31, 37, 38, 42, 49]  showed a larger overall effect of both SBP and DBP, compared with trials with a fixed frequency of reminders  [31, 33, 38, 39, 43, 47, 49, 51] , a noninteractive loop  [33, 37, 39, 43, 51] , and a single function  [32, 33, 39, 41, 47, 51] . The overall SBP reduction is greater in studies that lasted less than 12 months  [31, 33, 37, 39, 49, 51]  than studies that lasted longer than 12 months  [32, 38, 41, 47] . Further sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing any trials sequentially, revealing no substantial difference in the overall effect for SBP and DBP. In addition, Margolis et al  [42]  was regarded as the main article that influenced the heterogeneity of the comparison of SBP according to the sensitivity analysis. After excluding it from the analysis, the I 2 statistic was reduced from 49% to 24% (df=15; P=.18). XSL \u2022 FO RenderX Figure 3.

A total of 7 articles reported statistically significant improvement in medication adherence in intervention groups  [32, 34, 39, 41, [49] [50] [51] . Five studies suggested that mHealth interventions improved medication adherence, despite nonsignificant outcomes  [33, 35, 37, 41, 44] . Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used in 6 studies  [35, 37, 39, 42, 50, 51] . As a result, Bove et al  [33]  reported that there is no association between medication adherence and BP control, that is, an improvement in adherence did not necessarily lead to better BP control. Of the 9 articles that focused on the behavioral change of self-management, all reported positive effects either through physical activities or through a healthier diet. Adverse events reported in studies, such as medication side-effect and cardiovascular event, were unrelated to self-management and were evenly distributed across intervention and control groups. An exception to this was McKinstry et al  [37] , who found 3 patients became anxious as a result of self-monitoring. Of which, 6 studies conducted qualitative research about satisfaction related to the intervention  [31, 32, 35, 37, 47, 50] . All showed high levels of satisfaction. Patients and physicians were keen continuing to practice mHealth."

Two studies found the cost of mHealth interventions was lower than that of control  [44, 47] . The measurements of expenditure varied between study settings. The main cost was from monitoring, mobile phone use, connection charges, and cost of nurse support. However, Davidson et al  [44]  adjusted the BP control effect into the cost analysis, which means that patients with controlled BP after receiving the experimental treatment saved the extra cost of further treatment. This showed an overall health care cost saving of over US $20,000 between intervention and control groups."

Others were judged to be unclear as the procedure of the sequence generation was not classified  [31] [32] [33] [34] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [50] [51] [52] .

The risk of detection bias was high in 4 articles  [37, 38, 43, 46] , as these studies were unmasked to outcome assessors; 13 studies were rated as unclear, as there was an insufficient illustration of whether they blinded the outcome investigators  [32] [33] [34] [35] 41, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] 50, 52] ; 2 studies were double-blind trials in which participants were blinded to treatment conditions  [36, 53] . The control groups consisted of sending different messages compared with the intervention groups. Four articles reported no missing data from the baseline to the endpoint  [47, 49, 51, 52] . Low risk of attrition bias was found in 8 studies  [43, 44, 46, 47, 49, [51] [52] [53] . They reported that less than 5% of participants withdrew from the follow-up were analyses on an intention-to-treat basis for the missing data. Four studies had a high risk of attrition bias as the rate of dropout was over 15% in each study  [30, 33, 40, 48] . 92% (22/24) of the total studies were defined as low risk of reporting bias because all outcomes included in the protocol were reported in the results  [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [41] [42] [43] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . Missing pre-specified outcomes occurred in 2 articles resulting poor clarity in reporting bias  [40, 44] . In addition, funding bias was considered. Two articles mentioned that OMRON, which makes sphygmomanometers, including for home use, donated the BP device  [31, 49] . This was identified as a funding bias. Figure  5  describes the total risk of bias in the 24 studies.

      "text": "This systematic review found 24 RCTs with 8933 adult patients with hypertension, which met the criteria to assess the effectiveness of mHealth-enabled interventions in supporting self-management. According to this meta-analysis, mHealth interventions resulted in better BP control, with a significant decrease of SBP and DBP by 3.78 mm Hg and 2.19 mm Hg, respectively, compared with usual care. All 24 studies showed a greater decrease in mHealth intervention groups than the control groups. Findings of this review confirmed that self-management education through mHealth was effective in increasing patients' knowledge of hypertension and a healthy lifestyle, medication management, and self-efficacy.\n\nOutcomes of the economic evaluations were inconsistent across the studies. A total of 2 articles reported the negative outcomes of cost focused on direct costs  [37, 42] . The cost of mobile technology was shown as relatively high in rural areas. In contrast, the cost of health professionals' time in consulting in urban areas was higher than that in the rural. Thus, cost became an inevitable element when considering barriers and facilitators."

      "title": "Mobile Health Intervention Design",
      "text": "All interventions were conducted via mobile technologies. A total of 3 elements may have contributed to the effectiveness of self-management: First, the high intensity of medication reminders. Most studies focused on medication adherence adopted weekly automated alerts and educational or motivational messages. This increased exposure to interventions, which is impossible in routine care. Brennan et al  [41]  conducted a comparison between the different intensities of messages and showed that a higher frequency of SMS text messages achieved better medication adherence. However, previous research has shown that reported high-dose reminders would result in response fatigue  [54] .\n\nSecond, user-driven designs were frequently reflected in the interventions and consisted of customized information and patient-provider loop interactions. A total of 11 studies reported 2-way communication between patients and physicians  [31, 32, 38, 41, 42, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53] . All interventions with an interactive communication loop showed significantly positive improvement in self-management behavior and BP change. These findings were consistent with the subgroup analysis in this review. Tailoring the intervention to the specific situation and readiness of patients is considered as crucial to self-management  [55] . Particularly, Liu et al  [36]  compared the user-driven and expert-driven group behavior change. The expert-driven group showed better behavior change, perhaps because patients from the expert-driven group had more feedback, motivational commands, and support from physicians.\n\nFinally, most of the interventions combined different functions. A total of 12 interventions had more than 2 functions  [31, [36] [37] [38] 40, 42, 44, 46, 49, 50, 52, 53] , and 10 studies relied on SMS text messaging as their main method, while they also linked the BP monitoring devices to a Web-based system  [32, 34, 37, [43] [44] [45] 47, [49] [50] [51] . According to this subgroup analysis, studies with multifaceted functions had a larger effect on SBP and DBP reduction than those with a single function. In conclusion, the tailored frequency of messages based on patients' health status and readiness, two-way interactive communication, and multifaceted interventions can produce better effectiveness in the self-management of hypertension."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations of Studies Included in This Review",
      "text": "Significant heterogeneity showed in the meta-analysis of SBP. The reason for this is the variation in interventions. It also affects the calculation of the overall estimate  [56] . According to the sensitivity analysis, Margolis et al  [42]  was regarded as the main article, which influenced the heterogeneity.\n\nThe occurrence of heterogeneity highlighted the strengths and limitations of the included studies. Strengths are illustrated as follows: first, more than half (13/24, 54%) of the total studies conducted power calculations for clinical data outcomes  [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] 42, 43, 46, 48, 51, 53] . Second, the description of each intervention provided clear and sufficient details, allowing a thorough understanding of the method. Finally, the reporting rate of detail in the research methods was high within all articles. Over 80% (21/26) of the items listed in the mERA methodological checklist were described in these studies. This showed significant progress compared with the studies included in the previous review  [57] .\n\nParticularly, self-reporting bias of compliance is clearly a potential weakness of mHealth. It would increase the risk of recall and social desirability bias. The reliability of self-reporting depends partly on the educational, socioeconomic, and cultural background of participants  [58] . However, studies included in this review attempted to reduce the self-reporting bias. A total of 17 articles used self-reporting in their studies  [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] 50, 52, 53] . Of the 17 articles, 12 articles took steps to test the validity of self-reporting data, including home visits for behavior checks, BP monitoring devices connected to websites, and random phone calls to check medication adherence  [31, 33, 35, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] 47, 52, 53] .\n\nReferring to the limitations, the duration of the studies included was relatively short. Only 10 studies lasted for or over 1 year  [32, 38, [41] [42] [43] [46] [47] [48] 51, 52] . The result of subgroup analysis according to the duration of trials found in this study was similar to a previous meta-analysis, which compared digital interventions with conventional methods  [59] . The overall effects of SBP and DBP were inconsistent between studies with shorter and longer durations. Thus, more evidence is needed to confirm the long-term effect of mHealth. Though all articles were published after 2010 when the CONSORT-EHEALTH statement for reporting of eHealth and mHealth interventions was released  [60] , many mHealth intervention details were still unreported. Though performance bias was a prominent weakness in mHealth intervention, it can be explained by the interactive nature of the interventions, which is difficult for participants to be blinded to their health care providers  [61] . Small sample size was also prominent in the included studies, which would cause a huge difference in the estimates of the target population.\n\nIn addition, all studies were from high-middle and high-income countries. Similarly, the study sites were mostly in urban settings, which restricts the diversity of the target populations. This is despite the fact that one of the important benefits of mHealth is to allow patients to receive adequate care remotely  [19] . Davidson  [44]  reported more considerable cost savings in the mHealth group than in the control group in the study of underserved populations.\n\nThe relatively homogeneous populations limited the generalizability of the mHealth intervention. It is also important to consider culture-related differences, racial diversity, and the heterogenetic patterns of mHealth interventions, which have been mentioned in discussion of almost all articles. Nevertheless, only 5 studies have examined the potential cultural adaptation of mHealth in different settings  [31, 32, 35, 41, 50] . Specifying cultural and contextual adaptabilities of mHealth interventions would help clarify whether the study design can be considered as a potentially useful platform for future research. Other observable limitations include the fact that only 6 articles reported users' satisfaction  [31, 32, 35, 37, 47, 50] .\n\nIn relation to economic evaluations, mHealth showed only a small short-term economic benefit, but enormous potential in the longer term  [62] . However, the longest duration of studies in this review is 18 months  [46, 52] ."

More importantly, this review adds to a body of knowledge of the strengths and limitations of included studies against the mERA checklist.\n\nThe chief weakness is the observed heterogeneities in relation to the intervention and control features. In addition, this review only recruited RCTs and excluded other designs with analyses that might also have overcome confounding. The language was restricted to English, which reduces the diversity of studies analyzed. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis was only conducted by excluding each trial sequentially to determine the influence of a single study. Owing to the small number of studies included, studies were not divided into different categories for further sensitivity analyses."

There is increasing interest comparing benefits of mHealth approaches. Questions remain to be addressed about the values of diverse mHealth methods. To promote mHealth interventions of self-management effectively and efficiently, more clinical studies are warranted to detect the relationship between the specific intervention pattern and outcomes. In addition, patients' compliance with self-management interventions should be examined in the future.\n\nAccording to the generalizability, there is a necessity to determine whether mHealth-based self-management methods should be tailored to age groups, cultural contexts, or need to be extended to include support from health care personnel. Therefore, training physicians to ensure that patients' behaviors are maintained and adopted convincingly is also necessary."

This review clearly demonstrated that an mHealth-enabled hypertension self-management intervention was effective in improving SBP, DBP, and BP control. Both medication adherence and self-management behavior showed positive changes after the intervention. Economic evaluations presented potential cost saving in long-term effectiveness. It is the first analysis that combines clinical data and intervention features.\n\nIn conclusion, mHealth self-management has proved to be a potentially useful intervention strategy for BP management. mHealth interventions could be beneficial for BP control at the individual level and in reducing the burden of hypertension at the population level. The development of mobile technologies is especially useful when health care resources are inadequate. The broader utilization of mHealth self-management will be an important contributor to improving the quality of health care and meeting the target of universal health coverage."
