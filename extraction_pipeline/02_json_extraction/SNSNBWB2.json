      "text": "Tel emonitoring refers to the recording and tracking of medical data by patients and health care professionals (HCPs) at a distance. This method of care may be particularly relevant for the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, which require intensive daily monitoring and behavioral adjustment. Diabetes self-management includes self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) readings, taking medication, exercise, dietary management, and foot care. Evidence suggests that SMBG alone may be of limited clinical effectiveness. This may be because patients are unable to interpret results and hence make adjustments to self-care.  1, 2 By providing patients with the tools needed to review, interpret data, and receive feedback, telemonitoring could facilitate self-management.\n\nIn the past, telemonitoring applications relied on homebased technologies, but with mobile devices, patients can transmit data in real time, at any time and in any place. This also means feedback can be received when it is most relevant. The ubiquitous nature of these wireless technologies is an important development, with potential to impact diabetes management.\n\nA number of systematic reviews have examined the use of telehealth in diabetes, looking at a range of technologies, including fixed and mobile equipment.  [3] [4] ] [5]  Where reviews focused only on mobile platforms, a variety of interventions were included; for example, interventions aiming to increase peer support, educate, or remind patients of appointments or self-care activities.  [6] [7] ] [8] [9]  Some reviewed both pediatric and adult samples, despite their differences in the management of diabetes and use of technology. Inclusive reviews are useful to gain a better understanding of ongoing research in the field. When looking at clinical effectiveness, however, reviews that focus on specific interventions or intervention components are needed for conclusions to be precise and reliable. This review aims to examine the evidence for the clinical effectiveness [glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)] of mobile telemonitoring to support diabetes management in adult patients. It focuses on interventions including the transfer of data to a Web server to receive feedback."

Studies that were not randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled trials were assessed against nine of these areas, as blinding was not relevant. To achieve a \"strong\" rating, RCTs and controlled trials had to be rated \"strong\" in at least 6 of the 10 areas and have no areas rated \"weak.\" Other study designs required five or more strong ratings out of nine and no weak ratings."

Figure  1  illustrates stages of the paper selection process for the 2009 search and 2012 update. Titles and abstracts were screened, leading to the review of a total of 146 full texts. A total of 24 publications matched the selection criteria. Three additional papers  [11] [12] [13]  were used for data extraction purposes; they provided no additional clinical data but further information on the methodology or intervention tested in two of the reviewed studies. The 24 identified publications described 20 studies. Seven papers  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  published by the same group of authors evaluated the same intervention with some appearing to describe the same sample. The seven papers were independently examined by two authors and divided into three different studies. One study (2 papers  18, 20  ) focused on an intervention delivered to obese patients. A second study (4 papers  [15] [16] [17] 19  ) evaluated the same intervention in a population not restricted to obese patients. Eac  of these 4 articles presented different follow-up periods, and 1 paper presented a subgroup analysis based on baseline HbA1c.

Participants were required to transmit information on meal content and received automated feedback on protein, carbohydrate (CHO), calorie, and fat intake. An algorithm-based insulin dose was suggested in two of these studies. Of these, one study investigated whether the use of such a system could reduce the amount of hours usually spent on CHO-counting education; the mhealth group received a shortened version of the standard CHO education and used the device while the control group received the full version.\n\nIn the remaining studies on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, participants transferred a combination of one or more of the following to a Web server: BG readings, blood pressure readings, weight, exercise, diet, medication, free text, and/or their level of wellbeing. Reminders to transmit were part of the intervention protocol in seven studies. Of these, two  27, 29  were on type 1 diabetes; in one,  29  patients were reminded to transmit when there were too few readings for clinical judgment, and in another,  27  patients were reminded to transmit if less than three readings were sent daily. In some studies on type 2 diabetes, patients who did not transmit sufficient data were withdrawn.  [14] [15] [16] 7] [18] [19] [20] 30, 35  Health care professional feedback was provided in the majority of studies and included treatment recommendations, encouragements, reminders, advice, and corrections to lifestyle. In some cases, only patients with an out-ofrange BG reading or high-risk profiles were contacted, while in others, all participants received feedback regardless of their BG values. Automated feedback was an intervention component in nine studies and was delivered via text message, on an accompanying patient Web portal, or via letter. Graphical feedback was provided in seven studies and was a representation, sometimes color-coded, of BG values over time. This was offered in addition to HCP feedback in five studies. Only one study included both automated text and HCP feedback. It suggests that providing automated text feedback is considered as a good alternative to HCP feedback when resources are limited."

      "text": "For studies evaluating a diet-focused intervention, results were mixed. The single-group trial,  25  which was rated poor quality, failed to find any significant change in HbA1c post-intervention. The sample size remained small (n = 41), making the generalizability of the findings limited, and authors failed to report the number of participants completing the study. In addition, the frequency at which HCPs reviewed patient data and provided feedback was not specified. When the mhealth technology plus a short version of standard CHO education was compared with standard CHO education in the multinational RCT,  24  no difference was found between groups, but significant reductions in HbA1c were observed at 6 months in both groups. Although results are useful in suggesting mhealth could effectively replace part of the standard CHO-counting education, this study was rated of moderate quality. Little detail was provided on the content of the education sessions, which makes it difficult to identify which intervention components are necessary for intervention effectiveness. Authors also failed to report outcome differences between countries, although variations in dietary habits and intervention delivery (despite efforts to standardize) might have influenced results. Finally, the remaining dietary intervention compared twice-weekly transmission of BG and diet information with feedback from a HCP to standard care in a crossover trial.  23 A significant reduction in HbA1c was reported only in the group with a significantly shorter diabetes duration (5.3 versus 11.8 years), suggesting this tool might be particularly useful for patients recently diagnosed. This study, however, was also rated as poor quality. It included only 20 participants, and there was no washout period between study periods to avoid carry-over effects.\n\nResults of studies on non-dietary interventions were inconclusive with two  27, 28  of the four studies supporting the effectiveness of mhealth. Monitoring patients via mhealth led to significant improvements in HbA1c after 3 months in a before-and-after study  27  involving submission of data via mobile phone and access to graphics via a Web portal. Participants were sent a reminder to transfer every day on which less than three BG readings had been transmitted. This particularly intensive protocol for reminders may have ensured high use of the equipment and contributed to success of the intervention. This study, however, was rated poor in quality, a sample size of 10 being the major issue. A RCT  28  comparing mhealth with either intensive graphical feedback and nurse support or minimal graphical feedback only found significant improvements in HbA1c in both groups at months 4 and 9. This suggests that significant changes can occur regardless of the intensity of the graphical feedback provided and that HCP input may not be an essential ingredient to intervention success. Although the study had a larger sample size than many of the studies reviewed, it was slightly below the  www.journalofdst.org J Diabetes Sci Technol Vol 6, Issue 5, September 2012 number of participants required for adequate power. Authors also failed to report if outcome assessors were blinded. Interestingly, the response rate in this study was relatively low (52%) despite recruiting an age group (18-30 years) that may be keen to use technology. Finally, no significant clinical changes were observed in the two remaining studies examining transfer of BG readings via personal digital assistant and mobile phone plus HCP and graphical feedback.  26, 29 Unlike the majority of studies reviewed, patients were limited to transferring BG readings only in these two studies. Asking patients to transfer more information may increase awareness and understanding of the relationship between BG readings and lifestyle factors, making it possible for patients to act upon them in an effective way. In addition, G\u00f3mez and colleagues  26  asked patients to transmit BG readings fortnightly, which is considerably less frequent than other studies. Research regarding optimal transmission frequency is, however, lacking. In terms of methodological quality, intervention participants in the study by V\u00e4h\u00e4talo and associates  29  received twice as many testing strips as control participants, thus enabling increased monitoring and thereby introducing bias. In addition, the trend toward HbA1c deterioration in both groups was linked to the calibration differences between the machines used to test HbA1c. This suggests lack of methodological rigor in the conduct of the study, potentially biasing results."

      "text": "In the studies published by the same group of authors, the intervention included transmission of BG readings by mobile phone and weekly text message recommendations. In the 12-week program using a single-group design, 14 a significant pre-to-post reduction in HbA1c was found. Although the reduction from baseline to follow-up was clinically significant (1.1%), the sample size was small. With 26% (n = 12) of the sample excluded from the analysis, it would have been particularly relevant to investigate differences between patients who did not engage with the equipment or dropped out and those who completed the research. However, such analyses were not reported by the authors, nor were reasons for nontransmission of patient data. When applied to patients with a body mass index >23,  18, 20  this intervention led to a significant improvement in HbA1c in the intervention group compared with the control group. Following a group of participants longitudinally,  [15] [16] [17] 19  significant differences between the intervention and control groups were found at 3, 9, and 12 months. In a subgroup analysis,  15  significant improvements in HbA1c were observed at 3 months for intervention group participants with a baseline HbA1c of \u22657% but not for the control group participants with the same baseline HbA1c. As might have been expected, however, no significant improvement was noted in intervention group participants already well controlled at baseline (HbA1c <7%). In fact, these participants maintained good glycemic control, whereas participants in the control group starting the study with a HbA1c of <7% deteriorated significantly. These results suggest that mhealth is effective for people with poorly controlled diabetes while also being more effective than standard care in helping people with well-controlled diabetes maintain glycemic control.\n\nOf the 10 remaining studies, 7 found mhealth to be significantly more effective than other telehealth interventions and standard care. Two single-group studies  22, 34  led to similar and significant improvements in HbA1c at 3 and 6 months, particularly so for those with a baseline HbA1c of \u22657.0%.  31 In a trial  35  evaluating a system that provided patients with an insulin dose adjustment based on fasting BG readings, overall, a clinically significant reduction in HbA1c was observed, but the reduction was significantly greater in the intervention group. Three RCTs  32, 33, 36  found significant reductions in HbA1c for the mhealth group. One compared the mhealth intervention to a fax-or telephone-based intervention.  32 In this study, however, the control group phoned or faxed in their BG readings fortnightly until these were stable. It was unclear whether HCP feedback was provided to this group, and no criteria defined a stable BG readings pattern. The two other RCTs  33, 36  compared mhealth with standard care. In one of them,  33  improvements were significant at 6 months but were not at 12 months, therefore suggesting only shortterm effectiveness. Finally, the four-group RCT  37  found significantly greater reductions in HbA1c at 12 months in two of the three active treatment groups compared with the control group after controlling for baseline HbA1c. Unlike Rodr\u00edguez-Id\u00edgoras and coworkers,  33  these between-group differences were still significant at 12 months. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the three active treatment groups, although these differed in the level of access HCPs had to patient data. Similar to Farmer and colleagues,  28  in type 1 diabetes, it appears the key and active driver to success may be the transmission of patient data, regardless of whether those data are reviewed by HCPs or used to provide feedback.\n\nThe remaining three  21, 30, 31  RCT studies failed to find mhealth to be more effective than standard care or other telehealth interventions. These included mhealth and pedometer monitoring compared with standard care with pedometer monitoring,  31  HCP feedback via letter including amalgamated readings and treatment recommendations to standard care,  21  and a computer versus mhealth intervention.  30 For Faridi and associates,  31  this is unsurprising considering the low levels of adherence to protocol among 15 intervention group patients. Only 2 patients were completely adherent and transmitted readings daily, while 9 patients were found to either transmit only for a week (n = 4) or not at all (n = 5) and the remaining four only for 1-2 months out of 3. Important methodological issues led to this study being rated as poor. For example, the control group wore pedometers as part of the objective assessment of physical activity. Although this was not intended as an intervention, reviewing daily step counts could have influenced participants' levels of exercise and biased results. Istepanian and coworkers  21  found mhealth to be ineffective in reducing HbA1c with patients receiving feedback in a letter format. Unfortunately, authors did not report the frequency at which letters were sent to patients or the type of treatment recommendations made. The immediacy of feedback displayed via mobile platforms as a result of data transmission may be more likely to facilitate data interpretation and promote active and prompt reactions to physiological states. The third RCT  30  did find significant improvements in HbA1c for both mhealth and a computer-based Web monitoring intervention; however, differences between groups were not significant. Both groups improved significantly and similarly despite the computer group being able to transfer considerably more diabetes-related information than the mobile phone group. The portability of the device, which may act as a reminder and prompt to self-care, may therefore be as effective as being able to provide more information. The behavioral mechanisms involved in fixed and mobile technology may differ and require further examination."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This systematic review summarizes the evidence base for the clinical effectiveness of mhealth interventions in which patients transmit diabetes-related information to receive automated text, graphical, and/or HCP feedback. Systematic searching found 13 studies on type 2 diabetes and 7 on type 1 diabetes. None of the studies reviewed found mhealth to be harmful. Overall, the findings from the studies reviewed are somewhat mixed but do appear to be more consistently positive for studies in type 2 diabetes as was reported by Azar and Gabbay.  38 Ten of the 13 studies in type 2 diabetes and 4 of 7 studies on type 1 diabetes found mhealth to lead to benefits. Studies without HCP feedback led to improved HbA1c, suggesting HCP feedback might not be necessary for intervention success. The recording and tracking of data could be the key factor for increasing patients' awareness, understanding, and motivation to self-manage. Knowledge that the data are accessible to HCPs may also be an incentive to adhere to a regimen. The graphical and automated text feedback might also be an effective incentive to engage patients. It may help patients identify relationships between their lifestyle and BG patterns. Future research needs to determine which patients benefit most from HCP feedback and which patient characteristics predict intervention effectiveness. This will guide future mhealth deployment tactics and increase cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe methodological quality of the reviewed studies was poor, with many involving small sample sizes, no power calculations, and poor study designs. Many studies excluded patients who failed to engage with the devices from the analysis; this implies they assessed intervention efficacy and not effectiveness. If a \"per-protocol analysis\" rather than an intention-to-treat analysis is presented, as might be the case especially with studies with smaller sample sizes, this should be supplemented by an analysis of differences between completers and those who dropped out or were withdrawn along with a discussion on the possible implications and effects of the missing participants. Some of these criticisms reflect the observations made by Whitten and colleagues  39  in their review of the methodology adopted in telehealth research In addition, poor reporting in these studies made interpretations difficult; additional papers, Web pages, or diagrams should be made available to ensure transparency. The CONSORT-eHealth guidelines  40  for the reporting of telehealth interventions are available for researchers to use.\n\nFinally, the costs incurred in the delivery and running of these telemonitoring interventions was not discussed in this review. Without this information, it remains impossible to know whether implementing such services is cost-effective.\n\nThis systematic review has limitations. It does not consider research exclusively on specific subgroups such as pregnant women or insulin pump users. Non-English language papers were not reviewed, and a publication bias could have occurred since grey literature was not searched.\n\nIn view of the considerations raised earlier and their implications on the interpretation of study results, this review cannot reliably conclude on the clinical effectiveness of mhealth interventions for diabetes management. Results do show potential for beneficial change, but higher-quality studies with better standard of reporting are urgently needed and will provide a strong evidence base for policy makers."
