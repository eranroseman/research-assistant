  "title": "Effect of mobile phone intervention for diabetes on glycaemic control: a meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Aims To assess the effect of mobile phone intervention on glycaemic control in diabetes self-management. Methods We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) using the following terms: diabetes or diabetes mellitus and mobile phone or cellular phone, or text message. We also manually searched reference lists of relevant papers to identify additional studies. Clinical studies that used mobile phone intervention and reported changes in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) values in patients with diabetes were reviewed. The study design, intervention methods, sample size and clinical outcomes were extracted from each trial. The results of the HbA 1c change in the trials were pooled using meta-analysis methods. Results A total of 22 trials were selected for the review. Meta-analysis among 1657 participants showed that mobile phone interventions for diabetes self-management reduced HbA 1c values by a mean of 0.5% [6 mmol \u2044 mol; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.7% (4-8 mmol \u2044 mol)] over a median of 6 months follow-up duration. In subgroup analysis, 11 studies among Type 2 diabetes patients reported significantly greater reduction in HbA 1c than studies among Type 1 diabetes patients [0.8 (9 mmol \u2044 mol) vs. 0.3% (3 mmol \u2044 mol); P = 0.02]. The effect of mobile phone intervention did not significantly differ by other participant characteristics or intervention strategies. Conclusions Results pooled from the included trials provided strong evidence that mobile phone intervention led to statistically significant improvement in glycaemic control and self-management in diabetes care, especially for Type 2 diabetes patients.",

      "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent chronic disease worldwide. Although many well-established methods of patient care have improved clinical profile and complications associated with diabetes  [1] [2] [3] [4] , effectiveness of other novel interventions remains a problem  [5] . Growing evidence suggests that emerging telemedicine may further improve diabetes self-management and clinical outcomes.\n\nMobile telephone use has been engaged in daily life of adults over all age groups, not only in developed countries but also in developing countries with different cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. The mobile phone facilitates immediate delivery of short messages or direct calls to individuals at any time, in any place and any setting. Patients can receive education by the cell phone at the time of the blood glucose measurement or other event (medication), which can improve HbA 1c levels and improve self-care regarding diet, medication and exercise. Thus, mobile phone intervention may potentially assist in daily diabetes management via the establishment of an active interaction between patients and healthcare professionals. In addition, mobile phone use for diabetes self-management has high penetration in most populations, including those with low socio-economic status and poor health condition  [6, 7] .\n\nPrevious research has explored the use of mobile phone short message service (SMS) to remind patients of scheduled visits  [8] , deliver test results  [9]  and monitor side-effects of treatment  [10] [11] [12] [13] . The application of mobile phones for diabetes selfmanagement support, however, remains an innovative strategy. A number of completed intervention studies on mobile phone use for patients with diabetes have been reviewed previously  [14] [15] [16] , but no quantitative analysis has been performed to our knowledge. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of mobile phone use on glycaemic control in diabetes self-management."

We used an estimated correlation coefficient of 0.66 for our analysis based on the pre-and postintervention HbA 1c measurements reported in the selected studies. Two trials  [19, 20]  only reported the changes of mean HbA 1c value without standard deviation; we therefore used the prognostic method  [21]  to estimate the missing standard deviation from a set of sampling distributions with full information. To estimate the variance for both controlled before-after and crossover trials, we used a heuristic variance imputation scheme  [18] . We used the adjusted Jadad scale  [22]  to assess the quality of each trial, with a total score ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the lowest and 5 indicating the highest quality. As blinding was not applicable in mobile phone intervention studies, we replaced blinding criteria with statistical power and inclusion criteria. Weighted estimates of trial results were calculated with a random-effects model using the method of DerSimonian & Laird  [23] . Heterogeneity was quantified using the I-squared measure.

Postintervention HbA 1c values were obtained after a median follow-up period of 6 months (ranging from 3 to 12 months).

Finally, 1657 patients (911 men) with a mean age of 44 AE 18 years and a median diabetes duration of 6.4 years were included for analysis. Nine studies examined patients with Type 1 diabetes DM, 10 studies examined patients with Type 2 diabetes DM, two studies examined patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes DM  [19, 36] , and one study did not specify the type of diabetes  [26] . Four studies were conducted in tertiary hospitals, and the others were conducted in primary care or generalist settings.

      "title": "Characteristics of mobile phone intervention",

Twelve studies  [19, 20, 24, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, [35] [36] [37] [38]  used both SMS and Internet to initiate the intervention and provided support for self-monitoring blood glucose, continuous education, reinforcement of diet, exercise and medication adjustment. Eight studies  [11, 12, 26, 28, 30, 33, 34 ,39] adopted a short message service alone, or SMS or SMS combined with other intervention strategies, which included transmitting self-monitored blood glucose to mobile phone via a Bluetooth wireless link  [19, 20, 39] . Two studies compared the effect of mobile phone intervention with Internetbased care in the intervention group and control group, respectively  [11, 26] . One study combined mobile phone with clinical visits that consisted of clinical advice and structured counselling from a diabetes specialist nurse in response to realtime blood glucose test, and found that the combined intervention achieved greater reduction in HbA 1c than isolated mobile phone intervention  [34] .\n\nTable 1 (continued) Study Duration (months) Sample Pre(post) Type Design Setting Mobile phone technology Intervention Kim et al. 2009 [37] 3 100(92) Type 2 DM RCT Unmentioned Mobile phone and Internet Automatic adjustment of insulin dose based on the mean fasting blood glucose level Rossi et al. 2010 [13] 6 130(119) Type 1 DM RCT Multicentre outpatient Mobile phone, DID Diabetes education, managing hypoglycaemia, managing medication, SMBG Kim et al. 2006 [38] 3 45(33) Type 2 DM CBA Tertiary care hospital Mobile phone and Internet Continuous education, reinforcement of diet, exercise, medication adjustment and SMBG Turner et al. 2009 [39] 3 23(23) Type 2 DM CBA Nine general practices Mobile phone Telehealth monitoring and support for insulin initiation and adjustment, SMBG Abbreviations: CBA, controlled before-after trial; COT, randomized crossover trial; DID, diabetes interactive diary; DM, diabetes mellitus; Q-RCT, quasi-randomized trial; RCT, randomized controlled trial, SMBG, self-monitoring of blood glucose; TM, telemedical. * Intervention group using mobile phone; control group using Internet. Type of diabetes not specified or including both types of diabetes.\n\nContents of the mobile phone intervention were diverse. Almost all studies contained reinforcement of lifestyle management, including diet and exercise intervention. Most studies also encouraged self-monitoring of blood glucose combined with other interventions, such as support of medication adjustment. Some studies provided education intervention  [13, 19, 24, 27, 31, 38]  using the short message service SMS with or without Internet. Five studies provided personally tailored short message service SMS care interventions, comprising personalized goal-specific prompts and messages tailored to patients' age, sex and medical condition  [11, 25, 28, 33, 36] . Data of patients self-monitoring of blood glucose, diet and medicine problems were transmitted daily or more often in 14 trials  [11] [12] [13] 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] 30, 33, 34, 38, 39] , weekly or more often in three trials  [32, 35, 37]  and with unspecified timing in four trials  [19, 29, 31, 36] ."

      "title": "Analyses of effect size",
      "text": "The effect size of our analysis was calculated as the difference in change of HbA 1c value from pre-intervention to postintervention, comparing intervention group with control group. Across all included trials, the pooled difference in HbA 1c change was 0.5% [6 mmol \u2044 mol 95% CI, 0.3-0.7% (3-8 mmol \u2044 mol)], indicating that the reduction of HbA 1c value was 0.5% lower in mobile phone intervention groups compared with control groups (Fig.  2 ). Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled reduction in HbA 1c from 10 studies of patients with Type 2 diabetes DM was 0.8% [9 mmol \u2044 mol; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.1% (6-12 mmol \u2044 mol)] and the pooled result from nine studies of patients with Type 1 DM diabetes was 0.3% (3 mmol \u2044 mol; 95% confidence interval, 0-0.5% (0-6 mmol \u2044 mol); P for difference = 0.02; Fig.  3] .\n\nAmong the 22 studies included in this review, one trial showed no change in HbA 1c in the mobile phone intervention group  [13] , two trials reported increases in HbA 1c values in the intervention groups  [33, 35] , but the increases were small [0.5% (5 mmol \u2044 mol) or less] and statistically nonsignificant. Fifteen studies in which the mean baseline HbA 1c value was at least 8.0% (9 mmol \u2044 mol) reported greater reductions in HbA 1c values than the other studies with lower baseline HbA 1c values [0.6% (6 mmol \u2044 mol) vs. 0.4% (4 mmol \u2044 mol), respectively], but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.37). The included trials varied in duration from 3 months to 1 year. Among four 1 year trials, two reported significant reduction in HbA 1c , one showed no change in HbA 1c and the other one reported an increase in HbA 1c . Studies with a follow-up duration less than 6 months reported nonsignificantly larger reduction in HbA 1c than studies with a longer follow-up duration [0.7% (7 mmol \u2044 mol) vs. 0.4% (4 mmol \u2044 mol), respectively; P = 0.49]. The smaller effect size with longer duration of intervention possibly reflects the difficulty of maintaining large improvements in glycaemic control over time. The effect size did not differ between 11 trials with randomized controlled design [0.5% (6 mmol \u2044 mol), 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.8% (2-9 mmol \u2044 mol)] and 11 other trials with nonrandomized designs [0.5% (6 mmol \u2044 mol), 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8% (3-8.25 mmol \u2044 mol)]. We also conducted subgroup analyses that excluded seven before-after trials because of the imputation of mean and standard deviation in the control group, and the main results changed little [0.6% (6 mmol \u2044 mol) compared with the results from all the trials., 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9% (3-9 mmol \u2044 mol)). Subgroup analysis among studies with a quality score more than 3 showed greater reductions in HbA 1c values than the studies with lower scores [0.6% (7 mmol \u2044 mol) vs. 0.3% (3 mmol \u2044 mol)], but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.20).\n\nWe further conducted subgroup analysis by mobile phone intervention contents, technologies, frequency, and age group and body weight of participants (Table  3 ). The effect size did not differ between 13 trials with the intervention methods including both medication adjustment and self monitoring of blood glucose SMBG [0.6% (6 mmol \u2044 mol), 95%CI, 0.3-0.8% (3-9 mmol \u2044 mol)] and the remaining nine trials [0.5% (5 mmol \u2044 mol), 95%CI, 0.2-0.7% (2-7 mmol \u2044 mol); P = 0.6]. Studies with both mobile phone and Internet intervention showed greater reduction in HbA 1c than the studies with only mobile phone intervention [0.7% (7 mmol \u2044 mol) vs. 0.4% (4 mmol \u2044 mol)], and studies with daily intervention frequency reported greater reduction in HbA 1c than those with weekly intervention frequency [0.6% (7 mmol \u2044 mol) vs. 0.2% (2 mmol \u2044 mol)], but the differences did not reach statistical significance. The pooled reduction in HbA 1c was 0.5% [5 mmol \u2044 mol; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.8% (1-9 mmol \u2044 mol)] from five studies with average age less than 25 years old and 0.5% [6 mmol \u2044 mol; (95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.7% (3-8 mmol \u2044 mol)] from 17 studies with average age at least 25 years (P for difference = 0.54), 0.8 % [8 mmol \u2044 mol; (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.1% (5-12 mmol \u2044 mol)] from seven studies of patients with body mass index (BMI) at least 25 kg \u2044 m 2 , and 0.8% [9 mmol \u2044 mol; 95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 1.7% (-1 to 19 mmol \u2044 mol)] from three studies of patients with BMI less than 25 kg \u2044 m 2 (P for difference = 0.93).\n\nStudies with sample size less than 60 patients reported substantially greater reductions in HbA 1c values compared with trials with sample sizes at least as large as 60 patients [0.8% (9 mmol \u2044 mol) vs. 0.4% (4 mmol \u2044 mol)]. This inverse relationship between effect magnitude and sample size remained when we adjusted potential confounders, such as study design, quality score and sample size using meta-regression analysis."

The effect of mobile phone intervention did not substantially differ by sample size, study design, quality scores, mobile phone intervention contents, technologies and frequency, the mean baseline HbA 1c or age and body weight of participants.\n\nOur review and meta-analysis has several advantages over most previous systematic reviews of mobile phone  [15, 16, 40]  or telemedicine interventions  [41, 42] . We detected potential publication bias, assessed the quality of included trials, and used statistical methods to calculate missing values. If only a few studies with complete data were included, the pooled results were not representative of the total available evidence. Our analysis results supported the conclusion of a recent systematic review  [16, 43, 44]  and, to our knowledge, presented the first pooled analysis results of mobile phone intervention on glycaemic control among patients with diabetes. Nevertheless, our analysis also has limitations. First, important confounding and selection bias may remain in the original studies. For instance, patients enrolled in a mobile phone intervention study may be more likely to show reductions in HbA 1c values because of motivation. Second, we found that smaller studies reported greater reduction in HbA 1c values than did larger studies, which possibly reflected publication bias, with smaller trials more likely to report and publish their results if they found strong effects. Third, there is no gold standard of calculating the missing standard deviation, and therefore random errors may exist in the imputations.\n\nFor diabetes patients, maintaining lifestyle change is important but challenging. Telecare may play a role in supplementing behaviour change interventions. Patient-specific communication by a mobile phone short message service alone, or SMS or SMS combined with the Internet is a viable, safe and convenient option to support diabetes self-management. Most studies reported that the subjects did not experience significant side-effects, and were satisfied with the intervention  [11, 20, [25] [26] [27] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] 36] . However, the mobile phone intervention per se is not a therapeutic service, and its effect must be based on strong behavioural change theory. In addition, this intervention may not be suitable for all patients with diabetes. Some participants may drop out due to operating technical problems or intrusion into patients' life. Some patients withdraw from the studies  [11, 28]  because they cannot use the special cell phone on a regular day-to-day basis or do not have computer and Internet access  [11] [12] [13] 19, [27] [28] [29] 34, 35] . These facility and technique barriers limited the widespread use of mobile phone intervention, especially in patients with low income. Therefore, sophisticated telemedicine may not be beneficial to all patients with diabetes, and it should be recommended particularly to patients with high motivation to use it  [43] . Patients with good compliance may be those of older ages and who have a longer duration of diabetes  [36] . Innovative interventions currently under development that will provide a more convenient and reliable mobile phone service may further improve its effectiveness in management of patients with diabetes.\n\nNowadays, mobile phones and Internet technology are advancing rapidly and are ubiquitously available worldwide. However, the costs to the participants are difficult to estimate. The cost \u2044 benefit ratio of mobile phone intervention was only calculated in several studies, which reported that home monitoring would be cost-effective  [12, 29, 30, 33]  (eg. \u20ac4 per month  [12] , \u20ac1.4 per month  [13] , \u20ac10 per month  [29] , \u20ac0.5 per month  [30] , approximately 2 pence per text  [33] ).\n\nGrowing evidence suggests that emerging telemedicine may improve clinical results and lifestyle change of diabetes patients. Pooled results from 22 intervention studies showed that mobile phone intervention methods for diabetes care led to statistically significant improvements in glycaemic control and selfmanagement. Further research in well-designed trials with large sample size is needed to further demonstrate how mobile phone intervention can enhance diabetes self-management support and examine its cost-effectiveness."
