  "title": "Current evidence and perspectives for hypertension management in Asia Home blood pressure-centered approachfrom digital health to medical practice: HOPE Asia Network consensus statement 2023",
  "abstract": "Recent innovations in digital technology have enabled the simultaneous accumulation, and the linking and analysis of timeseries big data relating to several factors that influence blood pressure (BP), including biological indicators, physical activity, and environmental information. Various approaches can be used to monitor BP: in the office/clinic; at home; 24-h ambulatory recording; or with wearable and cuffless devices. Of these, home BP monitoring is a reliable and convenient method, and is recommended for hypertension management by current national and international guidelines. This recommendation is based on evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney disease in patients with hypertension. In addition, lifetime personalized health record (PHR)-based home BP with telemonitoring combined with co-interventions has been shown to lower BP more effectively than the traditional approach based on office BP. Thus, home BP represents a key metric for personalized anticipation medicine, from digital healthcare to digital medicine. This paper summarizes the latest evidence on home BP monitoring and proposes a Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia (HOPE Asia) Network consensus on a home BP-centered approach to the management of hypertension.",

      "text": "In 1905, a Russian army surgeon, Nikolai Sergeevich Korotkoff described a new auscultatory method to measure blood pressure (BP), in which arterial blood flow of the upper arm is blocked by inflating a cuff. Then the percussive sound of blood flow reopening the vessel is identified. This method became, and still remains, the reference standard for measuring BP.\n\nThe first intra-arterial ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was introduced in 1966, and BP variability over 24 h was acknowledged. The 1980s saw the development and use of home BP monitoring (HBPM) and ABPM devices that utilize the oscillometric method, which calculates systolic and diastolic BP based on the pulse waves (blood vessel oscillations that occur in response to heartbeats) detected by an intra-cuff pressure sensor. Recent technology developments have made it possible to measure out-of-office BP more conveniently and accurately. Several studies utilizing these devices have shown that there is a significant difference between office-measured BP and outof-office-measured home or ambulatory BP  [1] .\n\nHypertension is the most significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Current evidence indicates that each 20-mmHg difference in office systolic BP (SBP) is associated with a > 2-fold difference in the stroke death rate and 2-fold differences in the death rates from ischemic heart disease and other vascular causes in individuals aged 40-69 years  [2] . In addition, a recent meta-analysis of data from randomized clinical trials reported that a 5-mmHg decrease in SBP was associated with an ~10% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events  [3] . Furthermore, the Chinese Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) trial showed a reduction of ~26% in cardiovascular disease risk when morning home SBP decreased by ~7.5 mmHg  [4, 5] . The magnitude of cardiovascular benefit associated with a 5-mmHg reduction in BP in the two aforementioned studies suggests that the benefit of lowering BP might be greater in Asians.\n\nIt is important to note that office BP provides a snapshot of the BP level at a specific timepoint and is measured under specific conditions. As such, it does not reflect the overall BP profile and BP variability. In addition, over the past 30 years, accumulating evidence has highlighted that out-ofoffice BP metrics, such as home BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP, are more closely associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease than office BP  [1] . Therefore, current hypertension guidelines recommend that both office BP and out-of-office BP be used to diagnose and manage hypertension  [6] [7] [8] . In addition, evaluating BP using both office and out-of-office measurements allows the detection of white-coat and masked hypertension.\n\nRecent innovations in digital technology have enabled the simultaneous accumulation, and the linking and analysis of time-series big data (huge and complex accumulated data that needs to process and analyze using new methods and AI) relating to several factors that influence BP, including biological indicators, physical activity, and environmental information (e.g. temperature and humidity). Nevertheless, BP itself (and especially home BP) remains one of the most"

This paper summarizes the latest evidence on home BP and it proposes a HOPE Asia Network consensus statements on a practical personalized health record (PHR)-based home BP-centered approach  [23]  (Fig.  1 , Graphic Abstract) to achieve personalized anticipation medicine that predicts the time and place of the onset of cardiovascular events based on a time-series big data in digital health and digital medicine (Table  1 ).\n\nHome BP-centered approach: concept and rationale BP fluctuates in a variety of ways, from very short-term fluctuations (e.g. beat-by-beat) to short-term fluctuations (e.g. diurnal variation), to longer-term fluctuations (e.g. dayby-day, seasonal, and even annually). HBPM is widely used  in Asia because of its ability to capture BP variability over various time phases, including long-term variability, and because of evidence showing that home BP is a stronger risk factor for cardiovascular disease than office BP  [24] . The concept of a home BP-centered approach is the use of voluntarily self-measured home BP readings to achieve personalized, optimized anticipation medicine that prevents the onset and severity of cardiovascular events at an early stage by predicting each individual's risk throughout their lifetime. This applies to both digital health, which aims to promote healthy lives among asymptomatic individuals and patients with disease, and to digital medicine, such as telemedicine and digital therapy, which aims to treat patients. The concept and rationale of a home BP-centered approach to hypertension management are described in Tables  2  and  3 .\n\nStudies conducted in both general populations and patients with hypertension have shown that home BP was more closely associated with the risk of organ damage (cardiac hypertrophy, renal disorders, and arteriosclerosis), cardiovascular disease (stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure), and aging-related disease (dementia and chronic kidney disease) than office BP  [1] . Thus, home BP is a well-established risk factor and HBPM should play a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, now and in the future, as recommended by evidence-based guidelines  [6] [7] [8] .\n\nHome BP can be self-measured. In addition, newer HBPM devices can now gather information on other important variables simultaneously, including biological (e.g. continuous BP wave form, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration), behavioral (e.g. physical activity, sleep quality), and environmental (e.g. temperature, light, humidity, atmospheric pressure) signals  [25] . While the clinical implications of these additional variables have yet to be established, they could contribute to better patient classification and risk stratification when used in combination with home BP values."

      "text": "Hypertension and lack of BP control in treated patients are diagnosed when the average value of BP readings exceeds a defined threshold value. The accuracy of diagnosis and detection of uncontrolled BP may depend partly on the number of BP readings. This highlights the value of using the average value of home BP readings from a validated device and a standardized protocol whereby measurements are taken in the resting seated position at specific times of the day under consistent conditions, which shows high reproducibility and accuracy. It is therefore important that individuals comply fully with all the necessary information and instructions when self-measuring home BP (Fig.  2 ). Proper instruction of patients and tools available to assist with that is very important.\n\nThe Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) recommends the use of HBPM for the diagnosis and management of hypertension, and was the first in the world to clearly Table  3  Rationale for a home blood pressure-centered approach from digital health to medical practice 1 Home blood pressure measured according to guidelines is a well-established cardiovascular disease risk factor 2 Out-of-office blood pressure measurement is well-established hypertension diagnosis and management strategy in evidence-based guidelines 3 Various healthcare and environmental metrics could be monitored and correlated with home blood pressure readings on a day-to-day basis 4 There is the possibility of adding 24-h and nighttime (sleep) ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and blood pressure monitoring using a wearable device 5 The time-trend analysis and at-a-glance display with a shared target blood pressure goal will improve lifestyle modification, drug adherence, and clinical inertia in health promotion and clinical practice\n\nTable 2 The home BP-centered approach concept 1 Early detection of cardiovascular risk 2 Real-time early detection of increasing cardiovascular risk 3 Precision and anticipation medicine based on blood pressure variability 4 Promotion of self-efficacy in healthcare by self-measurement of blood pressure 5 Affinity to telemedicine Fig. 2 Recommendations for ensuring accurate home blood pressure measurement (reproduced, with permission, from Kario, 2021 [82])\n\nstate that if there is a discrepancy between the findings of office BP and home BP measurements then a diagnosis of hypertension should be based on the home BP data  [6] .\n\nConditions where office and home BP might differ are white-coat hypertension (office BP is in the hypertension range and home BP is in the normal range) and masked hypertension (office BP in the normal range and home BP in the hypertension range). Cardiovascular risk is low for uncomplicated white-coat hypertension but high for masked hypertension  [26] . Data from the J-HOP study showed greater differences between office BP and home BP values in individuals with higher BP and smaller differences in those with lower BP, with smallest difference seen when SBP was about 130 mmHg (Fig.  3 )  [27] . Table  4  shows the home BP level that corresponds with each office BP level. Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH)  [8]  and JSH  [6] , and the HOPE Asia Network 2020 consensus  [18]  define the threshold for diagnosing hypertension as 140/90 mmHg for office BP and 135/ 85 mmHg for home BP. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines simplify the thresholds for diagnosing hypertension, using 130/80 mmHg for office, home, and daytime (measured by ABPM) BP  [7] . In addition, the guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology and the Taiwan Hypertension Society published in 2022 emphasize the importance of home BP and recommend that HBPM is used to diagnose hypertension (defined as \u2265130/80 mmHg)  [28] .\n\nOverall, home BP-centered hypertension management can be applied to the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of antihypertensive therapy (Table  5 ). At the diagnostic phase, HBPM allows detection of white-coat hypertension, masked hypertension, the morning BP surge and nocturnal hypertension (with newer devices) (Table  5 )  [29] . During antihypertensive therapy, measurement of home BP is essential to provide information on whether target BP is being achieved, whether BP control is ongoing, and detect the presence of treatment-resistant hypertension (Table  5 ). As noted above, use of a validated device is essential. Furthermore, although the addition of digital technologies (including telemonitoring) is proving to be very useful  [30] [31] [32] , HBPM by whatever means (be it a traditional cuffbased device or the latest wearable technology) is an important component of hypertension diagnosis and management. Self-measurement of home BP alone has been shown to reduce BP and improve BP control  [33] , although these benefits are greater when HBPM is performed alongside other interventions, such as additional healthcare professional support  [34, 35]  and telemonitoring  [30] [31] [32] . To ensure achievement of target BP and ongoing BP control, or the presence of treatment resistance c As long as it is validated, the type is less important (e.g. conventional cuff-based or novel wearable device) Fig.  3  Distribution of hypertension subtypes based on the difference in office and home blood pressure (data from the J-HOP study) (reproduced, with permission, from Kario, 2018  [27] ) based on ABPM are 130/80 mmHg, 135/85 mmHg, and 120/ 70 mmHg for 24-h average, daytime (awake), and nighttime (asleep) BP, respectively  [19] . Masked hypertension is diagnosed when any of these out-of-office BP readings are within the hypertension range and office BP is below 140/90 mmHg. There are three main types of masked hypertension; morning, daytime, and nocturnal  [19] . Even when office BP is in the normal BP range, factors that are specific to a time of day can cause elevated BP during the early morning, daytime or at night. Of these masked hypertension subtypes, only morning hypertension could be definitively detected using routine HBPM. This is relevant because morning hypertension and elevated morning BP have been shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease and stroke, and morning BP surge is greater in Asians compared with Westerners  [20, [36] [37] [38] . Therefore, morning hypertension should be the first target for Asian clinical practice for hypertension management  [20] ."

The ideal hypertension treatment in the digital era will be personalized, optimized anticipation medicine, which predicts these surges in BP and provides personalized treatment."

      "text": "BP variability is emerging risk for renal and cardiovascular diseases  [42] . A greater number of BP measurements provides a more detailed assessment of BP variability, and home BP is the best BP monitoring method to obtain BPs for a longer duration. Several indices of home BP variability are proposed (Fig.  5 ). Day-by-day home BP variability is known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease independent of average BP value  [43] . Given that an increase in BP variability is observed prior to an increase in average BP values, continual home BP measurements may detect the development of hypertension at an early stage. Furthermore, frequent and stable home BP measurements have been shown to be associated with lower BP variability  [44] .\n\nIncreased BP variability is especially a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with increased arterial stiffness  [45] [46] [47] . Morning-evening (ME) difference is an index of diurnal BP variation based on HBPM data, and a ME difference of >20 mmHg is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease independent of ME average value  [48] . In addition, ME difference has been reported to be increased by nocturnal hypoxia  [49] .\n\nMorning BP increases in winter  [50]  and has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in winter  [51] . In addition, BP variability measured in winter was more strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular events than BP variability in other seasons  [52] . This may be most relevant in countries with marked temperature variation between seasons, with much lower temperatures in winter versus summer. Patients whose average home SBP (average of three consecutive BP readings measured in the morning or evening) exceeds 170 mmHg were reported to be 10 times more at risk than those with stable home SBP below 140 mmHg  [53] . In our recent extended study  [54] , peak home BP was a strong risk factor for stroke, especially within the first 5 years. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of stroke in patients with average peak home SBP in the highest versus lowest quintile was extremely high in the first 5 years: hazard risk 22.66. The pathological threshold of average peak home SBP for 5-year stroke risk was 176 mmHg. There was a linear association between the number of times peak home SBP > 175 mmHg and stroke risk.

A recent study demonstrated that the reduction of TTR is associated with risk of adverse renal and cardiovascular events  [55] . Although, the clinical implication of TTR was first tested to study the effect of long-term variability of office BPs, long-term multiple measurements of home BP could be more precise indicator to predict adverse outcomes  [56] .\n\nOne important clinical phenotype of BP variability is atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation show marked BP variability and were therefore often excluded from clinical studies on the association between BP and cardiovascular events. However, the recent ANAFIE study of older patients with non-valvular AF showed that those with an average home SBP of \u2265145 mmHg were at greater risk of experiencing cardiovascular events, including bleeding complications  [57] ."

      "text": "Traditional HBPM involves self-measurement of BP at specific times of the day (usually within one hour after waking up before taking antihypertensive medication and just before bedtime) and therefore cannot be used to diagnose daytime stress hypertension or nocturnal hypertension (i.e. BP while the individual is asleep). ABPM can be used for identifying all three hypertension subtypes (i.e. morning hypertension, daytime hypertension, and nocturnal hypertension), and it is recommended that 24-hour BP profiles should be assessed using ABPM in high-risk patients with hypertension  [1, 19] .\n\nA newly developed multi-sensor ABPM device has both 24-hour ABPM and HBPM modes (TM-2441; A&D Co., Tokyo)  [57] . This device allows continuous measurement in HBPM mode while switching to ABPM mode as appropriate to measure daytime and nighttime BP  [58] . In particular, there would be the opportunity to switch from HBPM to ABPM to measure nighttime BP when there is an increase in morning or daytime home BP and/or in home BP variability (e.g. greater difference between morning and evening home BP).\n\nNocturnal HBPM devices with an upper arm cuff also allow automated BP measurement during sleep  [59] . Studies using these devices have shown that nighttime home BP is a risk factor for organ damage and cardiovascular disease  [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . Nighttime BP monitoring is highly recommended for high-risk patients with nocturnal hypertension, such as those with sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or resistant hypertension  [1] . The latest development in nocturnal HBPM is a wrist cuff-type device, the HEM9601T (Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). This device fulfills the validation criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO81060-2:2013 guidelines and is considered to cause less sleep disturbance and be associated with less measurement noise, discomfort, and muscle compression than arm-cuff devices  [65] [66] [67] [68] ."

This device is being used in the ongoing Home-Activity ICTbased Japan Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Prospective Study (HI-JAMP)  [69] .\n\nA total of 2731 patients were enrolled in the HI-JAMP study between 2017 and 2020. The prevalence of uncontrolled office BP was lower in patients taking two (39.0%) or \u22653 (33.2%) antihypertensive agents than in those being treated with antihypertensive monotherapy (49.2%). In contrast, the prevalence of uncontrolled morning home BP was high across all levels of antihypertensive drug usage (54.4%, 54.7% and 54.1% in patients taking 1, 2 and \u22653 antihypertensive agents, respectively) (Fig.  6 )  [69] . The prevalence of uncontrolled nighttime BP also remained high in the group taking \u22653 antihypertensives (46.5%). These results highlight the fact that current conventional antihypertensive medication regimens often do not achieve control of 24-h BP in patients with higher antihypertensive medication loads.\n\nAlso in HI-JAMP, the prevalence of masked hypertension detected by ABPM was lower than that detected by HBPM, but the prevalence of masked hypertension by ABPM increased to the same level as that determined by HBPM when ambulatory BPs in the morning (2 h after waking) were additionally assessed  [70] . These data also confirm that morning BP is higher than BP measured at other times of the day. Considering the substantial body of evidence showing that both morning and nighttime BP are important cardiovascular risk factors  [37, 38, 62] , measurement of morning and nighttime BP should be regarded as essential, and these values represent specific targets for effective hypertension management.\n\nThe HI-JAMP study is the first to report BP control status for office, home, and ambulatory BP measured by the same device. More than 80% of patients with treated hypertension who had office BP < 140/90 mmHg and home BP < 135/85 mmHg also had well-controlled ambulatory BP (Fig.  7 )  [71] . Similarly, more than 80% of patients with office BP > 140/90 mmHg and home BP > 135/85 mmHg also had poorly controlled ambulatory BP  [71] . Patients whose BP control status was inconsistent between office BP and home BP readings (i.e. those with masked hypertension or white-coat hypertension) had less agreement in BP control status between ABPM and HBPM, indicating the importance of ABPM for these patients. In contrast, patients with consistent BP control status based on both office BP and home BP may not necessarily need to undergo ABPM for the management of hypertension."

Further development of device technology such as a beatby-beat BP monitoring device  [76] [77] [78]  or a cuffless BP monitoring device  [79] [80] [81]  will enable the collection of longitudinal time-series big data on BP monitored at various times and situations, probably resulting in more accurate diagnosis of hypertension, and prediction of organ damage and future cardiovascular event risk. With different forms of BP data from HBPM and 24-hour ABPM, there is the potential to use artificial intelligence to better understand the dynamic BP surge profile over a day and longer time periods (e.g. a year). Therefore, a personalized anticipation medicine strategy to optimize the hypertension management strategy will be feasible to achieve perfect 24-h BP control, and could facilitate the prediction of cardiovascular event occurrence (Fig.  8 )  [25] . It is important to note, however, that current evidence-and guideline-based noninvasive risk assessment has largely been based on BP values measured with a brachial BP monitoring device using the oscillometric method. Therefore, in addition to further innovations in BP monitoring device and data processing technology, there is the need for a large amount of evidence from future clinical trials utilizing this technology."
