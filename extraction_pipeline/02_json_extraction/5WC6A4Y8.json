  "title": "The efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for mental health problems: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
  "abstract": "Although impressive progress has been made toward developing empirically-supported psychological treatments, the reality remains that a significant proportion of people with mental health problems do not receive these treatments. Finding ways to reduce this treatment gap is crucial. Since app-supported smartphone interventions are touted as a possible solution, access to up-to-date guidance around the evidence base and clinical utility of these interventions is needed. We conducted a meta-analysis of 66 randomized controlled trials of app-supported smartphone interventions for mental health problems. Smartphone interventions significantly outperformed control conditions in improving depressive (g=0.28, n=54) and generalized anxiety (g=0.30, n=39) symptoms, stress levels (g=0.35, n=27), quality of life (g=0.35, n=43), general psychiatric distress (g=0.40, n=12), social anxiety symptoms (g=0.58, n=6), and positive affect (g=0.44, n=6), with most effects being robust even after adjusting for various possible biasing factors (type of control condition, risk of bias rating). Smartphone interventions conferred no significant benefit over control conditions on panic symptoms (g=-0.05, n=3), post-traumatic stress symptoms (g=0.18, n=4), and negative affect (g=-0.08, n=5). Studies that delivered a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based app and offered professional guidance and reminders to engage produced larger effects on multiple outcomes. Smartphone interventions did not differ significantly from active interventions (face-to-face, computerized  treatment), although the number of studies was low (n\u226413). The efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for common mental health problems was thus confirmed. Although mental health apps are not intended to replace professional clinical services, the present findings highlight the potential of apps to serve as a cost-effective, easily accessible, and low intensity intervention for those who cannot receive standard psychological treatment.",

      "text": "The treatment of mental health problems is expected to change considerably over the next few decades as a result of the widespread availability of Internet and mobile-device applications, and their use to deliver psychological interventions  1, 2  . This change is predicted to alleviate many barriers that stand in the way of people seeking or receiving treatment under the current model of health care delivery (e.g., insufficient number of trained professionals, geographical constraints, lack of anonymity), thereby vastly increasing the availability of psychological therapies  3, 4  .\n\nSmartphone interventions, in particular, offer many advantages over other digital interventions (e.g., computer-based), including their ability to allow users to engage in exercises and monitor symptoms in situ, in real time, and immediately before and after pivotal events, as well as their capacity to be accessed in private and at a time and location of choice  5  . However, some have noted possible risks with app-based smartphone interventions, a crucial one being the ease with which users may have access to potentially ineffective or harmful interventions  6  . Thus, practitioners and the general population need up-to-date guidance on the evidence base and clinical utility of app-supported smartphone interventions.\n\nThe efficacy of smartphone interventions for common and costly mental health problems, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms, was preliminarily documented in two recent metaanalyses. Firth et al  7, 8  identified a small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy of app-based smartphone interventions on symptoms of anxiety (n=9) and depression (n=18) in both clinical and non-clinical samples. Smartphone interventions were found to be significantly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression than both waitlist (g=0.45 and g=0.56) and active control (mainly attention/placebo-based) groups (g=0. 19 and g=0.21). The authors found no evidence that various intervention features (e.g., in-app feedback, mood monitoring features, theoretical orientation) were significantly associated with effect sizes, although larger effects were observed when in-person feedback was not provided  7  . Preliminary findings from these meta-analyses suggest that app-supported smartphone interventions have potential in treating and preventing certain common and debilitating mental health problems.\n\nSince the publication of those two meta-analyses, which included data from RCTs published until May 2017, nearly 50 RCTs evaluating the efficacy of smartphone apps on various mental health outcomes have been conducted. Since most RCTs of smartphone apps have been published within the last couple of years, and interventions delivered through smartphone devices are attracting enormous public, scientific and media attention  9  , we expect that a significant number of additional RCTs will be conducted and published in the near future.\n\nIt is therefore timely, pertinent and necessary to conduct an updated meta-analysis examining the efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions not only on symptoms of anxiety and depression, but also on other prevalent, costly and important mental health outcomes not examined in prior meta-analyses, including stress levels, specific anxiety symptoms (e.g., social anxiety, post-traumatic stress) and well-being/ quality of life.\n\nThe aims of the present meta-analysis of RCTs were to evaluate the efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions on a range of mental health outcomes, and to examine whether various features related to the intervention (theoretical orientation, whether professional guidance was offered, whether reminders to engage were sent) and sample (degree of mental health problem) moderated the observed effect sizes."

Reference lists of included studies and previous reviews were also hand-searched to identify any further eligible studies.\n\nA protocol for this review was registered via PROSPERO (CRD42019122136). There were three small deviations to the original protocol. First, we made a post-hoc decision to include rather than exclude studies that incorporated an app-supported smartphone intervention within a broader treatment program (e.g., additive or adjunctive designs). Second, we did not conduct meta-analyses of head-to-head comparisons of CBT vs. non-CBT-based apps, as there was an insufficient number of relevant studies. Third, we included an additional moderator, i.e. whether the smartphone intervention was directly aimed at targeting the specific symptom of interest.\n\nIncluded studies were English language RCTs that examined the effects of an app-supported smartphone intervention, compared to either a control condition or an active intervention, and provided the outcome data required to calculate an effect size.\n\nBoth published and unpublished RCTs were eligible for inclusion.

Trials of interventions delivered only in part via smartphone devices were also included, such as adjunctive designs (smartphone app + standard therapy vs. standard therapy alone) or blended intervention programs (when participants could access the app-based intervention via smartphones or computers). Control conditions were categorized as waitlist, assessment only, treatment as usual, informational and educational resources (e.g., website links, health tips), or attention/placebo controls (e.g., gaming apps, music-listening conditions). Active interventions were categorized as standard face-to-face therapy, web-based or computerized interventions, pharmacotherapy, and self-monitoring conditions.\n\nStudies were excluded if: a) the smartphone intervention did not address mental health or well-being (e.g., interventions focusing on weight loss, physical activity, diabetes management, smoking cessation or alcohol use were excluded); b) a computerized intervention, a virtual reality exposure treatment, or a text messaging-only intervention was delivered; and c) there was no relevant comparison condition (e.g., a two-arm trial comparing two apps was excluded) or no outcome measure was reported. If a study did not include data for effect size calculation, the authors were contacted, and the study was excluded if they failed to provide the data.\n\nJL screened all records, and full texts were obtained for potentially eligible RCTs. Two independent assessors (JL and MM) examined the full texts and selected eligible RCTs."

      "text": "The quality of trials was assessed using four criteria from the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 10 : adequate generation of allocation sequence, concealment of allocation to conditions; blinding of outcome assessors or the use of self-report questionnaires; and dealing with incomplete outcome data (assessed as low risk when outcome data used to calculate effect size were based on intention-to-treat analyses). JL conducted the quality assessments and MM coded a random 40% of studies, with good agreement observed between raters (kappa = 0.77, 0.69, 1.00 and 0.91, respectively). Disagreements were resolved through in-depth discussion.\n\nWe also coded the participant characteristics (target sample, mean age); the characteristics of the smartphone intervention (name, theoretical orientation, whether the app contained mindfulness components); the comparison condition; the out-come measures; and other trial characteristics (sample size, whether guided support or reminders to engage were offered, length of post-assessment)."

      "text": "For each comparison between a smartphone intervention and a control or active intervention condition, the effect size was calculated by dividing the difference between the two group means by the pooled standard deviation at post-test. The standardized mean difference (d) was then converted to Hedges' g to correct for small sample bias  11  . If means and standard deviations were not reported, effect sizes were calculated using conversion equations from significance tests (e.g., t statistics).\n\nTo calculate a pooled effect size, each study's effect size was weighted by its inverse variance. A positive g indicates that the smartphone condition had better outcomes than the comparison condition. Effect sizes of 0.8 can be assumed to be large, while effect sizes of 0.5 are moderate, and effect sizes of 0.2 are small  12  . If data from both intention-to-treat and completer analyses were presented, the former were extracted and analyzed.\n\nWe selected and analyzed the following mental health outcomes, as a sufficient number of trials (\u22653) reported these outcomes and allowed for a meta-analysis: depressive symptoms; generalized anxiety symptoms; specific anxiety symptoms (social anxiety symptoms, panic symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms); stress levels; quality of life/well-being; general psychological distress; and positive and negative affect. If multiple measures of a given outcome variable were used, the mean of the effect sizes from each measure within the study was calculated, before the effect sizes were pooled.\n\nComprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.0 was used for the analyses  13  . Since we expected considerable heterogeneity among the studies, random effects models were employed. Heterogeneity was examined by calculating the I 2 statistic, which quantifies heterogeneity revealed by the Q statistic and reports how much overall variance (0-100%) is attributed to betweenstudy variance  14  . The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the I 2 statistic were also calculated.\n\nSubgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of het erogeneity under a mixed effects model, which pools studies within a subgroup using a random effects model, but tests for significant differences between subgroups using fixed effects models.\n\nPublication bias was examined through the trim-and-fill procedure  15  , as well as Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test.

These comparisons were not independent from each other, which may have artificially reduced the heterogeneity estimate and affected the pooled effect size. To deal with this, we ran sensitivity analyses in which the comparison with the smallest effect size was only included in the analysis, and then repeated this again for the comparison with the largest effect size. These sensitivity analyses ensured that only one comparison per study was included in the metaanalysis. These sensitivity analyses yielded a pooled effect size highly similar to the overall effect (Table  1 )."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This meta-analysis examined the efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for a range of mental health problems. Our search identified 66 RCTs that tested several smartphone interventions on numerous distinct clinical and non-clinical populations. Importantly, the majority of RCTs were published in the last two years, highlighting that this area of research is gaining significant momentum and is growing exponentially.\n\nWe found evidence that app-supported smartphone interventions are efficacious for several common mental health problems. They significantly outperformed control conditions in improving depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms (generalized anxiety and social anxiety), stress levels, general psychiatric distress, quality of life, and positive affect, with effect sizes ranging from g=0.28 to g=0.58. Crucially, these effects were robust even after performing various sensitivity analyses that adjusted for common biasing factors in RCTs, including the type of control condition, trial risk of bias rating, and publication bias  57, 58  .\n\nThe statistically significant effect sizes were observed in both symptomatic (e.g., people meeting diagnostic criteria or reporting elevated mental health symptoms) and non-symptomatic (e.g., university students, general population) samples, further highlighting the potential that smartphone apps could bring within current models of mental health care. For instance, smartphone interventions could eventually serve as a low-cost, easily accessible, and user-friendly option for universal, selective or indicated preventive programs  59  . Smartphone interventions could also fit within the stepped-care model, in which low intensity interventions are offered as a first step in treatment, with more intensive resources reserved for those who fail to respond  60  .\n\nStudies that offered professional guidance (e.g., supportive text messages, personalized feedback, telephone calls) and engagement reminders were consistently associated with larger effect sizes on several mental health outcomes, although smart-phone interventions still significantly outperformed control conditions even in the subset of studies that did not offer guidance or reminders. That therapist guidance and engagement reminders bolster the effectiveness of smartphone interventions is consistent with what has been observed in a series of metaanalyses of Internet-based and computerized psychological treatments  [61] [62] [63] [64]  . However, the involvement of a therapist can be costly and may thus restrict the capacity of smartphone apps to reach the millions of people around the world in need of (and who cannot gain access to) treatment.\n\nIt has been suggested that digital interventions may benefit from peer or automated support rather than human support systems  38, 65  . The development of automated support systems may be guided by machine learning principles, so that users could receive guidance or prompts that are customized to their own needs and in real time  66  . Automated (and personalized) support has been shown to produce equivalent clinical outcomes to human support in RCTs of computerized treatments  67  , which suggests that developing and testing automated support systems for smartphone apps may be an important avenue for future research.\n\nWe also investigated whether the theoretical orientation of the smartphone intervention was associated with effect sizes. While interventions containing mindfulness-or acceptancebased components were not associated with effect sizes, CBTbased interventions produced larger effects for anxiety and stress. However, conclusions concerning the relative efficacy of different theoretical orientations would be premature at this stage, as too few head-to-head comparisons of different smartphone interventions have been performed, and those that compared CBT vs. non-CBT-based smartphone interventions reported no differences in level of symptom improvement  [68] [69] [70]  .\n\nSmartphone interventions did not significantly differ from active interventions on any outcome. These findings, although preliminary, are in line with reports regarding Internet-based treatments  71  , and point further toward the clinical utility of mental health apps. However, we note that few studies contributed to these head-to-head comparisons, so these analyses may have been underpowered. Power may have also been an issue for the other outcomes in which smartphone interventions conferred no benefit over control conditions (panic, post-traumatic stress, and negative affect). Alternatively, it could be that the content quality of smartphone apps for these specific symptoms needs to improve  72  .\n\nLimitations to the present meta-analysis must be considered. First, possible negative effects of smartphone interventions (e.g., deterioration rates)  73  were not assessed, since they were not reported in the included studies. Future studies should examine these possible negative effects  74  . Second, we did not analyze the long-term effects of smartphone interventions, due to large differences in follow-up times and since drop-outs were dealt with inconsistently across studies. Thus, it is unclear whether improvements in mental health are sustained after the period of the study. Assessing the long-term efficacy of smartphone interventions is an important future goal, particularly since promis-ing long-term effects have been noted in Internet-based trials  75  . Third, nearly all included studies assessed outcomes via selfreport questionnaires. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated that clinician-rated instruments yield significantly larger effect sizes in psychotherapy trials than self-reported measures  76  . So, it is possible that our effect size estimates were slightly underestimated.\n\nIn summary, we found evidence for the efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions. They significantly outperformed (with small to moderate effect sizes) control conditions in improving a range of mental health outcomes, with effects remaining robust even after adjusting for various biasing factors in RCTs. Studies that offered professional guidance and engagement reminders were shown to produce the largest effects, and smartphone interventions did not differ significantly from active intervention comparisons on any outcome.\n\nAlthough mental health apps are not here to replace professional clinical services, the present findings highlight the potential of apps to serve as a cost-effective, easily accessible, and low intensity intervention for the millions of people worldwide who cannot receive standard psychological treatment."
