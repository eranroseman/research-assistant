  "title": "A Text Message Intervention with Adaptive Goal Support to Reduce Alcohol Consumption Among Non-Treatment-Seeking Young Adults: Non-Randomized Clinical Trial with Voluntary Length of Enrollment",
  "abstract": "Background: Stand-alone text message-based interventions can reduce binge drinking episodes (\u22654 drinks for women and \u22655 drinks for men) among nontreatment-seeking young adults, but may not be optimized. Adaptive text message support could enhance effectiveness by assisting context-specific goal setting and striving, but it remains unknown how to best integrate it into text message interventions. \n Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate young adults' engagement with a text message intervention, Texting to Reduce Alcohol Consumption 2 (TRAC2), which focuses on reducing weekend alcohol consumption. TRAC2 incorporated preweekend drinking-limit goal-commitment ecological momentary assessments (EMA) tailored to past 2-week alcohol consumption, intraweekend goal reminders, self-efficacy EMA with support tailored to goal confidence, and maximum weekend alcohol consumption EMA with drinking limit goal feedback. \n Methods: We enrolled 38 nontreatment-seeking young adults (aged 18 to 25 years) who screened positive for hazardous drinking in an urban emergency department. Following a 2-week text message assessment-only run-in, subjects were given the opportunity to enroll in 4-week intervention blocks. We examined patterns of EMA responses and voluntary re-enrollment. We then examined how goal commitment and goal self-efficacy related to event-level alcohol consumption. Finally, we examined the association of length of TRAC2 exposure with alcohol-related outcomes from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Results: Among a diverse sample of young adults (56% [28/50] female, 54% [27/50] black, 32% [12/50] college enrolled), response rates to EMA queries were, on average, 82% for the first 4-week intervention block, 75% for the second 4-week block, and 73% for the third 4-week block. In the first 4 weeks of the intervention, drinking limit goal commitment was made 68/71 times it was prompted (96%). The percentage of subjects being prompted to commit to a drinking limit goal above the binge threshold was 52% (15/29) in week 1 and decreased to 0% (0/15) by week 4. Subjects met their goal 130/146 of the times a goal was committed to (89.0%). There were lower rates of goal success when subjects reported lower confidence (score <4) in meeting the goal (76% [32/42 weekends]) compared with that when subjects reported high confidence (98% [56/57 weekends]; P=.001). There were reductions in alcohol consumption from baseline to 3 months, but reductions were not different by length of intervention exposure.",

      "text": "Young adults have the highest prevalence of hazardous alcohol consumption among all age groups  [1] , largely due to binge drinking (defined as consuming \u22654 drinks for women or \u22655 drinks for men on any drinking occasion  [2] ), yet numerous barriers prevent them from seeking help to reduce alcohol consumption  [3] . Mobile digital interventions could help provide evidence-based support to young adults who would not otherwise seek help. Systematic reviews suggest that mobile digital interventions can reduce alcohol use in adults  [4]  and that text message (short message service, SMS) interventions reduce alcohol consumption among young adult populations  [5] . Our group has spent the past 6 years iteratively designing and testing a text message alcohol intervention (Texting to Reduce Alcohol Consumption: TRAC), which uses ecological momentary assessments (EMA) to assist self-monitoring, tailor goal support, and provide performance feedback and relevant protective behavioral strategies. In a large trial, we found that young adults exposed to the first TRAC intervention, TRAC1, reported greater reductions in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injuries compared with control and assessment-only groups up to 6 months after intervention completion  [6] . Still, effects of TRAC1 were small, indicating the intervention was not optimized.\n\nOne design feature potentially limiting TRAC1's effectiveness was that drinking limit goal support was not optimized. In examining EMA data collected from those exposed to TRAC1, we found that subjects declined to commit to a weekend drinking limit goal based on the binge threshold roughly 40% of the times they were prompted and that goals were met only 65% of the time  [7] . In examining latent classes of individuals exposed to TRAC1, we found that the class with higher baseline drinking had lower probability of committing to weekend drinking limit goals and had no discernible reduction in drinking over time  [8] . Finally, in focus groups, several TRAC1 subjects reported ignoring goal prompts or declined goal commitment because they felt consuming <4 or 5 drinks was unreasonable based on the amount they drank, which was typically >10 drinks  [9] . Together, these results provided evidence that design features focused on personalizing goal support, especially for heavier drinkers, needed to be improved.\n\nTo improve context-specific goal support, we incorporated drinking limit goal commitment EMA tailored to past 2-week alcohol consumption, intraweekend goal reminders, self-efficacy EMA with support tailored to goal confidence, and maximum weekend alcohol consumption EMA with drinking limit goal feedback into the TRAC intervention (now called TRAC2).\n\nOur primary aim was to evaluate young adult engagement with the TRAC2 goal support features. Specifically, we examined responses to goal commitment and goal self-efficacy EMA, and how responses related to event-level alcohol consumption. We hypothesized that the percentage of responses indicating a willingness to commit to a weekend drinking limit goal tailored to past drinking (adaptive goal prompts) would be higher compared with the 60% willing to commit to the fixed binge threshold used in TRAC1. Our secondary aim was to examine the association of length of TRAC2 exposure with alcohol-related outcomes from baseline to 3-month follow-up, including maximum drinks per drinking occasion on weekends, prevalence of reporting a binge drinking episode on a typical drinking week, and alcohol-related consequences. We hypothesized that subjects who used the TRAC2 intervention for longer periods would have greater reductions in alcohol-related outcomes than those who used it for shorter periods."

Following introduction by a member of the care team, 117 young adults who were medically stable and not seeking treatment for substance use disorder were approached by research staff and 72 (66.7%) of them provided consent to complete a questionnaire, including assessments of alcohol use severity. Young adults reporting recent hazardous alcohol consumption based on an Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test for Consumption (AUDIT-C) score of \u22653 for women or \u22654 for men  [9]  and at least 1 binge drinking episode in the prior month were eligible to participate. Young adults were excluded if they reported past treatment for drug or alcohol use, reported current medical treatment for psychiatric disorders, or did not own a mobile phone with SMS. Excluded young adults (n=22) did not differ in age or sex from those included (n=50). All subjects provided written informed consent and completed a baseline survey in the ED, for which they were compensated US $20. All procedures were approved by the university's institutional review board. The flow diagram of subject recruitment, enrollment, and retention is shown in Figure  1 ."

We will check in with you on [Thursday and Sunday].\" If subjects completed at least 50% of EMA during the 2-week run-in, they were offered the option of enrolling in the TRAC2 intervention by texting \"Go.\" We included the run-in period to exclude those individuals who expressed initial willingness in participation but did not exhibit adequate engagement through texting."

      "text": "Subjects who met the run-in eligibility criteria and opted in (n=38) were sent EMA each Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. On Thursdays, subjects were queried about their weekend drinking plans and willingness to commit to a drinking limit goal. Instead of asking individuals to commit to a weekend drinking limit goal based on the binge threshold (as done in TRAC1), we used an algorithm that prompted a drinking limit goal based on the running average of the largest number of drinks consumed by that individual on any occasion in the prior 2 weekends. When the average number of drinks in prior 2 weeks was greater than 10, the drinking limit goal was set at 10. When the average number of drinks in prior 2 weeks (#) was reported as less than or equal to 10 but greater than binge (>4/5 drinks), their drinking limit goal was (#) minus 1. This adaptive goal prompt feature fits with harm reduction principles  [10]  to meet individuals \"where they are at\" and the theory of behavioral shaping, where individuals with higher drinking amounts make small, successive approximations to an ultimate low-risk drinking goal (eg, binge threshold)  [11] .\n\nTo increase goal salience proximal to contexts of high cue reactivity and peer pressures  [12] , we sent goal reminders on Friday and Saturday evening (if they had committed to a drinking limit goal). We also queried their confidence in meeting this goal and tailored self-efficacy support based on their reply. This feature fits with prior research showing the importance of self-efficacy as a predictor of heavy drinking  [13] . On Sundays, we queried the maximum number of drinks consumed on any occasion and, based on whether they committed to a goal, sent goal-relevant feedback (success or failure reframing)  [14]  or feedback on amount consumed.\n\nIn addition to these goal support features, we chose to provide individuals more control over how long they use the TRAC2 intervention using enhanced active choice  [15] , where at the end of each 4-week block, individuals were offered the choice to opt in for continued voluntary enrollment. Following each 4-week block, all existing TRAC2-enrolled subjects were given the opportunity to re-enroll by texting \"Go,\" up to a maximum of six 4-week blocks.

We used data from the heavy drinking week to calculate the maximum drinks consumed over any weekend day, and we used data from the typical week to calculate the percentage of subjects reporting any binge drinking episode. The 24-item Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire  [17]  was used to assess the number of negative alcohol-related consequences experienced during the past month. Items were dichotomous (no/yes) and summed. We used the Alcohol Ladder  [18]  to measure an individual's motivation to change their drinking. The Alcohol Ladder is a visual analog scale that consists of 10 rungs, each with a corresponding statement (eg, \"I never think about changing the way I drink, and I have no plans to change\"). We coded responses to fit the stage of change  [19]  continuum (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance)."

To understand changes in alcohol consumption over weekends, we visually inspected distribution of maximum drinks consumed on any weekend day across groups and modeled data by group using repeated-measures linear regressions. We first declared data as a panel to account for clustering within individuals. We specified \"max drinks\" as a count variable with a Poisson distribution and modeled random effects, given the variability in maximum drinks consumed by subjects in week 1 (intercept). We specified that residuals were autoregressive. To understand predictors and processes influencing goal success, we used chi-square tests to examine univariate associations between selected correlates of drinking behavior and drinking goals being met. Finally, we tested the significance of differences between baseline and 3-month follow-up reports using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (for maximum drinks and negative consequences) and 2-sample test of proportions (for prevalence of any binge drinking episode in a typical week).

      "title": "Main Findings",
      "text": "In this study, we found high levels of engagement with a text message intervention incorporating adaptive goal support features among a racially diverse sample of nontreatment-seeking young adults at varying stages of change. Among subjects who met run-in criteria, there were high response rates to EMA during TRAC2 exposure. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we found that there was a high willingness to commit to adaptive drinking limit goals (96% of time), which is higher than the 40% goal commitment willingness when we used a fixed \"binge\" threshold with a similar cohort of young adults in TRAC1  [7] . This suggests that individuals find that goals for limiting drinks close to, but less than, typical drinking amounts are found to be more palatable than drinking limits that require larger reductions from typical drinking amounts. We also found that the proportion of weekends when goals were met was significantly higher than that found in TRAC1. This is likely due to the smaller \"step-down\" for each week, and could reduce the possibility of \"limit violations,\" which can be detrimental to future self-regulation of behavior  [22] . Finally, we found that lower confidence in meeting drinking limit goals was associated with a lower probability of goal success. This finding supports the role of self-efficacy in drinking self-regulation  [23] .\n\nRegarding the safety of prompting individuals to commit to goals to limit drinks at levels found to be associated with negative outcomes, we found that it was a time-limited issue. Despite more than half of subjects being prompted in week 1 to commit to a drinking limit goal above a binge threshold, by week 4 no subject was being prompted to limit drinks above binge threshold. We also recognize that the binge threshold is a somewhat arbitrary cutoff and that there is a linear relationship with escalating blood alcohol content and consequences  [24] , thus supporting goal prompts that work to assist any reduction in alcohol consumption from typical amounts.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first published report of an alcohol intervention that incorporates an algorithm that gradually steps an individual down gradually over time. We focused on goal support, given the importance of goals in behavior change generally  [25]  and for self-regulation of substance use among young adults specifically  [26] . Although there have been no prior alcohol interventions that use adaptive goal prompts, behavioral studies outside the alcohol field have used adaptive goal algorithms to improve step counts among obese adults  [27]  and reduce smoking by using a criterion based on percentile carbon monoxide levels  [28] ."

      "title": "Secondary Findings",
      "text": "We found that 76% (29/38) of enrolled subjects chose to continue the TRAC2 program after the first 4 weeks. We were surprised that a third of subjects chose to continue the program after 12 weeks, with 1 individual continuing the program up to 28 weeks. These findings suggest that most individuals exposed to TRAC2 find it valuable. It also highlights the importance of choice architecture in behavioral intervention designs and supports \"enhanced active choice\"  [15]  where users control length of participation. We did not find that subjects who used the TRAC2 intervention for longer periods had greater reductions in drinking than those who used it for shorter periods. This may be due to the fact that those who used TRAC2 for longer periods had lower alcohol consumption at the start of the intervention, as evidenced through EMA reports in the >12 week group. It may also be that those individuals who did not re-enroll in TRAC2 had made desired reductions in their drinking over a short period and did not need further support, as evidenced through the rapid reductions in weekend maximum drink reports seen in the 4-week group. If this is true, then not all who drop out of mobile behavioral interventions should be considered \"failures.\""

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This was a pilot study with a small number of participants. As such, differences may exist that we were not powered to detect. Subjects were sampled from an urban ED and therefore may not represent young adults broadly. All outcome data were self-reported and subject to possible bias. A quarter of young adults who expressed interest in study participation in the ED did not complete at least half of EMA sent over the first 2 weeks and were thus excluded from receiving the TRAC intervention. This may indicate that not all young adults with hazardous alcohol use are willing or interested in interacting through digital modalities such as SMS to improve health behaviors. We did not use randomization procedures, given the primary aim of determining acceptability, and therefore, cohorts may differ in both measured and unmeasured ways. Finally, the response rates to goal self-efficacy EMA were significantly lower than other EMAs. This may have been due to the fact that either the timing of the messages was not optimal (eg, received during socializing times) or the nature of the query was unacceptable."
