  "title": "Mobile Apps for Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review of Features and Content Quality",
  "abstract": "Background: With continued increases in smartphone ownership, researchers and clinicians are investigating the use of this technology to enhance the management of chronic illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD). Smartphones can be used to deliver interventions and psychoeducation, supplement treatment, and enhance therapeutic reach in BD, as apps are cost-effective, accessible, anonymous, and convenient. While the evidence-based development of BD apps is in its infancy, there has been an explosion of publicly available apps. However, the opportunity for mHealth to assist in the self-management of BD is only feasible if apps are of appropriate quality. Objective: Our aim was to identify the types of apps currently available for BD in the Google Play and iOS stores and to assess their features and the quality of their content. Methods: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and assessment of apps. We searched the Australian Google Play and iOS stores for English-language apps developed for people with BD. The comprehensiveness and quality of information was assessed against core psychoeducation principles and current BD treatment guidelines. Management tools were evaluated with reference to the best-practice resources for the specific area. General app features, and privacy and security were also assessed. \n Results: Of the 571 apps identified, 82 were included in the review. Of these, 32 apps provided information and the remaining 50 were management tools including screening and assessment (n=10), symptom monitoring (n=35), community support (n=4), and treatment (n=1). Not even a quarter of apps (18/82, 22%) addressed privacy and security by providing a privacy policy. Overall, apps providing information covered a third (4/11, 36%) of the core psychoeducation principles and even fewer (2/13, 15%) best-practice guidelines. Only a third (10/32, 31%) cited their information source. Neither comprehensiveness of psychoeducation information (r=-.11, P=.80) nor adherence to best-practice guidelines (r=-.02, P=.96) were significantly correlated with average user ratings. Symptom monitoring apps generally failed to monitor critical information such as medication (20/35, 57%) and sleep (18/35, 51%), and the majority of self-assessment apps did not use validated screening measures (6/10, 60%). \n Conclusions: In general, the content of currently available apps for BD is not in line with practice guidelines or established self-management principles. Apps also fail to provide important information to help users assess their quality, with most lacking source citation and a privacy policy. Therefore, both consumers and clinicians should exercise caution with app selection. While mHealth offers great opportunities for the development of quality evidence-based mobile interventions, new frameworks for mobile mental health research are needed to ensure the timely availability of evidence-based apps to the public.",

      "text": "Symptom monitoring is a fundamental component of the self-management of bipolar disorder (BD) that benefits from being performed in real-time and under natural conditions  [1] . With mobile phone penetration reaching 97% worldwide, and smartphones accounting for the majority of phone sales in 2014  [2] , researchers and clinicians are investigating the use of smartphone technology to enhance the management of chronic illnesses such as BD. As smartphones are personal devices that are carried on the user, mobile apps are a perfect platform for self-management. Smartphones can also be used to deliver interventions and psychoeducation, supplement treatment, and enhance therapeutic reach in BD, as apps are cost-effective, accessible, anonymous, and convenient.\n\nA study by Proudfoot et al  [3]  found that consumers hold positive attitudes towards evidence-based mental health apps, with 76% of survey responders indicating that they would be interested in using their smartphones for monitoring and self-management of mental health. This acceptability has also been shown in mobile programs for BD, with personal digital assistant  [4, 5]  and short message service based interventions  [1]  proving effective and acceptable to consumers. Similar programs are now being developed for smartphones. For instance, Wenze et al  [6]  are developing an expanded smartphone version of their successful PDA-based \"Increasing Adherence in Bipolar Disorder\" intervention, which will incorporate psychoeducation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions using smartphones alongside in-person treatment to address medication adherence. A smartphone app based on Interpersonal and Social Rhythms Therapy (IPSRT) augmented with objective data from phone sensors is also in production. This app, called \"MoodRhythm\", aims to stabilize daily routines and rhythms to prevent episode-onset  [7] . Also investigating the potential use of objective data alongside self-report, the monitoring, treatment, and prediction of bipolar disorder episodes (MONARCA) study app attempts to validate objective indicators of affect change by investigating correlations with user-inputted and clinician mood ratings  [8] . Additionally, Gr\u00fcnerbl et al  [9]  are investigating extending this research to enable the app to identify mood state changes based solely on objective sensor data. However, to our knowledge, there are currently no apps available for people with BD that have been subject to research evaluation to determine effectiveness.\n\nPrevious reviews have found that apps currently available to consumers for other health conditions are unlikely to be supported by research data, nor be developed with reference to evidence-based practice. For example, an investigation of the content of smoking cessation apps found that apps had low concordance with guidelines, with an average guideline adherence score of 7.8 out of a possible total of 60  [10] . Examining other chronic conditions with a strong self-management focus, a review of apps for asthma self-management determined that only 5% of those providing information were comprehensive, while 44% made recommendations that were not in line with treatment guidelines  [11] . Similarly, a review of apps for human immunodeficiency virus / sexually transmitted disease prevention and care found that only 11% of assessed apps covered all literature-driven prevention areas  [12] . Moreover, Donker et al  [13]  performed a systematic review of apps for mental health and noted the striking disparity between the number of apps available and the number of scientific articles assessing the evidence base of mental health apps. Similarly, a simultaneous review of health-related apps and research literature for a number of conditions noted the contrast between the number of research publications regarding the use of mobile technology to manage the investigated illnesses and the profusion of available apps  [14] .\n\nAn examination of the Google Play and Apple iOS app stores indicates that there is an abundance of publically available apps for BD despite the limited published research. Therefore, there is little information accessible to consumers about the quality of available apps beyond the user \"star\" rating system and user reviews. However, the popularity of an app is not necessarily a reliable indicator of its quality, effectiveness, or evidence base. The opportunity for mHealth to assist in the self-management of BD is feasible only if apps are of appropriate quality, and therefore, the aim of the current study was to identify the types of self-management apps available in the Google Play and iOS app stores and to assess the comprehensiveness and quality of their content for BD."

      "text": "A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and assessment of apps.\n\nSearch terms to identify apps developed specifically for BD were derived through a preliminary search of the Google Play store. Relevant synonyms and layperson alternatives to the identified terms were determined and also included in the search. Layperson alternatives were included because our aim was to assess apps that were specifically designed for consumers with BD, a group that may not use the technical terms of the disorder. In this way, the following search terms were identified: bipolar, bi-polar, \"manic depression\", \"mood swings\", \"mania\" AND \"mood\", cyclothymia, and cyclothymic. On July 16, 2014, these terms were used to identify publically accessible apps for BD in the Australian Google Play and iOS app stores. Android apps were identified by a search of the Google Play store via the Web interface, while iOS apps were identified via the iTunes/iOS search application programming interface. Details of apps identified from the app stores were extracted from the search results including app name, description, and price. Duplicate apps that were retrieved by multiple search terms on the same device platform were removed. Conversely, apps with different versions (eg, free/paid) or which appeared across different platforms were retained for comparison. Two reviewers (JN and ML) independently screened the app store description of each app. Apps were included in the review if the following criteria were met: (1) developed for BD, (2) aimed at consumers and/or caregivers, (3) available for download through official Android/iOS app stores, and (4) available in English. Discrepancies were identified and discussed until consensus was achieved."

Two reviewers (JN and ML) performed the assessment of apps using a standard data extraction form.\n\nDescriptive characteristics related to the following features were extracted: (1) app accessibility, including platform, price, need for network connectivity, number of downloads, and average user-scored star rating for the app's entire history, (2) primary function, such as app store classification, app function (see below), and target audience, (3) app source, including provider type and details, crisis information, disclaimer presence, and app update schedule, and (4) privacy and security, presence of an accessible privacy policy, and the ability to password-protect data.\n\nThe function of each app was determined through use of the app and classified as providing either information or self-management tools. Additional assessment was performed based on the identified function. Apps containing information about BD were assessed according to the comprehensiveness of its psychoeducation information and the quality of the information, as reflected by its concordance with evidence-based guidelines. The comprehensiveness of BD psychoeducational information was assessed according to 11 fundamental topics of face-to-face psychoeducation interventions  [15] . Core statements were derived from the main topics and goals of psychoeducation with reference to Colom and Vieta's Psychoeducational Manual for Bipolar Disorder  [15]  (Table  1 ). A clinical psychologist with experience with BD then reviewed the statements for accuracy and completeness.\n\nTable 1. Core components of psychoeducation for BD. a"

Thirteen statements were derived from treatment guidelines and meta-analyses for use as quality indicators in the app review (Table  2 ;  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ). A psychiatrist previously involved in the development of the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Bipolar Disorder  [22]  then assessed and adjusted the statements for accuracy and comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness and quality of information were calculated as a score out of 11 and 13 respectively, indicating how many of the core psychoeducation and guideline-derived statements were covered by the app's information.\n\nApps providing common tools for the management of BD were assessed against best-practice resources for their purpose. Screening and assessment apps were assessed according to whether the app used a validated BD screening questionnaire or how closely it reflected current diagnostic criteria  [25, 26] . Symptom monitoring apps were evaluated according to their similarity to well-known paper-and-pencil monitoring tools  [27, 28] . Treatment apps for BD were assessed against statements derived from the core goals of three commonly used therapies for the disorder: CBT  [29] , IPSRT  [30] , and Family-Focused Therapy (FFT)  [31] . As with statements used to assess the comprehensiveness and quality of information, treatment statements were reviewed by a clinical psychologist with experience with BD. Community support apps, which provided access to BD-orientated discussion boards, were assessed based on their methods of communication, and the level of moderation or oversight.\n\nTable 2.

In total, only four of the 10 screening apps used validated measures, and six of the tests screened for only manic symptoms.\n\nOf the apps that asked about symptoms of depression, three had a duty-of-care message at the end of the test, referring the user to clinical support if questions about suicidal ideation were answered positively.

The number of apps monitoring mood, medication, sleep, and other symptoms is shown in Table  5 . A mood scale designed for BD was defined as a continuous scale with \"depressed\" and \"manic\" at the extremes. Other scales used to monitor mood included using different emoticons to represent emotions (n=10), rating mood on a generic scale (n=8), or had users select from or rate a list of moods (n=4). Thirty apps monitored factors not commonly included on established mood charts, with energy levels and anxiety the most common additions. These tracking options were customizable in nine apps, allowing users to monitor factors specifically relevant to their mood states. General customization of other features such as esthetics, profiles, and data reports was possible in 21 apps. Alerts reminding users to track their mood were available in 22 of the 35 monitoring apps. Of these, 13 allowed users to designate a reminder time, six asked users to designate how many times per day to be reminded, and three had options for both. Over a sampling period of 3 days, seven apps failed to notify the user as directed.\n\nNone of the 35 monitoring apps had a duty-of-care alert, that is, a message suggesting users contact a health care provider. This was tested by logging 3 consecutive days of severely depressed mood and indicating suicidal ideation in free-text notes. Inputted monitoring data was presented graphically by 30 apps, could be exported from 20, and shared via social media by seven. Back-up of personal monitoring data was available in only six apps. No app used the sensor capabilities of the smartphone to enhance monitoring data beyond what is possible with paper-and-pencil resources, or as an attempt to validate subjective mood reporting with objective data."

    {
      "title": "Principle Findings and Comparison With Prior Work",
      "text": "This assessment of apps for BD indicates that most currently available apps do not reference clinical practice guidelines, standard psychoeducation information, or established self-management tools. Apps were available for a variety of uses including disorder information (38%), and management tools such as screening and assessment (12%), symptom monitoring (43%), and community support (5%). Interestingly, no apps combined these functions to provide both information and self-management tools. Furthermore, while all the assessed apps mentioned BD in their app store description, the content evaluation indicated few had been designed specifically for the disorder. For example, only a third of mood monitoring apps provided a BD specific mood scale, with the remaining apps using scales inadequate for the population. Furthermore, merely half of the apps claiming to provide information about BD actually provided disorder-specific information to be assessed for comprehensiveness and quality. Disappointingly, apps that did provide BD specific information had low levels of adherence to quality assessment criteria, neither comprehensively addressing main psychoeducation domains, nor endorsing evidence-based practice guidelines. The app that correctly addressed the most treatment guideline criteria was Your MD's Symptom Checker (app ID 39), which referenced NHS Choices  [32] , and presented information concisely and coherently (only BD information was assessed). Overall, comprehensiveness and quality scores were low and not correlated with average user ratings, confirming that an app's popularity is not an accurate gauge of its content. However, with only a third of information apps citing their information source, users are denied other important information by which to make informed judgments about an app's robustness and credibility.\n\nApps that offered tools to assist with the management of BD were also inconsistent in quality. Few screening and assessment apps citied the source of the test; additionally, a Google search of each app's assessment questions revealed that less than half used validated screening measures. Only one treatment app was included in the review, and while it covered half of the CBT treatment domains, it was not specifically designed for the needs of people with BD. Symptom monitoring was the most prevalent self-management tool offered by apps. However, only a third allowed users to track all three symptoms standard in traditional monitoring tools: mood, sleep, and medication. The high proportion of monitoring apps that did not feature a notification or alert function to remind users to input daily mood data was unexpected. As the ability to remind users to complete monitoring in situ is a major advantage of this technology, it is surprising that more than a third of monitoring apps did not utilize this function, and a further seven did not ensure the feature functioned as intended. It was also an unexpected finding that no symptom monitoring apps used the smartphone's sensors to supplement the user-inputted monitoring data. Torous et al  [35]  found that all published articles regarding apps for bipolar disorder focused on the use of passive sensor-enabled data collection with supplemental or no user input. This is another example of the disconnect between emerging research in this area, and apps currently available for the disorder.\n\nThese results are consistent with findings of reviews assessing apps of other heath domains. Unfortunately, many of these reviews examine quality using the information provided in the app store description rather than assessing app content against evidence-based clinical guidelines  [36] . However, those that do assess content have found similarly low endorsement of quality criteria. Huckvale et al  [11]  assessed asthma information against evidence-based asthma treatment guidelines and reported that the most endorsed guideline was cited by only 32% of apps. A similarly low concordance with guidelines was found in a review of smoking cessation apps  [10] . While a recent review of depression apps did not assess content, it highlighted another difficulty faced by users of health apps. Shen et al  [37]  reported that a search for depression on the five major app stores yielded three times more non-related apps than depression apps  [37] . In the current study, 78% of apps were excluded due to not being related to BD or not having a BD specific aim. This suggests an app's quality is not the only challenge consumers face in identifying appropriate apps, as irrelevant alternatives dominate search results. Together, these findings suggest that the results of the current study reflect a wider problem of app availability and quality across health conditions.\n\nRarely considered, the lack of privacy policies made available to app users was another area in which apps developed for BD fell short of optimal standards. A recent review by Dehling et al of information security and privacy of mobile health apps characterized apps that had access to mental health information as high sensitivity  [38] . The review identified health monitors, state of health tests, treatment reminders, and health records, which included disease management tools, as the highest privacy and security risks  [38] . However, only a quarter of the assessed BD self-management tools, which would fall into the above categories, provided a statement indicating how data would be protected, stored, and shared. Sunyaev et al  [39]  reported a similar absence of mHealth privacy policy availability. Their assessment of health apps found that only 30.5% provided privacy policies, two-thirds of which did not address the app specifically  [39] . This represents a problematic lack of transparent reporting of how apps handle personal and mental health-related data. As the use of apps in health care becomes more common, the topic of information privacy will continue to grow in relevance, as privacy and security consistently feature as major considerations of users  [3, 38] . Therefore, the time to ensure structures are in place to address privacy and security is now.\n\nWhile apps asked users to input personal health data, very few responded to indications that users were unwell. In fact, only three apps responded to users indicating severe extremes of mood or suicidal ideation. A lack of response to severity of recorded symptoms was also noted by Huckvale et al  [11]  in asthma management tools. Although both psychoeducation and clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of the ability to identify and respond to indications of mood change, few apps assisted users by informing them of such changes. This identification and response to indicators of change in mood forms the basis of action plans or stay well plans. Action plans are a common feature of psychoeducation  [15]  and combine information about early warning signs and factors that may ameliorate them into a plan that aims to prevent episode relapse. Action plans are also a common self-management tool used by people with BD to stay well  [40, 41] . A cohort of individuals that had not experienced an episode of BD for more than 2 years were interviewed about their strategies for staying well  [41] . All participants discussed the importance of a tailored and revised stay well plan, which identified triggers and early warning signs and designated strategies to intervene. However, no information apps mentioned action plans, and no self-management tools assisted users in the development of an action plan. Together with the lack of response to user input, this represents a missed opportunity for the facilitation of important self-management practices by mobile technology."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The current study is not without its limitations. A possible limitation is that the apps assessed were those available through the Australian Google Play and iOS app stores, and app availability may differ globally. This may affect the generalizability of results to apps available in other locations. However, a search of the Australian, British, and American iTunes app stores using the primary search term \"bipolar\" indicated that results were remarkably comparable. In total, 97% of apps were available in all three regions, with only three apps exclusively available in the American store. Therefore, at least in English-speaking countries, apps appear to be universally available, and this review provides a representative overview of the apps available internationally. A second possible limitation is that while this study is novel in that it provides, to our knowledge, the first assessment of apps for BD in respect to clinical guidelines, psychoeducation principles, and self-management tools, it does so for a snapshot of apps available when the search was performed in July 2014. As such, with changing nature of the Google Play and iOS app stores, the marketplace of apps for BD will differ by time of publication."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "With the exponential increase in the use of smartphones, there has been an increased interest in the use of apps for information dissemination and disease management. However, this study's findings highlight important shortcomings in current app marketplace offerings for BD, suggesting that apps are developed independently of research data, and without reference to best practice clinical guidelines. These results indicate that clinicians looking to recommend apps to supplement treatment should exercise caution with app selection and that policy makers and the research community need to consider ways of assuring app quality. There is an opportunity for mental health research to develop quality evidence-based mobile interventions that assist with the management of BD. However, with the domains of research and technology currently moving at different paces, new frameworks for mobile mental health research are needed to prevent a lag in availability and to ensure that evidence-based apps are available to consumers."
