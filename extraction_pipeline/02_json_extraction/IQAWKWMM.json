  "title": "Treatment Outcomes/Obesity Comorbidities Effects of bariatric surgery for knee complaints in (morbidly) obese adult patients: a systematic review",
  "abstract": "Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of knee osteoarthritis, and over the past 30 years the prevalence of obesity has more than doubled. In an advancedstage knee osteoarthritis is treated with total knee arthroplasty, and the demand for primary total knee arthroplasties is expected to grow exponentially. However, total knee arthroplasty in obese patients is associated with more complications, longer hospital stay and higher costs. We aimed to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on knee complaints in (morbidly) obese (body mass index >30 kg m -2 ) adult patients. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, TRIP, BIOSIS-Previews and reference lists of retrieved publications were systematically searched from earliest available up to 20 April 2014 for any English, German, French and Dutch studies. There was no restriction on study design. We included studies on the effect of surgically induced weight reduction on knee complaints in (morbidly) obese adult patients, with a minimal follow-up of 3 months. Studies on the effects of lipectomy or liposuction and studies in which patients had already received a total knee arthroplasty were excluded. Thirteen studies were included in this systematic review with a total of 3,837 patients. Although different assessment tools were used, an overall significant improvement in knee pain was seen in 73% out of the used assessments. All studies measuring intensity of knee pain, knee physical function and knee stiffness showed a significant improvement after bariatric surgery. The quality of evidence was very low or too low for most of the included studies and moderate for one study. Bariatric surgery with subsequent marked weight loss is likely to improve knee pain, physical function and stiffness in (morbidly) obese adult patients. However, with the current available evidence, there is need for high-quality studies.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "According to the World Health Organization the worldwide prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530 kg m -2 ) has more than doubled between 1980 and 2008. In 2008, 10% of all men and 14% of all women were obese and these numbers are continuing to increase. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, some cancers and the development of osteoarthritis (OA), especially in weight-bearing joints  (1) .\n\nKnee OA accounts for 83% of the total OA burden, measured by years lived with disabilities  (2) . The risk for developing knee OA increases by 35% with a 5-unit increase in BMI  (3) . Knee OA is initially treated conservatively, but when OA progresses a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is often indicated. The number of TKAs performed in the United States has increased substantially over time and the demand for primary TKAs is expected to grow by 673% between 2005 and 2030. This exponential growth is partly explained by the rising prevalence of obesity  (4) . Currently, obese patients represent at least half of the patients undergoing TKA; this proportion increased from 2000 to 2008 from 49 to 59% in primary TKA and from 51 to 62% in revision TKA  (5) .\n\nIn a recent meta-analysis on the influence of obesity on the outcome of TKAs, Kerkhoffs and colleagues  (6)  reported more infections (odds ratio 1.90), more deep infections requiring surgical debridement (odds ratio 2.38), and more revisions (odds ratio 1.30) in obese patients. Furthermore, TKA in obese patients is associated with longer hospital stay and higher costs. Beyond 30 kg m -2 every 5-unit increase in BMI is associated with higher hospitalization costs of approximately $250-300 for patients undergoing primary TKA, and $600-650 for patients undergoing revision TKA  (5) .\n\nWeight loss following a dietary programme is effective for pain relief in obese patients with symptomatic knee OA, independent of the level of joint damage  (7) . This is supported by the most recent guidelines of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons on treatment of knee OA, in which they suggest weight loss for patients with a BMI \u2265 25 kg m -2 (8). Unfortunately, durable weight loss is often hard to achieve in obese individuals because of limited mobility (9). Therefore, surgically induced weight loss, bariatric surgery, could be of great value as it is more effective than any conservative approach, with acceptable cost-effectiveness  (10, 11) . However, according to the current International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity guidelines, only patients who fail non-surgical intervention and have class III obesity (BMI \u2265 40 kg m -2 ) or medically complicated class II obesity (BMI \u2265 35-39.9 kg m -2 ) are potentially eligible for bariatric surgery  (11) .\n\nIn 2011, Gill and colleagues  (12)  conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients on hip and knee pain associated with OA. They concluded that these patients may benefit, but that there is a paucity of evidence and a considerable amount of variability among the included studies. Since then, new studies on this topic were published. Furthermore, we now know that the prevalence of both obesity and knee OA will increase considerably and that obesity has negative effects on the outcome and costs of a TKA. Therefore, a renewed systemic review that focuses on the effects of bariatric surgery for specifically knee complaints is needed."

First, the quality of evidence was only very low to moderate. Unfortunately, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed on this topic. Second, the variability in the used assessment tools forced us to a descriptive review. Moreover, only four studies  (20, 22, 25, 29)  described the severity of OA using the Kellgren-Lawrence classification, of which none described the relation between the severity of OA and the effects of bariatric surgery on knee complaints. Fourth, four studies  (20, 22, 25, 28)  used the WOMAC questionnaire for the assessment of pain. As it is a general measurement for the lower extremity, not a specific instrument for the measurement of knee pain, this could lead to outcome reporting bias  (35) . Fifth, two studies  (21, 25)  were conducted at the same department partly simultaneously. They used different tools, but we cannot rule out that some patients were included in both studies resulting in duplicate publication bias. concerning the review process are the language restriction and the fact that only two authors responded to the request for further information.

To prove these potential positive effects, well-designed ethically justified RCTs on the effect of bariatric surgery on knee complaints are needed for a more definite answer. Currently, only three ongoing and unpublished studies were found, of which two have an observational design. The third ongoing study, an RCT, compares laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding prior to TKA with TKA alone, in obese patients with knee OA  (40) . In addition there is need for an RCT in (morbidly) obese patients with knee OA that are unable to lose weight, in whom bariatric surgery followed by conservative knee treatment is compared with knee replacement without bariatric surgery. Apart from complications such as infection, revision and mortality, knee pain and physical function should be determined by a validated outcome measure such as the WOMAC or the KOOS  (35, 41) . Moreover, a distinction should be made between the various stages of OA, with an objective assessment such as the Kellgren and Lawrence classification  (42) .\n\nIf bariatric surgery proves to be an effective treatment for knee OA, this could answer the question whether permanent weight reduction can prevent the need for TKA. Subsequently, this could reduce the number of primary TKAs, and associated complications and high costs for our healthcare system. Another relevant outcome might be that the results of a TKA after bariatric surgery improve, should patients become candidate for knee replacement eventually."
