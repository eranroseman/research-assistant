All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self-reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non-adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non-adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised).\n\nKhonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention.\n\nFour authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non-adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics.\n\nThe included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly a er acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high-income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle-income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle-income country (Pakistan).

      "text": "Worldwide, there are an estimated 13 million deaths due to coronary heart disease or stroke each year, and 80% of these deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries (Lozano 2012).\n\nIt is estimated that approximately three times as many people will suffer non-fatal cardiovascular events and that each year\n\n35 million people have an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event. Worldwide, at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Chambless 1997; WHO 2002; Yusuf 2011). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a new cardiovascular event than people without known CVD (Kerr 2009). Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of a cardiovascular event in patients with known atherosclerotic CVD. There are two main aspects to secondary CVD prevention: risk factor management and medications. Drug interventions (such as antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers and statins) have been shown to be cost-effective in reducing the risk of subsequent fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and are recommended in international guidelines (ESC 2012; Smith 2011; WHO 2003a). Unfortunately there is a well-documented knowledge-practice gap in the implementation of these proven cost-effective interventions. For example, the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study reported that in low-and middle-income countries up to 75% of patients with known CVD are not using even one recommended medication (Yusuf 2011). Even in high-income countries, adherence to recommended treatments remains suboptimal. A cross-sectional survey of 12 European countries showed only 26% of patients on antihypertensives achieving control of hypertension and less than 31% of patients on lipid-lowering medication achieving cholesterol control (Kotseva 2010). It has been shown that a considerable proportion of cardiovascular events could be attributed to poor adherence, with 9% of cardiovascular events in Europe attributed to poor adherence(Chowdhury 2013). It is estimated that good adherence may be associated with a 20% lower risk of CVD and a 35% reduction in all-cause mortality (Chowdhury 2013). This evidence-practice gap might be influenced by different factors, including health system issues such as lack of accessibility and affordability; treatment complexity; or patients' non-compliance with recommendations (Nieuwlaat 2013). In order to influence noncompliance there is a need to develop scalable and cost-effective behaviour-change interventions."

      "text": "The global number of mobile phone subscribers is estimated at nearly seven billion (ICT 2014). Even in low-and middle-income countries the penetration rate of mobile phones is estimated to be 90% (ICT 2014). The widespread ownership of mobile phones and the possibility of automation leads to a potential to deliver behaviour-change interventions to large numbers of people at low cost. Mobile phone interventions are a potentially promising means to deliver messages to increase medication adherence. The use of mobile devices such as phones to support the delivery of medical care is commonly referred to as mHealth."

      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "Mobile phone text messages have been shown to improve medication adherence for a variety of conditions including HIV (Sharma 2012). The development of messages should follow some theoretical framework, and text messages should be developed specifically for the target population and intervention (Abroms 2015). Text messages as an intervention are relatively cost-effective and quick, and do not require that the intended audience need to search for information as it is delivered to them (Douglas 2013). Two recent systematic reviews addressed the question of using mobile phones for all types of medication adherence (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Park 2014b). The majority of studies found significant improvement in medication adherence through the use of text messages. Overall, few adverse events have been reported with mobile phone text messaging; however, potential rare adverse effects such as road traffic crashes may occur."

      "title": "Why it is important to do this review",
      "text": "While there is a great deal of enthusiasm for mHealth interventions among researchers and policy makers, there is still limited evidence for its effectiveness (Free 2013\n\n). Systematic reviews have recently been conducted on adherence to medications and reported promising results (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Park 2014b; Thakkar 2016); however, to date no systematic review has been conducted evaluating specifically the effect of mobile phone text messaging on secondary CVD prevention. Furthermore, no review has examined how text messages are created, and if short message service (SMS) are tailored based on individual patient characteristics, and if some patients benefit more than others from interventions. Mobile phone text messaging is of particular interest in low-and middleincome countries because of wider accessibility of mobile phones with text-messaging capabilities than smart phones."

We were able to obtain responses from four studies (Dale 2015a; Khonsari 2015; Park 2014a; Kamal 2015) the responses are summarised in Table  1 .\n\nTwo studies reported that the SMS was developed as a reminder to take their medications (Khonsari 2015; Park 2014a), and as a result no work was put into their development.\n\nOne study specified that the automated computer program from which the messages were sent was developed particularly for this study (Pandey 2014). Four other studies stated that an automated system was used (Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Park 2014a; Khonsari 2015), which can also be assumed for the remaining study but was not explicitly stated (Quilici 2013). In detail, Dale 2015a specified that \"we created and refined the Text4Heart intervention through formative and pre-testing studies following the mHealth Development an Evaluation Framework\" and \"a SMS library of 503 messages has been developed.\n\nIt is written in English at an appropriate reading level (RMS 800 Lexile: approximately age 13 years) tested using the Lexile Analyzer 2013 so ware program (MetaMetrics, Durham, NC, USA).\" Park 2014a specified that \"The primary intervention for this research study was based on Self-Efficacy Theory by Bandura. Briefly, this theory postulates that in one's capability to successfully perform certain behaviours influences level of motivation, affective states, and action (Bandura 1997).\" No study reported evaluating causes for non-adherence in the study. Dale 2015a and Khonsari 2015 reported on the psychological and behaviour-change techniques used in the development of their text messages (Table 1). Three studies tailored the text messages to the participants' name (Dale 2015a; Khonsari 2015; Park 2014a). One study stated that the messages were personalised without providing further details (Quilici 2013). One study (Pandey 2014) did not provide information on whether or not the messages were tailored. No study detailed that text messages were tailored to individual patient characteristics. Two studies stated that bi-directional text messaging was required (Dale 2015a; Park 2014a). Participants were required to respond back to confirm receipt (Park 2014a) or send their step count, questions and feedback (Dale 2015a). One study stated that the formulation of the text messages were different every day (Quilici 2013). Four studies provide details on the template texts used for the text messages (Dale 2015a; Pandey 2014; Park 2014a; Khonsari 2015). Dale 2015a, Kamal 2015, and Khonsari 2015 reported piloting the questionnaires before conducting the study; Fang 2016 did not discuss the method or timing of the SMS at all in the paper. Interventions Duration of the intervention ranged from 30 days (Park 2014a; Quilici 2013) to 12 months (Pandey 2014). Daily text messages were sent in most studies (Khonsari 2015; Pandey 2014; Park 2014a; Quilici 2013). One study (Dale 2015a) sent daily text messages from week zero to 12 weeks, which were reduced in week 13 to week 24 to five messages a week. One study (Fang 2016) did not report on message frequency. Kamal 2015 stated that they were sent on \"preset days of the week\", and at particular times before each medication intake. The control group was usual care in five studies (Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Pandey 2014; Quilici 2013), text messaging for health education in one study (Park 2014a), and monthly phone calls in one study (Fang 2016). Usual care in Dale 2015a consisted of the standard outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program, involving education classes and supervised exercise. Outcomes All included studies measured adherence to medication. Quilici 2013 looked at aspirin adherence using self-reported adherence. Two studies (Pandey 2014; Khonsari 2015) measured the overall adherence to several prescribed medications. Pandey 2014 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews included participants on a once-daily regimen of aspirin, a betablocker, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a statin using self-reported logs. Most participants in Khonsari 2015 were on five or more daily medications, adherence was measured using the Morisky Meidication Adherence Scale. One study measured adherence to antiplatelet and statin medications separately using both electronic pill bottles and self-reported adherence (Park 2014a). One study only looked at adherence to statins (Fang 2016). One study did not specify which medications the participants were taking and adherence was measured, but specified that it used selfreported medication adherence (Dale 2015a). One study reported on fatal cardiovascular events (Khonsari 2015). Two studies provided outcome data for our secondary outcome of blood pressure (Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015) and one study reported on LDL cholesterol (Dale 2015a). Two studies reported on adverse events (Dale 2015a; Quilici 2013). Four studies did not report on any of our secondary outcomes (Khonsari 2015; Pandey 2014; Park 2014a; Quilici 2013)."

MMAS-8 is a patientreported metric and validated tool that is widely used in adherence research. Unfortunatetly the studies presented the results in different ways, making it difficult to pool the studies. Dale 2015a, with a follow-up of six months and 116 participants analysed reports for the intervention group a \"significantly greater medication adherence score (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% CI 0.19, 0.97; P=.004)\". In particular, this was a MMAS-8 score of 7.3 (SD 0.9) for the intervention group and 6.8 (SD 1.2) for the control group at the six months follow-up. Fang 2016, had a three-arm design with SMS, SMS + micro letter, or telephone calls (follow-up of six months and 271 patients analysed) reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non-adherent compared to telephone reminders (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63) and patients that had SMS + micro letter had the lowest odds compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.15). Kamal 2015 (200 participants, two-month follow-up) reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85). Khonsari 2015 (62 participants) reported that \"the risk of being low adherent [(score 3-8 according to Morisky 1986)] among the control group is 4.09 times greater than the intervention group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18)\" at eight weeks followup. The same study also reported end of follow-up at two months the low adherence was 16.1% in the intervention group and 58.1% in the control group. Park 2014a, with the shortest follow-up of 30 days and 28 participants analysed in each group, reported a baseline MMAS-8 score of 6.20 (SD 1.66) for the intervention group and 5.85 (SD 2.10) for the control group. At follow-up, the score had risen for both groups, but was higher for the control group at 6.73 (SD 1.49) than for the intervention group at 6.43 (SD 1.22) (no P value reported). Objective Measures In addition to the MMAS-8 score, Park 2014a used another measure to test for medication adherence. A Medication Event Monitoring System (opening of the two electronic pill bottles provided a time-stamp corresponding with medication self-administration) resulted in the following. Antiplatelet doses taken on schedule were 86.2% (SD 15.4) in the intervention group and 85.7% (SD 18.2) in the control group. For statins, 84.1% (SD 19.4) of doses were taken on schedule by the intervention group and 79.7% (SD 19.3) in the control group. The correct number of antiplatelet doses taken were 88.0% (SD 14.0) in the intervention group and 87.2% (SD 16.5) in the control group.

The studies were mainly on CHD, with only one study examining stroke so the results are not applicable to other cardiovascular diseases.\n\nTwo trials for which information on the country is available took place in high-income countries (New Zealand and USA) and two took place in upper middle-income countries (China and Malaysia), and only one was conducted in a lower middle-income country (Pakistan) (Worldbank 2015). It is uncertain where the other two studies were conducted, but they were likely from high-income countries (France and USA). It is therefore unclear whether the results would apply to low-and middle-income countries. Access to mobile phone technology does not seem to be a problem in low-and middle-income countries (Worldbank 2012). We identified eight ongoing studies, that ranged from 75 individuals (NCT02336919) to 710 individuals (Chow 2015). Five of these studies are being conducted in high-income countries (ACTRN12616000422426; Chow 2015; NCT01642355; NCT02336919; NCT02783287).\n\nMost of the studies examined medications and diseases singly, this has implications for the generalisability of results, given that most people may have co-morbidities, or be on multiple medications."

The studies were generally of short duration, with two trials only lasting 30 days.\n\nEach study has at least one risk of bias domain judged as high risk. All studies were either at high or unclear risk of bias for blinding; both performance and detection bias, and only three studies (Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Park 2014a) were at low risk for allocation concealment and random sequence generation. Although all studies used mobile phones as the way to deliver the intervention, we identified substantial differences in the actual content of the SMS. Only one study (Dale 2015a) used behaviourchange models to develop the content of the intervention, while two other studies used just \"reminders\", and for the other two there was lack of information for review authors to judge what type Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of content was used in the SMS. This heterogeneity not only has implications to the applicability of the evidence, but also raised the questions that quality of reporting for trials evaluating mobile phone interventions is very poor."

Al-Ganmi and colleagues conducted a systematic review looking at cardiovascular medication adherence in cardiac patients, and also found too much heterogeneity of results to conduct meta-analysis (Al-Ganmi 2016). In a large systematic review of mhealth for behaviour-change and disease management, Free 2013 found that text message-based interventions increased adherence to antiretroviral (ART) and smoking cessation. One study on mobile text messaging for adherence on all chronic diseases found that mobile text messaging nearly doubled the odds of medication adherence (Thakkar 2016). Our study is the first review to include an assessment of SMS development."

      "title": "Implications for research",
      "text": "Mobile text messaging appears to have positive effects on adherence to medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with very little evidence of adverse events. However, there is a lack of high quality evidence. Although we were able to identify eight ongoing studies, most of these are from high-income countries. As a result we call for more, adequately powered, good quality, randomised studies to be conducted, particularly in low-resource settings. Because in most cases there is a need for lifelong adherence to medications longerterm trials are also needed. Future studies should also examine the frequency and timings that the messages should be sent; message content; optimal development processes, and process evaluations to assess the mechanisms by which messages have effect. It is of particular importance that standardised approaches to measure adherence (development of free and validated scores) are used so that outcomes can be pooled across studies."

The participants were required to respond to the SMS stating if they have taken their medicines. Moreover, twice weekly health information SMS were also sent to the intervention group. Health information SMS were customised according to medical and drug profile of every patient by the research team.\n\nControl: patients received the usual standard of care provided at the centre for stroke patients. This primarily consisted of regular follow-up visits (as advised by their neurologist) with their stroke neurologist. In general, these were at 1, 3, 5,9,12 months after a stroke. Each patient was provided with a telephone number that could be used to reach the stroke team in case of an emergency and each patient was also reminded of their clinic appointments 1-2 days prior via SMS and/or phone Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews \"The messages were designed in a weekly schedule at preset days of the week for total 8 weeks e.g., Wednesday and Saturday week 1 for patient X.

The text-messages content was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) multidimensional adherence model (WHO 2003b). In constructing the content of the text messages, we focused on the most common reasons for medication non-adherence based on the WHO model that are unintentional on the patient's part (forgetfulness and carelessness with medication usage), and include a therapy-related dimension (misunderstanding of treatment instructions: meds name, dosage and timing) (Gadkari 2012). No information -No information -Evaluation of causes for non-adherence No According to the study method, patients were recruited during an admission for ACS prior to discharge from the cardiology ward. It means that all patients were primarily diagnosed with ACS without any experience of taking cardiac medications. Therefore, evaluating causes for non-adherence in the target population was not applicable. No information -No information -Used psychological theories to develop SMS Messages were based on social cognitive theory and the common sense model (Dale 2014b) The WHO multidimensional adherence model (WHO 2003b) that guided this study included many different aspects to describe medication non-adherence behaviour including psychological factors. It is emphasised that no single determinant is responsible for non-adherence to treatment because the adherence phenomenon is multidimensional and results from the interplay of five sets of factors (dimensions) including: No Information -No information -Table 1.

Text messages were semi-personalised (addressed to participant's preferred name). Each message was sent on 4 to 5 randomly selected weekdays and arrived at random times of the day during working hours. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews message management program selected messages for each participant at random from a bank of messages. Participants were told not to respond to messages.\n\nControl group: Control participants received usual care, which generally included community follow-up with the majority referred to inpatient cardiac rehabilitation, as determined by their usual physicians."

The authors also stated that medication adherence data are planned to be published as a sub-analysis. Active Comparator: Prevention consult in addition to usual care, patients will receive a prevention consult by a prevention fellow and attending following their intervention. The consult will include guideline-based medical recommendations for optimisation of the patient's medical regimen targeting dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes. In addition, each patient will be educated on the cardiovascular disease process and given detailed lifestyle recommendations on physical activity, improved nutrition, smoking cessation and medication adherence. The physician-written prescription for antiplatelets and statins will be transferred on an OMR sheet and will be scanned. The information on the prescription (dose, name of the medication, duration, route or any other special instruction) will be sent to the patients via a text and a voice SMS (in Urdu language). The patients also receive an individualised code that helps them request for repeated reminders for their medication timings. However, a weekly medication reminder SMS will be sent to the patients in the intervention arm. Patients will receive regular semi-personalised text messages for 12 months. Each participants will receive 6 text messages per week, which will be sent at random times of the day (9.00 am, 12 noon, 4.00 pm). They will receive one general messages, one hypertension message, one glucose control message, one lifestyle message, one medication adherence message and one physical activity message per week."
