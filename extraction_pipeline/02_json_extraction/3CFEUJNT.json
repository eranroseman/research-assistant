  "title": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Chronic Pain: An Overview of Systematic Reviews with Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials",
  "abstract": "This overview of reviews aimed to summarize the evidence from systematic reviews and metaanalyses of randomized clinical trials of the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for adults with chronic pain in relation to pain intensity, pain-related functioning, quality of life, and psychological factors. The Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to July 2, 2023. AMSTAR 2 was used to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews. The overlap among reviews was calculated. Nine reviews comprising 84 meta-analyses of interest were included. At posttreatment, some meta-analyses mainly showed that ACT can reduce depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and pain catastrophizing; and can improve mindfulness, pain acceptance, and psychological flexibility. At three-month follow-up, ACT can reduce depression symptoms and psychological inflexibility, as well as improve pain-related functioning and psychological flexibility. At six-month follow-up, ACT can improve mindfulness, pain-related functioning, pain acceptance, psychological flexibility, and quality of life. At six-twelve-month follow-up, ACT can reduce pain catastrophizing and can improve pain-related functioning. Some methodological and clinical issues are identified in the reviews, such as a very high overlap between systematic reviews, the fact that the certainty of the evidence is often not rated and specific details needed to replicate the interventions reviewed are often not reported. Overall, however, randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews show that ACT can improve outcomes related to chronic pain (eg, pain-related functioning). Future systematic reviews should address the methodological and clinical concerns identified here to produce higher-quality findings. \n Perspective: Despite certain methodological and clinical issues, randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews of ACT appear to show that it can improve outcomes related to chronic pain (eg, psychological factors).",

In the United States alone, 1 in 3 people suffer from chronic pain, producing an annual national cost of between $560 and $635 billion in medical costs and lost productivity.  50 The experience of chronic pain is complex because of the multiple biopsychosocial factors it involves.  36 Therefore, interdisciplinary pain management may be the best coping option for patients with chronic pain dealing with a long list of symptoms related to their condition (eg, physical disability).  10 s part of the biopsychosocial management of chronic pain, psychological interventions-specifically cognitivebehavioral therapies (CBT)-have been the topic of many studies and have shown promising results.  16, 33 Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a form of CBT that relies on psychological flexibility, operant theory, and relational frame theory.  34 ACT emphasizes that improvement of 6 core processes (acceptance, self-as-context, cognitive defusion, present moment, values, and committed action) increases psychological flexibility and helps people engage in meaningful activities even when they are experiencing negative thoughts or emotions (ie, pain catastrophizing).  12 he idea behind ACT is that experiences that cause us pain, fear, grief, loss, or disappointment should not be repressed or ignored since these feelings are part of human life.  12 nstead, by focusing on personal qualities and activities that prove valuable to us and give us purpose (eg, personal growth), we are better equipped to face them.  12, 21 n chronic pain, different clinical trials have shown that ACT can be delivered online or face-to-face and is often applied alone or as part of interdisciplinary pain management.  32, 56 The number of clinical trials assessing the possible benefits of ACT for chronic pain has increased in the last decade, producing, in turn, a plethora of systematic reviews on this topic during the last 5 years.  4, 13, 17, 32, 45, 53, 56 The overview of the systematic reviews presented herein aims to summarize and critically analyze the benefits that ACT may have for pain intensity, pain-related functioning, psychological factors, and quality of life in adults with chronic pain. Overviews can help pain clinicians and researchers detect potential gaps in knowledge and chart future paths for ACT and chronic pain."

Eligibility criteria: Only systematic reviews with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included. Ultimately, we focused on RCTs since this research design is considered to yield the highest primary research evidence.  44 Eligibility criteria: quality of life and other psychological factors apart from anxiety and depression symptoms (eg, pain catastrophizing) were considered. This gives us a better perspective on the role ACT plays in chronic pain. Data extraction: We extracted information from systematic reviews that applied sensitivity analyses and/or meta-regressions. This step was essential to determine whether the systematic reviews explored possible sources of heterogeneity in their meta-analyses. Data analysis: Although a bibliometric analysis was not conducted, an upset plot was built to illustrate the overlap among systematic reviews."

No restrictions were considered in terms of cointerventions. ACT is a process-based, third-wave CBT based on 6 core processes (acceptance, self as context, cognitive defusion, being present, values, and committed action).  12 No restrictions were considered in terms of the time point effects of ACT (eg, post-treatment, or three-month follow-up).\n\nC: There were no restrictions considering the type of comparator.\n\nO: Psychological factors (eg, depression symptoms), pain (eg, pain intensity or pain sensitivity), pain-related functioning, and quality of life evaluated with self-reported tools (eg, the hospital anxiety and depression scale).\n\nS: Systematic reviews with meta-analysis evaluating RCTs. The definition of a systematic review proposed in the preferred reporting items for overviews of reviews checklist  18  was used for the selection:\n\nA systematic review is a type of study design that uses systematic, reproducible methods to collect data on primary research studies, critically appraises the available research, and synthesizes the findings descriptively or quantitatively. Typically, reviews considered systematic will include a research question, the sources that were searched (using a reproducible search strategy), the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the methods used to select primary studies, assessments of risk of bias in the included primary studies, and information about data analysis and synthesis that allows the results to be reproduced. However, systematic reviews might lack some of these components, for example, risk of bias assessments.\n\nThe exclusion criteria were: 1) meta-analyses that did not include at least 2 RCTs; 2) meta-analyses that mixed RCTs and non-RCTs; 3) network meta-analyses that did not provide direct estimates of comparisons of interest; 4) meta-analyses that mixed clinical trials on chronic pain with those focused on other health conditions (eg, other chronic conditions not involving pain); 5) meta-analyses that combined clinical trials in which ACT was delivered alone or jointly with other interventions with clinical trials on interventions other than ACT (eg, mindfulness practice)  20  ; 6) different outcome measures were meta-analyzed jointly without any clear justification (eg, pain acceptance and self-efficacy)  4  ; 7) overviews of systematic reviews; 8) protocols; 9) thesis dissertations and conference proceedings; and 10) abbreviated or previous versions of systematic reviews that were included in this overview."

All systematic reviews reported effect sizes at predetermined time points (eg, post-intervention or six-month followup). Therefore, this was the first option to extract effect sizes. When time points were not used, effect sizes were extracted from other types of subgroup analyses (eg, the type of experimental or comparator group or the type of clinical health condition). Effect sizes were measured in all of the studies included using standardized mean difference (SMD, Cohen's d, or Hedge's g). Effect size was considered small for an SMD up to .49, medium for an SMD of between .50 and .80, and large for an SMD of .80 or higher.  9 Finally, corresponding authors were contacted via e-mail when certain information was unreported or needed to be clarified."

The \"ACT for psychological factors\" category was subdivided by the psychological factors being evaluated: depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, distress, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, psychological flexibility, psychological inflexibility, values-based action, and mindfulness.\n\nA decision was made to include all meta-analyses that evaluated pain-related functioning, pain interference, or physical disability in the same section. These outcomes were measured with self-reported questionnaires such as the work and social adjustment scale, the multi-dimensional pain inventory, the Oswestry disability index, and the pain and impairment relationship scale. Since all fit with \"pain-related functioning,\" this term is used throughout the study to facilitate the interpretation of the results.\n\nThe efficacy of ACT was divided into: 1) positive effect when more than 50% of the meta-analyses conducted on a specific outcome and time point (eg, depression symptoms at post-treatment) reported a positive effect in favor of ACT, 2) negative effect when more than 50% of the metaanalyses conducted on a specific outcome and time point showed a lack of effect of ACT when compared to comparison groups, and 3) inconsistent effect when 50% of the meta-analyses conducted on a specific outcome and time point found a positive effect in favor of ACT and 50% of the meta-analyses did not confirm this positive effect."

At post-treatment, meta-analyses mainly showed a reduction of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and pain catastrophizing as well as an improvement in mindfulness, pain acceptance, and psychological flexibility. At three-month follow-up, ACT was shown to reduce depression symptoms and psychological inflexibility and to improve pain-related functioning and psychological flexibility. At six-month follow-up, ACT improved mindfulness, pain-related functioning, pain acceptance, psychological flexibility, and quality of life. At sixtwelve-month follow-up, ACT was shown to reduce pain catastrophizing and improve pain-related functioning. A recent overview of systematic reviews has also found that ACT could reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in different clinical populations (eg, patients with cancer or multiple sclerosis)  5  which may support these findings. While these results should encourage pain clinicians to consider ACT when treating patients with chronic pain, the clinical and methodological issues cited below should be considered when interpreting the findings of our overview."

      "title": "Clinical and Methodological Considerations",
      "text": "As occurs in many areas of health research, studies on ACT are often characterized by heterogeneity, inadequate initial reporting in trials, unsatisfactory approaches to bias and quality, and idiosyncratic outcome categories. In terms of the systematic reviews included here, the GRADE approach  44  to rate the certainty of the evidence was missing in 6 out of the 9 reviews.  17, 23, 29, 32, 53, 55 When systematic reviews are done without this tool, it is impossible to know how a potential risk of bias, inconsistencies, indirect evidence, imprecise results, and publication bias could affect the quality of the findings. There were, however, 3 systematic reviews that applied the GRADE approach: Du et al  13  found moderate evidence of ACT improving pain-related functioning for fibromyalgia. Sch\u00fctze et al  45  found high evidence of ACT reducing pain catastrophizing when compared to active controls with different chronic pain diagnoses, though evidence was low when ACT was compared to usual care, wait-list, or expressive writing interventions, and Williams et al  62  found very low evidence for the efficacy of ACT on pain, pain-related functioning, and distress. Overall, based on the information in the RCTs and ACT reviews, it appears that ACT can improve outcomes related to chronic pain (eg, pain-related functioning), although the certainty of this evidence has not been broadly checked. Therefore, systematic reviewers in the field of ACT and chronic pain are strongly encouraged to use the GRADE approach to confirm the grade of certainty of the findings observed.\n\nOverall, the systematic reviews included here showed that ACT could improve pain-related functioning, psychological factors, and quality of life at different time points. However, pain clinicians should be aware that different forms of delivering ACT (face-to-face, online, self-help books, individual sessions, or group sessions) were combined in some of the meta-analyses.  13, 23, 32, 62 nce sufficient data is available, it will be important for future studies to examine the effect size of each modality and pose the question as to whether or not a combination of modalities affects the estimation of the effect size.\n\nFurthermore, some chronic pain diagnoses such as chronic headache, chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, or mixed chronic pain were combined in some meta-analyses.  32 Although different chronic pain diagnoses may share similar characteristics in their progression and perpetuation, the use of secondary analyses such as metaregressions may help determine whether the combination of different pain diagnoses in the same meta-analysis influences the overall effect size."

    {
      "title": "Future Research",
      "text": "In order to improve quality, future systematic reviews could use the TIDieR checklist  22  to evaluate the clinical details for the interventions reviewed. This checklist is based on 12 items that can be rated as 'reported,' 'partially reported' or 'not reported' to collect information on aspects of the intervention such as who provided, how and where, what material and procedures, and adherence details. In addition, the GRADE approach should be used to assess the certainty of the evidence of each meta-analyzed outcome. Secondary analyses such as meta-regressions, subgroup meta-analyses, or sensitivity analyses could be also helpful in detecting possible sources of heterogeneity. Finally, future systematic reviews with meta-analysis should summarize evidence on ACT with regard to a specific chronic pain diagnosis (eg, neck pain or knee pain) whenever it is available."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Some systematic reviews may have been overlooked due to the exclusion of thesis dissertations, conference proceedings, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in languages other than English or Spanish. Cochrane recommends that 2 independent reviewers conduct screening and inclusion, methodological quality/ risk of bias assessments, and data extraction in overviews of reviews.  41 However, the Cochrane recommendation for screening and inclusion or data extraction was not followed here, which could increase the chance of bias in our methodological process. Only AMSTAR 2 was applied to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews. As AMSTAR 2 and the ROBIS tool  58  overlap in many signaling questions,  37  the ROBIS tool was not used in this overview. The results were not divided into categories by the type of comparison group. Although there were meta-analyses comparing ACT versus passive or active comparison groups, some meta-analyses mixed passive and active comparison groups in the same analysis, and some meta-analyses did not specify what comparison groups were mete-analyzed (See Table  1  for all comparisons). Therefore, we did not separate those meta-analyses that analyzed the efficacy of ACT versus passive controls (eg, wait list) from those meta-analyses that evaluated the efficacy of ACT versus active controls (eg, other psychological intervention)."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "In the last decade, a great number of RCTs and reviews have demonstrated that ACT can be effectively used for chronic pain. Despite the methodological and clinical issues detected in many of the systematic reviews, the evidence appears to indicate that ACT improves outcomes related to chronic pain (eg, psychological factors). Most of the systematic reviews show that ACT can reduce depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and pain catastrophizing and that it can improve mindfulness, pain-related functioning, pain acceptance, psychological flexibility, and quality of life at different time points. Finally, as noted herein, systematic reviewers should be encouraged to apply the GRADE approach to confirm the grade of the certainty of their findings."
