  "title": "The regulatory status of health apps that employ gamification",
  "abstract": "Smartphone applications are one of the main delivery modalities in digital health. Many of these mHealth apps use gamification to engage users, improve user experience, and achieve better health outcomes. Yet, it remains unclear whether gamified approaches help to deliver effective, safe, and clinically beneficial products to users. This study examines the compliance of 69 gamified mHealth apps with the EU Medical Device Regulation and assesses the specific risks arising from the gamified nature of these apps. Of the identified apps, 32 (46.4%) were considered non-medical devices; seven (10.1%) were already cleared/approved by the regulatory authorities, and 31 (44.9%) apps were assessed as likely non-compliant or potentially non-compliant with regulatory requirements. These applications and one approved application were assessed as on the market without the required regulatory approvals. According to our analysis, a higher proportion of these apps would be classified as medical devices in the US. The level of risk posed by gamification remains ambiguous. While most apps showed only a weak link between the degree of gamification and potential risks, this link was stronger for those apps with a high degree of gamification or an immersive game experience. Smartphone applications (i.e., mHealth apps) are one of the main delivery modalities in digital health 1 . As with other end-user-facing apps, user engagement is critical to the efficacy of these healthcare apps 2,3 . One strategy to augment engagement and enhance user experience in these apps involves integrating elements that have demonstrated efficacy in digital games  [4] [5] [6] [7]  . The integration of these game elements can be approached in two different ways. One is through the development of fully-fledged games, commonly referred to as 'Serious Games' (SG) 8 . Alternatively, specific game design elements (e.g., 'points,' 'badges,' or 'leaderboards') can be used within non-gaming apps, known as gamification  [8] [9] [10]  . The definition and distinction of both terms are still much debated. Various definitions exist, some of which are incongruent  7, 10  . This is further complicated by the fact that gamification can be incorporated into apps to differing degrees, and in extreme cases, it is difficult to distinguish between gamification and SGs 11 . SGs are often defined as an \"Interactive computer application, with or without significant hardware components, that has a challenging goal, is fun to play and engaging, incorporates some scoring mechanism, and supplies the user with skills, knowledge, or attitudes useful in reality [\u2026] 8 , \" while gamification is often defined as \"the use of game design elements in non-game contexts 9 . \" This definition is limited  10, 11  and was extended by Sailer et al. in 2017, who defined gamification as the \"[\u2026] process of making activities in non-game contexts more gamelike by using game design elements 4 .\" SGs, however, are inspired by entertainment games in appearance and technology and often need specific hardware (e.g., powerful computers, VR headsets, or gaming controllers)  8, 12  . In contrast, gamified apps utilize game elements like points, badges, high scores, leaderboards, and storytelling 4 and generally have cheaper development and fewer hardware constraints than serious games. The differences in and application of these approaches are described in Fig.  1 . The number of gamified apps on the market is growing  [15] [16] [17]  , with many examples among fitness, business, and education apps  18, 19  . A sector that is also growing is healthcare-specific gamified approaches  20, 21  , which are increasingly linked to wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) and are applied in chronic disease management, therapy, nutrition, and mental health  [21] [22] [23]  . A further grouping is apps as platforms for healthcare organizations such as insurance companies  20  . The evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and benefits of gamification in apps is mixed. There is suggestive evidence of its beneficial effects on health-related behaviors in one systematic review, particularly in promoting physical activity, nutritional awareness, healthy eating, and medication adherence, with positive effects in 59%",

Behavioral outcomes seem to be positively targeted, with some potential in mental health  22  . Yet, another systematic review indicated that gamification elements within mental health apps did not significantly boost the effectiveness of interventions or user adherence  25  . Gamification has shown a favorable influence on food selection and related nutritional behaviors in children and adolescents in the post-intervention phase (increase of the serving of fruits and vegetables of about 0.67)  24  . In diabetic populations, gamified interventions have been associated with improved medication adherence and HbA1c control (mean difference -0.21; 95% confidence interval (-0.37 to -0.05); p = 0.01)  26  and reduced highfat food consumption in diabetes self-management  27  . However, the lasting effect of gamification is not yet fully understood, as shown by the unknown long-term effects on blood glucose control beyond a 12-month period  26  . In addition, insufficient technical implementation of gamification elements or the use of these elements without understanding the underlying psychological mechanisms limits user engagement  28  . A recurring limitation in serious games and gamification research is the lack of robust study designs and randomized controlled trials, making it difficult to draw concrete conclusions  22, 24, 27, 29, 30  .\n\nWhen developing gamified applications for clinical practice rather than research purposes, new challenges might arise, such as ensuring clinical safety and managing risks associated with their use. Once gamified apps have a medical purpose, e.g., the treatment of specific diseases, they must comply with existing stringent regulatory requirements like all devices with a medical purpose. This includes obtaining clearance or approval as medical devices (MDs) and adhering to rigorous quality management frameworks encompassing development, release, audit, and clinical evidence of safety and efficacy. This procedure is not only intended to assess the potential benefits of an application, but primarily to mitigate the risks associated with the use of this product for end users, regardless of the actual clinical improvements. Globally, MDs, including gamified apps, fall under various regulatory jurisdictions, such as the EU's Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (MDR)  31  and the US Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)  32  . In the context of the EU, a device (e.g., software but also SGs) qualifies as a MD if, among other things, it is intended by the manufacturer to be used for \"(\u2026) diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease (\u2026)\", injury or disability, or for the control or support of conception  31  . In addition to the binary classification as a medical device or not, many jurisdictions classify devices into certain classes (e.g., Class I to Class III) depending on the risk they pose to the user  31, 32  . This risk classification is based on defined rules for different kinds of devices, e.g., software, surgical instruments, or invasive devices  31, 33  . Supplemental Material 1 provides a detailed description of the steps for qualification as a medical device and for classification into specific risk classes with examples. Putting such a MD on the market without meeting these requirements, when identified by the regulator, would be followed by warning letters for removal of the product, followed by enforcement action, which could include heavy fines or even custodial sentences. The latter are rare, and regulators have limited capacity for market surveillance. Therefore, unapproved (and illegally on the market) apps persist in the app stores  34  . An investigation of drug-dosage calculators, which are also considered SaMDs, has shown that the regulatory compliance of these freely available apps is poor and that they pose a risk to patients  35  . Although there is no definitive evidence of widespread actual harm to patients caused by SaMD malfunctions  36, 37  , the task of regulation is to prevent this as much as possible. Since most appbased MDs are distributed via the Apple and Google app stores, which are considered distributors and often importers under MDR  31  , they are responsible for ensuring conformity with regulations  38  . Fig.  1 . The user type and gamification space of mHealth apps. The range of current on-market apps is described according to their intensity of 'gamefeel' (x-axis) and their intended user group (y-axis). The degree of 'gamefeel' of the apps was based on the definitions used for this study  4, 11, 13, 14  . The apps shown are based on the properties of on-market apps.\n\nInterpreting the regulatory clearance/approval process can already be challenging for non-software MD manufacturers or traditional software developers  39, 40  . Interpretation is yet more challenging for cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), generative artificial intelligence (e.g., large language models)  [41] [42] [43] [44]  , or gamification. Here, both the interpretation of whether the intended purpose of the app qualifies as a medical device and their classification (grouping into regulatory 'risk classes' of medical devices) can be difficult. Also, since these apps could pose previously unknown risks, assessing their risks, including psychological effects, situation-specific interfaces, individualized user experiences, or device performance, can be challenging  45  .\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of gamified health apps, it remains unclear whether, as a category, they are effective or meet the regulatory requirements placed on them to ensure public safety. Even though the regulatory path of gamified applications is the same as that of non-gamified applications, this relatively new technology poses particular regulatory challenges within existing legislations  45  . Existing regulations provide guidance on how to assess and mitigate the risks of certain aspects of SaMD, including audio-visual technologies  46  , the use of AI  47  , or cybersecurity  48  . However, gamification differs from these aspects covered by existing guidance due to the unique characteristics described above. Therefore, this study assesses the regulatory compliance of the EU's most popular gamified health apps, available via the Google PlayStore and Apple AppStore. It examines the evidence supporting their medical claims (including diagnostic and therapeutic claims) and compliance with the EU's MDR. The study includes a qualitative comparison of the regulatory compliance of the identified apps in the US. We hypothesize that (H1) many gamified apps are on the market without the required MD approval and that (H2) unapproved gamified apps on the market without the required MD approval have hazardous or uncontrolled aspects to their gamification that could lead to patient harm."

The remaining 863 apps were then examined by the mHealth assessment panel. Of these, 328 met the criteria for mHealth apps. The gamification assessment panel examined those, and 77 apps were considered gamified. Eight apps were excluded since they functioned solely as interfaces for sensors Fig.  2 .

The remaining 69 apps were examined by the regulatory, clinical evidence, and risk expert panel. Seven of these 69 apps were already approved as medical devices in the EU, two according to the Medical Device Directive (MDD)  49  and five according to MDR  31  . All five (of seven) MDR-cleared and one (of two) MDD-approved apps were considered to have the correct risk class and CE-marking under the regulations as they currently apply (allowing for the transition arrangements for the older MDD regulations). One MDD app was assessed as likely to be up-classified in its risk class under MDR (from MDD Class I to MDR Class IIa). All seven MD-approved apps were assessed as qualifying as MDs by the panel. Of the 62 not approved apps, 32 were considered 'non-MDs, ' 10 were considered potential MDs, and 20 were considered MDs. The strength of agreement between the reviewers regarding the qualification as MD was fair (Fleiss' kappa = 0.40).\n\nApps that qualify as MDs have to follow a defined regulatory process. Considering all 69 assessed apps, 32 (46.4%) do not need to follow the regulatory process since they do not qualify as MDs. Six apps (8.7%) were rated by the panel as compliant with the required regulatory process. 10 apps (14.5%) were considered as potentially on the market without the required regulatory approvals, and 21 (30.4%) as on the market without the required regulatory approvals. The strength of agreement between the reviewers on regulatory compliance was fair (Fleiss' kappa = 0.37).\n\nAll seven approved apps and two not approved apps (13.0%) presented evidence in the form of peer-reviewed publications on their websites that demonstrate the effectiveness of their medical claims."

The largest category of apps was cardiovascular health management apps (n = 11), followed by apps assisting with addictions (n = 8), health insurance management apps (n = 6), diabetes management apps (n = 5), and pregnancy management apps (n = 5). The remaining apps were distributed over categories, with low numbers per category (1-3 apps), belonging to categories including, e.g., clinical guidance for HCP apps or symptom checker. A detailed list of all categories can be found in Fig.  3 .\n\nThe apps with the highest risk class as assessed by the regulatory panel can be found in the category of clinical guidance for HCP apps (Class IIa-III), diabetes management apps (Class IIb and Class IIb-III), and cardiovascular health management apps (Class IIa-III). All apps assisting with addictions, apps that foster physical activity, medication tracker, and parenting apps were considered 'non-MD. ' The degree of compliance to applicable regulations varied greatly between app categories: in some categories, most or all apps were compliant with regulations (e.g., symptom checker, mental health apps), while in other categories, all or nearly all apps could be considered to not have the correct risk class and CE-marking under the regulations as they currently apply (cardiovascular health management, neurological rehabilitation, diabetes management, urological prevention/therapy, musculoskeletal therapy). Among the approved apps, two were intended for obesity management and two for diabetes management. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Qualification as a medical device and risk classification 32 (46.4%) apps were considered not to be classified as MDs under EU law, while 10 (14.5%) were considered potential MDs, and 27 (39.1%) were considered MDs. The reliability of agreement between the assigned 'mostlikely' vote for risk classification of reviewers was fair (Fleiss' kappa = 0.33). In case of unanimous votes by the panel, ten apps would fall in Class I (14.5%), seven in Class IIa (10.1%), and one in Class IIb (1.4%). For nonunanimous votes, the range was quite broad. Four apps (5.8%) ranged between 'non-MD' and Class IIa, another three (4.3%) between Class IIa and Class III, four apps (5.8%) ranged between 'non-MD' and Class IIb and eight apps (11.6%) were considered 'non-MD' or Class IIa.

Of these apps, 27 (64.3%) could be considered MDs or potential MDs, but according to the expert panel, only 21 were on the market with correct risk class and CE-marking under the regulations as they currently apply. All seven already cleared/approved apps were in this category. Among the 'Health & Fitness' apps (n = 27, 39.1%), 10 (37.0%) were considered MDs or potential MDs by the regulatory panel.

      "title": "Analysis of app risks related to gamification",
      "text": "The numerically predominant risk identified across a subset of eight apps in the in-depth gamification analysis was the possibility of users being misled by incorrect medical information, predominantly attributed to software bugs, which could result from poor programming or inadequate testing, or attributed to conceptional problems in the design process, e.g., of interfaces. This risk was frequently classified as moderate in severity. The correlation between this risk and the gamification elements was generally assessed as weak, particularly in apps with a lower degree of 'gamefeel' (1 and 2 out of 5). Apps with a higher 'gamefeel' were assessed as having a stronger linkage between gamification and risk. These risks include the danger of users developing an over-reliance on the gamified tool caused by more compelling engagement mechanisms. Due to the assessment process based on ISO 14971, similar hazards, foreseeable sequences of events, hazardous situations, and harms in different apps could lead to different severities. The same applies to the association between gamification and risk, as this relationship depends on whether gamification elements alone have an impact on risk or whether other aspects of the app have an effect as well.

      "title": "Principal results",
      "text": "Our study has several findings that have implications for regulatory oversight and market compliance of publicly available gamified mHealth apps in the EU. Out of 863 apps analyzed, 69 were gamified mHealth apps. The panel considered 37 apps (53.6%) as MDs or potential MDs, necessitating appropriate clearance. Only 7 (10.1%) of these apps were already considered to have the CE-marking under the regulations as they currently apply, 6 of them in the appropriate risk class. One app was judged to face an up-classification with the transition from MDD to MDR on 31 December 2028  54  . In total, 31 (44.9%) of apps were assessed as not or potentially not compliant with the regulatory requirements, which confirms our first hypothesis (H1).\n\nAdditionally, only 9 (13.0%) of the apps provide evidence for their effectiveness; among them, all seven cleared/approved apps  4, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 45, 55, 56  . There is therefore a large gap in evidence for the largest segment of gamified apps and serious games. It is concerning that there is lack of clinical evidence (or the non-publication of this by the manufacturers) and a lack of appropriate regulatory approval, as lay people with no medical training could download these consumer-facing Only 14.5% (n = 10) of the assessed apps would fall into a low-risk category (Class I under MDR), whereas 39.1% (n = 27) could be classified as Class IIa or higher. MDs that fall into Class I, based on the MDR rules, have an easier pathway to regulatory approval since they can self-declare their conformity with the MDR without the involvement of a notified body  31, 57  . In comparison, higher-risk apps must be developed within a sophisticated and certified quality management system, bringing many quality requirements and increased regulatory burden to market access and involving a notified body for the conformity assessment  31, 53  . This process is presented in detail in Supplemental Material 1. It is highly unlikely that any of the 23 (33.3%) apps that are on the market without a CE-mark but assessed as Class IIa or higher will have undergone any standardized process of design, testing, risk assessment, and post-market surveillance, which are judged necessary by legislatures for apps in these categories.\n\nThe reliability of agreement among reviewers on this binary decision (MD or not MD) was fair (Fleiss kappa = 0.40), while the reliability of agreement for the risk classification itself (non-MD to Class III) was noticeably lower but still fair (Fleiss' kappa = 0.33). This could be due to different reasons: firstly, a large variation of the reviewer's perspectives indicating the challenge, even for experts, to classify gamified apps; secondly, a regulatory framework that is ambiguous; and thirdly, a regulatory framework challenged by the continuous emergence of new software approaches and app types that were not anticipated when the regulations were written. We suspect that the reason for this lies in a combination of all three explanations, considering existing evidence that the practical classification of MDs is ambiguous and discussed by courts 58 and among experts  59  . Additionally, the ruleset for SaMD remains unclear and relatively broad, as stated in MDCG 2019-11  60  . Some experts have even challenged whether any mHealth apps can be classified as MDR Class I devices, and some competent authorities have taken this view, refusing to accept the registration of any Class I apps  61  , while other experts and competent authorities have accepted the registration of Class I apps. This ambiguity is highlighted by the classification assessments of individual apps in this study, often ranging between Class I and IIa (Fig.  4 )."

      "title": "Specific risks linked to gamification",
      "text": "Our assessment shows that gamification was used in both approved MDs and in apps with a clear medical purpose that are available through the app stores despite lacking the required clearances/approvals. The second research question centered on whether the observed lack of compliance means risks for patients that might be related to gamification. The presence or absence of gamified elements does not solely determine an app's qualification as a medical device since, here, the app's intended purpose, which is defined by the developer, is crucial. However, gamification elements are of great importance for the risk assessment process, an integral part of the MD approval process, particularly when they are integral to the app's medical purpose. Thus, they may affect the MD's risk classification. While it is likely that apps that are approved/released as MD have considered the risks associated with gamification in their design, risk assessment, usability engineering, and mitigation measures as required by the regulations, it is highly unlikely that any of these formalized approaches to safe design have been followed for apps that are on the market without the required clearance/approval.\n\nThe in-depth analysis of a subset of eight apps was focused on specific risks associated with gamification elements and harms that could emerge from the failure of such elements. In a standardized approach defined in ISO 14971 50 , we have described risks related to hypothetical scenarios as well as risks that occurred while testing the app. This approach would be a requirement for the approval of MDs.\n\nOur results show that for most of the apps examined, the scenarios of failure of gamification elements posed little risk to patients. This is due to the following: (i) the main risk to users was being misled by incorrect medical information, resulting in mild to moderate harm; and (ii) most of the apps studied had a low level of gamification, and we assessed that there was a low association between gamification and risk in the app. Some of these risks could be caused by software bugs, which could be addressed through updates, while others may stem from foundational design flaws requiring more substantive revisions. For apps with a higher degree of gamification, we found a stronger link between risks and gamification elements.\n\nOf the eight apps included in the in-depth analysis, three had a strong connection between gamification and risk and possessed potentially hazardous or uncontrolled aspects to their gamification that could lead to patient harm. The first app (23_CARD) provided an interactive chat tool powered by ChatGPT-4 (a large language model-based chatbot  62  ), branded as an \"AI doctor. \" This tool claims to offer health advice based on deep learning algorithms, presenting a user-friendly interface adorned with comic-style 3D elements and avatars. Its gamification strategy hinges on a credit-based reward system designed to encourage daily logins and advertisement viewing, using gift timers and push notifications to foster habit-forming user behaviors. The number of interactions with the chatbots is limited by an in-app currency, which could lead to incomplete health assistance. The user would then rely on partial information, potentially resulting in delayed or incorrect medical treatments. Moreover, the app risks disseminating incorrect medical information, which occurred during the testing, misleading users about the severity or treatment of their conditions by providing contradictory advice under the guise of a specialized \"AI doctor. \" This misinformation could inadvertently direct users to make harmful medical decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate data. Additionally, since some of the app's features are non-gamified while others are, the app poses the risk that patients neglect these non-gamified features (e.g., blood pressure management), leading to incorrect or delayed treatment.\n\nThe second app (43_DIAB) for use by diabetics incentivized users to enter their blood glucose measurement data by awarding them with 'points. ' It used this data to calculate self-application dosage amounts of insulin. The app in question uses only five out of 81 items in the questionnaire for insulin dosage calculation and also rewards entering '0' as a value (e.g., if no insulin was taken). If those constraints are implemented in a poor way (e.g., no option for adding '0' as a value and still getting rewarded), or no consistency check of the input is performed, the user could 'cheat' to gain more points, e.g., by adding impossible hours of training or carbon intake, wrong insulin injection dosages. Those wrong values could potentially lead to false analyses and health recommendations by the app and hence might lead to lower clinical outcomes or, in a worst-case scenario, to high-risk situations for the patient, e.g., in hypoglycemia, if too much insulin is injected. An additional risk identified is that some features of the app are less gamified than others. This could lead to a neglect of the less gamified features, leading to incorrect or delayed treatment. We acknowledge that we have not had the opportunity to review the material provided for the regulatory process for this specific app. These reports would include both usability and clinical testing and may demonstrate that the approach taken in the app is indeed safe.\n\nThe third app (67_NEUR) was rated as having a high 'gamefeel' , although it only has one gamification element as defined by Sailer et al. (2017). Even if it cannot be described as a fully immersive, full-fledged game due to its limited visual presentation and the absence of relevant game aspects, it still represents an edge case. The gamified character in this app was much more strongly linked to the intended purpose than in the other applications analyzed, leading to a limited immersive experience for the users. As a result, the connection between the gamification elements and potential hazards was higher than in apps that included gamification elements but no immersive experience. One gamification-related risk identified in this and several other apps was that of over-reliance on the apps due to their engaging design and the stimulation effect of gamification. In scenarios of app malfunction, gamification of this nature could exacerbate delays to the start of effective treatment, as the gamification could promote ongoing use. The stronger the gamification was linked to the intended purpose of the app, the stronger the connection between risk and gamification was among the apps analyzed. Whilst no fully immersive SGs could be included in our study, 67_NEUR could point to interesting future research. Since the intended medical purpose of immersive SGs is particularly strongly related to gameplay, the connection between the degree of gamification and risk observed in our study could be investigated better.\n\nConsidering the complex and varied link between gamification and risks, Hypothesis 2 could neither be definitively accepted nor rejected. However, a small number of dangerous gamified apps were identified on the market that are not approved/cleared and where there is a clear need for action by the regulatory authorities and the app store in question (Google PlayStore)."

      "title": "Implications for the app stores",
      "text": "Since Google and Apple have an effective duopoly on the mobile market  63  , they play a pivotal role in distributing consumer-facing health apps. As importers or distributors under MDR  31  , the app stores are legally obliged to ensure regulatory compliance of the apps they offer 38 . Our results on gamified apps support previous findings on other types of mHealth apps that neither Apple nor Google adequately meet those requirements  34, 35  . This study shows that the availability of unapproved apps, despite the legal requirement for MD approval, is greater on the Google PlayStore (42.9%) than on Apple's AppStore (35.4%). This observation is even more pronounced for gamified apps exclusive to the Google PlayStore, where 66.7% are unapproved despite the assessment in this study as requiring l MD approval.\n\nAdditionally, the naming convention of the categories in both app stores remains unclear. Most apps considered in this study as MDs are in the 'Medical' category (n = 27), but some are also found in the 'Health&Fitness' category (n = 10), and in this latter category, none of which are adequately cleared/approved. While it was expected that a lot of MDs would be found in the 'Medical' category, the high number of MDs in the 'Health&Fitness' category was surprising since fitness apps are generally not considered MDs  31, 33, 60, 64  . A clear categorization could make distinguishing between MD and non-MD apps easier for users and HCPs.\n\nFurthermore, apps communicate their MD status and associated risks in various ways. Some explicitly mention their regulatory classification and potential risks in their descriptions or supplementary documentation, such as websites or publications, and some do not at all. This inconsistency makes it difficult for users and HCPs to assess an app's regulatory status and associated risk.\n\nA balanced approach is necessary for app stores to address those challenges. Although regulatory bodies have the responsibility of approving new MDs, their limited resources make it difficult to provide complete oversight of all newly published applications. Here, the role of the app stores as market entry points becomes critical. Since they already have expertise in the automated screening and analysis of applications, they could assure regulatory approval or certification for apps with a medical purpose and implement basic checks to ensure content accuracy  34  . The aim of that is to make it impossible to download clearly unsafe and illegal products from the app stores."

      "title": "Assessment of the US approval status",
      "text": "Comparing the EU market with the US, we found a higher proportion of MD apps in the US. Nonetheless, due to the FDA's enforcement discretion rules, fewer apps were marketed without the required approval in the US compared to the EU. This goes hand-in-hand with our finding that most assessed apps would fall into Class I and, therefore, be under enforcement discretion. The observation of a more flexible US regulatory classification approach for low-risk apps is consistent with the findings of other studies  53  . We observed that the FDA product classification database  65  provided greater transparency around regulatory decisions and evidence than the EU counterpart database, which is only partially operational and will provide less transparency on completion  66  .\n\nThis poses two main implications for the EU. Firstly, the US system enables low-risk Class I digital apps to reach the market more rapidly, potentially spurring faster innovation  53  . Secondly, the easy access to information on regulatory decisions and evidence from the FDA databases provides openness on app classification decisions and associated evidence, which is lacking in the EU and is not planned for in the EU regulatory framework  31  . The greater US openness allows all stakeholders, including clinicians and the public, to examine the basis for regulatory approvals."

      "title": "Implications for the regulation of gamified MDs",
      "text": "Our analysis shows that many gamified mHealth apps would be considered as MDs under current regulations. As such, gamified MDs, like non-gamified MDs, must comply with the applicable laws regulating them. While the general compliance of mHealth apps (gamified and non-gamified) was questioned by other researchers  35  , the compliance issues might be caused by different reasons, including unawareness or insufficient guidance documents, although existing regulations provide guidance on certain aspects of SaMD, including audio-visual design  46  , AI  44  and cybersecurity  48, 67  . For gamified apps, this lack of compliance could be caused by a notable gap of guidance documents addressing the intricate relationship between gamification elements, engagement design, and their impacts on health outcomes. The unique characteristics of such apps should be considered in the current regulatory approval process along with other aspects of the app's safety and performance within the assessment, validation, and regulatory frameworks. A tailored framework, guidance, or standard should delineate the specific risk categories associated with gamification and outline the required steps for design and human factors evaluation, as well as for clinical evaluation, considering the prolonged and dynamic user activity characteristics of gamified apps. Such a framework should complement existing regulatory legislation, but not replace them. They are intended to provide guidance on how these products are manufactured and how their risks can be assessed within the framework of the applicable laws. Similar guidance documents exist for other risk aspects of MDs, e.g. cybersecurity  48, 67  or AI  47  . These horizontal features are present in many MDs and create additional risks, while the corresponding guidance documents help to assess and mitigate them. Our paper is a Vol:.( 1234567890 ) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:21016 |  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-71808-2\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/ step towards how this can also be done for gamification. The increasing number of gamified health apps and the ambiguities around current regulations presented in this study underline the necessity for specific guidelines. Additionally, there is a need for a more transparent and accessible system to build trust in the EU medical device landscape, as has been recognized for implantable medical devices in the past  68  . This particularly applies to gamified mHealth apps, of which, in the judgment of the expert panel in this study, a surprisingly high proportion are on the market without the required approvals."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This analysis has several limitations. The inclusion criteria limit assessed apps to the most populous EU countries, and this potentially limits the generalizability of results to all EU member states. Additionally, due to feasibility reasons, we had to limit our search of the app stores to the categories 'Medical' and 'Health&Fitness' . Thus, we might have missed a small number of apps that have been misclassified by the app stores or developers. Assessment panel members had free choice of whether to download, install, and explore the functionality of the mHealth app or to assess the app based on the developer-provided descriptions, images, and videos (on the app stores, developer websites, and research publications). A minority of apps were downloaded. This is, however, compatible with the assessment of apps based on the developer-stated claims as they relate to the developerstated functionality, which is also the core approach of the regulatory approval process. Only mobile apps were included in this study.\n\nThe definition of gamification and of gamification elements is still an area of discussion among researchers; an agreed consensus definition does not yet exist, and multiple researchers propose different lists of gamification elements  4, 22, 69, 70  . We used the definition proposed by Sailer et al. (2017)  4  , which is widely recognized. However, competing definitions also exist  9, 11, 13  , which could limit our findings.\n\nThe identification of evidence on existing apps could be limited as developers of apps, whether MD or non-MD, are not obliged to put evidence in the public domain. As the EU EUDAMED database is still under development, there is no single source to definitively search a list of approved MDs and their risk class. A detailed search of the app store descriptions, the developer's websites, research publications, and a general internet search was conducted. The qualification of apps as MDs in the EU is largely based on the manufacturer's reported intended purpose. It was not always possible for the assessment panel to base their decisions on a stated intended purpose since not all apps clearly stated this. In these cases, the panel's judgment was based on all available information on claims and functionality.\n\nThe analysis of specific risks of gamification was only conducted for a subset of eight apps, which had to be available in German and English, free of charge, available in the Google PlayStore, and accessible without a doctor's prescription. Additionally, the degree of gamification was judged on a self-developed arbitrary scale. Thus, findings about the intersection of risks and gamification could be limited by the arbitrary character of this scale."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "In the emerging field of gamified health apps, few commercial products meet the strict standards of medical device regulations, in particular, the EU's MDR. Potentially unsafe and illegal products should not be available in the app stores, and the stores themselves and regulators should take action to remove them from the market in accordance with the applicable laws regulating MDs. Therefore, app stores must implement and enforce appropriate review procedures so that healthcare professionals and consumers can have confidence in the safety and efficacy of the apps they download. While the level of compliance for such apps is inadequate, the specific level of risk for most apps remains uncertain. In many cases, we found that there is only a weak link between the gamification elements and the potential risks of the apps. However, for the apps identified that have a high degree of gamification, the link between risks and gamification elements was stronger. This ambiguity highlights the need for further research to better understand and address the unique challenges that gamified health apps present in regulatory and safety contexts."

Fourth, the remaining apps were considered by a panel of regulatory experts who assessed their regulatory compliance. Each assessment was carried out using defined evaluation criteria. To assess whether the hypothesized lack of compliance, if confirmed, means risks for patients that might be related to gamification, an in-depth analysis of the association between gamification and risks of a subset of apps following an approach defined in ISO 14,971 was conducted. Additionally, a qualitative comparison of regulatory compliance in the US was conducted for those apps on the US market.\n\nThe statistical analysis was conducted using Python version 3.11.6 and the following libraries: pandas, NumPy, and statsmodels.

Here, a MD is defined as \"any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for one or more of the following specific medical purposes: diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease; diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability; investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state; providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body, including organ, blood and tissue donations, and which does not achieve its principal intended action by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, in or on the human body, but which may be assisted in its function by such means  31  \". The risk classification was based on 'Rule 11' of the MDR, which states that \"Software intended to provide information which is used to take decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes is classified as class IIa, except if such decisions have an impact that may cause: death or an irreversible deterioration of a person's state of health, in which case it is in class III; or a serious deterioration of a person's state of health or a surgical intervention, in which case it is classified as class IIb. Software intended to monitor physiological processes is classified as class IIa, except if it is intended for monitoring of vital physiological parameters, where the nature of variations of those parameters is such that it could result in immediate danger to the patient, in which case it is classified as class IIb.

An application could either be assessed as \"Non-MD\" if it does not qualify as a MD in the eyes of the expert, or it could fall in one of the four risk classes defined by the regulatory legislation, \"MD Class I, \" \"MD Class IIa, \" \"MD Class IIb, \" or \"MD Class III. \" Criteria used by the panel for the risk classification are provided in Table  4 , and example apps for each risk class are shown in Supplemental Material 1.\n\nEvery reviewer had to: (i) report the classification into which the app is likely to fall, with an assignment of the \"most-likely\" classification and any number of less likely but also possible classifications; (ii) report their degree of confidence in their \"most-likely\" classification assignment, on a scale from 1 (low confidence) to 5 (high confidence); and (iii) if an app had already regulatory clearance/approval, decide whether the app could be considered as adequately cleared/approved (particularly important as lower risk classes are self-declared by developers ). The judgment was based on the intended purpose, as presented by the developer. Assessors were instructed to comment on any deviation between the developer's stated intended purpose and actual delivered app functionality that would lead to a different risk class.\n\nAfter the evaluation, the results were combined and analyzed. A vote of at least 3 out of 4 reviewers was defined as a definite vote. Compliance was then assessed as 'regulatory compliant' if the rules applicable to the individual app were followed or as 'regulatory non-compliant' in the event of deviations from the applicable regulations. Apps that did not qualify as MDs, in the opinion of the experts, were always assessed as 'regulatory compliant' , as they are not subject to any special rules within the meaning of the MDR. Table  4 . Risk classification framework. This framework was based on the rules provided in the MDR  31  and on additional guideline documents  33, 64, 79  . All panelists had access to this framework and applied it in their assessment."

      "title": "Gamification analysis",
      "text": "To assess the specific risks of the apps associated with their gamified aspects, an in-depth analysis of a subset of eight apps was carried out independently by two reviewers, one professor for regulatory science and consultant for regulatory affairs (author S.G.), and one physician and game developer (author O.F.). Only apps with a majority panel decision of MD status (3 out of 4 votes) were included. Selected apps had to be available in Germany and English, free of charge, available in the Google PlayStore, and accessible without a doctor's prescription. Apps with similar functionalities by the same developer were excluded. Each app was downloaded and tested for at least 10 min. The number of gamification elements, following the adopted definition  4  , was stated, and the primary purpose of each app was assessed. Both reviewers had to report their personal game feel on an arbitrary scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). The scale was developed by three gamification experts (O.F., K.J.F., M.H.) to determine the degree of gamification. Both assessors had to answer the question \"How close is the experience, interaction and appearance of this app to a full-fledged game?\" on a scale from 1 (infrequent or minimal nonimmersive gamefeel through gamification elements), 2 (occasional or moderate non-immersive gamefeel through gamification elements), 3 (occasional immersive aspects of gamefeel, but separated by user experience with no or minimal game feel), 4 (frequent immersive aspects of game experience throughout), and 5 (Fully immersive game experience throughout, the app experience feeling fully like a game). The rationale behind using this selfdeveloped scale was that existing scales make the degree of gamification dependent on the number of elements used  70  , leaving out the perceptual level  80, 81  . However, since the number of elements does not necessarily correlate with the quality of gamification or the game feel  25  , we had to resort to a self-developed scale.\n\nThe specific medical risks that emerge from or are connected with the implemented gamification elements were assessed according to medical device risk assessment principles in the applicable compulsory standard ISO 14971 50 . Firstly, hazards (a potential source of harm), the foreseeable sequence of events (sequence of events or circumstances that lead to a hazardous situation), the hazardous situation (circumstance in which people are exposed to a hazard), and the harm (injury or damage to the health of people) to the user were defined. The severity of harm, which is dependent on the intended use of the app, was then rated from 1 (Negligible-Inconvenience or temporary discomfort), 2 (Minor-Temporary injury or physical and mental impairment requiring simple or no professional medical intervention), 3 (Moderate-Temporary injury or physical or mental impairment requiring professional medical intervention (excluding surgical intervention)), 4 (Severe-Permanent physical or mental impairment or life-threatening injury requiring surgical intervention) to 5 (Catastrophic-User death as a direct result of hazard). The strength of the association of gamification elements with risks was reported on a scale from none (Gamification elements are not responsible for any part of the reported risk), weak (Gamification elements are minimally responsible for the reported risk, contributing insignificantly, with other aspects of the app being more responsible), moderate (Gamification elements are moderately responsible for the reported risk, contributing to an increase in risk likelihood or severity, with other aspects of the app being similarly responsible), to strong (Gamification is a major factor in the reported risk, significantly increasing its likelihood or severity, with other aspects of the app being minimally responsible)."

      "title": "US assessment",
      "text": "One senior expert for US regulation performed the comparative US market analysis. All apps that were not available in the US app store were excluded. The definitions followed FDA guidelines  51, 65, 82  and the FFDCA 32 . In the first step, an app was defined as an MD based on whether the product acts on a disease or disordered state and references the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or disease prevention based on the app's claim and intended use. In the second step, the specific risk class a MD would likely fall under (Class I, Class II, Class III) was based on the expert's knowledge. Apps that have claims closer to mitigation (e.g., managing symptoms of MD) or if the product acts on a symptom rather than the disease itself (e.g., managing feelings of anxiety, where anxiety is not a disease), the device was considered as Class I. The device was considered Class II if the claims were specific to diagnosis, cure, or treatment. Since there are currently no software-only digital products in the US in Class III, such a classification was considered unlikely. In the third step, the most probable regulatory pathway was defined. Class I MDs mainly belong under the self-declared enforcement discretion status when they pose a low risk without needing evaluation or evidence  51  or could belong in the self-declared 510(k) exempt status  52  . Class II MDs could also belong to the 510(k) exempt status, follow the 510(k) pathway if a predicate is available, or follow the De Novo pathway if no such predicate is available  82  ."
