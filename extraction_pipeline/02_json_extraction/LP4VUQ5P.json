  "title": "Variations in Symptom Prevalence and Clinical Correlates in Younger Versus Older Youth with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
  "abstract": "Few studies have examined the phenomenology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in younger children. A sample of 292 treatment seeking youth with a primary diagnosis of OCD was divided into the young child (3-9 years old) and older child (10-18 years old) groups. Overall OCD severity did not differ between groups. However, older youth demonstrated stronger intensity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms, while younger children were rated as having less resistance and control of compulsions. Older youth exhibited increased occurrence of comorbid depression, and an increased occurrence of sexual, magical thinking, and somatic obsessions, as well as, checking, counting and magical thinking compulsions. Conversely, the group of younger children exhibited significantly poorer insight, increased incidence of hoarding compulsions, higher rates of comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior, and parent-rated anxiety, and more frequently exhibited hoarding compulsions. These differences suggest domains to consider when screening for OCD among younger/older pediatric cohorts.",

      "text": "Characterized by excessive, anxiety-inducing intrusive thoughts (i.e., obsessions) and ritualistic, distress reducing behaviors (i.e., compulsions)  [1] , obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of over 1-2 % in the general population  [2] . In children, clinical levels of obsessions and compulsions contribute to a significant functional impairment in school, with friends, and with family, as well as diminished quality of life  [3] [4] [5] .\n\nInitially, the clinical picture of pediatric OCD, like many other psychiatric disorders that occur across the lifespan (e.g., depression), was developed as a downward extension of adult presentation. Although the presentation of OCD in childhood is generally similar to adulthood, there are a number of unique developmental and familial characteristics of pediatric OCD that were not evident until study of OCD in youth became more commonplace. For example, comparison of youth versus adults with OCD have identified a number of differences including gender prevalence (i.e., pediatric OCD is more common among males as compared to among females in adults)  [6, 7] , comorbid disorders [e.g., attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is more common among youth]  [6, 8, 9] , level of insight (i.e. typically worse among youth than adults)  [6, 8]  as well as symptom prevalence and presentation (e.g., youth more frequently endorse aggressive obsessions than adults)  [10] [11] [12] .\n\nWhile most studies have examined phenomenological differences between adult and pediatric OCD, developmental differences within youth are also considerable. It follows that, similar to differences in adults versus youth, presentation of OCD may differ between younger and older youth. Investigation of other psychiatric illnesses have suggested that a child's age is an important factor in determining the clinical presentation, with symptomatic differences across ages of youths noted within ADHD (e.g., hyperactivity more common among younger children)  [13]  and depression (e.g., greater somatic complaints and agitation among younger children compared to higher rates of anhedonia, hopelessness, and suicide among older youth)  [14, 15] .\n\nTo date, only four studies  [11, [16] [17] [18]  (see Table  1 ) have investigated differences in OCD phenomenology across youth of different ages, resulting in mixed results. In general, it appears that youth present with comparable levels of overall severity  [11, [16] [17] [18] . Regarding symptom profile, a number of significant differences have been observed, though none have been consistently identified. For obsessions, some studies have found that older youth present with higher levels of contamination obsessions  [16]  and religious and sexual obsessions  [11]  as compared to younger children; however, other studies have found no differences among frequency of obsessions  [17, 18] . Although studies have found washing and checking rituals  [16] , as well as ordering and repeating compulsions  [18]  to occur more frequently in older youth than younger youth, others did not replicate these results  [11, 17] . Geller et al.  [11]  found young children were more likely to present with poor insight than older youth, a finding also noted in a study of insight  [19] , though this result was not replicated by Farrell et al.  [16] .\n\nSimilarly, there is cross-study variation in reports of gender and comorbidity. For example, most studies suggest that OCD has a male preponderance in youth  [11, 17, 18] . However, one study found a shift to female preponderance in adolescence  [16] . Comorbidity patterns appear consistent with patterns of onset for psychopathology, with younger children appearing more likely to present with comorbid separation anxiety disorder  [11] , specific phobia  [16] , tics  [11, 18] , and oppositional defiant disorder  [16] , while older youth more likely to be diagnosed with comorbid major depressive disorder  [11] .\n\nDifferences in findings across studies may be due to a number of study specific methodological variations complicating cross-study comparisons. For example, three studies featured relatively small samples of children and adolescents (see Table  1 ) and therefore may have been underpowered for a number of comparisons. The age at which groups were divided ranged between 10 and 13 across studies and, while most studies based groups upon the children's age at the time of assessment, Nakatani et al.  [18]  separated groups based upon retrospective report of age-of-OCD-onset. These methodological differences (and in some cases small sample sizes; e.g., Mancebo et al.  [17] ) across studies may partially explain variation in outcomes. Thus, further study of this population within a large sample, appropriately powered to detect small effects, is warranted to better understand the potential differences in OCD presentation and clinical characteristics between these two groups.\n\nConsequently we investigated phenomenological differences between older versus younger children with OCD (N = 292). This study examines possible differences in overall severity, endorsement of symptom types, frequency of comorbid conditions, medication usage and differences in insight and control in younger (9 years or younger) and older (10 years and above) youth. We selected these age ranges given that research suggests that for OCD, differences in clinical profile begin to emerge at 10 years old  [18, 20] . However, age was also explored as a continuous predictor of obsessive-compulsive severity and symptom endorsement. We predicted that younger age would be associated with a higher male predominance, increased instance of ODD, and anxiety, as well as lower clinician rated insight. We also predicted that older age would be associated with a higher predominance of major depressive disorder."

The sample was divided into the younger youth (n = 99; M = 7.46; SD = 1.42; range 3-9) and older youth (n = 193; M = 12.83 SD = 2.14; range 10-18) groups. All participants in the present study had a primary diagnosis of OCD determined by senior clinician diagnosis and confirmed by diagnostic interview; medication was not exclusionary. Comorbid disorders were common, with 74.8 % (n = 223) meeting criteria for at least one, and 33.6 % (n = 100) meeting criteria for two or more.

An obsessions (items 1-5), compulsions (items 6-10) and total severity (items 1-10) score is yielded. In addition, obsessions and compulsions severity scores were subdivided to examine intensity of obsessions (items 1-3) and compulsions (items 6-8), as well as the amount of resistance and control over obsessions (items 4-5) and compulsions (items 9-10)  [26] . For purposes of data analysis on the CYBOCS symptom checklist, participants were considered to have a specific symptom area if at least one item on the CYBOCS checklist within that area was identified. Insight was also assessed using the CYBOCS (item 11). The CYBOCS has demonstrated excellent reliability and validity  [27] [28] [29]  and is considered the goldstandard in pediatric OCD assessment  [30] .

For 18 year old participants, direct consent was provided, while parents provided consent to complete their portion of the assessment. Diagnostic decisions for a primary diagnosis of OCD, as well as of comorbid disorders, were made by a consensus panel of two licensed clinical psychologists using best estimate procedures  [23, 44] , which involved integrating impressions from structured clinical interviews by experienced masters/doctoral level clinician (ADIS, CYBOCS) and unstructured clinical intake evaluations by an experienced psychologist or psychiatrist  [23] . While demographic information, as well as CYBOCS and CGI-S scores were collected across all studies, other clinical measures, namely the family accommodation items, MASC-P and CSDS were not consistently assessed across all studies as each study had a unique clinical focus.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In the present study, we examined differences in symptom severity and presentation, as well as clinical correlates between younger and older youth with OCD. Methodological variability in extant studies has limited the clarity of conclusions  [11, [16] [17] [18] . Using a large, sufficiently-powered sample of youth, our study attempted to replicate prior results and better solidify an understanding of how these two groups differ.\n\nIn general, the present study provides further support for a distinction between the presentation of OCD in younger versus older youth. Consistent with previous observations, youth did not differ in the overall severity of their obsessive compulsive symptoms. Examination of symptoms in more detail did reveal that older youth experience more intense symptoms, but were better able to control or resist compulsive behaviors. In addition, younger children were observed to have significantly less insight into symptoms. Regarding obsessions, the present study confirmed increased frequency of sexual obsessions in older youth identified by Geller et al.  [11] , but did not replicate findings of differences in religious  [11] , contamination  [16] , or aggressive obsessions  [17] . In addition, the present sample did note higher levels of somatic and magical thinking obsessions in older youth. For compulsions, the present study similarly identified a higher presence of checking compulsions in older youth to Farrell et al.  [16] ; however, no other consistent differences (i.e. washing, ordering, and repeating compulsions) were observed. Again, the present study identified three new differences, noting older youth endorsed more counting and magical thinking compulsions while younger youth were more likely to endorse hoarding compulsions. Depressive disorders were significantly more common among older youth (also identified by Geller et al.  [11] ), while oppositional behavior was more common among younger youth (also observed by Farrell et al.  [16] ). While no differences were identified in the presence of any anxiety disorder, results of the MASC-P suggest that younger youth were more likely to present with significant separation anxiety and social fears than older youth. Not previously identified, ADHD was also significantly more common amongst younger youth in the present sample. Consistent with overall obsessive compulsive severity, family accommodation and overall level of impairment were not found to be significantly different between age groups.\n\nMany of the differences observed between youth can likely be explained by the natural course of development. For example, patterns of comorbidity observed are also consistent with typical ages of onset for those disorders in non-OCD samples. Specifically, separation anxiety and ADHD onset in early childhood and tend to decrease in prevalence over developmental course  [45] , while depressive disorders more commonly emerge in early adolescence  [45, 46] . In general, collecting behaviors are common and developmentally appropriate in young children  [47] [48] [49] . While age-appropriate collecting is conceptually different from hoarding  [50] , this may explain a higher frequency of reported hoarding compulsions in younger youth. This seems particularly likely, given the lack of difference in reported hoarding-related obsessions between groups. In addition, differences observed in the present study may be partially explained by developmental changes associated with puberty. For example, evidence indicates that increases in gonadal and adrenal hormones in males, as well as early onset of puberty in females, are associated with increased anxiety in adolescence  [51] .\n\nSimilarly, differences in level of insight can likely be explained by increased cognitive development in older youth rather than by differences in the nature of OCD between groups. This difference may also then contribute to those observed in regards to severity of obsessions, as well as lack of resistance and control of compulsions in younger youth. Older youth who have better insight, may be more cognizant of obsessional thoughts and therefore more able/likely to report them and/or feel more disturbed by them. It is also possible, considering the present study did not control for age of onset, that increased severity in older youth may be related to a longer duration of illness, which has previously been identified as a predictor of increased severity  [20] .\n\nWhile many previous observations regarding differences amongst youth were replicated, the findings of the present study, particularly in regards to symptom profile, were not entirely consistent with previous research in the area. As discussed earlier, methodological variations, such as the nature of the age cut off, may have resulted in a different composition of groups and therefore identified varying differences. A number of sample specific confounds may also have contributed to difference, such as varying locations/ cultures, assessors (i.e. different interpretation of symptoms/ severity), and recruitment. Finally, considering the number of comparisons made within the present study and past studies, it is possible that some observed significant differences were due to chance. These explanations appear particularly likely given that the reported prevalence of specific symptom domains across studies has been highly variable. This suggests the need for further research in the area, particularly the use of meta-analytic techniques which could synthesize prevalence rates across studies, in order to determine which differences are best explained by age rather than extraneous variables or chance.\n\nA number of limitations of the present study should be noted. First, the present study did not collect age of OCD onset, prior treatment history, or information on puberty or cognitive development. As a result, some of the differences observed between groups may be better explained by these specific factors rather than general age differences. Second, due to the varying nature and purpose of the studies included in the data, clinical data was not perfectly consistent across studies. As a result, group composition varied across the additional analyses in the present study. In addition, as a result, inter-rater reliability could not be calculated for diagnostic assessments. Third, the present study utilized a convenience sample of individuals seeking behavioral treatment for OCD.\n\nAs a result, participants may have had unique characteristics (e.g., less amenable to medication, refractory to previous treatment) that may not be representative of all youth with OCD. Fourth, while the present study is better powered than previous examinations, age comparisons were based on a cross-sectional sample of youth rather than on a longitudinal comparison. As a result, variability due to factors other than differences in age, may be present.\n\nFurther study is needed to further clarify differences between youth. While evidence is beginning to establish the presence of differences, the lack of consistency between current studies indicates further research is needed to replicate these differences. Simultaneously, additional variables should be investigated as potential moderators of age differences. While Nakatani et al.  [18]  did not find a relationship between treatment outcome and age of onset, no studies using a time of treatment age cut off have examined this. To provide a better continuous picture of age differences in youth, further longitudinal study of OCD in youth should be considered. This may be particularly helpful in clarifying which factors are related to age of onset, duration of symptoms, age regardless of onset, and other potential variables."

      "text": "The present study provides further evidence for differences in the clinical presentation of youth with OCD. While results indicated that groups did not differ in regards to overall OCD severity, older youth were rated as having increased intensity of both obsessive and compulsive symptoms, as well as more resistance and control over their compulsions. In addition, some significant differences in OCD presentation were observed. In particular, older youth endorsed more sexual, magical thinking, and somatic obsessions, as well as, checking, counting and magical thinking compulsions, while younger children endorsed more hoarding compulsions. Occurrence of comorbid disorders also differed between groups, with depression more common among older children and ADHD, disruptive behavior, as well as parent-rated anxiety more common among younger children. No differences were found between groups in regards to the extent of family accommodation or the level of impairment. In sum, the results suggest that youth with OCD may present with different clinical profiles depending on their age at the time of evaluation."
