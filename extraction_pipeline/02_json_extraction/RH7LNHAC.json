  "title": "Analysis of the Regulatory, Legal, and Medical Conditions for the Prescription of Mobile Health Applications in the United States, The European Union, and France",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Mobile health (mHealth) is now considered an important approach to extend traditional health services and to meet the growing medical needs. The prescribability of mHealth applications is a complex problem because it depends on a large number of factors and concerns a wide range of disciplines and actors in the industrial, health, normative, and regulatory domains. Objective: Our study correlated data from the scientific literature with data on regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union, and France with the aim of identifying the conditions for the prescription of mHealth applications. Methods: The search method adopted was the systematic literature review process by Brereton et al. All empirical evidence from the relevant fields of study was gathered and then evaluated to answer our predefined research questions. The WoS and PubMed databases were queried for the period between 1 January 1975 and 30 November 2020. A total of 165 articles (15 with a direct focus and 150 with an indirect focus on mHealth prescribing) were analyzed/cross-referenced. The ScienceDirect database was consulted to complement the collected data when needed. Data published by international and national regulatory bodies were analyzed in light of the scientific data obtained from the WoS, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases. Results: The International Medical Device Regulators Forum has ensured the international structuring of the regulatory field in collaboration with participating countries. The creation and updating of databases have allowed the tracking of medical device versions/upgrades and incidents. The regulatory organizations of the United States, the European Union, and France are currently consulting healthcare personnel, manufacturers, and patients to establish evaluation criteria for usability and quality of instructions for use that take into consideration patients' level of literacy. These organizations are also providing support to manufacturers who wish to file marketing applications. Marketing, privacy, and cybersecurity measures are evolving with developments in technology and state cooperation policies. The prescription of mHealth applications will gain social acceptance only if consistency and coordination are ensured at all stages of the process: from predesign, through verification of medical effectiveness, to ethical consideration during data collection and use, and on to marketing. \n Conclusion: The conditions for mHealth prescribability include the adaptation of international regulation by the different states, the state provision of marketing support, and the evaluation of mHealth applications. For mHealth to gain social acceptance, increased collaboration among physicians, manufacturers, and \"information technology stakeholders\" is needed. Once this is achieved, MHealth can become the cornerstone of successful health care reform.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Mobile health (mHealth) is the use of applications and/or mobile connected devices for the purpose of supporting medical and public health practices.  1, 2 Mobile health applications consist of two types. The first is software as a medical device (SaMD), which performs medical functions through software installation on generic devices such as tablets or smartphones. The second is software in a medical device (SiMD), which requires both hardware and software components to operate -for instance, an mHealth application that interfaces and interacts with a material medical device (MD).  3 Insofar as they are qualified as MDs, both SaMDs and SiMDs must comply with the regulatory frameworks established by national and international authorities for marketing, quality, safety of use, usability, and data security. Material MDs, and their embedded SiMDs if any, have long been required to undergo certification by national and international regulatory systems. By contrast, the requirement for certification of SaMDs, particularly mHealth applications, was implemented only recently.\n\nMobile health can play a positive role in various domains that affect the health status of individuals (wellbeing, prevention, care, monitoring or surveillance of diagnosed diseases, etc.) while also benefiting the health care system as a whole.  4 It is now considered an important approach to extend traditional health services and a means to meet the growing medical needs.\n\nIn their review of the literature, Gagnon et al  5  identified several factors that might contribute to the adoption of mHealth: perceived usefulness and ease of use, design and technical concerns, cost, time, privacy and safety issues, familiarity with the technology, risk-benefit assessment, and interaction with others (colleagues, patients, and management). Several studies  [6] [7] [8] [9]  have noted that physicians can play a major role in mHealth adoption by recommending mHealth applications to their patients. Yet, despite the recent publication of policy recommendations promoting the use of mHealth applications in routine clinical practice, these technologies are rarely recommended and even less prescribed by physicians.  10 he prescribability of mHealth applications is a complex problem because it depends on a large number of factors and concerns a wide range of disciplines and actors in the industrial, health, normative, and regulatory domains. Moreover, patient acceptance of these technologies is not self-evident. Patients must be assured that their data will be protected and must be provided information via explanatory notices on how to use these applications.  11 ndeed, while the prescription of drugs is a wellknown practice in the medical field, the prescription of software is not. For mHealth prescription to gain social acceptance, prescribers and patients must be protected through regulating this novel practice and requiring the certification of mHealth applications. In this regard, J. Forsstrom  12  highlighted as early as 1997 the urgency of implementing the certification of medical software to ensure their widespread adoption in clinical practice. In addition, the performance outcomes of mHealth applications must be evaluated in clinical trials, such that prescribers' actions are supported by evidence and possibly covered by insurance.  11 There is indeed a striking gap between the large number of mHealth applications available in app stores and the small number of applications evaluated by researchers and other actors.  13 n 2015, the Institute for Healthcare Informatics (IMS)  8  published a report proposing a series of actions to build a maturity model for the prescription of mHealth applications. The IMS noted that the prescription process had to be designed by all actors via the creation of technological standards and controls related to security and privacy. It also highlighted that mHealth applications had to be clinically evaluated prior to their medical use and integration into health information systems (HIS). The majority of IMS proposals have since been cited by researchers interested in the use of mHealth in clinical research. [14] [15] [16] [17]  In their study examining the possibility of prescribing mHealth applications in oncology, Berkowitz  17  et al recalled the importance of obtaining marketing authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). F x BI  18  argued that the prescription of certain types of mHealth applications could contribute to reducing hospital readmissions provided that the following conditions were met: provision of support to patients in their use of these applications; prioritization of applications adapted to patients' literacy level; verification of effective use; and allowance of dedicated nursing time. In their literature review of mHealth prescribing for the period 2005-2015, Daifi et al  19  proposed the development of stores with applications evaluated based on clinical data and approved for medical use by the FDA. Byambasuren et al  20, 21  identified the following two barriers to prescription of mHealth applications by general practitioners: lack of knowledge about effective applications and lack of reliable sources (eg app stores) to access them. They also observed that it is often impossible to affirm the effectiveness of mHealth applications based on the available literature, and highlighted the lack of robustness of existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs).\n\nThe 2017 report of the IQVIA (formerly IMS) 22 assessed the degree of maturity of the four criteria listed in the 2015 IMS report  8  to help promote the prescription of mHealth applications -ie patient usability; accuracy, effectiveness, and safety; data privacy and security assurance; mitigation of malpractice risk -and added two important criteria -ie acceptable financial incentives; acceptable clinical workflow and usability. All or part of these criteria have been included in several projects aimed at the creation of platforms that are interoperable with HIS, that integrate app stores based on IQVIA recommendations, and that provide decision support tools for the prescription of mHealth applications.  9, 23, 24 his background knowledge about mHealth usage indicates that the prescription of mHealth applications depends on the interaction between the regulatory, legal, and medical domains. Accordingly, our study correlated data from the scientific literature with data on regulatory developments in the US, the EU, and France with the aim of identifying the conditions for the prescription of mHealth applications.\n\nIn this paper, we begin by providing an overview of the international organizations responsible for the regulation and standardization of MDs and, in particular, of mHealth applications. Second, we describe the common regulatory framework developed by different international organizations and national bodies to ensure the global circulation of MDs. Third, we trace the implementation of international regulations in the US, the EU, and France. Fourth and last, we discuss the improvements that are still needed to reach the objective of widespread mHealth adoption taking into consideration the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in mHealth applications."

      "text": "The present study on mHealth prescribing is based on the collection of data from several disciplines: medicine, public health policy, and regulatory and normative policy. The consultation of different multidisciplinary databases required knowledge of their organization and a command of the specific mHealth vocabulary used in each.\n\nAs the growing number of empirical studies increases knowledge in the area of mHealth, systematic reviews are needed to evaluate their findings and to provide a balanced and objective summary of the evidence they provide. To achieve this purpose, we adopted the systematic literature review process proposed by Brereton et al,  25  which is commonly used in software engineering. This method was the most appropriate for our purposes as it can be applied to a wide range of domains, including clinical research.\n\nFollowing Brereton et al, all empirical evidence from a specific field of study must be gathered and then evaluated to answer one or several predefined research questions. The systematic literature review process consists of three major steps that can be adapted to achieve an evidence-based paradigm/model. In our study, these three steps were as follows: article search, article selection, and data correlation. The article search consisted in translating our research problem into a series of answerable questions and in searching for the best evidence with which to answer these questions. The article selection process consisted in choosing the documents most likely to answer all or part of the questions. The data correlation process consisted in analyzing data published by international and national regulatory bodies in light of scientific data obtained from the WoS, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases."

      "text": "We translated the need for information into the following four questions and searched for the best evidence with which to answer them. Question 1: What is an mHealth application?\n\nOne of the first publications to use the term \"mHealth application\" dates from 2004,  26  which is also the year when the word \"mHealth\" first appeared in the literature.  27 umerous other descriptors were employed to describe these new MDs until the term \"mHealth application\" was integrated in the MeSHas unique ID : D063731 in 2014. . These different descriptors were included in our query. Question 2: What regulations have international organizations established regarding mHealth?\n\nWe collected information on the membership and missions of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF). The organizational chart and mode of functioning of these organizations were examined to determine which documents contained the information we needed. Policy papers, reports on the definition or clinical evaluation of mHealth, and procedures for marketing mHealth applications were included in the analysis. Session proceedings were excluded.\n\nQuestion 3: How are the regulations of international organizations implemented by their Member States, more specifically the US, the EU, and France?\n\nWe identified the health agencies responsible for implementing international regulations in the US, the EU, and France. These were, respectively, the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the French National Authority for Health (HAS, Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9). We collected the following data from these agencies' websites: reports, recommendations, and guidelines for filing marketing authorization applications. Conventions signed between the US, the EU, and France were also collected. Question 4: How do scientific advances contribute to the evolution of regulations and how are scientific developments impacted by regulations? What synergy exists between the regulatory and scientific domains?\n\nTwo multidisciplinary databases, WoS and PubMed, were searched to gather scientific evidence using the same query. One advantage of the WoS database is that it covers not only the field of medicine, but also those of manufacturing, computer technologies, and security and technical standards. This allowed us to explore a wide range of literature addressing technical and normative issues beyond the medical domain. Another advantage is that Wos publications can be filtered according to their content by using the \"ANALYZE\" command on the bibliographic record's heading. We used the \"medical informatics\" heading in our analysis."

The titles and abstracts of the 4544 references were automatically analyzed using an SQL procedure: Only the references containing the concepts \"mHealth\" and \"prescription\" or \"recommendation\" in the same sentence were retained, for a total of 1143 references. After reading the abstracts and keywords of these 1143 references, we excluded those focusing on applications dedicated to wellbeing, administrative functions (eg appointment scheduling) or general health information, as well as technical articles that described mHealth without studying its impact on diseases. A total of 552 references were retained. After reading the full text of these 552 references, we selected 15 articles that dealt explicitly with the prescription of mHealth and 150 articles that dealt indirectly with prescribability in the context of clinical practice or research (eg RCTs evaluating mHealth applications, studies describing mHealth quality criteria such as MARS or UMARS or addressing usability, ethical issues, security, privacy, user perceived value). The article selection process is shown in Figure  1 .\n\nThe 15 articles dealing explicitly with the prescription of mHealth applications are listed in Table  1 .\n\nFor the literature on mHealth regulations, we used a narrative, descriptive approach to examine thematic and geographical aspects of the prescription of mHealth applications."

In the case of MDs, these rules concern circulation and control in the areas of health safety, contribution to care, and health care reimbursement. National and international organizations can agree to grant the right to market products, which implies the creation of labels or markings (eg CE marking, etc.), nomenclatures, and common clinical research programs in the case of MDs. Regulations provide actors in the field (manufacturers, researchers, healthcare personnel, patients, etc.) with a specific framework in line with public policy and public health objectives. Unlike standards, regulations are mandatory.\n\nStandardization is the process of implementing technical standards in manufacturing for the purpose of limiting risks and ensuring safety of use (eg AFNOR in France and ISO at the global level).

Yet, despite existing agreements, differences remained between the two databases that prompted the US and the EU to sign a new agreement in July 2018 for the purpose of aligning their content. In addition, four international bodies were designated by the European Commission and the FDA to supervise the production and allocation of UDI codes.  45 he GUDID and EUDAMED databases allow the traceability of MDs and ensure security through incident reporting in all participating countries."

Currently, the FDA approval process for an MD takes approximately 90 to 180 days, and this timeframe can increase up to two-fold depending on delays or changes to the application file. A new certification process is therefore needed that can keep up with the speed of software innovation.\n\nAs its name indicates, the Pre-Cert program allows for the precertification of a new SaMD based on the certification of the company and the processes it currently uses to manufacture SaMDs. Five \"excellence principles\" must be met for certification to be awarded: patient safety, product quality, clinical responsibility, cybersecurity responsibility, and proactive culture. Once a company is certified, it can manufacture new \"precertified\" SaMDs without having to go through the entire certification process again. It can undergo \"simplified reviews\" or, in some cases, be exempted from the entire review process if the product is low risk.\n\nIn 2007, the FDA and Duke University entered into a public-private partnership called the Clinical Trial Transformation Initiative (CTTI) to promote the use of mHealth applications in clinical research.

Achieving this will require increased collaboration among physicians, MD manufacturers, and \"IT stakeholders\".  [90] [91] ] [92] [93] [94]  Two important medical aspects of mHealth prescribability were not addressed in the 165 included studies: the economic costs and benefits of mHealth innovations and the barriers to the prescription of mHealth applications. We shall now briefly discuss how these aspects have been approached in other studies.\n\nIn view of the steady increase in health care expenditures in all countries, health economics researchers are paying more and more attention to the economic impact of mHealth use. In their 2007 literature review of economic evaluations of mHealth, Iribarren et al  95  identified 39 studies conducted in 19 countries (most of them high-income countries or upper middle-income countries): In 29 of these studies (74.3%), mHealth interventions were found to be costeffective, economically beneficial, and/or cost-saving.\n\nAllenby and al shed light on biopharmaceutical companies' interest in acquiring mHealth start-ups. Indeed, biopharmaceutical companies are looking for opportunities to take advantage of new ways of organizing care based on digital technologies. They are also trying to position themselves as third parties in the care relationship by providing, in addition to classic medication, applications that facilitate patient-doctor interaction and applications that allow for care monitoring either by the patient him/herself or by a healthcare professional.  96 everal barriers to the prescription of mHealth applications have been identified in the rest of the literature. One of the most common is that general practitioners have insufficient time to explain to their patients how to use mHealth applications.  97, 98 To overcome this problem, Rijcken C. recommends that instructions on use be given by pharmacists instead of physicians (as is already the case for drugs).  99 espite all the developments that have occurred since the introduction of connected devices, the prescription and reimbursement of mHealth applications remain rare.\n\nWhat improvements are still needed? Most importantly, there is a need for rigorous evaluation of mHealth applications. The lack of transparency, the instability of emerging technologies, and the gap between the long timeframe of clinical studies and the short timeframe of technological development should be addressed by adopting the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth (CONSORT-EHEALTH).  100  For applications incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), the recent Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence (CONSORT-AI) protocols should be preferred.  101 Application of these standards would allow for comparisons between trials.\n\nThe evaluation of mHealth applications based exclusively on traditional RCTs is a hindrance to the penetration of innovations into the world of healthcare. For this reason, researchers 102 have proposed a hybrid trial methodology that combines simulation studies using data from patient registries (which provide information on patient characteristics and help to identify simulation parameters) with RCTs conducted on a limited number of patients. This approach has proven successful for regulatory decision-making linked to drug effectiveness in some contexts.  103 n addition to evaluations based on clinical data, the EU 104 recommends the inclusion of patient input in regulatory decisions on the use of health technologies. In this regard, EU regulatory bodies have developed several initiatives that range from direct patient involvement in the regulatory decisionmaking process to the use of patient information as evidence in empirical studies.\n\nIn the US and the EU, a regulatory framework is now being built for digital technologies, with a particular focus on the introduction of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in MDs. Muehlematter et al observe that there is currently no clear approval process and no specific regulatory pathway for AI/ML-based MDs in these jurisdictions.  105 Accordingly, they recommend greater transparency regarding approval and regulation procedures with a view to improving public trust as well as the effectiveness, security, and quality of AI/ML-based MDs.\n\nShould mHealth applications not be evaluated differently from classic medication?\n\nIn practice, mHealth applications are evaluated in a manner similar to classic medication. Thus, in a study from 2016, Van Norman 106 found similarities between the processes of approval for drugs and MDs. While this study examined MDs in general, it was especially relevant with regards to mHealth devices.\n\nOne proposal to achieve mHealth prescribability is to create a specific framework for mHealth applications while still considering them as part of MDs, which would entail defining these applications with greater precision than is currently done with MDs. Other proposals are to build databases of applications that are accessible to all (from citizens to health personnel), to adopt a homogeneous UDI system, to provide a more clinically oriented description of applications based on specific medical terminology, to consider evaluations by  https://doi.org/10.2147/MDER.S328996"
