  "title": "Changes in Executive Function Following a Stressful Interpersonal Task Are Associated With Condomless Anal Intercourse Among Men Who Have Sex With Men",
  "abstract": "Background Executive functioning (EF) describes a set of neurocognitive processes critical to enacting complex health behaviors. However, theoretical frameworks for understanding sexual risk behavior have generally neglected neurocognitive constructs, and beyond a few studies of individuals selected for high substance use, the literature contains virtually no research on this topic with other adults at risk for HIV infection, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Purpose This study tested whether EF was associated with condomless anal intercourse (CAI) among MSM. Methods Seventy MSM completed cognitive tests assessing EF at two time points-baseline, and approximately 30 min later after engaging in a stressful interpersonal task. Men also reported their sexual behaviors over the past 3 months, including the frequency of CAI. Results Baseline EF was unrelated to CAI. However, CAI was associated with the degree to which performance improved from baseline to post-stressor administration. Compared with norms for practice effects, men who reported CAI improved less than expected from baseline to post-stressor EF performance, whereas men who reported no CAI exhibited a more normative practice effect. Conclusions MSM with histories of greater sexual risk improved less than anticipated from baseline to poststressor on tests of EF, suggesting that they might be more cognitively depleted by the stressful interpersonal task they engaged in between administrations. It is possible that certain individuals struggle to maintain executive control in stressful interpersonal situations, a finding that could contribute to the difficulty some individuals face executing precautionary behaviors during a sexual encounter.",

      "text": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain the population at highest risk for HIV infection in the USA, comprising 67% of all new infections in 2014  [1] . Consequently, HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing sexual risk behaviors among MSM have been deployed since the beginning of the epidemic, and they remain a cornerstone of the national approach to controlling HIV today  [2] . One common feature of behavioral HIV prevention interventions targeting MSM and other at-risk populations is that they are grounded in health behavior theories that emphasize the importance of cognitive variables in influencing sexual risk behavior (e.g., information, perceived severity and susceptibility, self-efficacy for enacting behavioral skills). However, empirical support for these theories' utility in predicting sexual risk is largely limited to cross-sectional research, and results from stronger designs (e.g., longitudinal or experimental) are much more mixed, suggesting that additional, as yet unidentified, processes operate to drive decisions about sexual behavior  [3] .\n\nDeploying information or behavioral skills toward precautionary behaviors during a sexual encounter is a complex self-regulatory task, requiring recruitment of a number of neurocognitive resources. Prominent among the resources necessary for self-regulation is executive functioning (EF). EF is an umbrella term for a set of neurocognitive processes that allow one to plan, organize, and execute mental and behavioral actions that are adaptive, goal-directed, future-oriented, and socially informed  [4] . Although it is generally agreed that many hierarchically organized and highly discrete cognitive processes fall under this umbrella, there is no clear agreement across various psychological disciplines as to what processes should be included and how they should be organized. For the purpose of this study, we utilize a comprehensive model  [5]  that builds on the tradition of clinical neuropsychology. Based on this model, several larger subdomains of EF can be identified. These include abstract reasoning, initiation and maintenance of adaptive action, selection of adaptive responses, and the ability to prospectively remember what actions need to be taken next  [5] .\n\nAlthough EF is increasingly appreciated as central to enacting health behaviors  [6] , one recent review failed to identify even a single study examining EF and sexual risk among healthy, nonsubstance-using adults  [7] . However, limited evidence from substance-using populations suggests that a link does exist. In one study of substance-using MSM, researchers found that men who performed poorly across several tests of EF reported greater risk behavior than other men in the sample  [8] . Another study of substance users found that more impulsive individuals (assessed with the Go/No-Go task) had a stronger association between frequency of substance use and sexual risk behavior  [9] . Two studies of HIV-infected substance users revealed that individuals with better decision-making performance (assessed with the Iowa Gambling task) had stronger associations of sensation seeking and emotional distress with sexual risk behavior  [10, 11] . This work suggests that EF might be an individual difference contributing to people's varying capacities to engage in safe sexual behavior. However, problems exist in generalizing from research on high substance users to other populations, given the complex, bidirectional manner in which substance use and EF affect one another  [12, 13] . Thus, we propose to study this phenomenon in an adult sample of MSM who were not preselected for any other risk factors.\n\nAlthough EF can be conceptualized as a stable trait, it also fluctuates as a state. Specifically, EF capacity fluctuates in response to acute stressors such as lack of sleep  [14] , pain  [15] , or the need to engage in emotional regulation  [16] . Such fluctuations are sometimes conceptualized as \"depletion\" of EF resources  [17] [18] [19] . Furthermore, individuals also vary in the degree to which their cognitive performance fluctuates  [20] , and such individual differences in fluctuation may be clinically meaningful. In fact, cognitive intraindividual variability is a risk factor for both morbidity and mortality  [21]  and for abnormal cognitive decline  [22] . In other words, people appear to vary in their susceptibility to EF depletion, such that more susceptible individuals have less capacity to sustain and engage EF during activities that are cognitively or interpersonally challenging. In turn, periods of EF depletion could lead to lapses in enacting precautionary measures during a sexual encounter. In fact, in an experimental depletion paradigm, participants in the experimental condition that was designed to deplete EF resources exhibited greater tendency to engage in inappropriate sexual behavior as compared with their nondepleted counterparts  [23] .\n\nThis study aimed to test the hypotheses that condomless anal intercourse (CAI) relates to (a) individual difference in trait EF (assessed at baseline), and (b) individual differences in the \"depletability\" of state EF (assessed after exposure to a stressor). We hypothesized that individuals with poorer baseline levels of EF (i.e., trait EF), as well as those whose EF was more depleted by the stressful task (i.e., state EF depletion), would be most likely to engage in CAI."

To be eligible, participants had to self-identify as gay or lesbian, be between the ages of 18-60 years, and should not be taking medications that were likely to affect the cardiovascular or cognitive function. Participants were recruited through the local gay pride festival and Facebook advertising, resulting in 150 total participants.\n\nOnly gay men (n = 75) were selected for analysis given the focus on sexual risk behavior. Two men were excluded because they reported significant suspicion about the manipulation before debriefing, and two were excluded because they had a standard score below 4 on at least one cognitive test, suggesting either test administration problems or cognitive impairment. This resulted in a final analytic sample of 71. One participant self-reported as being HIV-positive, and he was retained in analyses (sensitivity analyses indicated his inclusion did not change results). The mean age was 26 years (SD = 7.5; range = 18-56). Participants were 87.5% white, consistent with local demographics. Forty-nine percent of the sample reported some college or technical school degree and 36.1% a college degree. The median household income was $45,000-$55,000 (mode = $16,000-$25,000)."

After arriving in the laboratory, participants were oriented to the study and then completed baseline cognitive tests. They next engaged in a stressor task, lasting approximately 30 min, and then completed the same cognitive tests again. For the stressor task, participants were instructed that they would be interviewed by another participant (in reality, a prerecorded confederate) and then evaluated by that participant based on their intelligence, competence, and likeability  [24] . The interview proceeded with the confederate asking a series of four questions over an intercom, each followed by a 45-s period for the participant to answer, and another 45-s period for the confederate to ostensibly score and evaluate the response. All participants engaged in the stressor task; however, half were randomly assigned to believe that the interaction partner held anti-gay attitudes and half to believe their partner held pro-gay attitudes (the confederate recording was identical across conditions). The local Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures.\n\nConsistent with prior research using the task, measures of state anxiety increased significantly from pre-to-post task (M pre = 1.92, SD = 0.5, M post = 2.50, SD = 0.9, p < .001), and increases did not differ by condition (p = .85). Moreover, following the task, participants in both conditions reported that the task had been equally stressful (M anti-gay = 2.55, SD = 0.66, M control = 2.51, SD = 0.83, p = .81). Thus, conditions were collapsed for the current analyses."

Consistent with our prior work  [26] , these four test scores were combined into a single EF composite (i.e., the arithmetical mean of age-corrected scaled scores, based on the D-KEFS norms) that captures many of the processes that fall under the EF umbrella (described in detail elsewhere  [5] ). Additionally, because performance on tests of higher order processes (such as EF) rely on lower order \"component\" processes (such as reading speed or motor and verbal output)  [4] , it is necessary to assess such component processes (CP) to meaningfully interpret the results of EF testing  [4, 27] . We used three tasks from the D-KEFS designed to assess CP: Trail Making (Letter Sequencing completion time) and Color-Word Interference (Color Naming and Word Reading completion time). These tasks' scores were combined into a single CP composite (i.e., the arithmetical mean of age-corrected scaled scores). Cronbach's alphas for EF and CP were 0.57 and 0.61 at baseline, respectively, and 0.60 and 0.68 at post-stress testing, respectively."

Thus, we anticipated that performance on the D-KEFS would improve from first to second administration. The magnitudes of such improvements have been characterized for different age groups in the D-KEFS normative tables. Of note, smaller than normatively expected PE can be associated with cognitive impairment or certain medical conditions  [29] [30] [31] . However, our participants were generally healthy and cognitively normal; thus, the only remaining likely source of attenuated practice is depletion. To capture this depletion, we first computed the observed practice effect  [28]  for each participant (i.e., the difference between baseline and post-stress composite scores) for both EF and CP. We refer to these observed PE as EF-PE and CP-PE. Of note, normative PE from the D-KEFS were computed using test administrations that were separated by several weeks  [25] . Because our test administrations were separated by approximately 30 min, PE in our sample should be more pronounced than those in the normative sample  [28] ."

We covaried WAIS-IV information subtest scores and experimental condition, to control for the element of the study design unrelated to the present analysis.\n\nConsistent with expectation, results revealed a significant group difference in the size of the EF-PE (F [1, 67] = 9.47, p < .01), such that those who engaged in CAI had smaller EF-PE than those who did not engage in the CAI. Additionally, repeating this above analysis for EF-PE with CP-PE as a covariate did not change the results (F [1, 66] = 8.60, p < .01), suggesting that the effect we observed for EF was not driven by lower order processes. Contrary to our expectation, there were no significant associations of CAI with baseline EF (F [1, 67] = 0.00, ns). This effect did not change for EF even if CP was entered as a covariate (F [1, 66]= 0.24, ns). Finally, as we expected, we did not find any group differences for either baseline CP or CP-PE (F's [1, 67] = 0.48 and 0.91, respectively, ns).\n\nTo further explicate the association between CAI and change in EF from baseline to post-stressor, we conducted paired-sample t-tests, comparing EF-PE to the normed EF practice effect across both levels of CAI.\n\nAmong participants who reported no CAI with casual partners, observed PE from baseline to post-stressor were significantly better than the norm (M obs = 1.56 vs. M norm = 1.22; t [58] = 2.99, p < .01), consistent with the fact that our test-retest interval was considerably shorter than that of the normative tables (30 min vs. several weeks). In contrast, among participants reporting at least some CAI with casual partners, observed PE from baseline to post-stressor were significantly worse than the norm (M obs = 0.67 vs. M norm = 1.26; t  [11]  = 2.25, p < .05). No differences were found for either group between norms and observed PE for CP (all p values >.18)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Among our sample of adult MSM, trait EF assessed at rest in a laboratory setting was not associated with CAI. On repeated administration of the D-KEFS, after engaging in a stressful interpersonal task, most MSM demonstrated PE. However, the degree of improvement in EF was significantly lower among MSM reporting recent CAI, and that difference was not driven by lower order CP (e.g., perceptual speed or speed of motor output).\n\nOne possible explanation for these findings is that the stressful interpersonal task cognitively depleted some participants more than others, a difference which might reflect variability in the degree to which people have the capacity to maintain self-regulation through a challenging situation. This could explain why the same participants who performed relatively more poorly with practice also engaged in greater levels of CAI with casual sexual partners. Navigating a sexual encounter with a casual partner has the potential to be an interpersonally challenging task requiring both cognitive and affective self-regulatory skills. Specifically, individuals must manage their own affective and sexual arousal, make assessments about risk, engage in decision-making regarding behaviors to enact (e.g., condom use), and communicate effectively with a sexual partner who is himself engaged in a similar complex process. It is likely that individuals who are more cognitively depleted by those demands could also be those who struggle most to follow through enacting precautionary measures. We did not observe any associations between baseline performance on tests of EF and CAI. This is inconsistent with findings from two studies of substance-using adults that did find associations  [8, 9] . The discrepancy might be because of differences in the tests administered, as the two associations were observed in studies that utilized measures that are particularly sensitive to impulsivity (i.e., the IGT and Go/No-Go tasks), whereas our measure tapped broader EF constructs. Alternately, the differences might relate to the fact that previous research has utilized samples preselected for high levels of substance use. Substance use and EF likely influence one another bidirectionally, and substance use is also a strong predictor of sexual risk behavior; thus, these variables might form a complex triad, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of EF alone. Finally, it is possible that EF simply is not strongly associated with sexual risk behavior when it is assessed in an untaxed state among young adults not preselected for substances use.\n\nThese findings must be qualified by several limitations. First, our assessment of EF was abbreviated, and our composite measure had a lower reliability than we expected based on our previous research. Thus, although we utilized several subtests of a well-established battery, we did not tap all cognitive domains that contributed to EF, leaving open the possibility that unassessed domains might show different associations with CAI. Despite this, our study actually represents an improvement over much of the literature in this area, which commonly relies on just one or two tasks to assess EF and provides no control for lower order CP. Additionally, this study utilized a relatively small sample that reported generally low levels of sexual risk behavior, leaving us underpowered to detect small effects. Our assessment of sexual behavior also did not include questions about the relatively recent addition of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy. Thus, some of the men engaging in CAI in our sample might have been using PrEP, reducing their risk for HIV (but not other sexually transmitted infections). Another limitation is that our design did not compare the impact of a stressor task between test administrations to a control task. Thus, we cannot be certain what changes in cognitive performance we might have seen had the participants not engaged in the stressful task, and we can only speculate that differences in performance across categories of risk were related to depletion caused by the stressor task. Future research exploring this possibility should test the impact of different kinds of tasks, varying level, and type of stressor to more carefully pinpoint which kinds of tasks are truly depleting for men with varying histories of risk behavior. Moreover, because anti-gay \"minority stress\" might make MSM more vulnerable to rejection sensitivity  [33] , future work should examine whether the effects we observed generalize to other populations, including MSM who do not identify as gay or bisexual. Finally, the oft-cited phenomenon of \"ego depletion\" has been criticized recently with a new work suggesting that the effects may not be as robust as once thought  [34] . EF depletion is a much more specific neurocognitive phenomenon, with an evidence base distinct from that supporting ego depletion. Nevertheless, the application of EF depletion to sexual risk behavior does imply that the state decreases in EF contribute to broader self-regulatory challenges, and the field faces unresolved questions about what domains of self-regulation are truly \"depletable,\" and what those changes mean for subsequent real-world behavior.\n\nThis preliminary study is the first of which we are aware to examine associations between EF and sexual risk behavior in a sample of adults without documented substance use challenges. Should future research corroborate the idea that stressful interpersonal interactions deplete some individuals in a manner that makes it harder for them to maintain sexual safety, interventions will need to adapt accordingly. For example, execution of precautionary behaviors that occur outside of a sexual encounter (e.g., taking PrEP) might be a better option for individuals who struggle with executive control in challenging situations. Alternately, interventions might double down on the activities that emphasize building habits (e.g., repeated rehearsal of behaviors) that rely less on sustained EF in a sexual encounter. Exploration of these and other possibilities will be a priority as we build a greater evidence base for understanding the role of EF in sexual behaviors."
