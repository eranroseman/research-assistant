  "abstract": "Shigellosis is one of the leading causes of diarrhea worldwide with more than 130 million cases annually. Hence, the research of an effective vaccine is still a priority. Unfortunately, a safe and efficacious vaccine is not available yet. We have previously demonstrated the capacity of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to protect mice against an experimental infection with Shigella flexneri. Now, we present results on the capacity of this antigenic complex to confer a longer-term protection by oral or nasal routes when encapsulated into nanoparticles. OMVs were encapsulated in poly(anhydride) nanoparticles (NP) prepared by a solvent displacement method with the copolymer poly methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride. OMVs loaded into nanoparticles (NP-OMVs) were homogeneous and spherical in shape, with a size of 148 nm (PdI = 0.2). BALB/c mice were immunized with OMVs either free or encapsulated in nanoparticles by nasal (20 g or 10 g of OMVs) or oral route (100 g or 50 g of OMVs). All immunized animals remained in good health after administration. Challenge infection was performed intranasally on week 8th with a lethal dose of 5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU/mouse of S. flexneri 2a. The number of dead mice after challenge was recorded daily. Results confirmed the value of OMVs as a vaccine. By oral route, the OMV-vaccine was able to protect independently either the dose or the formulation. When vaccine was delivered by nasal route, encapsulation into NPs resulted beneficial in increasing protection from 40% up to 100% when low dose was administered. These results are extraordinary promising and put in relevance the positive effect of nanoencapsulation of the OMV subcellular vaccine.",

      "text": "Diarrheal diseases caused by bacterial, viral, or parasitic pathogens are a major public health problem. Among the several responsible pathogens, Shigella spp., causal agents of shigellosis or bacterial dysentery, are a leading cause of diarrheal diseases worldwide. Although recent estimations indicate an important reduction in deaths, it is still responsible for 130 millions of cases annually  [1] . This high incidence, together with the emergence of multidrug-resistant Shigella strains as well as the difficulties to implement appropriate sanitary conditions make shigellosis an unsolved global health problem  [1] [2] [3] . Accordingly, the research of an effective vaccine is still a priority by WHO. For this purpose, we recently developed an acellular vaccine based on outer membrane vesicles from Shigella flexneri  [4] . On this study, mice were immunized with one single dose of OMVs by intradermal, ocular, nasal or oral route. Remarkably, this OMVs-vaccine was effective on the experimental shigellosis model. As a result of these promising results, further studies related to long-term protection as well as the possibility of formulation optimization was performed.\n\nWhen subunit vaccines, with lower inherent immunogenicity, are used, it is usually required the employ of additional components to confer protective immunity. The incorporation of adjuvants or the employ of alternatives routes of delivery is the most common strategies to this respect  [5] [6] [7] [8] . Mucosal vaccination using antigens loaded or encapsulated in particles, and specifically, nanoparticles, appears to have a sound scientific rationale based on the protection of antigens from exposure to extreme pH conditions, bile and pancreatic secretions  [9, 10] . At the same time, advantage is taken of the inherent inclination of particles to be naturally captured by mucosal APCs as part of its duty as a sentinel in triggering of mucosal immunity against pathogens  [11] . In the development of nanoparticles as adjuvants for mucosal vaccination several factors need to be considered, such as the adequate combination between the polymer and the antigens, as well as the preparative method employed for antigen loading, both having a great influence on the physicochemical properties of the resulting particulates, their stability in the gastrointestinal tract and their interaction with components of the mucosa  [10] . Some amphiphilic polyanhydrides have been reported to exhibit adjuvant characteristics  [12] [13] [14] [15] .\n\nIn particular, poly(anhydride) nanoparticulate systems made by the copolymer of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride (PVM/MA) have demonstrated their efficacy as adjuvants to induce Th1 immune responses  [16, 17] . Furthermore, PVM/MA nanoparticles may be exploited as oral adjuvants since they can enhance the capability to develop bioadhesive interactions within the gut and prolong their residence in close contact with the mucosal surface  [18, 19] . Moreover, parallel toxicity studies show that poly(anhydride) nanoparticles are safe when administered by the oral route at different dose regimens  [20] .\n\nIn a previous study, we included PVM/MA nanoparticles for the delivery of Shigella OMVs by intradermal or mucosal routes  [4] . Specifically, OMVs encapsulated into poly(anhydride) nanoparticles by solvent displacement method increased the levels of protection from 20% up to 90% with respect free-OMVs. Under those experimental conditions, full protection was conferred with free OMV complex when delivered via mucosa (nasal, ocular or oral) demonstrating the intrinsic adjuvant properties of this liposomallike antigen complex. In the current study, we go further testing the efficacy of one single dose of Shigella OMVs-containing nanoparticles formulations against a lethal infection of S. flexneri in mice even after eight weeks after immunization by oral or nasal routes. Additionally, we tested lower doses of vaccine with respect the previous studies."

NP-OMVs were homogeneous and spherically shaped (Fig.  1A ). The average size of NP-OMVs was calculated to be 148 nm, with a polidispersity index of 0.2. On the other hand, the zeta potential of these nanoparticles was -45 \u00b1 1 mV, significantly less negative than the net charge observed for empty nanoparticles (-58 \u00b1 1 mV). These results suggest that OMVs were, at least partially, bound on the surface of nanoparticles. This fact was corroborated by two sets of experiments. First, a dotted appearance of NP-OMVs was observed by cryoEM microscopy (Fig.  1A ). Second, IFA images showed that nanoparticles containing OMVs were detected when using antibodies against OMVs antigens (Fig.  1C ).\n\nTo further confirm OMVs encapsulation into nanoparticles, BCA protein determination and SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting were also performed. S. flexneri OMVs were efficiently associated with PVM/MA nanoparticles, as they showed a loading encapsulation of 20.4 \u00b1 6 g OMVs/mg of polymer. Besides, an immunoblotting was carried out using sera from rabbit hyper-immunized with S. flexneri. Results indicate that entrapment in nanoparticles did not alter its antigenic properties (Fig.  1B )."

      "text": "Groups of 6 mice were immunized once by nasal or oral routes with OMVs either free or encapsulated into nanoparticles. Mice were immunized with one dose of 20 or 10 g/mouse by nasal route, or 100 or 50 g/mouse by the oral route. A control group of non-immunized mice was also included. All animals immunized by nasal or oral routes remained in good health, exhibiting no respiratory difficulties, changes in body temperature, or abnormal behavior. Then, in order to compare the kinetic of the immune response between the different groups, specific serum levels of IgG2a and IgG1 against OMVs antigens were determined by ELISA at different times post-immunization (Fig.  2A ). Results expressed that the immunization with free OMV by oral route elicited significant levels of serum IgG1 with respect control mice (P < 0.05, Fig.  2A ). Moreover, a clear adjuvant effect of the encapsulation into NPs was detected. Accordingly, mice immunized with the lower dose of NP-OMVs showed significant IgG1 levels from 2nd week after vaccination. Lower levels of specific IgG2a with respect IgG1 were found after oral administration (Fig.  2A ). Nasal immunization elicited significant serum IgG1 levels with the high dose (20 g/mouse) of the OMV complex either free or encapsulated, but only free OMVs (20 g/mouse) elicited significant specific IgG2a antibodies.\n\nMucosal IgA antibodies against OMVs or LPS were also determined in feces (Fig.  2B ). Although no significant levels were found, comparing the different groups the higher dose of free OMVs administered orally elicited significant levels of IgA against OMV, but, however, not against the LPS (Fig.  2B , upper left). Interestingly, after nasal administration of OMVs encapsulated into NPs (20 g/mouse), transient levels of IgA against both, OMV and LPS, were detected (Fig.  2B , upper right).\n\nThe serum levels of cytokines were measured by ELISA at day 7 post-immunization (Fig.  3 ). The oral administration of nanoencapsulated OMVs induced an increase (no significant differences) in the levels of TNF-\u2423 and IL-17 (Fig.  3A ). Furthermore, at the highest dose (100 g/mouse) the maximum levels of IFN-\u2425 and IL-6 were detected. Interestingly, IL-10 level displays the reverse profile.\n\nThe nasal administration of nanoencapsulated OMVs elicited, with the exception of IL-10, an inverse correlation with respect the antigen dose (Fig.  3B ). Thus, when low dose (  10  administered, IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, IL-6 and IL-17 increased respect the higher dose (20 g)."

Shigella vaccine strategies can be grouped into two fundamental approaches: live-attenuated vaccines and nonliving vaccines  [22] [23] [24] . Recent strategies involve the use of purified or recombinant subunit vaccines since they offer so far the safest choice for vaccination. However, safety usually goes together with a low inherent immunogenicity. Accordingly, this kind of vaccines might require adyuvants in order to be effective."

      "text": "Framed on this acellular Shigella vaccine strategy, our proposal involves the use of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) naturally released from the cell. This blebbing process is considered as a peculiar bacterial extracellular secretion system than enable bacterial colonization and impairs host immune response. Shigella releases OMVs as spherical lipid bilayer conformed by LPS, OMP and Ipa proteins  [4, 25]  that are considered as main protective antigens against shigellosis  [23, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . In fact, current subcellular strategies include these antigens in their composition such as Invaplex  [31, 32] .\n\nOn this context, we previously demonstrated the potential of Shigella OMV to protect against an experimental challenge in mice  [4] . In view of those results, the purpose of this study was, first, to evaluate the employment of a lower dose of antigenic complex for vaccination and, second, investigate if poly(anhydride) nanoparticles may help to get a long-term protection after nasal or oral administration.\n\nConcerning long term immunity, little information is available on the adjuvant effects on the memory development, and even less is known about mucosal adjuvants and memory responses. Long term memory paradigm is offered by key successful examples including yellow fever YF-17D vaccine  [33] . Cell-mediated immunity may be maintained in immunized people for decades. This attenuated vaccine contains agonists for several Toll-like receptors. The impact on the activation of innate immunity, specifically, the use of multiple TLR-agonists, could explain why this vaccine effectively stimulated long-term memory. This is an important finding that may be interpolated to the nanoparticles to induce long-term memory cells  [10, 34, 35] . Thus, although interactions between particles and DC depend on particle characteristics such as size and shape, charge and hydrophobicity, the mechanisms responsible for DC maturation may be mostly related to TLR recognition in DC. It was previously shown that the poly(anhydride) nanoparticles of PMVA used here induce innate immune responses mediated by a TLR-2 and TLR-4 dependent manner  [17, 36] . These nanoparticles induced maduration of DC with a significant up-regulation of costimulatory CD40, CD80, and CD86, and a biased Th1 response in animal models.\n\nIn the current study, results confirmed the potential value of these poly(anhydride) nanoparticles in order to offer a long term protection when encapsulating Shigella OMVs, as it will be later discussed. First, results confirmed the potential value of OMVs for vaccination against experimental shigellosis. The oral delivery of the vaccine, containing either free or encapsulated OMVs, was able to protect against the experimental lethal challenge. These oral vaccinated mice developed specific serum IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies. Of particular interest it is to highlight observed concerning the antigen dose when encapsulated in nanoparticles. Besides, a delay in antibody production was observed (Fig.  2 ). Notably, not only nanoparticles but also the OMV have been described to play a role as delivery systems due to their physical structure. Accordingly, we hypothesize these delivery systems may lead to a sustained released of the antigens displaying the observed kinetic profile.\n\nOn the other side, free OMVs administered directly onto nasal mucosa were able to protect at the highest dose evaluated (20 g). By contrast, it was necessary to use nanoparticles to get a similar level of protection with the low dose (10 g).\n\nImmunity against human shigellosis and in the experimental murine model of pulmonary infection, as well, correlates to the up-regulation of IFN-\u2425 production  [37] . The increase in IFN-\u2425 levels stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of Th1-biased cells, with the concomitant CD8 T cell response, leading to the elimination of phagocytosed Shigella organisms. As expected, this proinflammatory response is accompanied by the production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 limiting the sequellae of the inflammatory response in order to protect the host tissue destruction  [38] . In fact, a high production of both IL-10 and IFN-\u2425 is observed after experimentally induced shigellosis  [37, 39] . Consistent with the nature of these cytokines, we found an inverse correlation between IL-10 and IFN-\u2425 concentrations after immunization. Furthermore, we found a correlation between IL-10 and IgG1. IL-10 is a switch factor for IgG during B-lymphocyte maturation toward IgG, and IgA. Specifically, IL-10 stimulate B lymphocyte proliferation and IgG1 secretion mediated by the interaction between CD40 on B lymphocytes and CD40 ligand (CD154) on activated T lymphocytes  [40, 41] .\n\nFurthermore, PVMA-nanoparticles demonstrate their capacity to modulate the immune response elicited by the OMV antigens. The incorporation of antigens into these poly(anhydride) nanoparticles has been demonstrated to enhance the immune responses in terms of antibody production, IFN-\u2425 and IL-10 and, overall, protection levels. This fact may be explained by the implemented possibilities that nanoparticles render to the antigen. First, it has been reported that the bioadhesive nature of the polymer enhanced the interaction of poly(anhydride) nanoparticles with the gut mucosa  [18] . Second, the encapsulation of antigens creates high-density antigen surfaces that increase the possibilities of antigen recognition and/or capture by the APCs. Third, they allow a controlled release of the antigens that could favor their sustained exposition to the immune system, increasing the efficiently of vaccination. Besides, considering all this together, it could be lead to a more consistent and long lasting memory effect. Last, an additional advantage of this OMVs-nanoparticles based vaccine is that contain Ipa proteins and other major outer membrane proteins (MOMPs) that are conserved among Shigella species and may be enable to stimulate cross-reactive immunity against them  [31, 42] . Besides, an additional advantage of nanoencapsulation is the potential to incorporate antigens from these other Shigella species for future multivalent vaccine against shigellosis  [22] ."
