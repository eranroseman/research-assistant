  "title": "Using remotely monitored patient activity patterns after hospital discharge to predict 30 day hospital readmission: a randomized trial",
  "abstract": "Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly, but most only use information collected until the time of hospital discharge. In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission. Nearly 1 in 5 patients discharged from the hospital are readmitted within 30 days 1,2 . Despite significant efforts, models to predict which patients will be readmitted often perform poorly  1, 3, 4  . A major limitation to these approaches is that they rely heavily on data available up until the time of hospital discharge and do not consider information on patient behaviors at home after they have left the hospital. In addition, most prior models have used traditional regression techniques. Recent systematic reviews suggest that machine learning approaches could provide improved prediction  5, 6  . The use of remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices such as smartphones and wearables is increasing, and prior work has demonstrated they are accurate for tracking daily activity patterns  7, 8  . Several pilot studies have demonstrated associations between activity levels and patient outcomes including hospital readmission 9-13 , but evidence from more rigorous and larger clinical trials is lacking. While smartphones are more commonly used by adults, wearables may capture additional measures that smartphones do not, such as sleep patterns 8 . It is unknown whether this additional data collected by wearables will lead to improved prediction compared to data collected by smartphones. The objective of our study was to evaluate whether hospital readmission prediction models could be improved by incorporating RPM data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and by using machine learning approaches. To evaluate whether there were differences in prediction based on the type of RPM device, we randomly assigned patients discharged from medicine services at two hospitals in Philadelphia to use either their smartphone or a wearable device to track daily activity patterns. Many patients already have a smartphone and these devices have been demonstrated to lead to longer-term utilization for RPM than wearables 14 . However, wearables provide information on behaviors that smartphones do not, such as sleep patterns. Therefore, a headto-head comparison of smartphones vs. wearables could help to inform future implementation efforts. We also",

In the 30 days after discharge, the proportion of patient-days that RPM data was transmitted was greater for physical activity data among the smartphone arm (78.6% for smartphone arm vs 70.8% for wearable arm; P for difference < 0.001), but greater for sleep data among the wearable arm (0.3% for smartphone arm vs 39.5% for wearable arm; P for difference < 0.001).\n\nFigure  2  depicts hospital readmission prediction measured using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals by regression model (logistic vs. ensemble machine learning), RPM data (included vs. not included), and device arm (smartphone vs. wearable).

Prediction improved when including remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on physical activity and sleep patterns after hospital discharge (AUC range: 0.66 to 0.75). The best prediction included RPM data with nonparametric machine learning approaches (AUC range 0.80 to 0.85). In the randomized trial, we found that RPM data from wearables outperformed RPM data from smartphones, but that differences between the two arms were small. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies of its kind and demonstrates that hospital readmission prediction models could be significantly improved if they used nonparametric machine learning approaches and incorporated RPM data. = 250) Wearable (n = 250) Age, years Mean (SD) 46.2 (13.6) 46.9 (13.9) 18-34 61 (24.4) 56 (22.4) 35-49 71 (28.4) 75 (30.0) 50-64 101 (40.4) 94 (37.6) 65 or above 17 (6.8) 25 (10.0) Female gender 155 (62.0) 165 (66.0) Race/ethnicity White, Non-Hispanic 102 (40.8) 117 (46.8) Black, Non-Hispanic 125 (50.0) 110 (44.0) Hispanic 17 (6.8) 11 (4.4) Other 6 (2.4) 12 (4.8) Insurance Commercial 118 (47.2) 113 (45.2) Medicare 71 (28.4) 70 (28.0) Medicaid 61 (24.4) 67 (26.8) Annual household income, $ < 30,000 47 (18.8) 52 (20.8) 30,000-59,999 84 (33.6) 77 (30.8) 60,000-99,999 76 (30.4) 70 (28.0) \u2265 100,000 43 (17.2) 51 (20.4) Marital status Single 117 (46.8) 106 (42.4) Married 92 (36.8) 99 (39.6) Other 41 (16.4) 45 (18.0) Education Less than high school graduate 14 (5.6) 25 (10.0) High school graduate 150 (60.0) 146 (58.4) College graduate or higher 86 (34.4) 79 (31.6) Body mass index, mean (SD) 30.5 (8.6) 31.3 (9.6) Charlson Comorbidity Index, median (IQR) 2 (1, 5) 2 (1, 4)\n\nOur findings reveal several important insights for future implementation and research efforts. Prediction in the wearable arm was significantly greater than the smartphone arm, but the difference was small (AUC 0.85 for wearable vs. 0.84 for smartphone). Prior work has found that physical activity data collected by these devices is similar in accuracy  7  , but that smartphone device users transmitted RPM data at higher rates than wearable users over time  14  . Indeed, in this study we found those using a smartphone tracked their physical activity patterns at higher rates than those using a wearable (78.6% vs. 70.8%). This might be because patients may stop using a wearable device but do not stop carrying their smartphone. However, smartphone users still need to open the app to transmit physical activity data and smartphones do not track sleep data unless a patient manually reports it. These competing factors of better data quality with sleep data from wearables but less data availability may have led to similar prediction rates between the device arms. In the future, it will be important to compare prediction over a longer-term period such as 90 or 180 days. Since more than 80% of adults have a smartphone  16  , these devices may be a more scalable approach than purchasing wearables for patients to use. Future work should also evaluate wearables that can track additional biometrics such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. Table  2 . Adjusted prediction models for 30-day hospital readmission.

Another systematic review found that machine learning models of EHR data did slightly outperform traditional parametric approaches with AUCs averaging 0.74 in machine learning models  6  . In our trial, nonparametric machine learning approaches consistently outperformed traditional parametric regression techniques such as logit or lasso models. This was true for both the standard models with data until the time of discharge and enhanced models that incorporated RPM data. While machine learning approaches will need to be further tested in other settings, our findings suggest they could be an important component of efforts to improve prediction of important health outcomes.\n\nThis study has several strengths. First, we evaluated an important clinical outcome and used several data sources including electronic health records and state databases to identify hospital readmissions. Second, we enrolled a diverse patient sample that of which 47% were 50 years or older, 53% were Black or Hispanic, and 26% had Medicaid. Third, we evaluated 5 different modeling techniques including traditional parametric and nonparametric machine learning approaches and found consistent results across these models. Fourth, we collected remote patient monitoring data on patient behavior after hospital discharge, which has not traditionally been integrated into hospital readmission prediction models. Fifth, we conducted a pragmatic, randomized trial to provide a rigorous assessment of the difference in prediction between two of the most common devices used for remote patient monitoring.\n\nLimitations. This study also has limitations. First, the sample included patients with a mean age of about 46 years from medicine services at one health system who were being discharged to home and less than 10% of those approached agreed to participate, which limits generalizability. Future studies should evaluate a broader sample of patients. Second, the analyses evaluated hospital readmissions within 30 days. Future studies should evaluate prediction of rehospitalization at longer periods of time after discharge. Third, data on hospital readmissions was obtained from Penn Medicine and a database on hospitalizations in the State of Pennsylvania. We did not have access to readmissions that occurred outside of Pennsylvania. Fourth, while participant characteristics between study arms were similar, the readmission rate was lower in the wearable arm. This imbalance may have been due to random chance and the small sample size. However, it does not impact the main findings that RPM data with machine learning improved prediction. Fifth, RPM data was limited to measures of physical activity and sleep. We did not have data on heart rate or other biometrics which can be captured by some wear- able devices. Nonetheless, we did find improvements in prediction with these RPM measures and future studies could evaluate if additional biometric data can further improvement."

      "title": "Statistical analysis.",
      "text": "All randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. For each patient and on each day of the study (patient-day level), we obtained RPM activity data. Data could be missing for any day if the patient did not use the device, did not sync it to upload data, or the device did not capture it (e.g. smartphones did not track sleep data). We also excluded outliers (top and bottom 1 percentile) in activity data and coded them as missing. To account for missing values in the RPM data, we included a dichotomous missing-value indicator variable for each RPM data variable  24  . We also conducted multiple imputation by chain equations (MICE) with five sets of imputations that used a mixed effect model with the following predictors: study arm, day of the study, calendar month, weekend or weekday, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, education, marital status, annual household income, body mass index, hospital length of stay, Charlson comorbidity index, and vitals (temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, oxygen saturation, respirations per minute)  25  . Missing data rates are available (Supplementary Table  1 ). Since the amount of missing data itself could be an indicator of readmission risk, we also developed a variable for the proportion of days of data captured. Because more changes in RPM values may be better predictors than earlier changes, we created lagging indicator variables at the patient-day level that used a weighted average of data over the previous 3 days as follows: 1 day prior (0.9 weight), 2 days prior (0.9 2 or 0.81 weight), and 3 days prior (0.9 3 or 0.73 weight). RPM data was censored on the day of readmission or death.\n\nWe used a discrete-time survival analysis and evaluated hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge at the patient-day level as the unit of observation. The sample was split into training and testing folds for each arm that were mutually exclusive at the patient level in a 3:2 ratio. The training set used fivefold crossvalidation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set.\n\nWe fit a standard model that comprised data available up to the time of hospital discharge including demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, annual household income, and body mass index), time (calendar month and year), hospital length of stay, vitals near discharge (temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, oxygen saturation, respirations per minute), and Charlson Comorbidity Index. We fit an enhanced model with RPM data that included the same variables as the standard model as well as the following: daily measures of step counts, distance, calories burned (active and total), minutes of activity (soft and moderate intensity), minutes of sleep (total, light, and deep), minutes awake, and number of times awakened. The enhanced model with RPM also including missing-value and lagged indicators for each RPM measure, as previously described. For all models, we compared traditional parametric regression (logit and lasso) to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble machine learning). The ensemble machine learning model used a combination of logit, lasso, random forest, and gradient boosting. Hyperparameter specification is described in Supplementary Table  3 .\n\nModel performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)  26, 27  . The Delong method was used to test for differences in AUC between study arms and models  28  . To estimate 95% confidence intervals we used 1000 bootstrapped samples. We also estimated the observed rate of readmission by quartile of predicted risk. Analyses were conducted using Scikit-learn version 0.24.1 package, XGBoost version 0.9 package, and Lifelines version 0.25.7 package with Python version 3.7.9 (Python Software Foundation). We used 2-sided hypothesis tests (level of significance, P < 0.05)."
