      "text": "Health literacy, illustrated in Figure  1 , is defined as the ability to obtain, comprehend and apply health information to make informed decisions related to health  (1, 2)  , has been demonstrated to help improve health status  (3, 4) . Digital literacy is described as an individual's ability to find, evaluate and communicate information by using digital tools  (5) . Health and digital literacy play a vital role in promoting better health outcomes for individuals and communities  (3, 4, 6) . Limited health literacy has been linked to poor health outcomes, increased healthcare costs and health disparities  (7, 8) . To address these issues there has been growing recognition of the potential of digital communication tools to improve health literacy and empower individuals to take a more active role in managing their health  (9) (10) (11) (12) .\n\nDigital communication tools, such as mobile health apps, telemedicine and online health information resources, have gained significant popularity and are increasingly being integrated into healthcare delivery systems. These tools offer unique opportunities to reach a wide range of demographics, regardless of their geographic location, socioeconomic status, or educational background. By leveraging the power of technology, digital communication tools have the potential to enhance health literacy, improve patient-provider communication and ultimately lead to better health outcomes.\n\nThis review aims to explore the power of digital communication tools in improving health literacy and achieving better health outcomes for both patients and practitioners.\n\nWe examine the current evidence on the effectiveness of various digital tools, including mobile health apps, telemedicine platforms and online health information resources, in promoting health literacy. The impacts of improved health literacy, the challenges associated with low digital health literacy and strategies to overcome these constraints are discussed. We also assess the implications of leveraging digital communication tools for optimising engagement, enhancing health literacy across different demographics and transforming healthcare delivery.\n\nWe aim to provide a deeper understanding of the potential of digital communication tools to improve health literacy and contribute to better health outcomes across the full spectrum of healthcare (Figure  2 ). By identifying the benefits, limitations and future directions of digital health literacy interventions, this review will inform researchers, healthcare professionals, policymakers and other stakeholders in effectively utilising digital tools to promote health literacy and deliver patientcentred care.\n\nIllustration of the various dimensions of health literacy and the impact on different health domains.

      "text": "Health literacy levels vary significantly across the world. Poor health literacy remains a significant challenge globally. The consequences of low health literacy are far-reaching, impacting individuals' ability to access, comprehend and act upon health information effectively. The disparities in health literacy levels across countries and regions, underscores the need for targeted interventions to address these disparities.\n\nA population survey conducted by HLS19 Consortium of the WHO Action Network M-POHL (2021)  (13)  examined health literacy levels in Europe and found considerable variations among countries. The Health Literacy categorical levels of \"inadequate\" and \"problematic\" were combined and defined as \"limited\" Health Literacy. The survey revealed a range for \"limited\" health literacy of 25%-72%. That means between one in four and three out of four residents in countries participating in HLS19 have limited general Health Literacy.\n\n\u0160ulinskait\u0117 et al.  (14)  examined health literacy in a cross-sectional survey conducted in Lithuania which showed 40.6% of respondents had problematic health literacy. Inadequate or problematic health literacy was noted among 83.6% of respondents aged 59 years and older. Similar rates were also observed among patients with basic or primary education (76.1%), secondary education (76.6%) and divorced patients (86%). Respondents with better health literacy also had better health behaviours (p < 0.05). This study shows the influence of age, education and family status on health literacy.\n\nA review of previous studies in the United States (US) revealed that at least 88% of adults living in the US have health literacy inadequate to navigate the healthcare system and promote their well-being  (15) . Only 12% are proficiently health literate. Adults with lower health literacy are more likely to return incomplete medical forms/assessment tools, miss appointments with health providers and neglect follow-ups to required medical procedures.\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 60% of Australian adults have low Health Literacy  (16, 17) . A nationally representative study in Canada of men's health literacy showed low income, low education and living alone were associated with men's low Health Literacy  (18) .\n\nAnalysis of Health Literacy studies conducted in South East Asia also found that limited health literacy varied considerably, 1.6%-99.5% with a mean of 55.3%. As with other studies the most common factors associated with limited Health Literacy were education attainment, age, income and socio-economic background  (19) .\n\nAddressing the global impact of poor health literacy requires tailored interventions that consider the unique challenges faced by different populations  (8, 20) . Efforts should focus on improving health communication practices, developing culturally appropriate health information materials and strengthening healthcare systems to better meet the needs of individuals with varying health literacy levels  (21, 22) .\n\nLimited health literacy poses significant challenges to individuals and healthcare systems  (8, 23, 24) . The cited references shed light on the disparities in health literacy and emphasise the need for targeted interventions to address these gaps  (25, 26) . By implementing evidence-based strategies and prioritising health literacy as a global agenda, we can empower individuals, reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for populations worldwide."

      "title": "Improving health literacy",
      "text": "Vital to improving health literacy is conveying information in a manner and language that is easily understood and therefore engages the target audiences. It is essential to ensure that health information is accessible, comprehensible and actionable for individuals with varying levels of health literacy. Engagement of any target groups requires presenting the correct information to the relevant people in a timely manner using the most appropriate media. To achieve these objectives effective efficient content creation is fundamental. Producing engaging content that resonates, requires understanding the key messages to be conveyed, identifying the target audiences and their communication preferences.\n\nThere are many well established methodologies to help draft content and assess the understandability of language and terminology to convey the relevant health information. One example the Clear Communication initiative promotes the use of plain language in health communication to enhance understandability  (27) . This approach involves using clear, concise and jargon-free language, avoiding complex medical terminology, providing explanations and examples to improve comprehension  (28, 29) . In June this year the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) formally approved its first international plain language standard  (30) . The new standard will help improve written communication for everyone.\n\nReadability Assessment Tools, see Table  1  below lists some of the easily accessible resources for healthcare professionals and content creators to ensure the understandability of healthcare information. By actively utilising these freely available assessment tools, healthcare organisations can and should gauge the readability of their materials to enable informed decisions regarding the effectiveness of health information communication. Raising awareness about the availability of these tools and promoting their use can contribute to the development of health content that is clear, concise and tailored to individuals with varying levels of health literacy. Such a proactive approach ensures that healthcare information is comprehensible to the intended audience increasing the probability of engagement and motivating individuals to make informed decisions about their health. health literacy leading to better health outcomes. Mobile health apps provide convenient access to health information, self-monitoring tools and personalised interventions, empowering individuals to actively participate in their healthcare journey  (39) . Telemedicine enables remote consultations, expanding access to healthcare services and facilitating patient-provider communication, particularly in underserved areas  (40) . Online health information resources offer a wealth of information that can support patient education, decision-making and self-management  (41, 42) .\n\nHowever, the so called \"digital divide\" persists. The digital divide refers to the gap in access to digital technologies and the internet across certain populations and regions, many having limited or no access  (43) . Such limited access to digital technologies hinders availability and participation in digital activities. Approximately two thirds of the world's population have internet access but there are vast differences in internet usage between high (91%) and low (22%) income countries (44). Developing countries face infrastructure challenges, including lack of connectivity, electricity and access to necessary devices, hindering digital access for a significant portion of their populations. In addition, there are imbalances in terms of digital skills and literacy. Even when individuals have access to digital tools, there may be a lack of proficiency in using them effectively to access information and services online. The gap in digital skills further exacerbates the inequalities in digital access and inhibits the full potential of digital technologies to reach all populations.\n\nDespite the challenges digital access and connectivity continue to improve worldwide (44). Increased investment in infrastructure, expansion of mobile networks and greater affordability of digital technologies are reducing the disparities in digital access  (44, 45) . The widespread availability of mobile devices and the increasing use of mobile health apps and telemedicine platforms have shown promising results in empowering individuals to actively manage their health and make informed decisions  (46) . Furthermore, the use of digital technologies enables the delivery of tailored health information and interventions, reaching underserved populations and bridging the gaps in health literacy  (47, 48) . As digital access continues to expand and technologies become more accessible, the potential for digital communication tools to improve global health literacy continues to increase in significance."

There are over 300,000 health related apps available globally  (49) . Studies have shown that mobile health apps can improve knowledge and self-efficacy in managing chronic conditions  (50) . For example, a randomised controlled trial by Greenwell et al.  (51)  demonstrated that a mobile app for asthma self-management significantly improved patients' knowledge and confidence in using their inhalers. Mobile Health (mHealth) can help achieve global health service coverage by overcoming geographical barriers increasing access for patients in remote areas and communities with insufficient healthcare services  (47) .\n\nStandards and objective assessment of mobile health apps are increasingly recognised as critical in ensuring app quality, safety, and effectiveness. App certification organisations, such as the Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps (ORCHA)  (52) , play a pivotal role in evaluating and rating health apps based on stringent criteria. ORCHA assesses apps across multiple domains, including clinical effectiveness, data privacy, usability and accessibility, providing users with reliable information to make informed choices  (53) . Another example is the mHealth App Certification Program by the UK National Health Service (NHS) Digital (54), which evaluates apps against defined technical, clinical and regulatory standards. Similarly, the Health App Certification Program by Happtique (55) provides a certification process that evaluates apps. Objective assessments and certifications enhance user trust and confidence by promoting app transparency, reliability, and adherence to best practices. Objective certification also facilitates healthcare professionals' integration of apps into clinical workflows, ensuring the use of evidence-based and safe digital health tools  (56) . By establishing standards and offering objective assessments, certification organisations contribute to improving the overall quality and reliability of mobile health apps."

Transparent algorithm development: Ensuring transparency in algorithm development, including providing documentation on data sources, model design and evaluation metrics to facilitate scrutiny and identify potential biases. Regular audits and evaluations: Conducting regular audits and evaluations of algorithms to identify biases, disparities and limitations. This process should involve rigorous testing on diverse data sets involving experts from various backgrounds.\n\nAddressing biases in algorithms and overcoming shortfalls of limited data sets is an ongoing endeavour. Future research should focus on developing standardised frameworks for evaluating algorithmic biases and using robust methodologies to address these biases effectively. Additionally, collaborations between researchers, healthcare organisations and policymakers are essential for implementing equitable unbiased digital technologies in clinical decision making.\n\nWhile digital technologies hold immense potential for enhancing clinical decision making, concerns surrounding biases in algorithms and limited data sets must not be overlooked or underestimated.

However, their adoption in healthcare raises important considerations related to governance and regulation. Algorithms trained on insufficient datasets can introduce biases and perpetuate health disparities. It is essential there is appropriate awareness about data set limitations to minimise risk of biases and misinterpretations when using AI in clinical decision making.\n\nEfforts are underway to develop guidelines and standards for the ethical use of AI in healthcare. The American Medical Association (AMA) has outlined principles for the design, implementation and use of AI in healthcare, emphasising transparency, fairness and accountability  (88) . The European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence has also published ethical guidelines, emphasising human agency, accountability and inclusiveness in AI development and deployment (90)."

      "text": "Governance and regulation of digital technologies in healthcare must be adaptive to the rapidly evolving technological landscape. Regular evaluation and updates are necessary to address emerging challenges, assess the effectiveness of regulations and incorporate feedback from stakeholders. Continual monitoring and evaluation frameworks can help identify gaps and areas for improvement ensuring that governance and regulation remain effective and relevant.\n\nOversight of digital technologies in healthcare services delivery and clinical decision making are essential to safeguard patient safety, protect privacy, uphold ethical standards, promote\n\nFitzpatrick 10.3389/fdgth.2023.1264780 collaboration and adapt to digital advancements. Establishing robust and dynamic governance frameworks, helps ensure the responsible and effective use of digital technologies to enhance healthcare experience for everyone. The increased utilisation of digital communication tools in healthcare has brought numerous benefits, including improved access to health information, enhanced patient engagement and streamlined communication between healthcare professionals and patients. However, this widespread adoption of digital communication tools has also placed additional burdens on healthcare professionals, particularly in terms of communication volume. Research shows that the rapid influx of messages, notifications and electronic communications can lead to increased workload and time demands for healthcare staff. For instance, a study by Shanafelt et al. (92) reported that physicians spend a significant amount of time on electronic communication, contributing to physician burnout and impacting work-life balance. Furthermore, reviews of the literature conducted by Patel et al. (93), Bakhai et al. (94); McTaggart & Walker  (95)  highlight that healthcare professionals often struggle to manage the constant influx of digital communication, leading to feelings of overload and a blurring of personal and professional boundaries. It is paramount that healthcare organisations recognise these challenges and implement strategies to mitigate the impact of communication volume on the work-life balance of healthcare staff. This may involve implementing communication guidelines, providing training on effective digital communication practices and developing supportive work environments that encourage appropriate use and boundaries for digital communication. By addressing these challenges, healthcare organisations can harness the benefits of digital communication tools while prioritising the well-being of their healthcare staff."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Digital communication tools have shown great promise in improving health literacy and fostering better health outcomes for patients and practitioners. We have outlined examples that show the power of various digital communication tools, such as mobile health apps, telemedicine and online health information resources, in promoting health and digital literacy. The evidence suggests that these tools have the potential to enhance patient education, self-management, clinical decision-making and provider communication  (39, 51, 57) .\n\nPatient education and empowerment are critical components of achieving better health outcomes. Mobile health apps have been successful in providing personalised education and support to patients, leading to improved knowledge and confidence in managing their conditions  (51, 107) . Additionally, conversational agents in healthcare have shown promise in delivering tailored education and facilitating patient engagement  (39) .\n\nSelf-management plays a crucial role in chronic disease management and overall health improvement. Digital communication tools, including mobile health apps and telemedicine, have demonstrated positive effects on selfmanagement behaviours and treatment adherence  (51, 57) . These tools offer patients access to resources and support, empowering them to take a more active role in their own care  (47, 48) .\n\nImproved clinical decision-making is another significant benefit of digital communication tools. Telemedicine consultations enable real-time access to patient information, facilitating informed decisions and multidisciplinary collaboration  (40) . Mobile health apps equipped with decision support systems have the potential to enhance clinical decision-making by providing evidence-based recommendations to healthcare providers  (39, 67, 75) . Effective communication among healthcare providers is vital for coordinated care and better patient outcomes. Digital communication tools, such as telemedicine platforms, have been shown to facilitate seamless information sharing, reducing medical errors and enhancing care coordination  (51, 57, 64, 66, 108) . By enabling efficient communication and collaboration, these tools have the potential to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. Digital tools empower patients by providing access to resources, tracking tools and remote monitoring, enabling them to actively participate in their care. Digital communication tools enable effective collaboration, further empowering healthcare providers to make well-informed decisions and provide timely interventions.\n\nDespite the significant potential of digital communication tools, there are challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. Access and connectivity barriers continue to hinder the equitable use of these tools, particularly among underserved populations  (43, 109, 110)  . To fully realise the benefit of digital tools in healthcare, efforts must focus on bridging the digital divide and ensuring accessibility for all individuals. It is also important to note that while technology is a very useful tool it cannot compensate for content that is not engaging, easy to consume and appropriate for the audience  (73, 111) .\n\nThe reliability and accuracy of online health information remains a major worry. Individuals with low health literacy may struggle to discern credible sources  (8, 9, 74) . It is essential to continually promote health literacy skills that empower individuals to critically evaluate online information and seek reputable sources.\n\nPrivacy and security concerns are also important considerations in the digital health landscape. Protecting sensitive health data and ensuring transparent data governance are essential to maintain individuals' trust and confidence in using digital health platforms  (70, 71) . Implementing robust data protection measures, complying with privacy regulations and adopting encryption technologies are vital for safeguarding patient information, see Table  3 .\n\nAddressing health inequities and promoting inclusivity in digital health literacy initiatives are also key to achieving better health outcomes. Tailoring interventions to diverse populations and providing support for individuals with varying digital skills, language barriers and lower health literacy levels can help mitigate disparities and ensure equitable access to digital health resources  (8, 68, 69) . Collaborating with community organisations and stakeholders can help reach underserved populations and ensure equitable access to digital health resources.\n\nDecision support systems, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics, have and will increasingly contribute to clinical decision making. These technologies have shown effectiveness in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning and patient management  (51, (57) (58) (59) 65) . As digital tools continue to advance, it is essential for healthcare providers and researchers to harness their potential and integrate them into clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes and optimise healthcare delivery  (53, 56) .\n\nIn conclusion, digital communication tools offer immense potential to improve health literacy and achieve better health outcomes for patients and practitioners. By promoting patient education and empowerment, supporting self-management and treatment options, enhancing clinical decision-making and improving provider communication, these tools can transform healthcare delivery. However, addressing access barriers, ensuring the reliability of online information, safeguarding privacy and security while promoting inclusivity are critical to maximise the benefits of digital health literacy initiatives."
