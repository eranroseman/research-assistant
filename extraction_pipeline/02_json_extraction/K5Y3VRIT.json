  "title": "The Relative Persuasiveness of Gain-Framed and Loss-Framed Messages for Encouraging Disease Detection Behaviors: A Meta-Analytic Review",
  "abstract": "A meta-analytic review of 53 studies (N = 9,145)  finds that in messages aimed at encouraging disease detection behaviors, loss-framed appeals (which emphasize the disadvantages of noncompliance with the communicator's recommendation) are only slightly, but statistically significantly, more persuasive than gain-framed appeals (which emphasize the advantages of compliance); the difference corresponds to a correlation of -.04. Loss-framed appeals enjoy a small statistically significant advantage for messages advocating breast cancer detection behaviors, but not for any other kind of detection behavior (detection of skin cancer, other cancers, dental problems, or miscellaneous other diseases) nor for all other kinds of detection behaviors combined. Thus, in advocacy of disease detection behaviors, using loss-framed rather than gain-framed appeals is unlikely to substantially improve persuasiveness.",

      "text": "attention, namely, a variation in the way in which the consequences (of adopting or not adopting the recommended behavior) were expressed.\n\nAs noticed by several commentators (e.g.,  Dillard & Marshall, 2003; Nan, 2007b; Rothman & Salovey, 1997; Wilson et al., 1988) , gain-framed and loss-framed appeals can each take two forms, with the resulting four possibilities represented in a 2 \u00d7 2 array in which the contrasts are whether (a) the outcome described is a desirable or an undesirable one and (b) the outcome is described as one that is attained (acquired, made more likely) or avoided (averted, made less likely). That is, a gain-framed appeal might take the form ''If you perform the advocated behavior, desirable outcome X will be obtained'' or the form ''If you perform the advocated behavior, undesirable outcome Y will be avoided.'' A loss-framed appeal might take the form ''If you do not perform the advocated behavior, desirable outcome X will be avoided'' or the form ''If you do not perform the advocated behavior, undesirable outcome Y will be obtained.'' This variation has previously been described as a matter of the appeals differing in the linguistic representation of the ''kernel state'' of the consequence under discussion (O'  Keefe & Jensen, 2006) . The kernel state is the basic, root state mentioned in the message's description of the consequence. For example, in an appeal such as ''If you have regular skin exams, you will reduce your risk of skin cancer,'' the kernel state is ''skin cancer,'' which is plainly an undesirable state; that is, this appeal emphasizes the desirable consequences of compliance by discussing an undesirable kernel state (''skin cancer'') that will be avoided. By comparison, ''If you have regular skin exams, you will increase your chances of having healthy skin'' is an appeal describing a desirable kernel state (''healthy skin'') that will be attained by compliance. A gain-framed appeal thus could be phrased entirely in terms of avoided undesirable outcomes (''heart disease,'' ''skin cancer,'' ''premature death,'' etc.) and a loss-framed appeal could be phrased entirely in terms of foregone desirable outcomes (''healthy heart,'' ''attractive skin,'' ''long life,'' etc.)-and hence to sort out these possible evaluative confoundings, examination of this moderator seemed warranted."

      "text": "We included a study if it met three criteria. First, the study had to compare gain-and loss-framed persuasive messages. A gain-framed message emphasizes the desirable consequences of compliance with the advocated view; a loss-framed message emphasizes the undesirable consequences of noncompliance. Excluded by this criterion were studies with imperfect realizations of this message contrast, such as studies that compared one framing form with unframed information  (Abood, Coster, Mullis, & Black, 2002; Kalichman & Coley, 1995) . Second, the messages had to advocate disease detection behaviors (breast cancer detection behaviors such as mammography and breast self-examination [BSE], skin cancer detection behaviors such as skin examinations, etc.). We excluded studies in which the messages advocated other behaviors, such as disease prevention behaviors (e.g., Block, 1993, sun exposure condition) or behaviors unrelated to health (e.g.,  Thorsteinson & Highhouse, 2003) . As noted by  Salovey and Wegener (2003, p. 61) , some health-related behaviors, such as Pap tests and colonoscopies, might plausibly be described as either (or both) a disease-detection behavior or a disease-prevention behavior; in the interest of focusing on clear-cut studies of disease detection behaviors, studies of such ''dualfunction'' behaviors were excluded  (Miles, Brotherstone, Robb, Atkin, & Wardle, 2005; Mullins, 2005; Rivers, Salovey, Pizarro, Pizzaro, & Schneider, 2005; Wilkin, 2004) . Following similar reasoning, we excluded studies in which a message advocated both detection behaviors and prevention behaviors  (Block & Keller, 1995, Study 1)  and studies in which the disease condition to be detected was not the audience's  (Nan, 2007a, other target condition; Nan, 2007c; Roberto, Goodall, West, & Mahan, in press) .\n\nThird, appropriate quantitative data relevant to persuasive effects (e.g., attitude change, intention, or behavior) had to be available; where it was not provided in the report, we made efforts to obtain information from authors. Excluded by this criterion were studies of effects on other outcome variables and studies for which appropriate quantitative information could not be obtained  (e.g., Brunton, 2007; Miller et al., 1999; Salmon, Loken, & Finnegan, 1985; Steffen, Sternberg, Teegarden, & Shepherd, 1994; Trotto, 2001; Umphrey, 2001) ."

Wherever possible, multiple-factor designs were analyzed by reconstituting the analysis such that individual-difference factors (but not, e.g., other experimental manipulations) were put back into the error term (following the suggestion of  Johnson, 1989, p. 16 )."

      "text": "The unit of analysis was the message pair, that is, the pair composed of a gainframed message and its loss-framed counterpart. We recorded an effect size for each distinguishable message pair found in the body of studies. Most message pairs were used only in a single investigation, so only one effect size estimate was associated with the pair. However in three instances, message pairs were used in more than one study, with the result that several effect size estimates could be associated with a given message pair. These multiple estimates were averaged to yield a single summary estimate before inclusion in the analysis. Specifically, data from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 in  Keller, Lipkus, and Rimer (2003)  were combined and reported as  Keller et al. (2003) ; data from  Meyerowitz and Chaiken (1987)  and  Lalor (1990)  were combined and reported as  Meyerowitz and Chaiken (1987)  combined; and data from  Rothman, Martino, Bedell, Detweiler, and Salovey (1999) . Experiment 1 detection condition and  Sanchez (2006)  were combined and reported as Rothman letrolisus detection combined.\n\nWhenever a study included more than one message pair and reported data separately for each pair, each pair was treated as providing a separate effect size estimate (e.g.,  Ying, 2001) . Some studies included more than one message pair but did not report results in ways that permitted computing separate effect sizes for each pair  (Apanovitch, McCarthy, & Salovey, 2003; Schmitt, 2004; Williams, Clarke, & Borland, 2001) ; we computed a single effect size in such cases, with the consequence that this analysis underrepresents the amount of message-to-message effect variability in these data.\n\nIn some cases, the same primary data served as the basis for multiple reports (e.g., both a dissertation and a subsequent publication). When a given investigation was reported in more than one outlet, it was treated as a single study and analyzed accordingly. The same research was reported (in whole or in part) in:  Block (1993)  and  Block and Keller (1995, Study 2) , recorded under the former; Brenes (1998) and Brenes (1999), recorded under the latter; Cothran,  Schneider, and Salovey (1998)  and  Schneider et al. (2001) , recorded under the latter; Finney (2001) and  Finney and Iannotti (2002) , recorded under the former;  Lalor (1990)  and  Lalor and Hailey (1990) , with, as noted above, results recorded under  Meyerowitz and Chaiken (1987) combined; Nan (2006, Experiment 2)  and Nan (2007b, Experiment 2), recorded under the former; Shen (2005, Study 2, glaucoma exam), and  Shen and Dillard (2007, Study 2, glaucoma exam) , recorded under the former."

The addition of these new cases has revealed a statistically significant advantage for loss-framed appeals-but that advantage is quite small (a mean r of -.039). So on one hand, there is good evidence for some nonzero population effect, but on the other hand these results indicate that loss-framed appeals do not have some substantial advantage for encouraging disease detection behaviors. Indeed, the 95% CI around the mean effect indicates that a population value of -.08 is implausible. This must be counted a rather disappointing conclusion. Given the benefits of early recognition of disease conditions, identifying effective means of encouraging disease detection behaviors is an important task, and loss-framed appeals have appeared to offer a promising tool in this regard. But sufficient research evidence has accumulated to make it plain that the use of loss-framed rather than gainframed appeals will generally not make much difference to persuasive success in this enterprise. Those who have the responsibility of designing messages aimed at encouraging disease detection behaviors should not believe that choosing loss-framed appeals will substantially improve persuasiveness."

There is not as much evidence as one might like on this matter, but the research in hand gives no hint that variations in kernel-state phrasing will produce systematic differences in the relative persuasiveness of gain-framed and loss-framed appeals for disease detection behaviors."

So although these results recommend the use of loss-framed appeals for breast cancer detection messages, such appeals provide only a small persuasive advantage. 6  With respect to the advocacy of other specific disease detection behaviors, however, the evidence in hand is insufficient to recommend the use of loss-framed appeals. For no other kind of detection behavior (other than breast cancer detection) was a statistically significant difference observed. And not even across studies of all other detection behaviors combined (i.e., excluding studies of breast cancer detection) was there a significant difference, despite considerable statistical power."

    {
      "title": "The challenge of generalization",
      "text": "The present results may offer a useful object lesson concerning generalizations in communication research  (or, indeed, social-scientific research generally) . Given any individual study, it is always an open question just what generalizations it underwrites. Two aspects of generalization can be usefully distinguished: The scope of the effect (the cases to which it applies) and the size of the effect.\n\nThe scope of the effect One of the earliest investigations of gain-loss message framing effects was  Meyerowitz and Chaiken's (1987)  study of messages urging BSE, which reported a significant persuasive advantage for loss-framed appeals. This specific result might be used in the service of any number of different generalizations varying in scope.\n\nMost broadly,  Meyerowitz and Chaiken's (1987)  research has sometimes been interpreted as suggesting that loss-framed appeals are more effective than gain-framed appeals in general: ''Typically, loss frames are more persuasive than gain-frame messages  (Meyerowitz & Chaiken, 1987) ''  (Johnson, Maio, & Smith-McLallen, 2005, p. 640) . But several reviews of gain-loss framing effects have concluded that there is no such general effect (e.g.,  Rothman & Salovey, 1997) .\n\nA narrower scope is represented by the suggestion that loss-framed appeals are more effective than gain-framed appeals for disease detection behaviors (e.g.,  Salovey et al., 2002) . But the present results do not unambiguously underwrite such a conclusion. There is indeed a statistically significant overall effect favoring lossframed appeals-but that effect is not statistically significant for any specific kind of detection behavior other than breast cancer detection. Nor is the effect statistically significant across all other detection behaviors combined (i.e., excluding breast cancer detection behaviors), despite excellent statistical power. Thus, the overall significant effect might properly be described as carried by the effects obtained in breast-cancer detection studies specifically.\n\nSo, more narrowly still, Meyerowitz and Chaiken's (1987) findings might be interpreted as indicating that loss-framed appeals are more effective than gainframed appeals for breast cancer detection behaviors (only). Restricting the scope of the generalization in this way would naturally encourage attempts to account for the difference (between the effect for breast cancer detection studies and the effects for other particular detection behaviors) by identifying what is distinctive about breast cancer detection behaviors, or about the gain-loss messages used in these breast cancer detection studies, or about some other potentially differentiating factor. But these impulses would be mistaken. The advantage of loss-framed appeals is statistically significant for breast cancer detection but not for other behaviors-but this does not mean that the effect for breast cancer detection is significantly different from the effects for other behaviors. In fact, the breast cancer detection behavior effect is not significantly different from the effects for skin cancer detection behaviors (p = .72), behaviors to detect other cancers (p = .54), dental problem detection behaviors (p = .96), or miscellaneous detection behaviors (p = .21). Indeed, the effect for breast cancer detection behavior is not significantly different from the effect for all other detection behaviors combined (p = .41).\n\nSo perhaps the most appropriate conclusion-with respect to the scope of the effect-might be this: There is some very small nonzero overall population effect (as indicated by the dependably nonzero overall effect observed here), with potentially some similarly small population effect for each specific detection behavior. Examination of the confidence intervals in Table  2  reveals that these results are consistent with a belief that, for example, the population effect is -.02 both overall and for each specific kind of detection behavior; that is, a value of -.02 falls within the 95% CI both for all detection cases and for each of the specific behaviors broken out here. The sample effect emerges as dependable (statistically significant) only in the case of breast cancer detection behaviors, for which there is a relatively large number of studies, but the effect for breast cancer detection behaviors is not significantly different from that for other specific detection behaviors. Thus, both the overall population effect and each behavior-specific population effect might well be some very small (but nonzero) value.\n\nThere is one other potential scope condition worth considering, however. Given that Meyerowitz and Chaiken's (1987) participants were female (as were the participants in other breast-cancer detection studies), one might suspect that on disease detection topics, loss-framed appeals are more persuasive than gain-framed appeals for females but not for males. To explore this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between a study's effect size and the proportion of female participants in that study (see Table  1 ). The generalization under discussion implies that as the proportion of female participants increases, so should the observed advantage of lossframed appeals. Thus, the correlation between proportion-of-female-participants and effect size is expected to be significantly negative; that is, larger proportions of female participants should be dependably associated with increasingly negative effect sizes (which indicate greater persuasive advantage to loss-framed appeals). Among the 36 cases concerning detection behaviors other than breast cancer detection, 15 did not provide information about the proportion of female participants. Across the remaining 21 studies (where the proportion-of-female participants ranged from .00 to 1.00), proportion-of-female-participants and effect size were not significantly related, r(19) = .039, p = .87. 7 Thus, there is little evidence that males and females are differentially susceptible to gain-and loss-framed appeals concerning disease detection behaviors.\n\nIn sum, concerning the scope of the effect, the evidence in hand is consistent with a belief that loss-framed appeals may have some very small persuasive advantage over gain-framed appeals for encouraging disease detection behaviors (both in general and for any specific sort of detection behavior). But because the various observed effects are so tightly clustered (and hence not significantly different from each other) and so small (and hence often not statistically significant), the scope of the effect cannot be identified confidently.\n\nThe size of the effect  Ioannidis (2005)  has observed that in clinical medical research, it is not uncommon for initial studies of an intervention to report relatively strong effects but for subsequent research to yield smaller effects (for a similar conclusion about marketing research, see  Hubbard & Armstrong, 1994) . This pattern seems apparent here:  Meyerowitz and Chaiken's (1987)  early research produced an effect noticeably more powerful than many of those in later studies. 8  There is an obvious moral to be drawn about the prudent interpretation of isolated research results. The need for replication of social-scientific research findings has been emphasized for quite some time  (e.g., Hunter, 2001; Smith, 1970) . But the research community should be interested in replications not only for whether they reproduce the direction of a previously observed effect, but also for the extent to which they reproduce the size of that effect.\n\nIn considering generalizations about effect size from isolated results, it will surely be useful to attend closely to sample size, as this affects the width of the confidence interval (i.e., the range of plausible population values). Where a small-sample study yields a large effect size-one sufficiently large to be statistically significant-the inevitably wide confidence interval will indicate some caution about the possible size of the population effect.\n\nNotably, the four studies reporting a relatively large advantage for loss-framed appeals (r \u2264-.30) averaged fewer than 50 participants: D. Cox and Cox (2001 anecdotal; n = 55), Hsiao (2002 testing-prevention; n = 46), Kwan (1996; n = 33), and  Rothman et al. (1999 Experiment 2 detection; n = 60) . By comparison, the mean sample size in the other 49 studies reviewed here was 183; the median was 119. That is to say, where large effects have been reported, they have commonly been obtained with relatively small samples. Larger-sample studies tended to produce smaller effects.\n\nPlainly, large effects in small-sample studies, even if statistically significant, are invitations to misunderstandings. Attending to confidence intervals might minimize misinterpretations of small-sample effects because the wide CIs attendant to such results will indicate the considerable uncertainty about the location of the population effect."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "When a research study yields statistically significant findings that promise some consequential practical application, there is an understandable eagerness to generalize the obtained results. Against the backdrop of  Meyerowitz and Chaiken's (1987)  early research finding, there has been no dearth of assertions that loss-framed messages are more persuasive than are gain-framed messages for encouraging disease detection behaviors. And although there is indeed a statistically significant difference in persuasiveness between gain-and loss-framed messages advocating disease detection behaviors, the difference is remarkably small-and apparently largely attributable to studies of messages aimed at encouraging breast cancer detection behaviors. It now seems clear that in advocacy of disease detection behaviors, the use of loss-framed rather than gain-framed appeals will not dramatically improve persuasiveness.\n\nattitudes are in general more easily changed than are behaviors, this does not mean that the difference in persuasiveness between one message form and another will vary between these outcomes. Notably, Witte and Allen's (2000) meta-analytic review of fear appeal research reported that the mean effects of variations in depicted threat severity (high vs. low depicted severity) were statistically indistinguishable for attitudinal (mean r = .15), intentional (mean r = .14), and behavioral (mean r = .13) outcomes. That is, conclusions about the relative persuasiveness of high-versus low-depicted-severity messages were identical regardless of whether attitude, intention, or behavior was the outcome variable. Witte and Allen reported a similar pattern of effects for variations in depicted threat susceptibility (mean rs of .12, .17, and .14, respectively), variations in depicted response efficacy (mean rs of .14, .17, and .13), and variations in depicted self-efficacy (mean rs of .12, .17, and .13). These results, albeit limited, suggest that when one's research question concerns the relative persuasiveness of two message forms (as in the present enterprise), one's conclusions may not be much affected by whether the persuasive outcome assessed is attitude, intention, or behavior-and hence effect sizes are appropriately combined across these indicators. 2 Because the unit of analysis was the message pair, multiple effect size estimates were obtained from a given study when the research design contained more than one message pair (e.g.,  Chang, 2007) . In every case save one, the obtained effect sizes were based on different human samples and thus were statistically independent. The exception arises from  Nan (2006) , whose design contained two gain-framed appeals and two loss-framed appeals; this provided a total of four message pairs and hence four effect sizes, but some of these effect sizes had some participants in common. If one replaces those four estimates with the appropriate composite effect size that ensures complete statistical independence (r = .143, N = 135), the results (with k = 50, N = 9, 010) are substantively unchanged: Mean r = -.044, 95% CI limits of -.077 and -.010 (p = .01); Q(49) = 97.7, p < .001. 3 The 18 cases coded as ''miscellaneous'' detection topics were a varied lot, precluding any useful further breakdown of these cases. Five concerned a hepatitis C test, but four of these were derived from  Nan's (2006)  design with overlapping participants, which recommended against separate examination of results for this topic; three concerned fictional (hypothetical) diseases; two each concerned diabetes testing, cholesterol screening, and cardiovascular disease testing; one each concerned screening for Chlamydia, glaucoma, HIV, and hypertension. 4 Throughout this report, power figures are those for detecting a population effect size of r = .10, assuming large heterogeneity, with a random-effects analysis, .05 alpha, and a two-tailed test  (Hedges & Pigott, 2001) . 5 These studies varied in the specific sort of breast cancer detection behavior being advocated, but there was no dependable difference (in observed gain-loss framing persuasiveness differences) between messages that advocated mammography and messages that advocated breast self-examination (BSE). Of the 17 breast cancer detection studies, 10 concerned mammography (N = 1,986, mean r = -.041, 95% CI limits of -.086 and .005 [p = .08], power = .88; Q(9) = 9.2, p = .42); five concerned BSE (N = 354, mean r = -.116, 95% CI limits of -.292 and .068 [p = .22], power = .26; Q(4) = 11.2, p = .02); and two advocated a variety of breast cancer detection behaviors (mammography, BSE, and clinical breast examination; N = 396, mean r = -.075, 95% CI limits of -.172 and .024 [p = .14], power = .29; Q(1) = .29, p = .59).
