  "title": "Trends in Effectiveness of Organizational eHealth Interventions in Addressing Employee Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Mental health conditions are considered the leading cause of disability, sickness absence, and long-term work incapacity. eHealth interventions provide employees with access to psychological assistance. There has been widespread implementation and provision of eHealth interventions in the workplace as an inexpensive and anonymous way of addressing common mental disorders. Objective: This updated review aimed to synthesize the literature on the efficacy of eHealth interventions for anxiety, depression, and stress outcomes in employee samples in organizational settings and evaluate whether their effectiveness has improved over time. Methods: Systematic searches of relevant articles published from 2004 to July 2020 of eHealth intervention trials (app-or web-based) focusing on the mental health of employees were conducted. The quality and bias of all studies were assessed. We extracted means and SDs from publications by comparing the differences in effect sizes (Hedge g) in standardized mental health outcomes. We meta-analyzed these data using a random-effects model. \n Results: We identified a tripling of the body of evidence, with 75 trials available for meta-analysis from a combined sample of 14,747 articles. eHealth interventions showed small positive effects for anxiety (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.39; P<.001), depression (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.34; P<.001), and stress (Hedges g=0.25, 95% CI 0.17-0.34; P<.001) in employees' after intervention, with similar effects seen at the medium-term follow-up. However, there was evidence of no increase in the effectiveness of these interventions over the past decade. \n Conclusions: This review and meta-analysis confirmed that eHealth interventions have a small positive impact on reducing mental health symptoms in employees. Disappointingly, we found no evidence that, despite the advances in technology and the enormous resources in time, research, and finance devoted to this area for over a decade, better interventions are being produced. Hopefully, these small effect sizes do not represent optimum outcomes in organizational settings.",

      "text": "Mental health conditions are to be considered the leading cause of disability, sick leave, and long-term work incapacity in most developed countries  [1] . Furthermore, poor mental health has a substantial impact on employee well-being, productivity, absenteeism, compensation claims, and social welfare systems  [2, 3] . Evidence supports the increased demand for workplace interventions, highlighting that working conditions and the workplace environment can influence employees' mental health and well-being  [4] .\n\nThe nature of mental health symptoms fluctuates on a continuum between thriving and struggling  [5] . Most mental ill health that is seen in the workforce is because of common mental disorders, most notably, depression, anxiety, and stress-related conditions  [1, 6, 7] . Employees who have a mental health condition and become too unwell to continue working rarely move straight from being healthy to needing sick leave  [8] . There is usually a course that an employee might experience as they develop worsening symptoms  [9] , and different interventions may be required at different stages of this course.\n\nInternational approaches suggest multilevel organizational approaches targeting (1) healthy workers via universal prevention interventions;  (2)  those with subclinical conditions (symptomatic or at-risk workers), such as those experiencing high stress via indicated interventions; and (3) those workers who have disclosed a mental health condition with tertiary interventions (treatments)  [8] . Furthermore, the UK Thriving at Work Review into Mental Health at Work recommends the inclusion of the use of therapeutically tailored interventions based on individual-specific needs  [5] .\n\nThe 2 potential rate-limiting steps for organizations in implementing mental health intervention programs are the budget and logistics of delivering universal interventions to all staff at scale and the ability to target indicated and early interventions to those who are at risk or unwell before disclosure. The internet offers a unique opportunity to address these rate-limiting steps by delivering eHealth interventions with components such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and stress management to a broad audience. eHealth interventions provide employees with access to psychological help when they are not employed in a typical working environment, such as shift workers or those working from home, or when they may be sick-listed from work. As a result, eHealth interventions have been widely implemented and provided. eHealth is an emerging field in public health and business and provides health services and information delivered or enhanced through the internet and related technologies, such as smartphone apps. Recently, eHealth has been seen as a popular approach in organizations as it provides an inexpensive and anonymous way of addressing common mental disorders  [10] , including apps linked to wearable devices, and guided meditation programs  [11] .\n\nThere is a plethora of evidence for the short-and long-term benefits of eHealth-delivered CBT for treating anxiety and depressive conditions in both the general population and clinical settings  [12] [13] [14] [15] . Evidence has also emerged for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based eHealth interventions in improving symptoms for both the general population and individuals who are symptomatic  [16] .\n\nHowever, we know that employed individuals differ systemically from both general and clinical populations used in most eHealth studies; for instance, employees have much better mental health (fewer symptoms) than general and clinical populations  [17] , for whom many eHealth interventions and their content have been developed. As such, there are likely to be floor effects and other efficacy modifiers. The delivery in, and by, organizations will be different from just open access to interventions in the general population. This influences uptake and engagement, which are known determinants of digital health efficacy  [18] .\n\nA previous meta-analysis considering eHealth interventions from 2004 (first identified) to 2017  [19]  found randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for only 23 eHealth interventions delivered to employees. Overall, there was a small pooled effect of reducing depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms after the intervention (Hedges g=0. 24) , which was sustained at follow-up  (Hedges g=0.23) . Similar effect sizes (ESs) were found in a contemporaneous review  [20] . Only 2 years later, a meta-analysis  [21]  identified 50% (n=34) more studies of such interventions and suggested stronger effects on stress  (Hedges g=0.54) , insomnia (Hedges g=0.70), and burnout (Hedges g=0.51) but not symptoms of depression or anxiety.\n\nNone of the previous reviews have addressed the key issue of efficacy, which is affected by the digital placebo effect. Smartphone app users can experience significantly reduced mental health symptoms, even if the app does not contain any direct therapeutic intervention, similar to the placebo effect seen in pharmaceutical trials when using \"active\" or \"attention\" controls  [22] , or may reflect regression to the mean of fluctuating symptoms. Even simply tracking the symptoms of depression in an app can lead to significant reductions in depression  [23] . Both processes result in an apparent \"intra-group\" effect without any therapeutic intervention. In a trial, the type of control used is a primary determinant of the \"between-group\" ES. In a recent systematic review of smartphone apps for anxiety in clinical samples, the between-group ESs were lower in trials that used active controls than in those that used passive controls  [24] . This inflates the apparent efficacy of the interventions evaluated in trials with passive controls, such as the wait-list. It is not known whether and to what extent this is observed in working populations or for more preventive approaches.\n\nConsidering the increasing number of interventions being developed, implemented, and potentially evaluated, this review aimed to address the following questions by systematically reviewing the current state of evidence for the efficacy of eHealth interventions in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress in employees (Textbox 1)."

      "text": "The summary ES was the SMD (calculated as Hedge g, with 95% CI) between the intervention and control groups for each outcome measure (anxiety, depression, and stress)  [28] . A positive ES (SMD) indicated that the intervention was more efficacious than the control. The level of significance was set at P<.05 and 95% CIs. The magnitude of the effect was categorized as large (SMD>0.8), moderate (SMD 0.5-0.8), small (SMD 0.2 to <0.5), or trivial (SMD<0.2)  [29] . Pooling of ESs across studies was performed using a random-effects model in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Biostat Inc; version 3). We detected and accommodated outliers in the meta-analysis using the random-effects variance shift model and the likelihood ratio test. As the different types of eHealth interventions and approaches used may result in large heterogeneity  [30] , between-study heterogeneity was quantified using \u03c4 2 (variance of true effects) and further assessed using the Higgins I 2 statistic, which estimates the proportion of observed variance not because of sampling error. An I 2 value of 75% was considered large, 50% was considered moderate, and 25% was considered low  [31] .\n\nWe estimated the results separately for each mental health outcome measure (anxiety, depression, and stress) at the postintervention and first follow-up time points. Meta-regressions were performed for each mental health outcome to identify whether the intervention approach (eg, universal), type of intervention (eg, CBT), type of control (eg, wait-list), or intervention delivery method (web-based vs smartphone) moderated the observed effect.\n\nTo evaluate differences in effectiveness over time, we used only within-group ESs from the intervention arms for anxiety, depression, or stress outcomes. ESs were calculated by dividing the difference between pre-and posttreatment means by the pooled SD of the difference  [32] . ANOVA was used to assess whether there were any differences between the mean ESs for each year. For a test for trends, the within-group ESs with positive signs indicated improvement, and negative signs indicated worsening. This method allowed for the difference in effects over time to be accurately calculated, allowing us to explore whether interventions improved with technology.\n\nTo assess small study effects (in cases where at least 10 studies were available for analysis), we used a funnel plot for the overall effects and each subgroup analysis, which compared the outcome effects with their SEs. We used the Egger regression test to examine further asymmetry of the funnel plot  [33]  with statistical significance based on P<.10. In cases where at least 10 studies were available and a small study effect was found, we used a Duval and Tweedie trim and fill analysis to quantify the magnitude of the small study effect  [34] ."

Of these 3040 articles, 2893 (95.16%) articles were excluded based on the eligibility criteria, leaving 147 (4.84%) articles that were potentially relevant to the research question. Their full texts were examined by 2 independent researchers (ES and MA), and discrepancies were decided by the senior author (NG).

Of the 73 studies, 4 (5%) articles reported on the same study at different follow-up time points and were merged  [42] [43] [44] [45] , leaving 68 (93%) studies, of which 2 (3%) were excluded as they used face-to-face treatment for control groups  [46, 47] .

Most of the bias was observed in deviations from the intended interventions and missing outcome data, which is not uncommon and is an area for improvement in the eHealth field. An important aspect common to behavioral interventions is that 55% (41/75) of the studies were rated as having a high risk of bias because of the use of a wait-list control group. As such, it was impossible for users to remain blinded (Multimedia Appendix 3  [36] [37] [38] [39] [42] [43] [44] [45] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] ).\n\nAll the included trials used web-based self-report measures to collect the baseline and follow-up data.

The mean within-group ES reported in each year of the eHealth intervention arms in trials published since 2004 remained unchanged, with no significant SMD observed over time for anxiety (F 1,9 =0.28; P=.61), depression (F 1,10 =0.31; P=.59), or stress (F 1,11 =0.75l; P=.41; Figure  5 ).

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "This updated review aimed to synthesize the burgeoning literature on the efficacy of eHealth interventions for anxiety, depression, and stress outcomes in organizational settings and employee samples. We identified 52 new trial interventions published since the 23 identified in our prior review in 2017  [19] , a tripling of the body of evidence. The systematic search identified 75 relevant trials for the meta-analysis, delivering eHealth interventions either on the web or via a smartphone, with a combined sample of 14,747 employees. eHealth interventions reduced mental health symptoms immediately after use, with small positive effects observed in anxiety (Hedges g=0.26), depression (Hedges g=0.26), and stress  (Hedges g=0.25) , and data from trials with longer follow-up periods showed similar effects. These results are comparable with those of previous reviews, where small overall effects were found at the postintervention and follow-up time points  [19, 20] . These results imply that since 2017, the efficacy of eHealth interventions compared with control conditions reported in trials has remained unchanged, suggesting that the effectiveness of eHealth interventions does not seem to be improving over time. An analysis of the within-group effect observed in the intervention arms confirmed that since 2004, there has been no apparent systematic improvement in the effectiveness of these interventions. This is a surprising finding, given the enormous literature on methods to improve engagement with such interventions, greater penetration of technology to populations that do not access health care, and the increasing number of interventions delivered as apps, which reportedly improve access. All of these are commonly cited as factors favoring eHealth as a mode of intervention delivery or improving effectiveness.\n\nThe small but significant effect at follow-up suggests that eHealth interventions might have sustained positive effects on mental health. However, only half of the studies assessed follow-up outcomes, which may reflect a reporting bias. Supporting this, null, and in some cases, even negative, effects on mental health were observed in 27% (20/75) of the studies, and a greater proportion-60% (45/75)-did not report follow-up outcomes.\n\nLess than one-fifth of all the trials used active controls. However, we found no significant differences in the efficacy of interventions tested against active versus passive controls overall or for any individual mental health outcome (Table  2 ). These findings do not confirm the digital placebo effect, which has been found in other eHealth reviews in clinical populations, where the ESs were lower in trials that used active controls than in those that used passive controls  [24] . Given that most (47/75, 63%) of these trials were not conducted in clinically unwell populations but were delivered universally to employees, this contrary finding may have implications for the types of control recommended for different settings of eHealth trials and for future framework analysis or guidelines. The primary moderator of efficacy appeared to be the content of the intervention, with stress management and mindfulness-based interventions being seemingly more efficacious than CBT-based interventions. This suggests that CBT, which was adapted from its intended use in a more personalized and clinical setting, may have less useful content, especially for use in organizations with universal delivery, than other approaches adapted for more universal or indicated tools such as mindfulness and stress management.\n\nIn our previous review, stronger effects were seen in eHealth interventions that were supported  [19] , and other studies have found increased effects when eHealth interventions were supported by trained mental health professionals  [105] . The positive impacts of supported interventions may suggest that even in generally subclinical populations, a combination of eHealth and adjunctive support is the most effective in reducing mental health symptoms in employees.\n\nPrevious research has pointed to the importance of tailoring eHealth interventions to match individual user needs, as mental health symptoms differ from person to person [106]. However, this review did not support the notion that the tailoring of interventions provides any benefit to improving mental health. The limited evidence available suggests no greater efficacy when using tailored interventions than when using interventions delivered universally or for indicated or even unwell samples. In fact, 43% (3/7) of the tailored interventions showed potential for harm in at least one mental health outcome."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study had some limitations. Significant heterogeneity was detected; however, this is not uncommon in this field or in meta-analytic research  [24] . Differences across studies should be considered when interpreting these findings. It must also be acknowledged that some of the follow-up analyses were underpowered and that the findings should be interpreted tentatively. Furthermore, this review did not include any gray literature, and some authors did not provide data. Finally, the individual study pooled data calculated using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis by Biostat Inc are not presented in this manuscript. Instead, we report the raw data of the pre-post means, SDs, and sample sizes in Table  1 ."

      "title": "Future Directions",
      "text": "As we were unable to detect that eHealth interventions are improving over time, to design effective eHealth interventions, a better understanding of the factors that may influence efficacy is required. This study did not consider engagement and adherence and only considered a small number of potential moderating factors for each intervention. A subsequent framework analysis model is being undertaken to establish the potential beneficial or harmful features of the different types of interventions. This is an important future direction and requires further in-depth analysis as eHealth interventions have the potential to offer a range of novel self-management tools for employees with clinical and subclinical mental health conditions.\n\nAnother recommendation is to develop a standard framework for eHealth interventions to best understand the features that have therapeutic benefits and those that may potentially cause harm. This will guide developers to ensure that eHealth interventions are designed in the most effective manner. A framework may address the significant heterogeneity within studies; if the development standards are regulated against this framework, the differences in the features of the interventions and how they are delivered may be reduced. This research suggests that those evaluating interventions or designing protocols should carefully consider the level of support provided when interpreting reported ESs."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "This review and meta-analysis confirms that eHealth interventions have a small but positive impact overall on reducing mental health symptoms in employees. There was significant heterogeneity between trials; however, overall, stress management and mindfulness interventions comprising in-person support appeared to be the most effective.\n\nOrganizations should carefully consider the interventions delivered within the workplace; otherwise, they may not see long-term value in their return on investments. A substantial minority of intervention trials have demonstrated no efficacy, and a few may even be harmful. There is not enough evidence to make recommendations for the preferential use or development of therapeutically tailored interventions. Disappointingly, we found no evidence that despite the advancements in technology and the enormous resources in time, research, and finance devoted to this area for over a decade, better interventions are being produced. Hopefully, these small ESs do not represent the optimum outcome in organizational settings, and stakeholders and researchers should focus on improving effectiveness and efficacy or comparing and understanding the effects of current interventions. Despite the small effectiveness, this level of reduction could result in a large economic value in an organizational setting."
