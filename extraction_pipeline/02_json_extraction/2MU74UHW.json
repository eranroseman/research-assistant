  "title": "Vitamin D status and functional health outcomes in children aged 2-8 y: a 6-mo vitamin D randomized controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Most Canadian children do not meet the recommended dietary intake for vitamin D. Objectives: The aims were to test how much vitamin D from food is needed to maintain a healthy serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D 3 ] status from fall to spring in young children and to examine musculoskeletal outcomes. Design: Healthy children aged 2-8 y (n = 51) living in Montreal, Canada, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary vitamin D groups (control or intervention to reach 400 IU/d by using vitamin Dfortified foods) for 6 mo, starting October 2014. At baseline and at 3 and 6 mo, anthropometric characteristics, vitamin D metabolites (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), and bone biomarkers (IDS-iSYS, Immunodiagnositc Systems; Liaison; Diasorin) were measured and physical activity and food intakes surveyed. At baseline and at 6 mo, bone outcomes and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured. Cross-sectional images of distal tibia geometry and muscle density were conducted with the use of peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans at 6 mo. Results: At baseline, participants were aged 5.2 \u00b1 1.9 (mean \u00b1 SD) y and had a body mass index z score of 0.65 \u00b1 0.12; 53% of participants were boys. There were no differences between groups in baseline serum 25(OH)D 3 (66.4 \u00b1 13.6 nmol/L) or vitamin D intake (225 \u00b1 74 IU/d). Median (IQR) compliance was 96% (89-99%) for yogurt and 84% (71-97%) for cheese. At 3 mo, serum 25(OH)D 3 was higher in the intervention group (P < 0.05) but was not different between groups by 6 mo. Although lean mass accretion was higher in the intervention group (P < 0.05), no differences in muscle density or bone outcomes were observed. Conclusions: The consumption of 400 IU vitamin D/d from fall to spring did not maintain serum 25(OH)D 3 concentration or improve bone outcomes. Further work with lean mass accretion as the primary outcome is needed to confirm if vitamin D enhances lean accretion in healthy young children. This trial was registered at  www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02387892.",

      "text": "Vitamin D is important for bone growth and development in children  (1)  and cannot be synthesized from exposure of skin to sunlight at latitudes \u226540\u00b0N year-round because solar UV-B radiation is limited in winter months  (2) . Clinically, vitamin D status is assessed by using serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, a composite reflection of total intake and synthesis. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for vitamin D intake were set to meet the needs of the general population in the absence of UV-B exposure. The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; 400 IU/d) and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA; 600 IU/d) align with serum 25(OH)D concentrations of 40 and 50 nmol/L, respectively  (3) . Given these recommendations, Canadian children, with an average intake of 244 IU vitamin D/d, appear to be at risk of not meeting population targets for vitamin D status  (4) .\n\nThe IOM vitamin D recommendations for young children were based on results from supplementation trials in adults and older children  (3) . Since that time, vitamin D interventions in young children have been trialed during the winter months  (5) (6) (7) (8) , and results from 3 of these interventions  (5, 7, 8)  suggest that the vitamin D EAR may be overestimated for young children. Furthermore, only 1 study  (8)  had mean 25(OH)D concentrations equivalent to those observed in national surveillance studies conducted in Canada and the United States (children aged 3-11 y: 64-74 nmol/L)  (9, 10) . Thus, it remains questionable how much vitamin D is required to maintain healthy vitamin D status during seasonal UV-B-void periods. In addition, although there is a well-known positive impact of vitamin D on bone health in adults  (3) , trial data in young children are limited  (11, 12)  and it is possible that vitamin D interventions may only affect bone outcomes when baseline 25(OH)D concentrations are <35 nmol/L  (13) . Data from children in Montreal (aged 2-5 y) showed that vitamin D status \u226575 nmol/L was positively related to bone mineral density (BMD) of the whole body and radius  (14)  and was also related to a leaner body phenotype  (15) . This agrees with a 1-y trial in vitamin D-deficient prepubertal girls, in whom lean mass accretion was greater in those receiving a vitamin D supplement  (16) . Thus, the primary objective was to test how much vitamin D intake from food is required to maintain healthy vitamin D status from the beginning of the UV-B-void period (end of October) to the end of the winter period (March). It was hypothesized that intakes of 400 IU/d, but not 200 IU/d, would support serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D 3 ] concentrations of \u226550 nmol/L. The secondary objective was to explore the effects on lean mass, bone mineral accrual, bone geometry, and biomarkers of bone mass and mineral metabolism. Lean mass was not originally specified as a secondary outcome; however, it was added as an outcome due to recent work in Montreal children, which showed a relation of vitamin D status to lean mass  (15) ."

Children were randomly allocated by family in a 1:1 design and stratified by families with only young (aged 2-4 y) or only school-age (aged 5-8 y) children or families with both ages of children to double-blinded groups (Figure  1 ) by using random-numbers tables. Group codes were randomly assigned by a member of the research team with no direct contact with the participants. In addition to their regular food intake, the control group was instructed to consume 33 g cheddar cheese/d or two 93-mL drinkable yogurts/d, neither with added vitamin D (expected vitamin D intake: 140-195 IU/d). To reach the 400 IU/d, the intervention group consumed the same yogurt and cheese products, except with added vitamin D 3 . The cheese contained 300 IU vitamin D 3 /33 g and yogurt beverages contained 150 IU/93 mL. Children could consume the products at any time during the day so that the products would be incorporated into their normal eating habits. The products were provided precoded by the companies, with codes only disclosed after all of the data were analyzed. The vitamin D content of each product was independently verified to be within \u00b18% (Maxxam Analytique, Inc.) for the yogurt and within \u00b15% (O'Neal Scientific Services, Inc.) for the cheese. Families were instructed to otherwise follow their normal lifestyle. Children were seen at baseline and at 3 and 6 mo, at which time anthropometric measures were taken, fasting blood samples were obtained, and surveys were completed on demographic characteristics, illnesses, sun exposure, physical activity, and dietary intake. At baseline and at 6 mo, body composition and bone geometry measures were taken."

Although 3 d of 24-h intake assessments may be sufficient to measure energy and macronutrient intakes, to represent usual intakes of calcium and vitamin D, a longer time period of assessment is needed  (21) . Thus, the 30-d food-frequency questionnaire was used to measure the intakes of these micronutrients.

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry states that whole body and lumbar spine are the preferred dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement sites  (24) . In addition, forearm scans were performed because the forearm is the most common fracture site in children  (25) . For bone outcomes, DXA measures of whole body, lumbar vertebrae 1-4 (anterior-posterior), and distal forearm (nondominant) were made. Ultra-distal forearm data were reported because this region measures new bone close to the growth plate. Wholebody scans were used to assess lean mass. All of the scans were performed by using a Hologic 4500A (APEX software, version 13.3:3) fan-beam clinical densitometer at baseline and at 6 mo. Daily quality-control measurements were obtained by using a lumbar spine bone phantom (Hologic) with an accuracy of \u00b11.5% of the mean and CVs of 0.396%, 0.524%, 0.363% for BMD, bone mineral content (BMC), and area, respectively. As per the manufacturer's recommendations, global SDs for the low-air and highair measures of radiographic uniformity were always <2.0.\n\nPeripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT; XCT-2000; Stratec) scans of the nondominant tibia were performed by X-ray technicians at 6 mo to evaluate 3-dimensional bone geometry and muscle variables. There are no standard pQCT methods for children  (26) , so our methods were based on those used when producing normative data in children  (27) . Length of the tibia was measured between the superior margin of the medial condyle and the medial malleolus. A scout scan was performed to visualize the distal growth plate and the reference line placed at the most proximal line of the growth plate. The 4% and 66% sites, measured proximally from the distal end of the tibia, were each scanned with a single 2-mm slice, a voxel size of 0.4 mm 2 , and speed of 30 mm/s."

A mixed-model ANOVA was used to analyze continuous data, accounting for fixed effects (group, sex, and age) and random effects (e.g., within family, demographic characteristics, body composition), with post hoc testing where necessary by using Bonferroni correction. Non-normal data were log-transformed where applicable [e.g., 25(OH)D 3 ]. The drop-out rate was <5% during the study period, so data imputation approaches were not sought.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The IOM recommendations for vitamin D were set on the basis of evidence from adolescents and adults (3), highlighting the need for randomized controlled trials in young children. To address this gap, the present study suggests that 400 IU vitamin D/d maintains serum 25(OH)D \u226540 nmol/L in 100%, \u226550 nmol/L in 85%, and \u226575 nmol/L in 8% of young children during UV-B-void periods in Canada. Despite interim benefits at 3 mo, the intervention did not maintain vitamin D status over 6 mo compared with the control group. It is possible that if we had used greater amounts of vitamin D that the intervention group would have had a higher status; however, that was not suitable for a fortified food-based trial because such foods would not realistically be approved for the Canadian food market (4). Within the secondary outcomes, greater lean mass accretion was observed in the intervention group and may imply that meeting 400 IU/d for vitamin D could be beneficial for physical development beyond bone health. Because this finding is hypothesis-generating, further work is needed to confirm if vitamin D has an effect on lean mass in healthy young children.\n\nThe intervention in this study was designed to achieve dietary intakes of 400 IU vitamin D/d, consistent with the EAR and below the RDA (600 IU/d). Although the intervention failed to support the hypothesized 25(OH)D 3 concentration of 75 nmol/L, it did maintain 25(OH)D 3 at >40 nmol/L in all participants with 85-88% of values \u226550 nmol/L, which is more similar to that anticipated when achieving the RDA. The baseline serum 25(OH)D 3 of \u223c70 nmol/L in our study is similar to national surveillance data (3-5 y: 74 nmol/L; 6-11 y: 67 nmol/L)  (9) . In contrast, trials in children aged 4-8 y in Denmark (  5 ) and aged 8-14 y in Pittsburgh  (6)  suggest that 780 and 1500 IU/d, respectively, are needed for 97.5% of children in winter to maintain  25    8 )]. In addition, the higher intakes needed among the Pittsburgh children may be due to overweight and obese status because the median BMI (kg/m 2 ; 20.6; IQR: 17.8-23.3) was in the 80-85th percentile  (17) , although the Danish and Montreal children had mean BMI z scores of 0.08 \u00b1 0.83 and 0.67 \u00b1 0.94, respectively. These points highlight that extrapolation of data from studies in which baseline 25(OH)D or BMI are not reflective of a general population needs careful consideration before applying them to dietary recommendations.\n\nMultiple pediatric trials have shown that adiposity is negatively associated with serum 25(OH)D  (30) (31) (32) . Vitamin D can be absorbed into fat cells instead of being quickly hydroxylated to 25(OH)D because serum 25(OH)D >15 nmol/L is associated with saturation of liver 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1)  (33) . It has previously been suggested that adipose tissue may have a negative relation with vitamin D status due to vitamin D sequestration  (34) . Our data show that fat mass did not significantly affect serum 25(OH)D 3 concentrations observed at 3 or 6 mo. This could be ascribed to the healthy body composition of the participants (by design) and the fact that we adjusted for age, because older children would have higher fat mass than those at the lower end of our age spectrum. However, because 25(OH)D 3 declined over the study and fat mass was relatively stable, it is possible that adipose stores of vitamin D were not sufficient or that needs for tissue expansion were increased, both of which are consistent with a significant decline in serum 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 after 3 mo and greater lean mass accretion in the intervention group. It has been shown that increased vitamin D intake could be taken up by multiple other body tissues  (35) , although little is known about vitamin D tissue distribution in children.\n\nEarly work on 25(OH)D tissue distribution  (36, 37)  showed that 25-66% was found in muscle tissue. A 2009 review  (33)  stated that, in an average woman, \u223c20% of 25(OH)D is in muscle tissue  (33) , suggesting that muscle consumes a significant proportion of 25(OH)D. Calcitriol is implicated in regulating the expression of transcription factors within the myocyte, which is important for muscle development  (38) , as well as increasing serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3)  (39)  and activation of calmodulin-dependent kinases  (40) . Increased IGFBP3 has been suggested to increase the half-life of insulin-like growth factor I, resulting in an increased concentration in circulation and an increase in downstream protein synthesis  (39) . Calmodulin-dependent kinases were shown to enhance vitamin D receptor-mediated transcription activity and thus may have a synergistic effect with vitamin D on vitamin D receptor-mediated transcription  (40) . The results of our trial support the hypothesis that a vitamin D intake of 400 IU/d may enhance lean mass accretion in healthy young children. Furthermore, although there was no absolute difference in leg lean mass accretion between groups, the biggest percentage of difference in lean mass accretion between groups was in the legs, similar to results in postmenopausal women  (41) . With physical activity in our trial not being related to lean mass, it is hypothesized that vitamin D interventions may have a larger effect on fast-twitch muscle fibers  (42) . Our results also agree with previous trials in Chinese girls (age 15 y)  (43)  and prepubertal Lebanese girls (aged 10-13 y)  (16) , which showed significant associations between lean mass and vitamin D intake. In the trial in Lebanese girls, when compared with the control group, supplementing with 200 IU vitamin D/d significantly increased lean mass accretion but not vitamin D status, suggesting that differences in vitamin D intake and not status led to changes in lean mass  (16) . However, a recent study  (15)  showed that if serum 25(OH)D was \u226575 nmol/L, vitamin D intakes >400 IU/d did not improve accretion. This underscores the importance of using the serum 25(OH)D concentration measurement when examining the interrelations with lean mass accretion.\n\nThe serum 25(OH)D concentration recommended by the IOM for bone health is 50-125 nmol/L (3). All DXA-based BMD z scores were within a healthy range, which agrees with a 2012 meta-analysis  (13)  showing that vitamin D supplementation in children with serum 25(OH)D >35 nmol/L did not affect hip or lumbar spine BMD. Interestingly, a 1-y trial in Finnish girls (n = 228; mean age: 11.4 \u00b1 0.4 y) showed that vitamin D supplementation elevated total hip BMD without significantly affecting serum 25(OH)D (baseline: 46.3 \u00b1 17.4 nmol/L)  (44) . This highlights that associations between BMD and vitamin D status need careful examination. With no differences between groups for bone accretion or density outcomes, it is not surprising that in our study we did not find between-group differences for bone biomarkers. Importantly, however, bone health biomarkers can rapidly respond to changes in nutritional status, because P1NP was shown to significantly increase over a time frame as short as 4 wk due to zinc supplementation  (45) . Thus, if we had seen significant between-group differences in bone accretion in our 6-mo trial, we would have expected significant increases in markers of bone formation.\n\nSignificant strengths of our study include a high compliance rate and a 6-mo UV-B-void period with study visits every 3 mo, which provided the ability to track seasonal changes in serum 25(OH)D. By assessing other vitamin D metabolites, we could see whether vitamin D intake related to the conversion of 25(OH)D 3 to 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 . A limitation of our trial was that few children started with 25(OH)D 3 \u226575 nmol/L, which meant that we were not able to test if this status could be maintained or affect functional outcomes. In addition, by focusing on the population target for vitamin D intake (400 IU/d) (3), we were not able to test if higher amounts would better support serum 25(OH)D 3 concentration or other functional outcomes. It is possible that either a longer time frame or a larger sample size would be needed to investigate functional outcomes, especially given the healthy vitamin D status throughout the study. However, as stated in our methods, DXA has an accuracy of \u00b11.5% and CVs for BMD and BMC were <0.55%. Thus, the 5-10% changes in BMC (shown in Table  3 ) and over 6 mo are large enough to be outside the range of instrumental error, meaning that 6 mo was long enough to measure change in BMC. Because pQCT scans were only performed at 6 mo, we were not able to look at changes in bone or muscle outcomes measured by pQCT. In addition, with scans at 4% and 66% sites of the lower leg, we were not able to assess bone outcomes at predominantly cortical sites. Furthermore, we did not look at whether muscle strength of the children was affected by vitamin D intake as has been shown previously  (43, 46) . Last, our sample of families may be more health conscious or health literate than average Canadians, because the majority of parents in our study were university educated and had family incomes at or above the national average.\n\nIn conclusion, 96% of all children maintained 25(OH)D 3 \u226540 nmol/L and 70% of the control group (\u223c200 IU vitamin D/d) maintained 25(OH)D 3 \u226550 nmol/L (set to align with bone health), whereas 85% of the intervention group (\u223c400 IU vitamin D/d) achieved this healthy target. By 6 mo, only 2 children achieved the 75-nmol/L target in the intervention group, because serum 25(OH)D 3 concentrations in both groups declined over the study, which shows that vitamin D stores are utilized during the UV-B-void period but not depleted. The increased vitamin D intake of the intervention group did not lead to improved bone health outcomes, but may explain the higher lean mass accretion in the intervention group than in the control group. Further longer-term studies with lean mass as the primary outcome are needed to confirm this hypothesis-generating finding. These results show a need for future vitamin D food fortification trials to examine the relations between vitamin D intake, serum 25(OH)D, and lean mass outcomes in children. Such trials will further inform dietary recommendations and food fortification policies."
