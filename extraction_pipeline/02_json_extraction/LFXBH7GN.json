  "title": "Effect of Lifestyle-Focused Text Messaging on Risk Factor Modification in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease prevention, including lifestyle modification, is important but underutilized. Mobile health strategies could address this gap but lack evidence of therapeutic benefit. OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of a lifestyle-focused semipersonalized support program delivered by mobile phone text message on cardiovascular risk factors. \n DESIGN AND SETTING The Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (TEXT ME) trial was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial that recruited 710 patients (mean age, 58 [SD, 9.2] years; 82% men; 53% current smokers) with proven coronary heart disease (prior myocardial infarction or proven angiographically) between September 2011 and November 2013 from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. INTERVENTIONS Patients in the intervention group (n = 352) received 4 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care. Text messages provided advice, motivational reminders, and support to change lifestyle behaviors. Patients in the control group (n=358) received usual care. Messages for each participant were selected from a bank of messages according to baseline characteristics (eg, smoking) and delivered via an automated computerized message management system. The program was not interactive. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at 6 months. Secondary end points included systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and smoking status. RESULTS At 6 months, levels of LDL-C were significantly lower in intervention participants, with concurrent reductions in systolic blood pressure and BMI, significant increases in physical activity, and a significant reduction in smoking. The majority reported the text messages to be useful (91%), easy to understand (97%), and appropriate in frequency (86%). Parameter Mean (95% CI) Mean Difference (95% CI) P Value Intervention Control LDL-C, mg/dL 79 (76 to 82) 84 (81 to 87) -5 (-9 to 0) .04 Systolic blood pressure, mm Hg 128.2 (126.7 to 129.8) 135.8 (134.3 to 137.3) -7.6 (-9.8 to -5.4) <.001 BMI 29.0 (28.8 to 29.3) 30.3 (30.1 to 30.5) -1.3 (-1.6 to -0.9) <.001 Physical activity, MET min/wk 932 (825 to 1039) 587 (482 to 692) 345 (195 to 495) <.001 Smoking, No./total (%) 88/339 (26.0) 152/354 (42.9) RR, 0.61 (0.48 to 0.76) <.001 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with coronary heart disease, the use of a lifestyle-focused text messaging service compared with usual care resulted in a modest improvement in LDL-C level and greater improvement in other cardiovascular disease risk factors. The duration of these effects and hence whether they result in improved clinical outcomes remain to be determined.",

      "text": "lobally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disease burden.  1  Many treatments and treatment strategies are proven to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. Interventions that modify lifestyle factors are among the most effective but are poorly adhered to.  2  Secondary prevention is an effective way to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease and is a current priority of the World Heart Federation. Currently there are large gaps in utilization of preventive drugs,  3  control of risk factors,  4  and uptake of lifestyle-changing behaviors.  2 This is often because of failure in the initiation of secondary prevention.\n\nCardiac rehabilitation programs deliver comprehensive support, education, and monitoring of patients after a cardiovascular event. In a meta-regression analysis of 63 randomized trials of 21 295 patients, formal secondary prevention programs were associated with lower mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction.  5 However, there is substantial underutilization of existing programs internationally, with at best one-third of patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs after an acute coronary syndrome event.  6 Barriers to use include distance to services and time pressures caused by the need for face-to-face in-hospital or clinical setting attendance. There is therefore a need to develop simple, lowcost, widely available alternatives to improve the adoption of healthy lifestyles, particularly in patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events. Mobile phone text messages to remind, encourage, and motivate patients might be useful in this regard, but there has been limited robust scientific evaluation of these interventions.\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate, in a randomized clinical trial, the effect of a text message-based intervention to encourage lifestyle change on objective measures of cardiovascular risk in individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD)."

Patients were excluded if they did not have an active mobile phone or sufficient English language proficiency to read text messages. A log was kept of all participants screened. Patients referred for evaluation of congenital heart disease or coronary anomalies were excluded.

The computerized randomization program interfaced with the message-sending program to trigger the sending of messages to patients randomized to the intervention. To maintain blinding of study personnel, patients were informed of their allocation in a text message sent after hospital discharge. Prior to their follow-up appointment patients also received a text message to ask them not to reveal their allocation status to study personnel or clinicians in follow-up visits. Intervention participants received, in addition to usual care, the 6-month prevention program of approximately 96 messages. Control participants received usual care, which generally included community follow-up with the majority referred to inpatient cardiac rehabilitation, as determined by their usual physicians. Both groups received 3 study management text messages providing them with their allocation assignment, study contact details, and a reminder prior to the follow-up appointment."

Content for each participant was selected using a prespecified algorithm dependent on key baseline characteristics. Participants received 4 messages per week for 24 weeks. Each message was sent on 4 of 5 randomly selected weekdays and arrived at random times of the day during working hours.\n\nA bank of messages was developed with input from investigators, clinicians, academics, and patients through a multistage iterative process previously described in detail.  9 The content of messages was based on and referred to the Australian Heart Foundation Healthy Living Guidelines.  10  Content was developed for 4 modules: smoking, diet, physical activity, and general cardiovascular health. The general module of messages included information generally provided by secondary prevention programs, eg, on chest pain action plans, guidelines and risk factor targets, and medications and adherence.\n\nThe message management program selected messages for each participant at random from the bank of messages from all relevant content areas as per the prespecified algorithms and using baseline data entered into the message management system-eg, nonsmokers would not be sent smoking messages, and vegetarians would not be sent information about meat. Some messages were merged with patient's preferred names, eg, \"Have you gone for your walk today Jane?\" The Box provides other examples of messages. The message management system, previously described in detail,  9  sent messages to participants randomized to the intervention according to our prespecified algorithms on content, frequency, and timing described above.\n\nAt study entry all participants were given brief (average, 3 to 5 minutes) training, if necessary, on how to read a text message and how to delete or save messages. Participants were told not to respond to messages and informed that messages would be managed through a computerized messaging engine. Responses to all messages were monitored by study staff, but interactive communication did not occur. \"Stop\" messages were followed up by study staff to check if the participant wanted to stop the program. This was needed to meet legal requirements for sending bulk text messages.\n\nWe bought a bulk package of text messages from a local service provider to run the TEXT ME study. We used these costs to calculate an average cost for sending each text message."

      "text": "Our study found that a simple, low-cost automated program of semipersonalized mobile phone text messages supporting lifestyle change compared with usual care led to significant differences in LDL-C level, systolic blood pressure, and BMI in patients with CHD. Intervention participants were also substantially more likely to exercise regularly and become nonsmokers. There was a high level of acceptability of the intervention, with an overwhelming number of participants in the intervention group perceiving the messages to be of use and the level of contact to be appropriate.\n\nThe risk factor difference between the groups for LDL-C level was small, less than 20% of what may be expected if comparing a statin with placebo.  17 However, the differences were larger for blood pressure (similar to standard blood pressurelowering therapy compared with placebo  18  ) and larger for BMI and physical activity (comparable or greater than achieved in cardiac rehabilitation programs).  19 he proportion of patients achieving multiple guideline target levels of risk factors were substantially higher in the intervention group vs the control group, with 62.7% achieving at least 3 of 5 guideline levels in the intervention group, compared with 33.6% in the control group; 28.9% achieving at least 4 guideline levels in the intervention group, compared with 10.3% in the control group; and 4.7% achieving all 5 guideline levels in the intervention group, compared with 1.8% in the control group. For some risk factor changes, such as for smoking, the treatment effect was attributable to an improvement in the study group and no change in the control group. For others, such as blood pressure, it was attributable to a worsening in the control group after hospital discharge, which was not seen in the intervention group.\n\nIn recent years mobile phone text message-based interventions have arisen as a potential means of modifying health behaviors.  20 Recent studies have evaluated the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging to change individual health behaviors of smoking, weight loss, and physical activity to improve medical management of diabetes  21  or adherence to medication.  22 Few, however, include objective outcome measures, and concerns have been raised about potential biases associated with self-reported outcomes. Also, there is very little evidence on the effects of these interventions on multiple risk factors.  20 Reducing multiple risk factors concurrently, rather than targeting single factors, is likely to deliver greater reduction in events.  23 ext messages can be sent quickly at low cost (approximately US $10 for the 96 messages sent by our program over 6 months) and can be easily automated. Mobile phone interventions that focus on text messaging have particular value, because they do not require a smartphone and are agnostic to the mobile operating system. Furthermore, most people across all income groups own a mobile phone, so a text message-based intervention has the potential to have substantial population effects. A feature of e-health or mobile health interventions is the potential for scalability owing to affordability and ability to deliver personalized services. This is particularly the case in low-income countries, where mobile phone usage is already highly prevalent.  24 As such, e-health and mobile health have gained momentum worldwide as a platform for transforming how health care is delivered, but to date there have been minimal scientific data on effectiveness.  25 This study helps address this gap in evidence to show that delivery of secondary prevention programs is possible, effective, and acceptable. For clinicians, text messaging provides a simple, low-cost means of providing a support program and perceived continuation of their care beyond the hospital or clinic encounter. One possible way via which these interventions may work is through greater patient engagement; this needs further examination in future research studies. To policy makers and publicly or privately run health systems, the potential for population health benefit is apparent, as the intervention is likely scalable at low cost, behaviorally appropriate, acceptable to the patient, and exerts effect on multiple risk factors.\n\nOur findings are consistent with the existing evidence to support the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging in changing individual health behaviors. A number of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging to promote smoking cessation,  26, 27  and a number of small randomized clinical trials have shown improvements in weight loss,  28  physical activity,  29  adherence to asthma medication,  30  glycemic control in diabetes,  21  blood pressure lowering,  22  and adherence to medication among people with human immunodeficiency virus infection  24  or after liver transplantation.  10 The important differences with our current study are that our study targets multiple risk factors rather than individual risk factors, the sample size is larger than those for all these studies except the smoking studies, and the follow-up time is longer than for all studies and similar to that of the studies of human immunodeficiency virus treatment.\n\nOur population had relatively high rates of participation in cardiac rehabilitation. Hence, our findings suggest that messaging programs like TEXT ME could complement other programs like cardiac rehabilitation programs and provide ongoing support.\n\nThis study has a number of limitations that need to be considered. First, the outcome was the difference in risk factor levels, and a large study would be required to determine the effect of this intervention on clinical outcomes. However, we can infer from a large body of literature that change in risk factors can affect future clinical outcomes if they are sustained. Second, the current study was conducted from a single large tertiary referral center hospital, and it is unclear whether the observed benefits are generalizable. For example it is possible, but not shown in this study, that the benefits might be even greater in less affluent and more remote communities, where traditional secondary prevention programs are more difficult to access. These questions could be addressed in future research by conducting similar trials in different settings and conducting collaborative meta-analyses or conducting larger trials across multiple settings.\n\nThird, we only delivered the messages in English, despite considerable ethnic diversity among the study participants, and one of the main reasons for exclusion was that potential participants were non-English-speaking. Fourth, some of the secondary outcomes are measured using self-report; in particular, physical activity is measured through a self-reported questionnaire.\n\nFifth, this study assessed only the costs of the text messages delivered in the program. Given the modest effect sizes, it is not possible to determine whether the intervention represents a good value until formal cost-effectiveness analysis is conducted. Sixth, the trial could not be completely blinded, and we did not assess the effectiveness of the blinding. We did, however, minimize the effects of potential biases (1) by ensuring that data collectors did not know the group allocation at the time of recruitment, because this was determined by the computerized texting program and delivered in the first message, sent after hospital discharge; (2) by minimizing unblinding at follow-up by sending a message to participants asking them not to disclose their group allocation; and (3) most importantly, by using objective measures as our primary and key secondary outcomes."
