The aim of this study was to document the effect of add-on treatment with structured physical exercise in a clinical population of adolescents hospitalized for depression and anxiety in a psychiatric hospital. Methods: A group of 52 adolescent inpatients was randomly assigned to a physical exercise or control program three to four times per week over a six-week period (20 hours in total). The primary outcome was the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) for evaluation of depression and anxiety symptoms. Secondary outcomes were psychological self-assessments, diagnostic interviews, and physical examinations. Results: Six participants were lost in each group, leaving 20 inpatients each in the intervention and control groups. A linear mixed model with F-test revealed a significant interaction in favor of physical exercise in reducing the mean depression score (HADS-D) by 3.8 points [95% (CI), range 1.8 to 5.7], compared to a mean reduction score of 0.7 [95% (CI), range -0,7 to 2.0] in the control group. No significant interaction was found for anxiety symptoms (HADS-A). Limitations: The investigation was limited to the six-week hospital window and the small sample size prevented exploring differences in social characteristics. Conclusion: Structured physical exercise add-on therapy integrated into the psychiatric hospitalization of adolescents has led to a reduction in their depressive symptoms, demonstrating its effectiveness in the care of adolescent inpatients with depression. ;",

      "text": "\"Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease\" (WHO (World Health Organization) 2020). Symptoms of depression and anxiety can first arise from childhood to adolescence with different severity levels, although not often leading to a clinical diagnosis. In fact, some 10% of adolescents experience subclinical depression  (Bertha and Balazs, 2013) , which is often associated with functional impairment and interference in their education, and may also be a precursor to a major depressive disorder in adulthood  (Bertha and Balazs, 2013; Wesselhoeft et al., 2013) . Furthermore, there is evidence for a causal association whereby anxiety precedes depression  (Garber and Weersing, 2010) , such that many young people with depressive symptoms suffer from comorbid anxiety. Early detection of depression and anxiety symptoms is crucial for timely initiation of treatment. The optimal treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms in young people should include complementary non-pharmaceutical options such as cognitive behavior and interpersonal therapies  (Weersing, et al., 2017) , and calls for attention to the risk of suicidality in adolescents treated with antidepressant medications  (Stone et al., 2009) .\n\nThere are many cohort studies or Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) indicating that participation in physical activity or appropriate exercise programs is associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms among adults  (Schuch et al., 2016)  or adolescents  (Bailey et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2016; Larun et al., 2006; Oberste et al., 2020; Radovic et al., 2017; Wegner et al., 2020) . Previous studies with a RCT design have shown the positive effects of exercise on depression in adolescent outpatients  (Carter et al., 2015; Hughes et al., 2013) , some of which have been conducted in adolescents with severe depression  (Dabidy et al., 2011) . However, there are few data regarding the effect of exercise therapy as an add-on treatment in psychiatric units for adolescents (12-19 years old), which calls for additional studies  (Carter et al., 2016; Radovic et al., 2017; Wegner et al., 2020) . In the present study, we investigated the effect of structured physical exercise as an add-on treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms in a sample of teens hospitalized in a specialized psychiatric setting for youths. Psychiatric units for adolescents offer multidisciplinary residential care to young people suffering from severe psychological symptoms in a psychosocial crisis where outpatient care is not sufficient. In addition to this acute context, it has not yet been shown that implementing a structured physical exercise program in substantial and multidisciplinary psychiatric care can effectively better reduce psychological symptoms in a clinical sample of adolescents. We tested the hypothesis that a brief structured exercise program would result in a greater psychological improvement than a control program entailing social relaxation."

All patients were receiving multidisciplinary care (psychiatrists, family and individual psychologists, social workers, artist monitor, nurses, educators, psychomotor therapist, physical education teachers, physiotherapists). After randomization, participants were included in only one intervention and they could not participate in the other arm. All participants could electively join other basic physical activities in addition to the research-related exercise and social-relaxation interventions. We could not refuse access to these activities for participants for ethical reasons. Participation in these activities was open, with free intensity, and not structured but supervised for security whereas the experimental structured physical exercise treatment was developed as an original addon treatment. Information was recorded on their education level and school attendance and researchers were blinded to the participants' medication status until the end of the study. Written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki and a medical history were required from the legal guardians of people aged less than 18 years of age, in addition to written consent from each participant."

The heart rate was monitored in each participant with an individual POLAR FT2\u00ae heart rate monitor to measure the intensity of activity. The therapists were exercise professionals, physical health caregivers, physical education teachers and physiotherapists. They managed in alternation the same number of sessions in each group. Both interventions consisted of 20 sessions of 1 hour each (50 minutes activity + 10 minutes for gathering equipment, warm-up and cool-down), each administered three to four times a week for a duration of five to six weeks to complete the program (total = 20 hours)."

Self-assessment tools for depression included the Child Depression Inventory (CDI)  (Smucker et al., 1986 ), Beck's abbreviated Depression Inventory (BDI-13)  (Beck et al., 1988)  and the Zung Self-Assessment Depression Scale (SDS)  (Zung, 1965) . Symptoms of anxiety were also assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) consisting of two subscales, the STAI, form Y-A, which assesses the recent state and the STAI, form Y-B, which assesses the long-term trait anxiety  (Knight et al., 1983) .\n\nA medical height gauge and a mechanical doctor's scale were used to measure the Body Mass Index (BMI). An adapted version of the Astrand-Rhyming Sub-Maximal Effort Test  (Swain et al., 2004)  was used to estimate the maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) using a bicycle ergometer. After each session in both interventions, the subjects noted in a personal folder using a ten cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) their level of hedonia and fatigue. They also reported their mean and maximal heart rate during the one-hour session as recorded on their individual POLAR FT2\u00ae heart rate monitor."

      "text": "This is the first randomized, controlled trial aimed at evaluating the add-on effect of structured and supervised physical exercise in the treatment of adolescents hospitalized in a psychiatric unit for young people for treatment of clinical depression and anxiety. When compared to a control social relaxation program, the exercise intervention resulted in significantly reduced symptoms of depression after 6 weeks. Contrary to our initial expectations, both interventions showed similar benefits in reducing anxiety. At the baseline, both groups had severely low cardiovascular condition (5 th percentile), which was significantly improved in the exercise group only."

      "title": "Primary outcomes",
      "text": "The main clinical finding was a greater reduction of depression symptoms in the HADS-D scale in the group completing a structured and supervised physical exercise compared to control intervention. There are several potential explanations for this effect, as that the participants experienced a positive life experience, benefited from an improved therapeutic alliance, or had transference of physical fitness benefits to brain pathways underlying their improvements in mood.\n\nSupervised group exercise, accompanied by increasing but realistic goals (gradually enjoying physical exercise, improving own performance, learning new sports), presented in a fun context, and encouraging enjoyable physical movements, associated positive peer interactionsi.e. positive life experience -could inherently improve self-esteem and feelings of self-efficacy, thus bringing a positive emotional response  (Carter et al., 2015; Cid et al., 2019) , while reducing social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and anhedonia.\n\nPhysical exercise therapy, administered at the initial phase of hospitalization for depression and anxiety, may be beneficial for the therapeutic alliance between adolescent inpatients and mental health care providers. This seems a particularly important factor in the present context, because it has already been shown that early therapeutic alliance with adolescents plays an essential role in psychotherapy, promoting early gains in depressive symptomatology  (Labouliere et al., 2017) , as has also been reported in adults  (Zuroff and Blatt, 2006) . However, in the context of this study, the promotion of the therapeutic alliance through the activities was not tested, and seems likely to have been similar in both groups, given their similar positive experiences.\n\nFinally, structured physical exercise could also be beneficial for brain functions underlying affect and trait anxiety. Previous work has shown that regular physical activity in a general population of children and adolescents improves the performance of executive function and modifies the task-induced activation of involved brain areas such as the frontal cortex  (Herting and Chu, 2017; Voss et al., 2011) . Furthermore, hippocampal volume and memory performance are better in athletic participants compared to age-matched but sedentary participants  (Chaddock et al., 2010) . Since major depressive disorder in adolescents is associated with impaired executive function and mental ruminations  (Belzung et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2015) , the hypothesis of a change in brain function should be tested in future functional imaging studies. By ascertaining the impact of physical exercise on brain structure and function in adolescents with mood disorders, a clearer causal mechanism might emerge to explain the pathway for reduction of depressive symptoms.\n\nThe longitudinal HADS-A scores showed a reduction in anxiety symptoms over time in both groups. Accordingly, we can infer that the participants benefited with respect to anxiolytic effect of the general psychiatric environment, but obtained no added value from physical exercise, or rather no benefit of sufficient effect size to attain significance. To date, there is also a lack of evidence for a reduction in symptoms of anxiety with exercise in young ambulatory patients  (Carter et al., 2021; Das et al., 2016; Larun et al., 2006) , in contrast to observations made in adults  (Jayakody et al., 2014; LeBouthillier and Asmundson, 2017) . In school settings, we previously reported that a low-to-moderate exercise program reduced anxiety symptoms to a greater extent compared to intensive exercise in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents  (Philippot et al., 2019) . Additional research should explore if tailored interventions can benefit outpatients and inpatients with clinical symptoms of anxiety."

      "title": "Secondary outcomes",
      "text": "A better reduction in depressive symptoms on the SDS scale was observed in the physical exercise group compared to the social relaxation control group. Unlike the significant interaction obtained for depressive symptoms in SDS and HADS-D scales, statistical analysis revealed a comparable benefit of the two programs in the other depression tests scores, namely CDI, BDI, and HAM-D. These several tests are widely used in research to assess the severity of depression in ambulatory patients. The present trial was performed in hospitalized patients, who were already under multidisciplinary psychiatric care and, therefore should have been expected to benefit from treatment as usual. Our primary outcome, the HADS, is a brief test that focuses on anhedonia and assesses depression and anxiety in separate subcomponents, making it suitable for application in our adolescent inpatients. In addition, we note that the CDI was developed to enable longitudinal monitoring of depression at school, and therefore contains elements of school life, while 55% of the participants in the present study were no longer attending school daily before their hospitalization. Additionally, widely  At baseline the test scores were similar in the two groups. SD= Standard Deviation.\n\nused HAM-D scale for clinical research in adults includes somatic symptoms of depression as well as some symptoms of anxiety  (Bagby et al., 2004)  in the final score. The lack of group differences in these symptoms could therefore contribute to the lack of difference in the evolution of HAM-D scores in the present trial.\n\nIn the present study, the VO 2 max indices, although still low after treatment, increased significantly in the exercise group, thus attaining the 10th percentile for girls (60% of the sample)  (Tomkinson et al., 2017) . At baseline, the mean VO 2 max indices were well below the desirable threshold for cardio-respiratory condition (41.8 mL/min/kg in boys and 34.6 mL/min/kg in girls aged 15 years) to prevent the risk of cardiovascular disease later in life  (Ruiz et al., 2016) . Since depressive symptoms per se in otherwise healthy adolescents may influence later risk of cardiovascular disease  (Olive et al., 2020) , an adapted physical exercise program with endurance training should in any event be prescribed to adolescents with clinical depression because of the risk of sedentary lifestyle, irrespective of any benefits for present mood.\n\nThe study group completed 76% (exercise) or 79% (control) of the sessions offered over an average of 6 weeks to reach the goal of twenty sessions. This roughly matched the attendance rates in two RCTs of depressed adolescents involved in a previously investigated outpatient exercise program (79% observed for 12 weeks  (Hughes et al., 2013)  and 70% for 6 weeks  (Carter et al., 2015) )."

    {
      "title": "Strengths",
      "text": "A strong point of the study is that there haven not hitherto been any reports on RCTs in a psychiatric hospital setting documenting the physical and psychological/psychiatric effects of a structured, reassuring, and supervised exercise program. Thanks to the design of our RCT, we can attribute improvements in certain endpoints as main effects of the exercise program per se. At baseline, all psychological assessments corresponded to clinical thresholds of moderate to (mainly) severe depression and anxiety. There are relatively few reports of physical exercise interventions as an add-on treatment in patient groups with relatively severe mood disorder symptoms and nearly all were conducted in outpatients  (Carter et al., 2015; Dabidy Roshan et al., 2011; Hughes et al., 2013) . The positive effect of structured and supervised exercise on depressed mood seen in the present study is in accordance with the conclusions of these previous studies, especially trials with clinical samples  (Bailey et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2016; Radovic et al., 2017) . Although noticeably smaller effect sizes were found in studies that used non-physical activity as control treatments compared to studies without control group  (Oberste et al., 2020) , here, we observed a significant benefit of physical exercise intervention as compared to a control intervention conducted in parallel. The good participation and enjoyment scores recorded using VAS at the end of each session indicated that the content of the sessions was equally attractive in both programs. This stands in contrast to conventional thinking that depressed adolescents would not adhere to an exercise program, which might generalize to more effective interventions based on present methods, as likewise recently suggested in the literature  (Radovic et al., 2018) . In addition, the very low mean aerobic score observed in our sample at baseline underscores the critical need to improve the physical condition of depressed adolescents who are at risk for future cardiovascular disease. Our structured, supervised, task-oriented exercise program in a fun setting could be easily implemented in gyms as part of a successful rehabilitation strategy to achieve this goal of improving physical condition of non-hospitalized depressed adolescents."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "It would have been preferable to record long-term effect of the intervention on mood symptom scores, but this approach was not possible due to the incomplete medical follow-up after six months. Therefore, we confined out investigation to the six week window of typical psychiatric hospitalization. Only 40 participants completed the whole study, which is not a sufficiently large sample to explore the effects of factors such as social and clinical characteristics of the participants, and the use of randomization precluded performing an analysis of any sub-group. The study dropout rate of 23% mainly reflected decisions of participants to shorten their hospital stay, or expulsion due to noncompliance with internal unit rules. The circumstances of hospitalization typically result in high rates of premature discontinuation (28 to 75%) in mental health research studies in adolescents  (de Haan et al., 2013) . We did not have information on prior physical activity from a physical activity questionnaire such as the SIMPAQ that is validated in adolescents  (Rosenbaum et al., 2020) . Furthermore, we note that physical activity is a regular part of multidisciplinary care at our hospital, thus being available to both study groups. On average, there was a low attendance of basic physical activities (open participation and unstructured sessions) at the rate of 1.2 session per week for the control group and 1.3 session per week for the exercise group and this was not sufficient to improve the VO2max score in the control group."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "The results of our study indicate that a structured, group-based, and supervised exercise program imparts physical and psychological benefits in the treatment of young people admitted in a psychiatric hospital for depression and anxiety. Exercise appears to be an effective add-on intervention to antidepressants, thus being crucial for adolescents with depression, who are at chronicity of their mental disorder compounded by sedentary lifestyle. Further investigation regarding the role of training history, comorbidity, cognitive and social functioning on exercise programs in youth with mood disorders are urgently required."
