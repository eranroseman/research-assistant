  "title": "Promoting Engagement With Smartphone Apps for Suicidal Ideation in Young People: Development of an Adjunctive Strategy Using a Lived Experience Participatory Design Approach",
  "abstract": "Background: Suicide among young people is a worrying public health concern. Despite this, there is a lack of suitable interventions aligned with the needs of this priority population. Emerging evidence supports the effectiveness of digital interventions in alleviating the severity of suicidal thoughts. However, their efficacy may be undermined by poor engagement. Technology-supported strategies (eg, electronic prompts and reminders) have been deployed alongside digital interventions to increase engagement with the latter. However, evidence of their efficacy is inconclusive. User-centered design approaches may be key to developing feasible and effective engagement strategies. Currently, no study has been published on how such an approach might be expressly applied toward developing strategies for promoting engagement with digital interventions. Objective: This study aimed to detail the processes and activities involved in developing an adjunctive strategy for promoting engagement with LifeBuoy-a smartphone app that helps young people manage suicidal thoughts. Methods: Development of the engagement strategy took place in 2 phases. The discovery phase aimed to create an initial prototype by synthesizing earlier findings-from 2 systematic reviews and a cross-sectional survey of the broader mental health app user population-with qualitative insights from LifeBuoy users. A total of 16 web-based interviews were conducted with young people who participated in the LifeBuoy trial. Following the discovery phase, 3 interviewees were invited by the research team to take part in the workshops in the design phase, which sought to create a final prototype by making iterative improvements to the initial prototype. These improvements were conducted over 2 workshops. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data obtained from the interviews and workshops. Results: Main themes from the interviews centered around the characteristics of the strategy, timing of notifications, and suitability of social media platforms. Subsequently, themes that emerged from the design workshops emphasized having a wider variety of content, greater visual consistency with LifeBuoy, and a component with more detailed information to cater to users with greater informational needs. Thus, refinements to the prototype were focused on (1) improving the succinctness, variety, and practical value of Instagram content, (2) creating a blog containing articles contributed by mental health professionals and young people with lived experience of suicide, and (3) standardizing the use of marine-themed color palettes across the Instagram and blog components. Conclusions: This is the first study to describe the development of a technology-supported adjunctive strategy for promoting engagement with a digital intervention. It was developed by integrating perspectives from end users with lived experience of suicide with evidence from the existing literature. The development process documented in this study may be useful for guiding similar projects aimed at supporting the use of digital interventions for suicide prevention or mental health.",

      "text": "Suicide among young people is a significant global public health concern  [1] . In Australia, suicide is the leading cause of death among individuals aged 15 to 24 years  [2] . Though it is well recognized that young people have different and unique mental health needs compared to adults  [3] , there continue to be few resources and interventions that have been specifically designed for young people and that have evidence for preventing suicide-related outcomes  [4] . Self-guided digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) delivered through smartphone apps or web-based platforms without human guidance have rapidly emerged as a potential low-cost and scalable model of care for young people experiencing suicidal ideation, self-harm, and mental health issues  [5] .\n\nFindings from a recent meta-analysis of self-guided DMHIs for suicide prevention show that self-guided digital interventions directly targeting suicidal ideation are effective in reducing the severity of suicidal thoughts, although evidence specifically in relation to young people is still rare  [6] . However, there is ample evidence indicating that low levels of user engagement with DMHIs have hindered the real-world uptake of these interventions  [7, 8] , including DMHIs targeted at younger users  [9, 10] . In addition, poor engagement-stopping use of a digital intervention before the minimum number of modules that are expected to lead to clinical benefits have been completed-may also impede mental health benefits that could potentially be gained from DMHIs  [11] . For these reasons, solutions for optimizing user engagement with DMHIs represent a critical step toward advancing the wider integration of digital interventions in routine practices of health, education, and community settings where they can reach and benefit young people.\n\nTo date, there is inconclusive evidence supporting the efficacy of technology-supported strategies (eg, reminders, coaching, and personalized feedback) toward improving engagement with DMHIs  [12] . It has been hypothesized that the lack of efficacy associated with these engagement strategies may be due to poor alignment with the needs and preferences of users  [13] . Indeed, there is little evidence that such engagement strategies have been co-designed with, or incorporated the perspectives of, those who are intended to benefit from DMHIs  [4] . To improve the effectiveness of both DMHIs and any supporting engagement strategies, adopting user-centered design approaches-such as participatory design or co-design-has been strongly recommended  [14] . While several studies have now described processes of actively involving service users in the development of mental health-focused digital interventions for youth and young people  [4, 15] , no studies have yet discussed such processes in the context of adjunctive strategies-strategies that are accessed externally to DMHIs (eg, via social media or the internet) but are designed to be used in conjunction with the latter-for promoting engagement with digital interventions.\n\nThis study details the development of a technology-supported adjunctive strategy for increasing engagement with LifeBuoy  [16] -a smartphone app designed to help young people manage suicidal thoughts. LifeBuoy seeks to achieve this by imparting distress tolerance and emotional regulation skills that are grounded in dialectical behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy.\n\nA recent evaluation of LifeBuoy supported the app's efficacy in reducing the severity of suicidal ideation but not other outcomes of interest such as depression, anxiety, or general psychological distress  [16] . Additionally, while module completion rates were high, most participants stopped engaging with the app after a month  [16] . By adding an adjunctive strategy to reinforce therapeutic content and enhance sustained engagement with the app, we hoped to see improvements across both mental health and suicidality-related outcomes.\n\nOur design approach integrated existing literature with qualitative insights obtained from young people with lived experience of suicide. This study is the first to discuss how user-focused design practices may be applied in developing strategies for promoting engagement with DMHIs for young people."

This was carried out by integrating existing evidence from the literature with the perspectives of (1) the broader population of mental health app users and (2) LifeBuoy users. Subsequently, the design phase sought to iteratively refine this initial prototype. This was achieved by collaborating with a smaller group of LifeBuoy users across 2 design workshops, culminating in the final version of the strategy. The sections that follow will focus on the interviews conducted during the discovery phase and the workshops conducted during the design phase."

First, 2 systematic reviews were conducted to (1) clarify the association between engagement and mental health outcomes in the context of digital interventions  [11]  and (2) explore the range of strategies that have been used to promote engagement with these interventions  [12] . The main findings of these reviews have been discussed earlier. Collectively, they highlighted the importance of adopting a user-centered approach in developing strategies for promoting engagement with DMHIs.\n\nSecond, a cross-sectional survey of mental health app users in Australia was conducted to gather insights on the feasibility and acceptability of potential strategies for promoting engagement  [17] . Key insights that were directly relevant to the development of the engagement strategy for LifeBuoy were that (1) content should be brief, practical, and digestible; (2) the strategy should be visually appealing; and (3) social media might be an acceptable platform for the strategy among young adult users  [17] . This paper is focused on describing the third group of activities-semistructured qualitative interviews of LifeBuoy users. The interviews were conducted to assess the acceptability of having an adjunctive strategy and gain users' perspectives on the specific characteristics (eg, content, design, medium or platform, and frequency of delivery) that this strategy should possess."

Based on the existing literature, strategies that have been used to increase engagement with digital interventions for mental health include electronic prompts  [18] , fun facts  [19] , and quizzes  [20] . These strategies were of interest in this study, as they did not require ongoing human support, consistent with the self-guided delivery model of the LifeBuoy app. In addition, given the widespread use of social media among young Australians  [21] , interviewees were also asked whether they thought an accompanying social media account would help improve engagement with LifeBuoy."

Discussions were centered on improving the quality and alignment of existing content with the profile of LifeBuoy users. Similarly, advisors were asked for their feedback on the aesthetics of the current prototype. Insights obtained from this workshop were used to revise the initial prototype.\n\nTwo weeks before the second workshop, the revised prototype was disseminated to advisors via email.

Grammatical and spelling errors for each transcript were corrected as the audio was cross-checked against the transcription. Initial impressions of the data set were then used to generate a list of preliminary codes. Thereafter, an initial coding framework was drafted, and potential themes were generated. An inductive approach was used to identify and organize codes into themes to minimize the potential influence of preconceived opinions.\n\nA second researcher (LM) helped to refine and finalize the coding frame. Consensus on the suggested themes and codes was reached through a discussion between DZQG and LM. In total, 50% of the interview and workshop data sets were double coded by DZQG and LM using the final coding framework, achieving an average agreement of 82%. The remaining transcripts were coded by DZQG. All authors conducted a final evaluation of the alignment between the suggested themes and the codes.

They shared that, during times of acute psychological distress, they found it very difficult to consciously and independently engage with complex methods of coping. Simple strategies with clear instructions might therefore be the best way of helping young people tide over more intense periods of distress.\n\nMotivational and uplifting messages would be helpful for reminding users that their well-being is important and encouraging them in their everyday life. Advisors felt that these messages should be focused on encouraging young people to persevere in their life challenges. In doing so, the messages should not come across as clich\u00e9d, patronizing, or overly idealistic.\n\nContent should also be emotionally validating. Advisors emphasized that the general tone of any wording should be gentle and emotionally supportive. In addition, they recommended that some content be designed specifically to validate negative emotions that young people might be experiencing, as they may not have had opportunities to express these feelings. They suggested that one way this could be done was to provide information, such as prevalence statistics, that reminds users that they are not alone in their struggles.\n\nAdvisors stressed the importance of ensuring that content not be perceived by users as advertising or hard-selling the LifeBuoy app. They felt that users who developed such perceptions would significantly be less willing to engage with both the strategy and the app. According to advisors, this concern stems from a broader discontentment among their contemporaries with the way corporations have used social media to promote their products. Thus, it was imperative that messages convey genuine concern for the well-being of users.\n\nRegarding the frequency and timing of dissemination of content, weekly updates were considered sufficient to keep users reminded of the LifeBuoy app. Advisors expressed that they were more likely to attend to Instagram notifications sent in the late afternoon to early evening. This time window was perceived to be suitable as it represents a block of time after the end of school and work but before bedtime."

      "text": "Advisors unanimously supported the use of nature-themed backgrounds. They felt that the nature-themed backgrounds would be better paired with the content topics and provided consistency with the marine-themed design of the LifeBuoy app. Aesthetic features of the posts could also help to reduce feelings of distress by having a calming effect on mood. Advisors also recommended improving the visibility of text-based content by increasing the color contrast between the text and the background. Specifically, they suggested placing text-based content in front of a white background to enhance readability. Finally, advisors expressed that a key reason why Instagram was more suitable than platforms such as Facebook was because Instagram was better at delivering information in a visually appealing way."

      "text": "During the workshops, advisors reflected on the possibility that some users, like themselves, may be avid information seekers who appreciate more in-depth content. They also felt that certain pertinent topics should feature in the content of the strategy. In particular, they explained that a topic on help-seeking for suicide ideation would be very relevant for users seeking therapy for the first time. Content on such a topic might not be very helpful for users if it were too concise. Advisors concurred that social media platforms might not be an ideal way of presenting topics that contain more comprehensive information. In the discussions, a spontaneous suggestion about having a blog as one component of the adjunctive strategy was well-received by advisors."

      "title": "Initial, Revised, and Final Design Samples of the Engagement Strategy Through the Design Process",
      "text": "Sample social media posts and blog posts at different stages of the design process are summarized in Figures  2 to 5 . Based on insights from the qualitative interviews, sample Instagram posts, which were informative, uplifting, and aligned with content in LifeBuoy were created to start discussions at the first workshop (Figure  2 ). Several variations of each post were created using different types of color schemes, aesthetics (eg, nature and baby animals), and fonts, with the objective of getting feedback from workshop participants about their preferred styles.\n\nFeedback and insights from the workshops were used to refine the initial samples before the second workshop (Figure  3 ). Motivational posts were worded to read as encouraging but realistic. Psychoeducational posts were written in simple and clear language. Instructional posts were presented in bite-sized pieces of information with succinct steps provided. A blog was also created. A water-themed nature background was used for the blog to align its design with that of the LifeBuoy app and with the preferences of young people. The blog posts provided detailed information on a range of topics related to mental well-being and help-seeking. They were written by a trained clinical psychologist (LM) or young adults with lived experience of suicide. Each post had an estimated reading time of 2 to 4 minutes.\n\nThe final version of the engagement strategy was created from the initial prototype following 3 rounds of iterative refinements arising from the workshops. It consisted of three main components: (1) an Instagram account (Figure  4 ) containing posts that delivered concise informational or inspirational content aligned with the content in the app, (2) a blog (Figure  5 ) with entries containing more detailed and in-depth therapeutic information and advice for maintaining mental wellness, and\n\n(3) weekly emails inviting users to visit these platforms. A total of 42 Instagram posts and 12 blog articles were created, collectively allowing for new material to be posted every 2 to 3 days over the course of the trial. To balance safety considerations and ensure the strategy required only minimal ongoing human support, user comments were disabled for both Instagram and the blog. To ensure that users could access Instagram content anonymously, the account was made public instead of private. The like count was also hidden to preserve the identity of users who liked any of the Instagram posts."

      "text": "This paper described the qualitative processes and activities undertaken with young people who had a lived experience of suicidal ideation to develop an adjunctive strategy aimed at promoting engagement with the LifeBuoy smartphone intervention. Social media, particularly Instagram, was seen as an acceptable medium to deliver brief, practical, and inspirational content that could motivate and encourage young people to engage with the intervention. A blog with articles contributed by a clinician and people with lived experience of suicide was identified as the preferred medium to deliver in-depth information on (1) living with and (2) seeking help for suicidal thoughts. Nature-themed visuals with calming colors were used as the design theme."

    {
      "title": "Comparison With Previous Literature",
      "text": "To date, no study has reported on the process of designing adjunctive strategies for supporting engagement with DMHIs. Notwithstanding, our study findings were generally consistent with past research on the co-design of digital interventions for younger users, which found young people to have a preference for direct, practical information  [27] , content that positively impacts mood (such as relaxation techniques, distraction activities, or uplifting quotes)  [23] , and designs that are visually appealing  [28] .\n\nNature-themed backgrounds appealed most to advisors because of their calming effect on mood. These views are congruent with theories and findings from environmental psychology. According to Stress Reduction Theory  [29] , exposure to nature reduces stress and has therapeutic effects on both physiological and psychological well-being. Importantly, earlier research has extended the postulations of Stress Reduction Theory by demonstrating that virtual exposure to natural environments can be effective toward reducing stress and attenuating subsequent reactivity toward stressful stimuli  [30] . This is aligned with feedback from the design workshops that looking at nature-themed stock photos has a rejuvenating effect.\n\nThe young people who were interviewed felt that Instagram was a suitable social media platform for the adjunctive strategy. This was attributed to their existing familiarity with the platform and the perceived sense of community support provided by other users. This finding appears to contradict previous research reporting an inverse association between Instagram use and mental health among youth and young adults  [31, 32] . However, a recent study found that Instagram use had an indirect effect on reducing suicidal ideation through the mediating effect of perceived burdensomeness among young people aged 18-25 years  [33] . Although more research is needed to elucidate the relationship between Instagram use and mental health, these findings collectively suggest that an accompanying Instagram account might be a suitable complement to DMHIs targeting suicide ideation among young people.\n\nCurrently, there are no studies promoting engagement with digital interventions, which have examined the feasibility or acceptability of adjunctive digital strategies that provide detailed content on topics relevant to users  [12, 18] . Using a blog emerged as a novel way to provide in-depth information on topics of interest to young people with suicidal ideation and reinforce the therapeutic content covered in LifeBuoy. Importantly, the blog allowed young people with lived experience of suicide to directly contribute content that would likely resonate with the needs and challenges faced by intended users of the LifeBuoy app. It is also hoped that this would increase the acceptability of the blog among young people who use LifeBuoy. Nevertheless, whether the blog is efficacious toward promoting engagement with LifeBuoy requires empirical investigation."

      "title": "Strengths",
      "text": "As far as the authors are aware, this study is the first to discuss the application of a participatory design approach in the context of developing an adjunctive strategy to complement a digital intervention for mental health. The workshop aspect of the design process drew from principles and recommendations of participatory and co-design frameworks  [22, 34] . Young people's perspectives on what facilitates engagement with DMHIs were generally consistent with the extant literature.\n\nA rigorous methodological approach integrating evidence, professional input, and lived experience insights was used in the planning, design, and refinement of the adjunctive strategy. The rationale for developing the strategy was grounded in evidence from the research literature and perspectives of the broader mental health app user population in Australia. Young persons who contributed their insights during the interviews and workshops came directly from the target population that the app was designed for. Development of the initial prototype was based on data from the qualitative interviews. Finally, the initial, revised, and final versions of the adjunctive strategy were developed in an iterative manner between each round of design activities. Although only 2 workshops were conducted, this was sufficient given that a high degree of consensus between advisors and researchers regarding the strategy had been reached by the second workshop.\n\nA robust coding frame was developed to consolidate and make sense of the feedback obtained. In total, 50% of all qualitative data were double coded, and a reasonable overall level of intercoder agreement was achieved even though this was not an essential requirement for thematic analysis  [35] .\n\nFinally, this work is well-aligned with high-level national  [36]  and international  [37]  efforts aimed at supporting suicide prevention by empowering young people with lived experience to play a greater role in the creation and dissemination of mental health services."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study had several limitations. Only the research team was involved in every phase of this project. As such, they may invariably have shaped some aspects of the strategy's development. For example, as described in the Methods section, decisions on the types of engagement strategies to explore further during the interviews and workshops were made before users were involved. Nonetheless, it was necessary and pragmatic to streamline the qualitative data collection to focus on solutions that were feasible based on existing resources. However, these decisions were informed by the existing literature and are therefore consistent with what young people have identified as potentially useful engagement strategies. Moreover, all suggestions provided by young people were fully considered. In other words, the eventual version of strategy was based not only on their perspectives of what might work but also on what might not work.\n\nResource constraints affected the implementation of development activities in several ways. Workforce and financial constraints did not allow for multiple parallel workshops to be conducted with different groups of young people. Doing so may have generated additional insights that could inform the development of the adjunctive strategy. Finally, operational constraints associated with technical expertise and funding meant that not all feedback from the design activities could be incorporated into the adjunctive strategy. However, the research team was transparent with participants by informing them that not all the feedback provided could feasibly be acted on.\n\nCharacteristics relating to the study sample may have restricted the scope of design activities conducted, and consequently, the insights obtained. Young people who took part in the interviews represented only a small proportion of all LifeBuoy users (n=228)  [16] . Notwithstanding, the demographic and clinical profiles of young people involved in this study were similar to the wider sample. Finally, only potential end users of LifeBuoy were involved in the design process. Engaging other stakeholders, such as mental health professionals or caregivers, may have yielded useful perspectives that could have contributed positively to the development of the strategy."

      "title": "Conclusions and Future Directions",
      "text": "This study is the first to thoroughly describe the process of designing an adjunctive strategy for promoting engagement with a digital intervention. Characteristics pertaining to the platform, content, aesthetics, and dissemination of this strategy were based on integrating past literature with insights from young people with lived experience of suicide. The design approach, its associated activities, and how the findings were used toward creating and refining the adjunctive strategy were documented in detail. The work undertaken in this study may be helpful for informing subsequent projects aimed at creating resources to support engagement with digital interventions for suicide prevention or mental health.\n\nThe next step for this research will be to explore the acceptability and satisfaction of the adjunctive strategy in a large sample of young people who fit the intended user profile for LifeBuoy. This step is important for confirming the representativeness of end-user feedback received during the design process and provides an opportunity to identify and improve upon any potential limitations in the strategy before efficacy testing.\n\nFuture efforts should strive to embrace a co-design approach in developing adjunctive strategies for promoting engagement with digital interventions. Co-design is one of the most important emerging concepts in modern health care research because of its focus on addressing gaps in the availability of mental health-related services that are appropriate, acceptable, and relevant to priority populations  [38] . Empowering users to be equal partners in the design and development processes may be crucial for improving engagement with mental health interventions which, thus far, has been tied to lack of relevancy or mismatch in needs."
