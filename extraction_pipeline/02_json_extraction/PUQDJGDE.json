  "abstract": "Objective: ''Patient activation'' describes the extent to which individuals manage their own healthcare. This study evaluated the association of patient activation, depressive symptoms and quality of life in a primary care setting. Methods: 278 patients who visited two primary care clinics were interviewed in the waiting room before their appointment or by telephone. Study participants completed the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12). Physicians assessed each participant's depression status immediately after the visit. Results: PAM scores correlated negatively with PHQ-9 (r = \u00c00.35, p < 0.0001) and positively with total SF-12 score (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). Increased participant involvement by one-level increments on the PAM was predicted by their being in the 55 to 74-year age group and higher total SF-12 quartiles. Almost half of those scoring !10 on PHQ-9 were not considered depressed by their physician (false negatives, i.e. ''hidden depression''). Conclusion: In primary care settings, PAM is easily administered and useful for general patients and for those with depressive symptoms. Practice implications: Assessing patient activation will enable caregivers to monitor levels of self-care (activation) and potential adherence to health behavior recommendations. PHQ-9 screening could increase awareness of ''hidden depression'' in the primary care setting.",

      "text": "''Patient activation'' is a term used to describe the extent to which individuals are able to manage their own healthcare. Hibbard and her colleagues  [1]  conceptualized patient activation as encompassing a range of elements important in self-management that extend beyond any single health behavior. As a measure of this concept, they developed the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), a 4-level model of health behavior. The lowest level indicates that the patient may not believe his/her role in self-care management is important; the second level indicates that the patient lacks confidence or knowledge to take an active role; the third level indicates that the patient is beginning to be active; and the at highest level, patients actively attempt (even with difficulty) to maintain health management behaviors over time  [2, 3] .\n\nThe ability of individuals to effectively manage their healthcare is linked to their emotional state  [4] . Major depression is a common chronic disorder, often presenting in primary care with a lifetime prevalence of about 13-24%  [5] [6] [7] [8] . Approximately 80% of patients with depression are treated and managed by primary care physicians, but not necessarily for their depressive symptoms  [9] [10] [11] [12] . Despite its high prevalence, reports have noted that 50-70% of patients with depression are not diagnosed by their physician within the framework of primary healthcare. In addition, only one-third of those who are diagnosed receive appropriate treatment  [9, 10, 13]  and among those for whom treatment is prescribed, compliance has been found lacking  [14, 15] .\n\nFew studies have considered the relationship between patient activation and depression, and those that did so investigated only specific, serious health conditions, including multiple sclerosis  [16]  and HIV  [17] . Among patients with chronic conditions, an individual's involvement in managing his/her own care might be an expression of mood and general well-being. Among depressed patients, the impact of disease may be reflected by the degree of the patient's active involvement in self-care  [18] . The current study evaluated the association of patient activation and depressive symptoms in the primary care setting."

      "title": "Methods",
      "text": "This cross-sectional study included patients who visited two large primary care clinics of the Clalit Health Services (CHS) Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) between February 6 and March 31, 2011. Clalit is the largest HMO in Israel, covering about 65% of the population. Both clinics are located in Beer Sheba, the largest city in southern Israel (pop. 200,000). Two family physicians were selected from each clinic to participate in the study. In one clinic, these were the only family physicians and in the other clinic the two were selected because only they worked both morning and afternoon shifts. Included were all of their patients aged 18 or over, who were members of CHS, covered by Israel's National Health Insurance Law, and who came for appointments on predetermined study dates, alternating the physicians' morning and afternoon shifts. The only exclusion criterion was inability to speak or read Hebrew. It should be noted that there were no specific conditions for patients' making their appointments on the study dates, thus both patients with acute care needs and those with chronic conditions could choose to participate. The study was approved by the Clalit Health Services Institutional Review Board (Helsinki Committee).\n\nPatient Activation Measure (PAM): the PAM is a self-report questionnaire reflecting a patient's involvement, i.e., knowledge, skill and confidence, in managing chronic health conditions which he/she may have  [1, 19] . It has 13 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, which can be analyzed as a continuous variable or as a 4level discrete variable (as described in the Introduction). Higher scores and levels indicate more patient involvement. The PAM was translated into Hebrew and back-translated. In the present study, the Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency was 0.78.\n\nPatient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9): the PHQ-9 is a selfreport questionnaire for screening for symptoms of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV. It has a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 85% in primary care settings  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The questionnaire has nine items, with a total score ranging from 0 to 27; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. A cut-off score of !10 is considered to indicate at least a mild depressive episode  [25] . The Hebrew translation of the PHQ-9 has also been validated in a primary care setting  [8] .\n\nShort Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12): the SF-12, a 12-item questionnaire, was employed as a measure of subjective quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate better quality of life  [26] . This measure was added to provide a broader indication of patient activation, in addition to the depressive symptoms alone. The SF-12 has several subscales, as well as physical and mental health composite scores (PCS and MCS, respectively). It has been validated in Hebrew  [27] .\n\nIn addition to the questionnaires, participants were asked to respond to the following question: ''If you were to/would feel emotional or mental distress, would you be interested in continued evaluation, treatment, and follow-up by your family physician?''\n\nPhysician assessment: during the study period, participating physicians were asked to assess the status of each participant at the end of the index visit, using a coded label affixed to the daily patient list. The codes were grouped into three categories: (1) diagnosed with depression; (2) not diagnosed, but physician suspects depression; (3) not diagnosed and physician does not suspect depression or depressive symptoms. The physicians were blinded to the patients' PHQ-9 scores.\n\nProcedure: two physicians in each clinic participated in the study. Demographic data were provided by the participants and recorded on structured forms. During the study period, all patients visiting these physicians were asked to complete the study questionnaires either in the clinic waiting room before their scheduled visit (n = 459) or by telephone the day after the designated visit (n = 368). These two approaches were used for HMO policy planning. The method of approach alternated according to day of the week and shift (morning or evening). The two interviewers conducting the face-to-face interviews were jointly trained in order to minimize interviewer bias and were instructed regarding privileged information and confidentiality. Interviewers who conducted the telephone survey received similar training and at least three attempts were made to contact those who did not answer the telephone.\n\nThe sample size was determined using the Epi Info program, v.6 (CDC, 2011), based on an earlier Israeli study of the PHQ-9 that reported a response rate of 63%, with 19.6% scoring !10  [7] . The calculation was based on a power of 1 \u00c0 b = 80% and a p-value of a = 0.05. Data were entered onto an Excel worksheet and analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.2 for SOLARIS software. For analysis, the age variable was grouped into four categories: 18-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-74 years, and 75+. The PHQ-9 scores were dichotomized into 0-9 and !10, where indicated. Discrete variables were analyzed by chi-square test and continuous variables by Pearson Product Correlation and t-test or one-way ANOVA for difference in means. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using GLM procedure was conducted to analyze predictors of PAM scores, including the PHQ-9 score, SF-12, gender, age group, and level of education. PAM levels were determined by conversion of raw score equivalents of ''activation score''  [2]  as follows: Level 1, scores 35; Level 2, scores 36-38; Level 3, scores 39-42; and Level 4, scores !43. Ordered logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors predicting a one-level increase in the PAM. For all analyses, a p-value of <0.05 was considered significant."

      "text": "During the study period, 278 of the 827 (33.6%) patients who were approached agreed to participate in the study. They ranged in age from 18 to 85 years (mean 52.5 AE 17.9; median 56 years), and more women than men participated (59.4% vs. 40.6%, respectively. This reflects a higher representation of women and of patients under 75 years of age than in the patient population of the Southern district of CHS. The compliance rate was higher among participants who were approached face-to-face than among those contacted by telephone (38.6% vs. 27.4%; p < 0.0001). There was no difference between these groups with regard to gender or age group, but there were fewer high school graduates among those contacted by telephone (p = 0.04). The primary reasons for non-response were outright refusal (with no specific reason offered) and inconvenient timing. The rate of refusal was more frequent among those approached in the clinics and inconvenient time was more prevalent in the telephone requests. Although details of the participants' medical history were not collected, the study questionnaire asked whether they were currently taking anti-depressant medication; 35 (12.6%) responded in the affirmative.\n\nThe mean PAM score was 43.8 AE 5.6 (range 17-52) with higher mean scores (indicating more activation) among men than among women (44.7 AE 6.0 and 43.2 AE 5.4, respectively; p = 0.04) and among those with 12 or more years of education, compared to those with less education (44.5 AE 5.0 and 43.1 AE 6.1; p = 0.04) (Table  1 ). There was no significant difference in PAM scores for the various age groups or between those approached in the clinics or by telephone. According to the classification of Hibbard et al., 60.1% of the participants scored in the Level 4 range, indicating the highest degree of patient activation, and 23.9% scored in Level 3. Only 9.0% and 7.1% scored in Levels 2 and 1, respectively  [19] , indicating the lowest degree of involvement in managing their own healthcare.\n\nThe mean PHQ-9 score was 6.1 AE 6.1 (range 0-25; higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms), with 65 (23.4%) scoring !10, indicating a possible depressive episode. Women had a significantly higher rate of scores !10 compared to men (29.7% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p = 0.003), as did those with post-high school compared to those with less education (31.5% vs. 14.1%; p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in depression scores among the age groups or according to interview method.\n\nThe mean SF-12 score was 32.1 AE 8.3 (range 12-44; higher scores indicate better quality of life). Mean scores were higher among men than women (33.8 AE 7.5 vs. 31.0 AE 8.6; p = .006) and those younger than 55 years of age (33.7 AE 7.9 vs. 30.9 AE 8.4; p = 0.004), respectively. Those with post-high school education had higher mean SF-12 scores (33.7 AE 7.1 vs. 30.9 AE 9.0; p = 0.005). There was no difference in the mean SF-12 score or in the associations with demographic variables according to interview method.\n\nThe PAM score was negatively correlated with PHQ-9 (r = \u00c00.35, p < 0.0001; Table  2 ). A significant difference in mean PAM scores was found between those who scored 0-9 on the PHQ-9 and those scoring !10 (40.9 AE 5.2 vs. 44.7 AE 6.0, respectively; tvalue 4.6, p < 0.0001). Thus, the higher the PHQ-9 depression score (both actual scores and dichotomized values), the less involved the patients were in their healthcare. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association with depression status, i.e., 57.9% of those scoring in Level 1 on the PAM, scored !10 on the PHQ-9, with the rate decreasing to 16.9% of those scoring in PAM Level 4, having scores of !10 on the PHQ-9.\n\nPAM scores were positively correlated with the total SF-12 score (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001), as well as with the PHC and MHC subscale scores and with the Mental Health subscale (p < 0.0001). There was a negative correlation between PHQ-9 scores and the total SF-12 score (r = \u00c00.78, p < 0.0001), as well as with the SF-12 MHC and PHC scores (r = \u00c00.72 and r = \u00c00.58, respectively; p < 0.0001), confirming that increased depressive symptoms were associated with poorer self-reported well-being.\n\nAnalysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) revealed SF-12 and PHQ-9 as the strongest predictors of PAM when each was entered separately into the model (F value 38.2 and 23.9, respectively). However, when both were entered into the model, only the SF-12 was a significant predictor (F value 13.6). Method of interview was not a significant predictor of PAM. Increased involvement by increments of one level on the PAM was significantly predicted by participants being in the 55-74-year age group and with higher total SF-12 quartiles (Table  3 ).\n\nIn response to the direct question regarding assessment, treatment and follow-up of emotional symptoms within the framework of the primary care clinic, 93% of participants who had a PHQ-9 !10 and 86.0% with a PHQ-9 <10 expressed an interest in this option (p > 0.05). Similarly, there was no difference in mean PAM scores between those who or were not interested in pursuing this option (44.0 AE 5.5 and 43.3 AE 5.6, respectively; p > 0.05).\n\nBasing the designation of depression on a PHQ-9 score of !10, 77.9% of those scoring <10 on the PHQ-9 were not considered by their physician to be depressed (true negatives), while nearly half of the 64 participants scoring !10 (n = 29; 45.3%) were not considered or suspected of being depressed (false negatives, i.e. ''hidden depression''). The mean PHQ-9 score of these participants was 17.7 AE 2.30). Half of these individuals scored 15 or over, indicating moderate to severe depression, while the rest were 'borderline' cases scoring between 10 and 14. These participants comprised over one-third (35.9%) of all those scoring in the !15 range on the PHQ-9 (Fig.  1 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study approached the issue of assessing patient activation in primary care settings and considering it in relation to depressive symptoms. Low PAM scores were strongly associated with increased depressive symptoms and poorer quality of life. Similar inverse relationships have been reported among individuals with serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis  [16]  and HIV  [17] . Munson et al. also reported a positive relationship between the PAM score and health-related quality of life  [28] . These findings have implications beyond the PAM score itself. Depressive symptoms are usually associated with feelings of helplessness and decreased quality of life, which in turn are associated with low PAM scores, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle. Although this study cannot point to causation, but only to the association of activation and mood, this association is important in itself. It illuminates a possible entry point for breaking the cycle. In other words, caregivers could develop strategies to increase patient activation, thereby reducing depressive symptoms, increasing quality of life, and improving health outcomes  [18] . For example, providing patients with information, clear instructions and specific caretaking tasks might empower them to begin taking a larger role in their self-care. Small successes at these tasks can build confidence and encourage patients to take additional actions, until they are finally able to manage their own healthcare  [29] . Hibbard and Tusler  [30]  showed that offering a workshop in the community setting once a week for two or three hours over a 6-week period could improve patients' ability to manage their healthcare and maintain active and fulfilling lives. Indeed, Hibbard and Cunningham  [31]  reported that participants with increased activation over the study period had lower depression scores over 6 months. In another intervention conducted by Hibbard, Greene and Tusler  [2] , coaches were in telephone contact with patients, instructing them in accordance with their PAM level and building on success at each level to progress to the next level. Deen et al.  [32]  found that a brief intervention focused on improving patient activation levels was successful in a primary care setting and Shively et al.  [33]  reported that among participants with heart failure, a patient activation intervention was successful in improving levels of activation, as well as adherence to medication and health behavior recommendations. The physician can use the PAM concept as a guideline for action. For example, if the physician assesses a patient as being at the equivalent of PAM Level 1 (i.e. does not consider his/her role in health management as being important), the physician can first focus on this aspect and then attempt to empower the patient by offering encouragement and appropriate information regarding what steps the patient can take to improve his/her own health.\n\nRask et al.  [34]  found that patient activation was related to selfcare management among patients with diabetes, similar to the positive association found by Marshall et al.  [17]  among patients with HIV. Indeed, in a retrospective analysis, Remmers et al.  [35]  found that PAM scores were predictive of future health outcomes among diabetic patients.\n\nWhen asked the hypothetical question about help for emotional difficulties, the fact that the majority of participants stated that they would be willing to pursue evaluation, treatment, and followup care for such difficulties by their family physician indicates that the primary care setting could employ such strategies to improve patient compliance and outcomes, and might be a receptive entry point. Deen et al.  [32]  found that patient activation intervention was particularly effective for those with PAM scores at Levels 1 and 2 (i.e., the less activated patients). However, activation can increase at all levels. Harvey et al.  [36]  reported that among participants with and without chronic disease, changes in PAM levels were directly related to changes in health status, e.g., cancer risk, stress and mental health, as well as health behaviors such as exercise, even among those who were at PAM Level 4; indicating that improvement in patient activation leads to better health outcomes. Nagykaldi et al.  [37]  found that engagement in a ''wellness portal'' improved both patient activation and preventive health behaviors among primary care patients.\n\nAn added benefit of improving health-related quality of life and reducing depressive symptoms related to patient activation is the positive impact on utilization of healthcare services. Shively et al.  [33]  found that cardiac patients who participated in their activation intervention group had fewer hospitalizations over the six-month study period. Donald et al.  [38]  reported that as patients with chronic disease became more activated they were less likely to visit their healthcare provider for assistance with their condition.\n\nThe rate of under-diagnosed depression by primary care practitioners noted in this study is similar to that reported previously  [39, 40] . While most physicians correctly identified those who were not depressed, nearly half of the participants who reported depressive symptoms were not identified as depressed by their physicians. The relatively high rate of depressive symptoms and the impact on physical well-being, suggests the importance of providing continuing education to physicians on topics related to mental health. Nearly half of the participants in this study whose PHQ-9 score indicated possible depression (i.e., !10) were not recognized by their physician as being depressed. These individuals might constitute cases of 'hidden depression', which screening with the PHQ-9 could identify for further inquiry and clarification. The apparent contradiction between the findings regarding physician assessment and PHQ-9 scores reflects a limitation of this study. The participants' actual status vis-a `-vis depression diagnosis would be best determined by an acceptable gold-standard, such as the Goldberg Standardized Psychiatric Interview  [41] , Spitzer's Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID)  [42]  or an interviewer-assessed diagnostic standard based on DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorder. This was not possible in the current study, but is recommended for future research. On the other hand, the instruments used here have several practical clinical advantages. They are brief and administration did not require a mental health specialist, which makes them especially suitable for use in primary care practice  [43] . Since there was no significant difference in the rate of depression among those who completed the questionnaires at the clinics and those interviewed by telephone, depression screening via telephone interview could offer a satisfactory and efficient method for detecting depression among community populations.\n\nAdditional limitations of this study were the relatively low response rate and the use of two interview methods. However, the fact that associations between the variables were in the expected directions lends credence to the findings. The fact that both interview methods yielded similar PAM, PHQ-9 and SF-12 scores indicates that this did not affect the findings. While the findings of this study confirm the expected association of PAM scores with depressive symptoms and quality of life measures, it is recommended that the translation of the PAM be validated in Hebrew and in Arabic, for the Israeli population.\n\nAn important note of caution should be drawn from the research of Chubak et al.  [44]  who found that PAM scores fluctuated over time among their patients. The factors determining and affecting patient activation or possibly certain aspects of it, should be investigated further."

Primary care physicians should consider adapting novel healthcare intervention strategies (such as providing clear information, specific instructions and tasks and maintaining telephone contact) to promote patient activation. It is recommended that future research investigate more specific modalities for encouraging patient activation (timing, method and length of intervention), thereby assisting patients to take a greater role in their self-care, foster adherence to treatment and ultimately improve health outcomes."
