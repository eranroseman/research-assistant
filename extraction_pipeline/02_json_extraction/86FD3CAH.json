  "title": "Firearm Storage Practices and Risk Perceptions",
  "abstract": "Introduction: During the past 2 decades, gun owners have become more likely to store household firearms loaded and unlocked, and believe that guns make homes safer rather than more dangerous. Methods: Self-reported household firearm storage practices were described among 2,001 gun owners in relation to whether they report that firearms make homes (1) safer, (2) more dangerous, or (3) it depends. Data were from a probability-based online survey administered in 2015 (completion rate, 55%) and analyzed in 2018. Results: Nearly 60% of gun owners said that guns make homes safer (57.6%, 95% CI=55.1%, 60.1%), 39.9% (95% CI=37.4%, 42.5%) said that it depends (on other factors), and 2.5% (95% CI=1.8%, 3.4%) said that guns make homes more dangerous. A higher proportion of gun owners who reported that they believe guns increase household safety said that they store household firearms loaded and unlocked (39.2%, 95% CI=35.9%, 42.6%), compared with those who thought guns make the home either more dangerous (3.7%, 95% CI=1.3%, 10.1%) or those who thought the effect of guns on household safety depends on additional factors (17.5%, 95% CI=14.7%, 20.7%). Conclusions: Gun owners who are most likely to assert categorically that firearms in the home make homes safer are, as a group, far more likely to store guns in their home loaded and unlocked.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "I n the past 20 years, the fraction of U.S. gun owners who store at least 1 household firearm loaded and unlocked has increased.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  This increase in unsafe storage has occurred in tandem with a growing public perception that guns make homes safer rather than more dangerous, 4-6 and a shift toward owning guns for protection (and away from hunting and sports shooting).  7 To what extent perceptions about firearm-related risk versus benefit are related to how guns in homes are stored is not known. This study is the first to examine this relationship in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults."

      "title": "METHODS",
      "text": "The sample was collected using a web-based survey described in detail elsewhere.  8 In April 2015, a total of 7,318 panel members were drawn from Ipsos' (formerly Growth for Knowledge) KnowledgePanel, which consists of a sampling frame of approximately 55,000 U.S. adults selected using equal probability, address-based sampling.  9 Gun owners and veterans were oversampled from this sampling frame. The survey completion rate was 55%, comparable to other surveys administered by Ipsos, yielding a final sample size of 3,949 gun owners and nongun owners. Analyses presented here are limited to the 2,001 respondents (of 2,072 gun owners) for whom the survey has complete information about both risk perceptions and gun storage practices. The survey was reviewed and approved by the Northeastern University IRB.\n\nGun owners were identified through 2 questions; the first was: Do you or does anyone else you live with currently own any type of guns? This question was followed by, among all respondents who answered in the affirmative: Do you personally own a gun? To evaluate risk perceptions, respondents were asked: Do you think having a gun in the house makes it a safer place to be or a more dangerous place to be? Respondents indicated whether guns in the home make it: safer, more dangerous, it depends, or refused.\n\nGun owners were asked about their storage practices and reasons for gun ownership. Gun owners reported the number of handguns, long guns, or other guns stored loaded, unlocked, or both. For the analyses, this measure was collapsed into 3 mutually exclusive categories: (1) any firearm loaded and unlocked, (2) all firearms unloaded and locked, and (3) everything else. Everything else included gun owners with any firearms stored either loaded and locked, unloaded and unlocked, or both. Gun owners identified their reasons for gun ownership as for protection against strangers, protection against people I know, protection against animals, protection against unspecified agents, hunting, other sporting use, a collection, work, or for some other reason. The measure was recoded into 2 mutually exclusive categories: (1) any gun for protection against people or unspecified agents and (2) reason other than protection against people or unspecified agents.\n\nAll analyses were conducted using Stata, version 15.1 and were weighted with survey weights provided by Ipsos to produce nationally representative estimates of U.S. adults (aged \u226518 years) in 2015. More detail about KnowledgePanel sampling and weighting methods is available elsewhere. 9 First, the unadjusted distribution of gun owner responses to the question about perceptions about guns in the home was described. Next, cross-tabulations and the SUBPOP command were used to describe differences in gun storage practices stratified by household firearm risk perception."

      "title": "RESULTS",
      "text": "Overall, 57.6% (95% CI=55.1%, 60.1%) of gun owners said that guns in the home make it a safer place to be and 39.9% (95% CI=37.4%, 42.5%) said it depends if guns in the home make it safer or more dangerous. Less than 3% of gun owners thought that guns make the home more dangerous (Table  1 ). Among gun owners who believed that a gun in the home makes it safer, the great majority own guns for protection against people (81.8%, 95% CI=79.0%, 84.3%) and own handguns (82.8%, 95% CI=80.0%, 85.3%). By contrast, among those who said it depends, about half own for protection (48.6%, 95% CI=44.5%, 52.7%) and 7 of 10 own handguns (71.9%, 95% CI=68.1%, 75.4%).\n\nGun owners who perceived guns as increasing safety in the home were more likely to store a gun loaded and unlocked (39.2%, 95% CI=35.9%, 42.6%) than to store all guns unloaded and locked (18.3%, 95% CI=15.8%, 21.0%) (Table  2 ). By contrast, more gun owners who indicated that safety depends on additional factors stored all guns unloaded and locked (33.3%, 95% CI=29.6%, 37.2%) compared with any gun loaded and unlocked (17.5%, 95% CI=14.7%, 20.7%). The relationship between risk perception and storage practices did not vary substantively by political ideology or presence of children in the home but was more pronounced among gun owners who owned at least 1 gun for protection and hand gun owners."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this large nationally representative survey, gun owners who think that the risk of firearms in the home is contextually dependent tend to store their guns more safely than gun owners who assert categorically that guns make the home safer. Given that the presence of household guns substantially increases the risk of suicide and unintentional firearm deaths for household members of all ages,  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  and that for children and young adults risk is especially elevated when household guns are stored unlocked (versus locked) and loaded (versus unloaded),  14  it is noteworthy that a larger proportion of gun owners who believe that firearms in the home make homes safer (compared with those who say otherwise) store at least 1 household gun in the least safe manner."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The findings presented here should be considered in light of several limitations. First, given the cross-sectional nature of the data, results reflect only the cooccurrence of risk perception and storage practices (i.e., not the direction of the relationship). Second, the measure of risk perception does not identify what factors respondents believe modify the risk of household guns, factors that future research should try to identify using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Third, although the findings are based on a nationally representative sample, results may nevertheless be susceptible to response bias. This concern is mitigated, to some extent, by the survey completion rate (55%), which is higher than completion rates of most nonprobability, opt-in, online surveys, and far higher than previous national surveys that included questions on firearm ownership.  16, 17 Fourth, self-report surveys, such as in this study, may suffer from social desirability response bias. To the extent that online surveys in general are less subject to such biases than are other forms of eliciting opinions,  18  findings from the survey may be less biased than alternative approaches.\n\n130 15.4 (12.6, 18.7) 30,000-74,999 765 36.6 (34.1, 39.1) 461 38.4 (35.2, 41.8) 14 24.6 (13.3, 40.9) 290 34.6 (30.9, 38.5) 75,000-124,999 600 32.3 (29.9, 34.8) 339 32.0 (28.9, 35.3) 17 32.2 (19.7, 47.8) 244 32.7 (29.1, 36.6) \u2265125,000 335 16.5 (14.8, 18.4) 165 15.1 (12.9, 17.7) 19 36.5 (23.1, 52.3) 151 17.2 (14.6, 20.2) Region Eastern 659 33.1 (30.7, 35.5) 382 33.8 (30.6, 37.1) 14 24.8 (14.6, 39.0) 263 32.5 (28.9, 36.3) Central 927 46.3 (43.8, 48.9) 531 47.4 (44.0, 50.8) 32 55.7 (40.3, 70.2) 364 44.2 (40.3, 48.2) Mountain 165 8.5 (7.2, 10.1) 90 8.1 (6.4, 10.2) 4 10.2 (3.1, 29.1) 71 9.0 (6.9, 11.6) Pacific 250 12.1 (10.6, 13.9) 128 10.7 (8.8, 13.0) 5 9.3 (3.6, 21.8) 117 14.3 (11.7, 17.4) Note: Cross-tabulations using survey weights were used to generate nationally representative estimates.
