  "title": "A Mobile Prenatal Care App to Reduce In-Person Visits: Prospective Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Risk-appropriate prenatal care has been asserted as a way for the cost-effective delivery of prenatal care. A virtual care model for prenatal care has the potential to provide patient-tailored, risk-appropriate prenatal educational content and may facilitate vital sign and weight monitoring between visits. Previous studies have demonstrated a safe reduction in the frequency of in-person prenatal care visits among low-risk patients but have noted a reduction in patient satisfaction. \n Objective: The primary objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of a mobile prenatal care app to facilitate a reduced in-person visit schedule for low-risk pregnancies while maintaining patient and provider satisfaction. Methods: This controlled trial compared a control group receiving usual care with an experimental group receiving usual prenatal care and using a mobile prenatal care app. The experimental group had a planned reduction in the frequency of in-person office visits, whereas the control group had the usual number of visits. The trial was conducted at 2 diverse outpatient obstetric (OB) practices that are part of a single academic center in Washington, DC, United States. Women were eligible for enrollment if they presented to care in the first trimester, were aged between 18 and 40 years, had a confirmed desired pregnancy, were not considered high-risk, and had an iOS or Android smartphone that they used regularly. We measured the effectiveness of a virtual care platform for prenatal care via the following measured outcomes: the number of in-person OB visits during pregnancy and patient satisfaction with prenatal care. Results: A total of 88 patients were enrolled in the study, 47 in the experimental group and 41 in the control group. For patients in the experimental group, the average number of in-person OB visits during pregnancy was 7.8 and the average number in the control group was 10.2 (P=.01). There was no statistical difference in patient satisfaction (P>.05) or provider satisfaction (P>.05) in either group. \n Conclusions: The use of a mobile prenatal care app was associated with reduced in-person visits, and there was no reduction in patient or provider satisfaction.",

      "text": "In the United States, there are nearly 4 million live births each year. This makes prenatal care one of the most widely utilized preventative care health services  [1, 2] . Despite its widespread use, the effectiveness and organization of standard prenatal care has been debated  [3] [4] [5] . Rigorous scientific evidence of the effectiveness of standard prenatal care, including effects on maternal and infant outcomes, health-related behaviors, and health care costs is limited  [2] . In the early mid-1980s, an expert panel recommended stratifying women into high-and low-risk categories, with high-risk women receiving more intensive prenatal care and low-risk women following a reduced visit frequency schedule  [6] . The rationale for this recommendation was that unnecessary visits for low-risk patients consume health care resources that could be applied more judiciously to women with higher-risk pregnancies. However, despite these recommendations, the standard model of prenatal care with high-frequency visits has persisted. Almost a third of low-risk women receive more visits than recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  [7] . The barriers cited by providers for not reducing visits for low-risk pregnancies include the following: concern about decreased patient satisfaction, need for frequent weight and blood pressure monitoring, and concern about reduced transmission of educational information regarding health and lifestyle choices during pregnancy."

The application of mobile phone technology has been shown to improve disease management for diabetes self-care activities, HIV infection medication adherence, and sickle cell anemia medication adherence  [9] [10] [11] . We hypothesize that a similar approach using a mobile app and connected monitoring devices may also be beneficial to manage prenatal care. A pilot trial with 8 patients was performed. This trial ensured the platform and devices functioned appropriately, any blood pressure and weight triggers were identified and managed, a reduced visit schedule was achieved on a small scale, and the platform was satisfactory to patients. The feedback from the pilot guided this investigation  [12] ."

Prenatal care is provided at both locations by OB and GYN physicians and nurse midwives. Low-risk women are cared for by obstetrician-gynecologists at both locations, and all deliveries take place at the GWU hospital in Washington, DC.

As a secondary outcome, all patients were evaluated for satisfaction with their prenatal care experience and pregnancy outcomes. (Multimedia Appendix 2) Patient satisfaction surveys were administered to participants at gestational weeks 16, 20, 25, 30, and 35 and 2 weeks postpartum. Satisfaction survey consisted of 16 questions using a 4-point Likert scale modified from the hospital consumer assessment of health care providers and systems survey instrument  [15]  In addition, 6 questions specific to the Babyscripts platform were submitted to participants in the experimental group. Participants who completed all 6 surveys and responded to all related questionnaires were compensated with a US$20 Amazon gift card at completion of the study. An additional secondary outcome was obtained via a chart review for significant clinical outcomes-preeclampsia, eclampsia, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, other serious outcome per investigator judgment, and route of delivery including cesarean delivery rate.

The educational content was based upon ACOG standards and refined by a committee of 4 board-certified obstetricians at the GWU School of Medicine. Input from a variety of other stakeholders including patients, midwives, and administrators was also obtained. The mobile app sends educational content to the expectant mother at gestation-appropriate times throughout the pregnancy. This information encompasses material covering pregnancy progression; preexisting risk hazards such as alcohol intake, smoking, or drug abuse; advice to address these risk hazards; dietary and nutritional content; breastfeeding information; guidelines for appropriate weight gain; and warning signs for pregnancy complications. In addition, the app integrates with a Wi-Fi-connected scale and blood pressure cuff to provide both feedback and alerts depending on the readings. The alerts were created to provide early warnings to patients and providers about aberrant data points with the hope of providing early detection of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and abnormal weight gain, indicating an increased risk of gestational diabetes, nutritional deficiency, or edema associated with preeclampsia."

Satisfaction scores were aggregated for all 16 questions that were asked to XSL \u2022 FO RenderX participants in both the control and experimental groups at each time point during gestation. For data visualization, the scores were normalized from 0 to 1 and then compared for statistical differences at each time point. Provider surveys demonstrated aggregate scores demonstrating highly perceived quality and satisfaction with the virtual care platform. There was no statistical difference in patient satisfaction (P>.05) or provider satisfaction (P>.05) in either group (Figure  3 ).\n\nAlthough maternal and fetal outcomes were tracked, the study was not powered to demonstrate the effect of the virtual care platform on maternal or fetal outcomes. We identified 1 adverse fetal event of stillbirth at 38 weeks gestation. Investigation of the case revealed that the patient had an uncomplicated pregnancy and was compliant with the prenatal care schedule of the experimental group. Her obstetrician saw her in person within 3 days of the fetal demise at which time normal fetal movement and fetal heart tones were identified. Workup revealed a likely fetal-maternal hemorrhage unrelated to the study protocol."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "Pregnant women represent a promising target for digital health apps. Unlike digital health apps that target chronically ill or elderly populations, pregnant women are a young and healthy population. A mobile health app that targets pregnant women may facilitate the integration of prenatal care into other aspects of their family and professional life. In addition, pregnancy is a unique period of life when healthy behaviors including exercise, diet, and sleep take on greater importance. As such, women are highly engaged with their health care decisions during pregnancy and may be more receptive to educational programs that can be delivered through a mobile health app. Finally, the majority of prenatal care visits are scheduled to exchange educational information with the patient or weight and blood pressure data with the provider. Both of these exchanges are especially amenable to communication via mobile technology or remote monitors. Ultimately, the app does not replace in-person visits but may replace some of the current activities that occur at each visit. If the app can communicate basic educational components of prenatal care, the in-person visits may allow for more individualized discussions.\n\nAs part of this study, several important elements emerged as critical to the success of a mobile prenatal care app. First, the initial assessment is critical to identifying high-risk versus normal-risk on initial assessment; second, accurate communication of patient data to the provider is necessary to assess early signs of pregnancy complications; third, educational information must be provided at the appropriate time during pregnancy; fourth, educational information should be targeted to individual patient (eg, not all women need regular reminders about the importance of smoking cessation); and fifth, a clear explanation that the role of the mobile app is to augment and not replace the obstetrician or midwife."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "There are several limitations to our study. First, the use of a quasi-randomization scheme where participants were allocated by type of phone creates potential confounders, as it is possible that iOS users differ from non-iOS users. However, there was no significant difference in age, race, education level, gravity, or parity between the cohorts. We did not collect data on differences in household income, a possible confounder. The second risk concerns the possibility of contamination across groups. It is possible that by reducing visits in the experimental group, physicians were more likely to reduce the visits in all patients. However, given there was a statistically significant difference in visit schedule, this was unlikely to confound this cohort. Third, the mobile prenatal care app was prescribed as part of the reduced care schedule, and it is unknown if a reduced care schedule might have been effective without the mobile care app or with a different solution. Finally, we have limited information regarding emergency visits or phone calls that may have occurred outside of the chart review or the direct patient calls. It is possible that there were some therapeutic interactions missed in both the control and experimental group."
