  "title": "Cultural adaptation of internet-and mobile-based interventions for mental disorders: a systematic review",
  "abstract": "Providing accessible and effective healthcare solutions for people living in low-and middle-income countries, migrants, and indigenous people is central to reduce the global mental health treatment gap. Internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMI) are considered scalable psychological interventions to reduce the burden of mental disorders and are culturally adapted for implementation in these target groups. In October 2020, the databases PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were systematically searched for studies that culturally adapted IMI for mental disorders. Among 9438 screened records, we identified 55 eligible articles. We extracted 17 content, methodological, and procedural components of culturally adapting IMI, aiming to consider specific situations and perspectives of the target populations. Adherence and effectiveness of the adapted IMI seemed similar to the original IMI; yet, no included study conducted a direct comparison. The presented taxonomy of cultural adaptation of IMI for mental disorders provides a basis for future studies investigating the relevance and necessity of their cultural adaptation.",

      "text": "The World Health Organisation has called to take action in order to address global health inequalities  1  as one of the major global health challenges  [2] [3] [4] [5]  . Particularly when it comes to mental health, the treatment gap in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) is estimated to be far higher than that in high-income countries: Whereas ~76-85% of people with a serious mental disorder living in LMIC do not get treated, ~35-50% of people living in highincome countries do not get treated  1, 6, 7  . Similarly, migrants and refugees make less use of mental health services  [8] [9] [10]  , although they face many stressors before, during, and after migration  11  and show an increased prevalence of mental disorders  [12] [13] [14]  . Such a mental health treatment gap can also be observed in indigenous people, caused by lower mental health  15, 16  and lower use of health services  17  . In order to improve global health equality, existing barriers of these populations need to be addressed on a structural and individual level.\n\nExisting structural barriers, such as a lack of mental health services and difficulties in accessing services  [18] [19] [20] [21]  , could be reduced by low intensity interventions  [22] [23] [24] [25]  . Low intensity interventions are interventions aiming to be easy to access by a high number of people, due to a resource-saving and flexible delivery (e.g., self-help interventions, interventions delivered by nonprofessionals)  26  . Internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMI) as one kind of low intensity intervention offer anonymity, temporal and local independency, easy accessibility, and scalability  [27] [28] [29] [30]  and are thus suggested to hold potential in overcoming structural healthcare barriers  31, 32  . Despite reports of lower treatment completion rates  33  , IMI have been proven effective in preventing and treating mental disorders  [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]  . However, they were mostly developed for and evaluated in majority populations from high-income countries, and were found to be less effective for people with a differing cultural or ethnic background  39  . When it comes to the use of healthcare, populations living in LMIC, as well as migrants, refugees, or indigenous people face a range of individual barriers, such as language and cultural barriers (e.g., understanding of disease and treatment processes) or poor knowledge on the healthcare system  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 40  . The e individual barriers may be reduced by considering cultural aspects in the intervention development, i.e., including knowledge on potential cultural differences  41  . However, newly developing interventions for each population requires significant effort. A more resourcesaving possibility could be to use the high number of already existing and evaluated psychological treatments and to culturally adapt them for the new target groups  42, 43  .\n\nA cultural adaptation should be conducted in a structured, systematic way by following adaptation guidelines  44, 45  . Various research groups established such guidelines, focussing (a) on specific treatment components that should be culturally adapted  [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51]  , or (b) on the procedure that should be followed to gradually adapt the treatment  45, [52] [53] [54]  . The Ecological Validity Framework by Bernal et al.  47  was the first model describing in detail what to culturally adapt. The authors recommended the consideration of eight intervention components, including language (translation, differences in regional or subcultural groups), persons (patient-therapist relationship, roles), metaphors (symbols, sayings), content (values, customs, traditions), concepts (theoretical model of the treatment), goals (agreement of therapist and patient), methods (procedures for achieving the treatment goals), and context (broader social, economic, and political contexts). This model was widely reused and can be seen as a base for later frameworks. For example, Resnicow et al.  50 ifferentiated the components to adapt into surface characteristics, such as language, locations, and persons, and deep structure characteristics of treatment, which comprise the inclusion of cultural, social, environmental, and historical factors to consider the understanding of disease and its treatment of the respective clients, such as cultural values (e.g., family) and specific stressors (e.g., racism). Regarding frameworks on the procedure of culturally adapting treatments, Barrera and Castro summarised various suggestions of other frameworks in their Heuristic Framework for the Cultural Adaptations of Interventions  54  . They describe the procedural components of how to culturally adapt by (1)  gathering information by literature searches or qualitative research, (2) developing a preliminary adaptation based on this information, (3) testing the preliminary adaptation in case or pilot studies, and (4) refining the adaptation based on the findings of case or pilot studies.\n\nConsidering both the suggested content and procedural components of cultural adaptation intends to facilitate access to psychological treatments for people with a cultural background differing from that of the original target group  44  . Correspondingly, findings of meta-analyses aiming to investigate the relevance and necessity of cultural adaptation suggest that, in populations that the intervention was originally not developed for, culturally adapted treatments are more effective as compared to nonadapted versions of the treatment  55, 56  . The higher the extent of cultural adaptation, the higher seems their effectiveness  57, 58  . Based on this revealed relevance of culturally adapting face-toface treatments, it may also be of relevance to culturally adapt IMI to reach out to people with a cultural background differing from the original target group  25, 59, 60  . Various research groups culturally adapted IMI to fit new target groups and showed their effectiveness  [61] [62] [63]  . Furthermore, a meta-analysis indicated that an enhanced cultural adaptation of an IMI was associated with its increased effectiveness in the respective target group  59  . However, studies directly comparing the effectiveness or acceptance of culturally adapted versus non-/less-adapted IMI are lacking  59, [64] [65] [66]  , which would allow for drawing conclusions on the added value of cultural adaptation. A precondition for such comparison trials and for examining the relevance of adapting specific components following a specific procedure would be a systematic and welldocumented adaptation  67, 68  . Yet, components and procedures considered in the cultural adaptation of IMI are often only poorly reported  [69] [70] [71] [72] [73]  . Thus, research on the cultural adaptation of IMI is still in its early stages  66  , and there is a particular lack of knowledge on specific aspects of IMI that might need cultural adaptation in addition to the components adapted in face-to-face treatments. In this context, following aspects of evaluation frameworks of IMI could provide an orientation, such as methodological components to enhance the user engagement with the IMI, its ease of use, or design and aesthetics  [74] [75] [76]  .\n\nThus, this review aims to\n\n(1) systematically identify and summarise content, methodological, and procedural components considered in the previous cultural adaptations of IMI for mental disorders; (2) summarise results on the adherence and effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI.\n\nBy providing a taxonomy on the cultural adaptation of IMI, this review may inform researchers on systematically developing scalable interventions for underserved people."

      "title": "Components of cultural adaptation",
      "text": "Various components of which the authors reported the cultural adaptation were identified across the included articles and grouped in distinguishable aspects of culturally adapting IMI. Using the frameworks of previous literature as a base  47, 54, [74] [75] [76]  , the classification had been continuously refined in the course of data synthesis, resulting in ten content, four methodological, and three procedural components that provided qualitative information on the cultural adaptation of IMI for mental disorders. Generally, the consideration of these components was used by the authors to enhance the fit of the IMI to the context, lives, and burdens of the new target group. Across all interventions averaged consideration of content (68.8%) versus methodological (69.0%) versus procedural (66.7%) components was comparable with 68.5% of all components being considered. The 17 components of culturally adapting IMI that were identified across the articles are illustrated in Table  2 , including specific adaptation examples of the articles. A more detailed illustration of the conducted adaptations of each IMI can be found in Supplementary Table  5 . An overview of the 17 components illustrating the respective extent of consideration across the articles is provided in Fig.  2 .\n\nRegarding content components, (1) an important element to adapt were the characters illustrated in the IMI (adapted in 35 of 42 interventions). (2) Alongside the characters, activities were added, removed, or tailored to make them relevant to the target group (25/42 IMI). (3) Furthermore, environments, settings, and, associated with this, specific burdens illustrated in the IMI were adapted (36/42 IMI). (  4 ) Related to these aspects, researchers changed the content to accommodate culturally relevant values and traditions (28/42 IMI). Beside the adaptation of the daily life illustrated in the IMI, language adaptation was considered important: (5) numerous studies translated the entire intervention into the main language or the regional dialect of the target group (35/42 IMI). In addition, language and texts were (6) tailored to the target group (34/42 IMI), and (7) visualised with appropriate quotes, symbols, and metaphors (18/42 IMI). (  8 ) When culturally adapting their IMI, researchers also considered potential differences in the target groups' concepts of mental health and its treatment (26/42 IMI). Correspondingly, (9) the aims (23/42 IMI) and (10) the used treatment methods in the IMI (27/42 IMI) were changed occasionally.\n\nRegarding methodological components of cultural adaptation, (11) the general structure of IMI was adapted (34/42 IMI). (  12 ) Also, researchers adapted their IMI to enhance its functionality and ease of use for the specific target group (26/42 IMI), e.g., by including interactive elements or simplifying the navigation. (  13 ) Moreover, the design and the aesthetics were adjusted (34/42 IMI). (  14 ) As another aspect of culturally adapting IMI, researchers have changed the format or amount of guidance (22/42 IMI).\n\nWith regard to the procedure of cultural adaptation, (15) researchers used a wide range of methods to obtain information about necessary cultural adaptations of their IMI and about the adequacy of the conducted adaptations (32/42 IMI used at least two different methods). (  16 ) During the cultural adaptation process, different people were involved, including healthcare professionals or the target group itself (32/42 IMI involved at least two groups of people). (17) Many authors also based their adaptation process on theoretical frameworks for cultural adaptations of face-to-face therapies (20/42 IMI)."

Cultural adaptations were done to illustrate relatable situations (e.g., persons, activities), to fit the characteristics of the communities (e.g., collectivism, values, traditions), to consider specific risk factors for low mental health (e.g., burdens due to migration, war, discrimination, and\n\nIp (2016)  93  / Sobowale (2013\n\n82.4 Kaal (2020) 82 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\u2713 9 52.9 Kanuri (2020) 96 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 8 47.1 Kayrouz (2015/2016) 97-99 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 11 64.7 Knaevelsrud (2015) 61 / V\u00f6hringer (2020) 144 / Wagner (2012) 95 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 7 41.2 Lal (2020) 131 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 11 64.7 Lindegaard (2020) 63 / Nygren (2018) 134 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 15 88.2 Luo (2021) 132 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 9 52.9 Muroff (2017/2019) 105,133 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 13 76.5 Nygren (2019) 135 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 11 64.7 Okujava (2019) 84 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 12 70.6 Paris (2018) 100 / Silva (in prep) 140 / Silva (2020) 101 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 14 82.4 Patel (2016) 136 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 12 70.6 Pinto-Bruno (2019) 137 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 5 29.4 Rahmadiana (2019) 79 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 14 82.4 Salamanca-Sanabria (2019/ 2020) 73,138\n\n88.2 Titov (2018) 77 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 7 41.2 \u00dcnl\u00fc Ince (2013) 94 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 7 41.2 Wang (2013) 88 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 3 17.7 Wasil (2020) 83 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 10 58.8 Yokomitsu (2020) 85 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 7 41.2 Total 11.6 68.2 Char illustrated characters, Act illustrated activities, Env illustrated places/environment/burdens, Val illustrated values/traditions, Tran language translation, Tail language tailoring, Vis visualisation of language, Con mental health (treatment) concepts, Goal goals of treatment, Meth methods of treatment, Stru structure, Fun functionality, Des design/aesthetics, Guid guidance, Inf \u2265 2 methods to obtain information, Per \u2265 2 persons involved in CA, Fram theoretical framework for CA.

Twenty-eight studies, including 14 (randomised) controlled trials, evaluated the culturally adapted IMI in terms of adherence and/or effectiveness for the new target group. Adherence rates and effect sizes of randomised controlled trials seem to be comparable to both those found in the studies on the respective original IMI (see Table  4 ), and those found in studies investigating the adherence and effectiveness of IMI in general  36, 107  . However, enrolment and adherence rates of IMI are generally low  [108] [109] [110]  . Above that, we could not identify any study on a direct comparison of a culturally adapted with a non-adapted IMI. Hence, we believe it is premature to conclude that cultural adaptation is a prerequisite to make IMI work in people living in LMIC, migrants, or indigenous people. Our taxonomy of cultural adaptation of IMI may provide a base for future researchers to systematically adapt IMI by considering the 17 identified components. The included ten content components overlap with components that are culturally adapted in face-to-face psychological treatments  47  . Thus, both surface (e.g., the adaptation of characters, activities, and language) and deep (e.g., the adaptation of burdens, values, mental health concepts, and goals and methods of treatment) structure adaptations were shown to be important  50  . Also, the three procedural components seem to reflect the procedure proposed in the adaptation of faceto-face psychological treatments  54  . Accordingly, the study investigators used multiple methods to obtain information from various groups of people (e.g., mental health experts, target group) on necessary adaptations of the IMI, including focus groups and feasibility trials. Thereby, about half of the IMI were adapted following theoretical frameworks of cultural adaptation of face-toface treatments. However, in addition to the content and procedural components, we identified four unique methodological components specifically considered in the cultural adaptation of IMI. These include components related to the structure (e.g.,  Twenty-two included articles provided relevant information on the effect of their intervention. If more than one primary outcome was reported, the effect size of the Patient Health Questionnaire 102 is illustrated. Both single group studies and randomised controlled trials are included. Full information on the respective effect sizes can be found in Table  4 .\n\nshortened text sequences or modules), functionality (e.g., the consideration of a potentially bad internet connection), design and aesthetics (e.g., the amount or design of pictures), and human guidance (e.g., level of guidance). Hence, it may not be sufficient to rely on existing frameworks for cultural adaptation of face-toface treatments when culturally adapting IMI, as also highlighted by Lal et al.  72  and implemented by  Burchert et al. 111  .\n\nBy enabling a systematic cultural adaptation of IMI, our taxonomy on cultural adaptation of IMI can furthermore serve as a base to measure the extent and type of cultural adaptation, and thus can lay an initial foundation for further examining the relevance and necessity of the cultural adaptation of (specific elements of) IMI. This relevance and necessity of cultural adaptation could differ, for example, depending on the target group, the addressed disorder, or the language of the IMI. Conducted exploratory post hoc analyses indicate that culturally adapting IMI for people with a migrant background and people living in LMIC might be more important as compared to culturally adapting IMI for new target groups in western countries, especially with respect to content components. However, in the current systematic review, no link between the extent of the conducted cultural adaptations, and the effectiveness or adherence of the IMI was revealed. The analyses should be interpreted with caution, as the present systematic review included very heterogeneous IMI and did not yield sufficient outcome data. Even with more randomised controlled trials included in meta-analyses, the heterogeneity of interventions studied remains mostly very high, making it difficult to draw conclusions on the influence of specific intervention characteristics or components of cultural adaptation on the effectiveness of the IMI. Thus, questions on possible differences in the necessity of cultural adaptation and its influence on the effectiveness of IMI could be addressed in other study designs. By using randomised factorial trials  112, 113  , different versions of the same IMI that were systematically culturally adapted to varying degrees could be tested against each other. For example, deep structure content components versus surface structure content components versus no content components of an IMI could be culturally adapted. The effectiveness of each of the versions could then be evaluated and compared, herewith enabling to draw conclusions on the benefit of culturally adapting these specific components. Some limitations of this systematic review need to be considered. First, we excluded studies that did not report (n = 14) or provide details on (n = 6) their cultural adaptation. At the same time, we excluded grey literature with potential unpublished reports on conducted cultural adaptation. This might have led to biased findings and hindered us from drawing conclusions on a potential influence of the (extent of) cultural adaptation of IMI on the adherence or effectiveness of the respective IMI. Second, we also excluded studies that newly developed culturally sensitive IMI for a target group of people living in LMIC, migrants, or indigenous people (n = 32), in contrast to studies that culturally adapted previously used and evaluated IMI. Yet, the 17 components of the taxonomy of cultural adaptation might also be helpful in the development of culturally sensitive IMI. Thus, it may be a fruitful next step to conduct a review on the development of culturally sensitive IMI and compare the results with the current review. Third, the wide range of target groups in our review makes it difficult to interpret the findings across all included target groups. Following the cultural diversity approach 114 , the necessary extent and depth of culturally adapting IMI may differ between target groups, also depending on the similarities and differences between the original and new target groups. Fourth, although we extracted and summarised aspects of cultural adaptation that the authors have reported to be adapted in order to enhance the cultural fit, we cannot fully rule out that there might have been other reasons (e.g., resources of the researchers and technical innovations). Fifth, the choice of the two cultural adaptation models used as a basis for data extraction  47, 54  was not based on a systematic approach, but mainly on the frequent use of the models in previous research. Sixth, as the extracted components of cultural adaptation represent differing intensities of adaptation (surface structure adaptations, such as language translation, versus deep structure adaptations, such as the consideration of differences in the concepts of mental health and its treatment), the extent to which the components are considered is not equal to the extensiveness of cultural adaptation. Seventh, reliability regarding data extraction and data synthesis was not evaluated and may thus be limited."

To provide impactful interventions, an efficient and systematic cultural adaptation is central  24  . The present systematic review illustrates a taxonomy of 17 components of culturally adapting IMI, making them more relatable to the new target group by considering their specific context, burdens, and understanding of mental health. This taxonomy can serve as a base for the systematic cultural adaptation of IMI. The next steps should be to investigate the relevance and necessity of a systematic cultural adaptation of IMI, which could help provide adequate and effective mental healthcare to underserved populations, herewith contributing to reduce global public mental health inequalities."
