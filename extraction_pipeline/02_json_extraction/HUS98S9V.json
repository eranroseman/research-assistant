  "title": "Text Messaging Interventions for Reducing Alcohol Consumption Among Harmful and Hazardous Drinkers: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile phone-based interventions have become popular for lifestyle behavior change, particularly the use of text messaging as it is a technology ubiquitous in mobile phones. Reviews and meta-analyses of digital interventions for reducing harmful and hazardous use of alcohol have mainly focused on Web-based interventions; thus, there is a need for a body of evidence to guide health practitioners, policy makers, and researchers with respect to the efficacy of available text messaging interventions. \n Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of text messaging interventions for reducing the amount of alcohol consumed among harmful and hazardous drinkers; this is compared to receiving no, minimal, or unrelated health information. Specifically, we ask the following questions: (1) Can interventions consisting of only text messages be effective in reducing alcohol consumption compared to no intervention or a minimal or unrelated intervention? (2) Can interventions consisting of only text messages be effective in reducing the prevalence of risky drinking compared to no intervention or a minimal or unrelated intervention? Methods: Several databases will be searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index, ClinicalTrials.gov, OpenGrey, among others. Reports of studies that evaluate text messaging interventions for reducing the amount of alcohol consumed will be included. Primary outcomes of interest will be weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of heavy episodic drinking. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool will be used to assess bias in reports, and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. A narrative review will be presented, and a meta-analysis will be conducted in case of homogeneity among included studies. \n Results: The systematic review has not yet begun but is expected to start in May of 2019; publication of the final review and meta-analysis is expected at the end of 2019. \n Conclusions: The technology for text messaging is ubiquitous in mobile phones; thus, the potential reach of interventions utilizing this technique is great. However, there are no meta-analyses to date that limit the scope to the use of text messaging interventions for alcohol consumption reduction. Therefore, the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis will help health practitioners, policy decision makers, researchers, and others to better understand the effects of these interventions.",

      "text": "Hazardous drinking, defined as a quantity or pattern of consumption that places an individual at risk for adverse health events  [1] , is a modifiable behavior that increases the risk of noncommunicable diseases  [2] . Noncommunicable diseases are responsible for 70% of deaths globally each year, of which cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes account for over 80%  [3, 4] . Recent evidence suggests that alcohol consumption at any level increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, fatal hypertensive disease, fatal aortic aneurysm, and coronary disease, excluding myocardial infarction, but may on the other hand have a protective effect on myocardial infarction  [5] .\n\nHarmful drinking, defined as consumption of alcohol that results in physical or psychological harm  [1] , may lead to injury, road traffic accidents, violence, and social and economic burdens, as well as having a causal relationship with a range of mental and behavioral disorders  [6] . Harmful use of alcohol contributes to 5.9% of deaths globally, and as much as 25% of total deaths in the age group 20-39 years are attributable to harmful drinking  [2, 7] . Furthermore, harmful use of alcohol is the seventh-leading risk factor for disability-adjusted life years and is the leading risk factor of death among those aged 15-49 years  [8] ."

      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines eHealth as the use of information and communication technologies for health, including electronic health records, patient management systems, ecological monitoring, robotics, lab systems, informatics, etc. By extension, eHealth interventions can be understood as interventions that promote health using information and communication technologies. With the global growth of mobile phone subscriptions-in 2016, it was estimated that 95% of the global population resided in an area with a mobile-cellular network  [9] -a subfield of eHealth called mHealth (ie, mobile health) has emerged  [10] . Continuous contact with individuals, interactivity, and cost reductions are only some of the benefits that mHealth interventions may be associated with.\n\nText messaging, more formally known as short message service (SMS), is a technology ubiquitous in mobile phones. The technology does not rely on data networks such as 3G or 4G, which usually incur extra costs for end users and may be unavailable in certain areas, but runs on networks utilizing earlier standards such as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), which are generally more available and cheaper. Thus, there is potentially a great reach for lifestyle interventions that utilize text messaging.\n\nTrials of text messaging for smoking cessation have shown positive results  [11] [12] [13] , and a Cochrane review reported a beneficial impact of mobile phone-based smoking cessation programs  [14] , most of which were text message based. However, while there have been evaluations of text messaging interventions for alcohol consumption reduction  [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , there have been no meta-analyses regarding the use of text messaging programs for reducing alcohol consumption, despite the need to collect evidence and provide guidance on these types of interventions."

      "title": "Digital Interventions for Alcohol Reduction",
      "text": "Previous meta-analyses of digital interventions targeting harmful and hazardous use of alcohol have mainly focused on trials of electronic screening and brief interventions  [20] [21] [22] [23] . Commonly, individuals engaging with this type of intervention respond to a series of questions, after which a summary of their alcohol habits is presented; feedback is then given with respect to recommended drinking levels, alongside some advice on behavior change. The focus was broadened in a Cochrane review to include all digital interventions  [24] , which identified moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption; however, the authors emphasize that \"Most included trials tested Web-based interventions, so the effectiveness of other types of interventions such as smartphone apps or SMS messages is less clear.\" Thus, there still exists a knowledge gap with respect to the efficacy of text messaging interventions. A recent systematic review  [25]  supported the use of mHealth interventions to address substance use; however, while included trials of interventions were delivered in a variety of formats (eg, Web based, text messaging, and mobile phone apps), overall effectiveness in a meta-analysis was not quantified."

However, studies that include participants who are obviously receiving care for their alcohol consumption (eg, patients in a treatment program) will not be included. The aim is to assess the effect of text messaging interventions as the main intervention, not as a cointervention to other treatment programs. Recruitment can be done through different means (eg, through email, workplaces, at emergency rooms, and in primary care settings).

Only studies where a text message intervention is the sole intervention will be considered; therefore, studies of interventions where text messages are combined with other interventions (eg, therapy or pharmaceutical treatment) will be excluded.\n\nIn cases where the intervention targets multiple behaviors or conditions (eg, smoking and depression), the study report will be included if participants were screened into the trial (ie, nonharmful and nonhazardous drinkers were excluded) and alcohol consumption outcomes are available."

Basic health information. For instance, this includes participants allocated to the control setting that were given basic information about the risks of alcohol at the time of randomization and possibly contacted with similar information at intervals throughout the period, however, at a lower frequency than twice a week, on average. 3 . Referred to self-help. For instance, this includes participants allocated to the control setting that were told that they should access a website for more information and help or that they should contact their primary health care provider, etc. Additional contact in the form of reminders at a lower frequency than twice a week, on average, is acceptable. 4 .

Some countries include a time period during which the units should have been consumed, however, we will not take any action to account for this difference. What also may differ is the use of fixed-response options (eg, Once or twice a week) or a numerical measure. We will convert all data to monthly assessments, converting fixed-response options to numerical measures by taking mean values and multiplying appropriately, for example, Once or twice a week would be (1 + 2)/2 \u00d7 4 = 6."

Differences will first be discussed; if no consensus is found, then a third team member will arbitrate. The tool assesses several sources of bias, including selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting. This is done by judging the sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, etc. The assessment will result in a low risk, high risk, or uncertain risk classification of each included trial.\n\nThe publication in which each included trial was initially published will be scrutinized for predatory behavior, since predatory publications usually apply less rigor in their review practices. If a publication is found to be predatory, either through Cochrane's list of predatory publications or the website Stop Predatory Journals  [30] , then we will consider removing the trial completely or classifying the trial as high risk."

The two primary continuous outcomes-weekly consumption and heavy episodic drinking-will be analyzed using weighted mean differences with 95% CI. Transformed data will be back-transformed, and reports of medians will be taken as the best approximator of the mean; ranges will be converted to standard deviations, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews  [28] . 2 . The secondary dichotomous outcome will be analyzed in terms of relative risk with 95% CI and pooled in a meta-analysis using Mantel-Haenzel weighting.\n\nSince individuals randomized is the primary unit of analysis, the interclass correlation coefficient will be extracted from reports on cluster randomized trials and results modified according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews.\n\nIn studies where outcomes have been assessed more than once, we will use data from the first postintervention analysis. For instance, an intervention might last for 12 weeks and have assessments at 6, 12, and 18 weeks. In this case, the 12-week assessment will be the primary assessment in the meta-analysis.
