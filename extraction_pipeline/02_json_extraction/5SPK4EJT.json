  "title": "Building health service management workforce capacity in the era of health informatics and digital health -A scoping review",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Health informatics and digital health, two rapidly growing disciplines, are becoming increasingly important to the sustainability of health service provision, highlighted especially through the COVID-19 pandemic. To maximise the benefits of the adoption and growth of health informatics and digital health, health service managers play a critical role in leading and managing the implementation and transformation of the system, both strategically and operationally, whilst still needing to manage 'business as usual'. Objectives: The objectives of the paper are to present and discuss the findings from a scoping review identifying: 1) competencies required for health service managers leading the implementation and transformation of informatics and digital technology in the health sector; and 2) factors that are critical to building the management workforce capacity in the era of health informatics and digital health. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was conducted in 2020 focussing on identifying empirical articles published in the English language since the year 2000 using a number of keywords such as 'health informatics', 'digital health', 'electronic health', 'competencies', 'capability', 'proficiency', 'qualification', 'certification', 'health manager', 'health executive' and 'health administrator'. The literature search was guided by a PRISMA approach searching within eight databases: Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, PubMed, Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations. Results: After duplicates were removed, 941 publications were included for title screening as the result of an initial review. Title screening selected 185 articles to be included for abstract screening by two reviewers confirming 19 papers relevant to the focus of the current paper which were included in data extraction and content analysis. The analysis identified the additional competency of 'information and data management' be included as a core competency for health service managers. The analysis also confirmed additional elements for the following four core management competencies that are important to health service managers working in the digital health context, including: 1) leadership; 2) operational and resource management; 3) personal, interpersonal and professional qualities, and 4) understanding the industry and environment. Factors that are critical to developing the system and organization capacity in the use of health informatics and digital health technology, and leading and managing the adoption in the healthcare organizations were identified in three categories: 1) policy/system; 2) organizational structure and processes; and 3) people factors. Conclusions: This paper has taken an important step in confirming the competency requirements for health services managers that are relevant to leading and managing in the health informatics and digital health space, consequently indicating the directions for developing a competent workforce in meeting the existing and emerging healthcare delivery challenges, both now and in the future.",

      "text": "Health informatics and digital health, two rapidly growing disciplines, are becoming more important to the sustainability of health service provision in the last two decades  [1] . The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented swift adoption of digital health technologies as health professionals and health systems needed to rapidly adopt methods of maintaining service delivery during periods of social distancing and lockdowns  [2] . A significant focus on the implementation of digital health was witnessed during the pandemic, related to the use of communication technologies such as audio and video conferencing. Digital health, however, has the potential to offer a far wider range of Fig.  1 . Trend in publications relating to digital health, health informatics and digital health competencies based on Google Scholar citations. While health informatics was initially the dominant field (based on citations), digital health surpassed this in 2011. The pandemic saw a resurgence of interest in digital health but did not appear to affect health informatics. The interest in digital health competencies represents a small subset of digital health publications and has sustained exponential growth between 2000 and 2021. service delivery change than what has been adopted to date  [1, 2] . The rest of the decade is likely to see a focus on the delivery of value for other aspects of patient care such as chronic disease.\n\nThe term digital health is becoming progressively predominant in the literature and health care generally  [3] . The analysis of the citations listed in Google Scholar indicates that there has been a constant growth in the number of health informatics publications between 2000 and 2021, from approximately 4,490 citations in 2000 to 29,400 in 2021 (see Fig.  1 ). There was no apparent increase in publications associated with the pandemic.\n\nThe growth in digital health, however, has surpassed that of health informatics. Analysis of the google citation indicates that the growing interest in digital health has not been constant over the last two decades (Fig.  1 ). Between the years 2000 and 2012 there was exponential interest in digital health based on citations listed in Google Scholar and no effect of the Global Financial Crisis can be seen. The period of 2014-2018 marked a lower level of interest in digital, with strong growth occurring when the pandemic occurred.\n\nThe increase in interest in digital health competency-related publications can be gauged from the proportion of citations that relate to digital health competencies (see Fig.  2 ). Until 2013, interest in competencies represented approximately-one per cent of all digital health publications. Since 2014 there has been continued growth in the interest in digital health competencies with a doubling of the growth of the proportion of citations relating to competencies occurring since the pandemic. This can be seen in the context of the urgency to operationally respond to the pandemic and \"the implementation of digital health technologies to support continuity of high-quality primary care provision\"  [4] .\n\nHowever, the implementation is not without challenges. Many existing challenges to the adoption of digital health solutions, including workforce related challenges have been identified  [5] , and the inevitable transformation of health workers' roles requiring a digitally competent health workforce to be developed  [6] . As digital health competencies evolve, further advancement of health informatics and health service management competencies is required. To maximise the benefits of the adoption and growth of health informatics and digital health, one particularly pertinent question is whether health service managers have the capacity to lead and manage the implementation and transformation at the system level, both strategically and operationally, whilst still needing to manage 'business as usual'.\n\nHealth service managers must face the challenge of exponential growth in digital health literacy as well as how to plan and manage the digital tools and technologies in a changing landscape  [7, 8] . They need capabilities and relevant competencies to apply these new technologies to assist in informing both strategic and operational decision-making  [9, 10, 11] . A flurry of new positions such as Chief Digital Officer (CDO), Chief Clinical Information Officer (CCIO) and Chief Health Information Officer (CHIO) have emerged to reflect the changing landscape and skills required by healthcare executives  [12] . There is increasing evidence regarding the importance of investing in developing a competent health service management workforce, through professional institution certifications and academic credentialing  [13] . Additionally, various management competency frameworks instantiated to guide developing the competence of health service managers have been published and utilised  [14, 15] . However, whether these frameworks can guide the development of health service managers' understanding, effective scale-up and management, of health informatics and digital health, remains unanswered.\n\nIn 2016, the Australian Digital Health Agency stated that \"A workforce confidently using digital health technologies to deliver health and care will be required to address the technology adoption challenge \u2026 and embrace the changes and opportunities created by digital health innovation\"  [16] . However, there is a significant gap in the readiness of the Australian health and health management workforce to engage with digital health and health informatics. The Australasian Institute of Digital Health submission to the 2022-23 Australian Federal Budget  [17]  stated that \"Currently, the health sector lacks a critical mass of personnel with technical expertise in computing and data harvesting, storage, and analysis\". Evidence cited included data from a prepandemic survey where 42 % of health professionals reported interest in digital health and only 15 % self-identified as having any expertise  [18] . It is therefore timely to examine the changing competency requirements for health services managers that enable them to lead and manage in the changing ecosystem of digital health, and the specific competencies needed to develop a capable health informatics and digital health workforce.\n\nThe objectives of this paper are to present and discuss the findings from a scoping review identifying: 1) competencies required for health service managers in leading the implementation and transformation of informatics and digital technology in the health sector; and 2) factors that are critical to building the management workforce capacity in the era of health informatics and digital health, that need to be developed."

      "title": "Competencies required for health service managers working in the digital health context",
      "text": "As discussed earlier, the existence of core competencies for health service managers has been well recognised. However, in the continually evolving healthcare context, detailed requirements for each of the core competencies need to be periodically revised. The scoping review has confirmed that the new competency of 'information and data management' is to be included  [8, 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , and that additional elements are to be incorporated into the four recognised core competencies for health service managers  [13, 15, 40 ]: 1) leadership; 2) operational and resource management; 3) personal, interpersonal and professional qualities; and 4) understanding the industry and environment  [8, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .\n\nThe constant financial constraint and growing healthcare needs call for healthcare innovation. From a leadership perspective, a strong interest in technology and a demonstrated commitment to innovation and change are important for providing health services in the future  [21, 23]  which, \"demands new forms of innovation competence\"  [22] . From an operational and resource management perspective, the commitment to allocating and managing specific resources to enable innovation has been linked to maintaining a competitive organization  [22] . Further, a demonstrated ability to facilitate and enable the development of strategies and educational programs for digital health readiness has been found to enhance overall health workforce competency development  [24] .\n\nThe personal, interpersonal and professional qualities required of a health service manager are diverse and dynamic  [41] . In the digital health context, managers are required to have the ability to work effectively with the newly emerging digital workforce, enabling integration with the existing teams, together with a thorough grasp of their professional development needs  [24, 42] . This may not have been developed via the formal and informal training that they have received nor included in their management position description. The demand for managers' abilities to access and use data to support decision-making has become greater to \"assist in navigating a rapidly changing healthcare delivery system\"  [8] . Key requirements for successful management in the digital health environment include a sound understanding of the industry and environment  [43] , and an understanding of the legal system for information management  [25] .\n\nDammann  [44]  argues that \"Data, information, and knowledge are central concepts in health informatics and data science\", which provides context for this study's findings that, central to digital health management are the concepts of firstly, understanding data governance, access and translation  [27] . Next, the ability to develop the right system for data management  [25] , as well as having a systematic awareness of informatics and technologies across the organization  [26] . A fundamental understanding of core informatics concepts and their utility to patient care and professional collaboration, includes how digital health information ecosystems promote the provision of quality care  [24] . An understanding of privacy and release-of-information requirements to ensure patient's or consumer's confidence in the security of their personal health information, are hallmarks of safe, clinical decision-making  [25]  and key attributes required of successful health service managers  [8] . Finally, this scoping review found that a manager's ability to analyse, evaluate and maintain the information systems employed, are key contributors to effective and efficient healthcare organizations  [26] ."

      "title": "Factors critical to building system and organization capacity",
      "text": "The importance of building system and organization capacity is a known strategic success factor for healthcare enterprises  [41] . This study identified key factors that are critical to building digital health specific system and organization capacity, in the following three categories: 1) policy/system attributes; 2) organizational structure and processes; and 3) people factors.\n\nAdapting policy and system attributes includes a focus on digital policy processes that assure a comprehensive health policy dialogue leading to well defined goals  [34] . Governing rules, regulations and organisational policies are required to protect data privacy and integrity  [41] , especially in the digital health enterprise  [33, 38] . Strong trust in the organizational technical infrastructure and applications is important to provide a sound foundation for operating in the digital health environment  [34] . It was also well recognised that support and investment in both socio-economic and regulatory impact assessments provided surety in digital investment decisions  [34] , and that support and investment in infrastructure development at both a system and organization level are equally important  [34] . Adapting existing tools to educate health professionals about the challenges of the information age and providing capability development in context is important for the health workforce  [30, 33] . Burton-Jones, et al.  [45]  also argue that evaluating digital health transformations is important for both the significant investment involved and the associated potential consequences, and that creating a shared online repository of measurement instruments is a recommended activity to support building digital health specific, system and organisational capacity  [39] .\n\nContextual and effective healthcare organizational structures and processes are foundational for the delivery of quality care outcomes  [41] . In the digital age, factors that facilitate system and organizational capacity, identified in this study, include information systems harmonising with existing workflows  [30] , along with effective and timely technical and expert support, to facilitate efficient communication across the organization and amongst users  [29] . Importantly, the need to minimise the risks associated with the adoption of digital health technology has emerged  [29] . Factors to build system capacity include:\n\n1) optimising the use of existing digital resources  [30] , while developing a consistent platform for technology integration of business, clinical, workforce and financial systems  [38] ; 2) empowering users to take up innovation and embrace change  [30] ,\n\nwith a clear focus on health professional and stakeholder needs and benefits  [34] , supported by a stronger emphasis on leadership and accountability  [37] ; and 3) having system enablers for the development of organisational digital capacity including, a robust mechanism and framework to identify, prioritise and support the introduction of system-wide clinical analytic initiatives and streamlining the data process framework  [38, 44] .\n\nEffective leaders and managers in organizations are key to producing quality services and required outcomes  [43] . Their interest in and affinity for technology in their personal lives has been shown to be a crucial predictor of successful digital transformations among organizations, so is the demonstrative leadership, attitudes and the supportive organizational culture, i.e., employees seeing their leaders' 'walking the technology talk'  [23] . Furthermore, the evolving healthcare system requires a health workforce with information technology (IT) knowledge and expertise  [32]  as well as managers' confidence in monitoring and measurement systems  [39] . Hence, commitment to developing service level and system managers who can use clinical analytics data with administrative and other data to guide policy development and improve performance is required  [38] ."

      "text": "The development of health management workforce capacity requires a holistic approach with efforts from and collaborations between government, professional and tertiary institutions, and healthcare organisations  [46] . In Section 3.4 of this paper, six enabling factors identified as being critical to ensuring health services managers' readiness in leading and managing in the digital health era were detailed.\n\nFrom a system perspective, investment in overall workforce development has been argued as essential to enhancing contextual management capability, with a focus on digital health planning, implementation, and training that is relevant to specific health professional groups, including managers  [22, 29, 32, 34, [36] [37] [38] [39] . Such investment and efforts can come in various forms. Government policy, strategic intent and financial support in overall workforce upskilling set the momentum for improvement. Resetting the current training and development direction for health managers at the organisational level, and the review of higher degree teaching curricula to incorporate newly emerged competency requirements, are equally important to producing an upskilled and relevant health management workforce.\n\nRapid changes abound in the health sector and the subsequent change fatigue amongst health professionals is well documented  [47] . Adopting well tested change management principles, including the development of an organisational culture for developing trust in innovation investment  [32, 34, 37] , and creating a team climate to reduce fear and uncertainty  [32, 34, 37] , was also pronounced in this review. This will be further enabled by leaders and managers demonstrating an interest in and a positive attitude toward technology and innovation  [23] . One of the success factors for leading and managing change is ensuring that the relevance and positive outcomes resulting from the changes are evaluated and broadly communicated to those who are affected by the changes  [48] . Therefore, it is important for managers to develop competence in designing monitoring and evaluating frameworks that measure the impact of digital technology and reliably and sensitively assess digital health service outcomes  [38, 39] ."

Although this scoping review has only identified a handful of articles focused on understanding the evolving competency requirements for health service managers working in the digital health context  [8, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , the review has confirmed various important elements to complement the existing health service management competency frameworks used to guide the design of informal and formal training and development curricula  [13, 15, 40] .\n\nHowever, the development of health management workforce capacity requires not only workforce training and education, but also system and organisational level commitment in developing policy, structure and processes to enable success in designing, planning and implementing the adoption of innovation  [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , as well as financial resources to support workforce development and ongoing monitoring and improvement. Equally important, a positive organisational culture supportive of change is required together with demonstrated strong interest and support from senior management. Management competencies are context-sensitive and will continue to evolve over time. Hence, ongoing commitment from both professional and tertiary institutions to understanding the changing competency requirements and competency development needs of the health management workforce in leading and managing healthcare innovation is necessary."

The implementation of digital competence and managing the transformation of healthcare may not be successful without guiding policy, supportive organizational structure, and strong leadership. Therefore, the investment in readying the health workforce, in particular the management workforce that can lead and manage the changing healthcare landscape, is critical.\n\nThe development of relevant competencies for the health service management profession needs joint efforts across government, educational and professional institutions, as well as healthcare organizations. This paper has taken an important step in confirming the competency requirements for health services managers that are relevant to leading and managing in the health informatics and digital health space, consequently indicating the directions for developing a competent workforce in meeting the existing and emerging healthcare delivery challenges, both now and in the future."
