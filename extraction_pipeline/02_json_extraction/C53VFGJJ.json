Similarly, the presentation and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modified on the basis of evolving technologies and other factors to facilitate optimal dissemination of information to healthcare professionals at the point of care.\n\nToward this goal, this guideline continues the introduction of an evolved format of presenting guideline recommendations and associated text called the \"modular knowledge chunk format.\" Each modular \"chunk\" includes a table of related recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text, and when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. References are provided within the modular chunk itself to facilitate quick review. Additionally, this format will facilitate seamless updating of guidelines with focused updates as new evidence is published, as well as content tagging for rapid electronic retrieval of related recommendations on a topic of interest. This evolved approach format was instituted when this guideline was near completion; therefore, the present document represents a transitional format that best suits the text as written. Future guidelines will fully implement this format, including provisions for limiting the amount of text in a guideline.\n\nRecognizing the importance of cost-value considerations in certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an analysis of the value of a drug, device, or intervention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology. P-5  To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with full guideline revisions commissioned in approximately 6-year cycles. Publication of new, potentially practice-changing study results that are relevant to an existing or new drug, device, or management strategy will prompt evaluation by the Task Force, in consultation with the relevant guideline writing committee, to determine whether a focused update should be commissioned.

      "text": "In 2013, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Advisory Council recommended that the NHLBI focus specifically on reviewing the highest-quality evidence and partner with other organizations to develop recommendations. S1-1,S1-2 Accordingly, the ACC and AHA collaborated with the NHLBI and stakeholder and professional organizations to complete and publish 4 guidelines (on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of blood cholesterol in adults, and management of overweight and obesity in adults) to make them available to the widest possible constituency. In 2014, the ACC and AHA in partnership with several other professional societies initiated a guideline on the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults. Under the management of the ACC/AHA Task Force, a Prevention Subcommittee was appointed to help guide development of the suite of guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nAs early as the 1920s, and subsequently in the 1959 Build and Blood Pressure Study  S1-3  of almost 5 million adults insured between 1934 and 1954, a strong direct relationship was noted between level of BP and risk of clinical complications and death. In the 1960s, these findings were confirmed in a series of reports from the Framingham Heart Study. S1-4  The 1967 and 1970 Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group reports ushered in the era of effective treatment for high BP. S1-5,S1-6  The first comprehensive guideline for detection, evaluation, and management of high BP was published in 1977, under the sponsorship of the NHLBI. S1-7  In subsequent years, a series of Joint National Committee (JNC) BP guidelines were published to assist the practice community and improve prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of high BP. S1-7-S1-9  The present guideline updates prior JNC reports."

Key search words included but were not limited to the following: adherence; aerobic; alcohol intake; ambulatory care; antihypertensive : agents, drug, medication, therapy;  beta adrenergic blockers; blood pressure: arterial, control,  determination, devices, goal, high, improve, measurement,  monitoring, ambulatory; calcium channel blockers; diet;  diuretic agent; drug therapy; heart failure: diastolic, systolic; hypertension: white coat, masked, ambulatory, isolated  ambulatory, isolated clinic, diagnosis, reverse white coat, prevention, therapy, treatment, control; intervention; lifestyle:  measures, modification; office visits; patient outcome; performance measures; physical activity; potassium intake; protein  intake; renin inhibitor; risk reduction: behavior, counseling;  screening; sphygmomanometers; spironolactone; therapy;  treatment: adherence, compliance, efficacy, outcome, protocol,  regimen; weight. Additional relevant studies published through June 2016, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The final evidence tables included in the Online Data Supplement summarize the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate recommendations.\n\nAs noted in the preamble, an independent ERC was commissioned to perform a formal systematic review of 4 critical clinical questions related to hypertension (Table  2 ), the results of which were considered by the writing committee for incorporation into this guideline. Concurrent with this process, writing committee members evaluated other published data relevant to the guideline. The findings of the ERC and the writing committee members were formally presented and discussed, and then guideline recommendations were developed. The systematic review report, \"Systematic Review for the 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults,\" is published in conjunction with this guideline, S1-10 and its respective data supplements are available online. No writing committee member reported a RWI. Drs. Whelton, Wright and Williamson had leadership roles in SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial).

This guideline does not address the use of BP-lowering medications for the purposes of prevention of recurrent CVD events in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) or chronic heart failure (HF) in the absence of hypertension; these topics are the focus of other ACC/AHA guidelines. S1-11,S1-12  In developing the present guideline, the writing committee reviewed prior published guidelines, evidence reviews, and related statements.

Checklist for Accurate Measurement of BP S4.1-1,S4.1-2 Key Steps for Proper BP Measurements Specific Instructions Step 1: Properly prepare the patient 1. Have the patient relax, sitting in a chair (feet on floor, back supported) for >5 min.\n\n2. The patient should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 min before measurement.\n\n3. Ensure patient has emptied his/her bladder.\n\n4. Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the rest period or during the measurement.\n\n5. Remove all clothing covering the location of cuff placement.\n\n6. Measurements made while the patient is sitting or lying on an examining table do not fulfill these criteria.\n\nStep 2: Use proper technique for BP measurements 1. Use a BP measurement device that has been validated, and ensure that the device is calibrated periodically.* 2. Support the patient's arm (eg, resting on a desk).\n\n3. Position the middle of the cuff on the patient's upper arm at the level of the right atrium (the midpoint of the sternum).\n\n4. Use the correct cuff size, such that the bladder encircles 80% of the arm, and note if a larger-or smaller-than-normal cuff size is used (Table  9 ).\n\n5. Either the stethoscope diaphragm or bell may be used for auscultatory readings. S4.1-3,S4.1-4 Step 3: Take the proper measurements needed for diagnosis and treatment of elevated BP/hypertension 1. At the first visit, record BP in both arms. Use the arm that gives the higher reading for subsequent readings.\n\n2. Separate repeated measurements by 1-2 min.\n\n3. For auscultatory determinations, use a palpated estimate of radial pulse obliteration pressure to estimate SBP. Inflate the cuff 20-30 mm Hg above this level for an auscultatory determination of the BP level. June 2018 4.2.

Although we recommend use of the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations ( http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD- Risk-Estimator/) to estimate 10-year risk of ASCVD to establish the BP threshold for treatment, the vast majority of adults with a co-morbidity are likely to have a 10-year risk of ASCVD that exceeds 10%. In some instances, clinical trial confirmation of treatment in patients with comorbidities is limited to a target BP of 140/90 mm Hg. In addition, the selection of medications for use in treating high BP in patients with CVD is guided by their use for other compelling indications (eg, beta blockers after MI, ACE inhibitors for HFrEF), as discussed in specific guidelines for the clinical condition.

S9.7-1-S9.7-3 According to data from the NHANES  III and NHANES 1999-2006, S9.7-1,S9.7-4  the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the United States was 34.2% in 2006 and has likely increased substantially since that time. The metabolic syndrome is linked to several other disorders, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, certain cancers, CKD, Alzheimer's disease, Cushing's syndrome, lipodystrophy, and hyperalimentation. S9.7-5,S9.7-6 Lifestyle modification, with an emphasis on improving insulin sensitivity by means of dietary modification, weight reduction, and exercise, is the foundation of treatment of the metabolic syndrome. The optimal antihypertensive drug therapy for patients with hypertension in the setting of the metabolic syndrome has not been clearly defined. S9.7-1 Although caution exists with regard to the use of thiazide diuretics in this population because of their ability to increase insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia and to accelerate conversion to overt DM, no data are currently available demonstrating deterioration in cardiovascular or renal outcomes in patients treated with these agents. S9.7-1 Indeed, as shown in follow-up of ALLHAT, chlorthalidone use was associated with only a small increase in fasting glucose levels (1.5-4.0 mg/dL), and this increase did not translate into increased CVD risk at a later date. S9.7-7-S9.7-10 In addition, in post hoc analysis of the nearly two thirds of participants in ALLHAT that met criteria for the metabolic syndrome, chlorthalidone was unsurpassed in reducing CVD and renal outcomes compared with lisinopril, amlodipine, or doxazosin. S9.7-9,S9.7-11 Similarly, highdose ARB therapy reduces arterial stiffness in patients with hypertension with the metabolic syndrome, but no outcomes data are available from patients in which this form of treatment was used. S9.7-12  Use of traditional beta blockers may lead to dyslipidemia or deterioration of glucose tolerance, and ability to lose weight. S9.7-2 In several large clinical trials, the risk of developing DM as a result of traditional beta-blocker therapy was 15% to 29%. S9.7-2 However, the newer vasodilating beta blockers (eg, labetalol, carvedilol, nebivolol) have shown neutral or favorable effects on metabolic profiles compared with the traditional beta blockers. S9.7-13 Trials using vasodilator beta blockers have not been performed to demonstrate effects on CVD outcomes."

However, in prespecified analyses, there was no evidence of an interaction between sex and treatment effect. Furthermore, no significant differences in CVD outcomes were observed between men and women in a large meta-analysis that included 31 RCTs with about 100 000 men and 90 000 women with hypertension (1 Some have called for conduct of a SPRINT-like trial with sufficient power to assess the effects of intensive SBP reduction in women {Wenger, 2016 #9131). Some have called for a SPRINT-like trial with sufficient power to assess the effects of intensive SBP reduction in women. S10.2.1-2 In meta-analyses, there was no convincing evidence that different antihypertensive drug classes exerted sex-related differences in BP lowering or provided distinct CVD protection. S10.2.1-1 Calcium antagonists offered slightly greater benefits for stroke prevention than did ACE inhibitors for women than for men, whereas calcium antagonists reduced all-cause deaths compared with placebo in men but not in women. However, these sex-related differences might have been due to chance because of the large number of statistical comparisons that were performed. The Heart Attack Trial and Hypertension Care Computing Project reported that beta blockers were associated with reduced mortality in men but not in women, but this finding was likely due to the low event rates in women. S10.2.1-3 Similarly, in the open-label Second Australian National BP study, a significant reduction in CVD events was demonstrated in men but not in women with ACE inhibitors versus diuretics. S10.2.1-4  Adverse effects of antihypertensive therapy were noted twice as often in women as in men in the TOMHS study. S10.2.1-5 A higher incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough and of edema with calcium antagonists was observed in women than in men.
