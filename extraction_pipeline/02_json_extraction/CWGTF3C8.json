      "text": "Older adults (\u226565 y) represent a large and growing segment of the US population.  1  Engaging in regular physical activity is a crucial component of healthy aging as it confers many health benefits including improved cognitive function, physical function, and quality of life.  2, 3 The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend older adults achieve at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and minimize the amount of time spent sitting during the day. Importantly, the guidelines also stress that the greatest health benefits are achieved for those who are most sedentary and that replacing sitting with even light-intensity walking can be beneficial.  3 Still, older adults are the least active age group;  4  only 16.3% of those aged 65-75 years are sufficiently active.  5 der adults report multilevel barriers to increasing activity, including lack of safe environments to be active, reluctance to exercise alone, financial constraints, and low self-efficacy for physical activity.  6, 7 Conversely, multiple studies and systematic reviews of physical activity interventions for community-dwelling older adults have identified multilevel facilitators of physical activity including access to convenient and enjoyable activities and receipt of social and environmental supports for physical activity.  [8] [9] 10] With a growing number of older adults living in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), and evidence suggesting multilevel interventions are more effective than interventions targeted at the individual level alone, this represents an ideal setting for developing physical activity interventions targeted to older adults. To date, few physical activity interventions have been conducted among older adults living in CCRCs.\n\nRecently, the ubiquity of mobile computing devices and the low cost of physical activity monitors (eg, Fitbits) have dramatically increased the feasibility of delivering multilevel physical activity interventions within the retirement community setting. Our team recently developed an mHealth physical activity intervention called MapTrek for the purpose of promoting physical activity using a low-cost, scalable platform.  11 MapTrek was originally designed as a mobile phone-based walking game that places participants into a series of virtual, individual walking races for the purpose of encouraging more daily physical activity throughout the day. We recently demonstrated that MapTrek significantly increased physical activity behaviors of sedentary office workers over 10 weeks.11 Given the past success of MapTrek, we decided to adapt MapTrek for use among older adults living in CCRCs. MapTrek was redesigned for older adults living in CCRCs by removing the phone requirement (as many older adults do not have smartphones) and creating a team-based format.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to test the efficacy and acceptability of an 8-week multilevel mHealth intervention for increasing physical activity of older adults living in a CCRC in a phase IIa proof of concept trial.  12 Based on our previous study, testing our mHealth intervention among sedentary office workers,  11  we hypothesized participants would immediately increase their physical activity from baseline to week 1 and that physical activity levels would remain elevated throughout the 8-week intervention. We hypothesized participants would maintain their elevated activity levels after the intervention was removed for 4 weeks. Finally, we hypothesized participants would increase their social support for physical activity, self-efficacy for physical activity, outcome expectations for physical activity, and social isolation from baseline to 8 weeks."

      "text": "We recruited a convenience sample of older adults (\u2265 65 years) living at a single CCRC in a Midwestern state. Participants were recruited from June 17, 2019 to June 27, 2019, by word of mouth and through advertisements posted on digital monitors located throughout the CCRC. Eligibility of the participants was contingent upon their full-time residence at the CCRC, ability to walk without a walker, and an ability to wear a Fitbit activity monitor daily throughout the intervention. Exclusion criteria included: (1) age <65 years; (2) not fluent in English; and (3) any reported contraindications to engaging in physical activity. Interested participants were invited to attend a large group-based orientation session in which our team explained the study in detail. After all questions were answered, eligible and interested participants provided their voluntary informed consent. A total of 54 participants were found to be eligible and enrolled in the study.\n\nAfter providing their consent to participate, participants were asked to complete a baseline survey which asked about their demographic information and included several psychosocial questionnaires.13-15 Each participant was then provided with a Fitbit activity monitor and oriented on how to properly wear and use the device to self-monitor their daily activity. Participants were then asked to wear the Fitbit for a minimum of 7 days to assess their baseline physical activity. Following the baseline testing period, participants were invited to attend a large group orientation session during which participants were provided further details about the intervention."

      "text": "Immediately following the orientation session, participants received access to the MapTrek intervention. MapTrek was designed to be a fun and interactive game to motivate participants to increase their daily physical activity behavior (walking). Key components of the intervention included a wearable Fitbit activity monitor that each participant received and wore daily throughout the intervention,  3  TV monitors placed in common areas (eg, main lobby, caf\u00e9, activity room) throughout the CCRC which illustrated the MapTrek game board, and 5 sync stations placed near the TV monitors which automatically synced participant's Fitbit monitors to the MapTrek operating system. The sync stations were controlled with small (credit card-sized) Raspberry Pi computers that had Bluetooth capability for syncing with Fitbits. Participants were instructed to walk near the sync stations daily to ensure their Fitbit steps would be added to the team total. The syncing process took roughly 1 minute to complete.\n\nAll TV monitors presented the same information which included: (a1) the walking route of the current race, (b2) a Google Maps Street View illustrating the leading team's location on the map at any given time, (c3) a team leaderboard that reported total team steps and team places, and (d4) daily educational and motivational messages designed to target specific theoretical constructs including self-efficacy and outcome expectancies (Figure  1A ). A new walking route/race was launched every 2 weeks. To foster social support for physical activity and reduce social isolation, participants were assigned to one of 3 teams and provided a wrist band for their team (black, white, or teal). The 3 teams competed against each other in the 2-week races. Steps recorded from each participant's Fitbit were added to the team step total and each team's logo automatically progressed along the walking route based on team steps. Participants were encouraged to walk to a TV monitor and sync station daily to ensure their steps were added to the team total, to keep up on the status of the races, to view the leader board, and to read the daily educational/motivational messages. The daily messages were developed by PhD level members of the research team and were based on demonstrated behavior change techniques informed by the social cognitive theory.  16 The daily messages were updated each day at 7:00 AM.\n\nConsistent with the social-ecological model,  17  MapTrek was designed to target known determinants of physical activity that operate at multiple levels. At the individual level, new educational messages were displayed each day on the TV monitors to improve attitudes, knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations regarding physical activity. Specifically, messages focused on the known benefits of physical activity, the negative consequences of physical inactivity, tips for improving physical activity, and positive/encouraging messages. Each individual was also provided a Fitbit activity monitor to support individual self-monitoring of daily steps. At the social level, it was our intention that the teambased approach would promote social support, build self-efficacy through peer modeling, and potentially reduce social isolation. Each team was comprised of both residents and staff members with the intent of establishing a supportive culture of physical activity within the CCRC environment. At the end of the 8-week intervention, all participants were asked to complete a follow-up survey which repeated questions asked at baseline on self-efficacy for exercise,  13  social support for exercise,  14  outcome expectations for exercise,  15  and social isolation  18  (described in detail in the Measures section). Participants were also asked to complete a process evaluation survey which asked questions about satisfaction with the intervention. At the end of the process evaluation survey, participants were asked to continue wearing their Fitbit monitors for an additional 4-week follow-up period. The purpose of the follow-up period was to determine whether physical activity levels were maintained following removal of the mHealth intervention. MapTrek display monitors were deactivated during the 4-week follow-up period."

The Fitbit Zip has been demonstrated as a valid and reliable measure of daily steps among community-dwelling older adults compared with the ActiGraph GT3X+ (intraclass correlation coefficient = .94, 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.97).  19 At the beginning of the study, all participants were provided a Fitbit Zip activity monitor and were asked to wear the monitor on the nondominant wrist, during all wakeful hours, each day through the duration of the intervention. Minute-by-minute level step data were downloaded using the Fitbit application programming interface. Participants' compliance wearing the Fitbit was determined by counting the number of days each participant successfully recorded Fitbit-measured steps.\n\nPsychosocial Outcomes.-The secondary psychosocial outcomes were assessed with 4 questionnaires. Self-efficacy was measured with the Self-Efficacy for Exercise scale, a 13-item questionnaire designed to assess participants' self-efficacy related to their ability to continue exercising in the face of barriers.  13 Social support for physical activity was measured with a modified version of the Social Support and Exercise Survey. The Social Support and Exercise Survey is a 12-item (originally 13 item) questionnaire that assesses the level of support from family and friends that participants have in making health behavior changes (exercise).  14 Outcome expectations were measured with the Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale. The Outcome Expectations for Exercise is a valid and reliable 9-item scale that assesses the participant's outcome expectations and benefits associated with exercise.  15 Social isolation was measured with a modified version of the Friendship Scale. The Friendship Scale is a 5-item (originally 6-item) scale that assesses 6 dimensions contributing to social isolation.  18"

Participants also rated (5-point Likert Scale; [not at all helpful] to [very helpful]) the helpfulness of each intervention feature (eg, game route, images from Google Street View, leaderboard, educational information, team-based approach).\n\nFinally, participants were invited to participate in one of 3 focus groups to provide openended feedback on the intervention features they found to be most and least helpful, suggestions for improving the intervention, barriers they experienced that limited their participation, and any unexpected benefits to participating in the intervention. Focus groups were semi-structured and held in person at the CCRC. A total of 18 participants participated in the focus groups. Each group included between 4 and 8 participants and lasted between 20 and 40 minutes."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The results of this pilot study indicate that a multilevel mHealth intervention increased physical activity among older adults living in a CCRC over the short term. Over the course of the 8-week intervention, participants walked an average of 6266 steps per day, representing a 15% increase compared with the baseline period. However, once the MapTrek intervention was removed (monitors disabled), participants' physical activity levels regressed back to their baseline levels. At 12 weeks, participants returned to walking an average of 5417 steps per day, which was similar to the 5438 steps they were walking at baseline. In addition, while participants were asked to continue wearing and syncing their Fitbit each day during the follow-up period, Fitbit compliance dropped by 12% to 84% compliance during the follow-up period. This finding is consistent with our process evaluation data in which 65% of participants reported MapTrek motivated them to keep wearing their Fitbit. Collectively, these findings suggest MapTrek had a positive short-term effect on participants' physical activity levels and that participants found the intervention engaging while it was operational. However, these findings also suggest that both physical activity levels and compliance dropped once the intervention was removed. It may be difficult for residents to maintain their elevated physical activity levels with just a Fitbit and no additional support from the intervention team. Future technologybased physical activity interventions like MapTrek should be designed to be user friendly so that they can continue to be administered by nonresearch staff. In this specific case, members of the CCRC staff could be trained on how to administer MapTrek challenges and should be evaluated for effectiveness over a longer duration.\n\nIn order to provide additional context for these findings, it is important to consider the typical activity levels of older adults. Past studies have found heathy older adults tend to walk anywhere between 2000 and 9000 steps per day (median of 5500 steps per day).  21 articipants of the present study were averaging 5438 steps per day at baseline and would therefore be considered approximately as active as the average older adult. However, over the course of the intervention, participants were walking more than the median steps for older adults. It has been recommended that healthy older adults walk between 7000 and 10,000 steps per day, which would be equivalent to accumulating 30 minutes of daily MVPA and meeting the recommendations put forth by the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.  21 Collectively, participants of this intervention averaged fewer than 7000 steps per day. Our findings are consistent with previous physical activity interventions targeting older adults living within CCRCs. Rosenberg et al  22  found both a standard walking intervention and enhanced walking intervention lead to increased daily step counts of roughly 500 steps per day (10-15% increase), which is consistent with the relative increase in physical activity observed in our study (+15%).\n\nOur findings are also consistent with a study by Strath et al,  23  which examined the feasibility of combining a pedometer with step targets and motivational messages for increasing physical activity among older adults.  24 Participants increased their daily steps by more than 40%, which is far greater than the 15% increase we observed in our study.\n\nContrary to our hypotheses, we did not observe improvements in self-efficacy for exercise or outcome expectations over the 8-week intervention. Given participants' high levels of self-efficacy and outcome expectations at baseline, a ceiling effect may have limited any significant increase in these variables. It is possible participants were overly optimistic about their perceived ability to exercise in certain situations, which has been reported in previous studies.  25 A second explanation for the observed decline in selfefficacy could be that participants did not engage with the TV monitors. Specifically, behavior change techniques designed to increase self-efficacy may not have been delivered as they were intended. Intervention features designed to increase self-efficacy included adding motivational and educational information on the bottom of the display monitor. Although the messages were displayed, some participants reported not looking at the monitors because they could sync at a syncing station without a monitor. Other participants reported not seeing the messages, which may have been due to how small the daily message section was on the monitor. With regards to outcome expectations, participants in this study were highly educated and therefore may have been more aware of the physical and psychological benefits of physical activity than most older adults. Previous research has found a positive association between education level and knowledge about the benefits of physical activity.  26 Still, it is also possible the intervention did not effectively target self-efficacy and/or outcome expectations as intended.\n\nWe also did not observe an improvement in social support over the course of the intervention. While we attempted to facilitate social support by taking a team approach and placing staff members on each team as \"team leaders,\" only 16% of participants reported this feature to be helpful. Given evidence suggesting social support from friends has a stronger influence on physical activity habits of older adults than social support received from family and/or experts,  27  future interventions should consider testing the efficacy of peer leaders as opposed to staff members.\n\nWe did not observe a decrease in social isolation among participants over the 8-week intervention. Participants entered the study reporting low levels of isolation, which left little room for improvement. Such low levels of isolation could be a testament to the CCRC where this study was conducted, which offers regular socializing events. This finding could also be due to a self-selection bias as residents who are more socially isolated may have been less likely to enroll in the study.\n\nThis study was limited by the use of a single-arm study design that included a relatively small sample size. Our use of the Fitbit activity monitor as an outcome measure, as opposed to a blinded, research-grade accelerometer, limits the overall accuracy of the physical activity data. We also recruited a convenience sample of older adults living in a local retirement community. The sample was a homogenous group of participants who were mostly white, mostly female, highly educated, and of middle to upper income levels. It is unclear if the study findings can be generalized to older men, older adults with lower income and education, and/or older adults from racial and ethnic minority groups. However, the present study should be viewed as a phase IIa \"proof of concept study\" as defined by the ORBIT model.  12 Based on the ORBIT model, the next step for this line of research would be to test MapTrek in a phase IIb pilot study, which compares MapTrek against a control group among a more representative sample. Future studies should include a more diverse sample and possibly target CCRCs located in rural areas where facilities may offer fewer social events and opportunities for physical activity.\n\nAlthough the study did have limitations, this study had many strengths as well. First, MapTrek is an innovative platform that leverages multiple technologies (Fitbit activity monitors, Raspberry Pi computers, and TV display monitors) to deliver a multilevel intervention to increase physical activity levels of older adults living full time in a retirement community. MapTrek combines individual level behavior change techniques (eg, providing educational/motivational information, encouraging self-monitoring) with social level behavior change techniques (eg, team-based approach) to support the physical activity behavior change process. Second, we were able to objectively measure participants' physical activity patterns on a granular level over the course of the intervention. Given our early stage of development for this intervention, this data provided us a clear picture of the immediate and long-term effects of the intervention, which we will use to further refine and improve MapTrek. Finally, MapTrek was designed so that it could be scaled to reach larger numbers of participants and delivered to older adults who are at greater risk for physical inactivity including older adults living in rural areas who have limited access to physical activity resources."

Participants found the intervention to be acceptable, but many refinements are warranted. Additional studies that test the efficacy of a refined version of the intervention against control group in a phase IIB pilot study are needed."
