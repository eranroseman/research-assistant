  "title": "A text message based weight management intervention for overweight adults",
  "abstract": "Background: Weight management interventions can be extended using mobile telephone technology to deliver support in real-time, real-world settings. The present study aimed to determine whether text messaging helped patients maintain or lose weight following a weight-loss programme. Methods: In this controlled study, overweight and obese [body mass index (BMI) >30 kg m -2 or >28 kg m -2 with co-morbidities] adults who completed a weight-loss programme participated in an additional 12-week text message intervention [Lifestyle, Eating and Activity Programme (LEAP) Beep]. Patients were allocated goals for steps, fruit, vegetable and breakfast consumption. Patients regularly 'texted' their progress and received tailored practitioner feedback. Pre/post-intervention body weight, waist circumference (WC), BMI, quality of life (QOL), anxiety and depression measurements were compared retrospectively with a control group offered weight checks only. Results: Compared to control (n = 17), the intervention group's (n = 17) body weight, WC and BMI reduced significantly (\u00c01.6 versus 0.7 kg, P = 0.006; \u00c02.2 versus 1.5 cm, P = 0.0005; \u00c00.6 versus 0.7 kg m -2 , P = 0.03, respectively). QOL and depression scores also improved (\u00c06.8 versus 1 point, P = 0.134; \u00c00.2 versus 0.2 points, P = 0.228). No difference was observed in anxiety scores between the groups. Intervention versus control group follow-up attendance improved significantly (4.4 versus 1.7 attendances, P = 0.0005). Conclusions: LEAP Beep promoted losses in weight, WC and BMI, and improved QOL parameters and follow-up attendance. Text messaging is a cheap, portable, convenient and innovative medium facilitating goal setting, self-monitoring and information exchange. Further improvements to automation at the same time as maintaining individual support are necessary to ease practitioner burden. Text messaging offers cost-efficient dietetic input, opening up possibilities for practitioner-to-patient support and yields positive weight outcomes following initial weight loss.",

      "text": "The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends long-term follow-up of weight management patients in its obesity guidance  (NICE, 2006) . High costs for obesity-related health care mean researchers and clinicians are continually searching for cost effec-tive and successful treatments for weight loss and maintenance  (Berkel et al., 2005) . However, the challenges faced when providing extended interventions include cost and adherence over long time periods  (Walcott-McQuigg et al., 2002) . Wing (2000)  suggests that alternative options requiring less direct face-to-face contact would be useful.\n\nMany dieters regain the weight they lose; therefore, programmes promoting maintenance skills are vital  (Wing & Hill, 2001; Wing et al., 2006) . Common behaviours amongst those successfully losing and maintaining weight are the consumption of a low-fat diet; eating breakfast almost every day, high levels of regular physical activity (approximately 1 hour day -1 ) and frequent selfmonitoring of body weight and food intake  (Wing & Hill, 2001) . NICE (2006)  recommends that behavioural interventions such as self-monitoring should be incorporated into weight management programmes. Self-monitoring aims to increase self awareness of specific behaviours and their relative outcomes. This process acts as an early warning system should issues appear and can be used to mark lifestyle achievements  (Yeager et al., 2008) . Self-monitoring ultimately leads to a change in target behaviour to control dietary intake and physical activity through simple observation  (Korotitsch & Nelson-Gray, 1999) .\n\nHistorically, dietetic teams have favoured the use of written food diaries as a self-monitoring tool. However, a much quicker and more convenient alternative to paper diaries is to use Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging (texting). There is the potential for behavioural treatments to be enhanced beyond traditional research or clinical settings by using mobile telephony to deliver interventions as people go about their daily lives. These interventions can be sent to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) in natural settings (i.e. the real world;  Heron & Smyth, 2010) .\n\nLittle research has been conducted into the potential of SMS text messaging for weight management. Such studies have focused primarily on one-way communication (usually practitioner to patient) of nonpersonalised messages. Joo & Kim (2007)  studied the effects of sending weekly practitioner to patient non-individualised text messages on lifestyle behaviours including dietary modification. Forty-seven percent of patients completed the weight management programme. Mean reductions of weight, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) of 1.6 kg (P < 0.001), 4.3 cm (P < 0.001) and 0.6 kg m -2 (P < 0.001), respectively, were found. A high attrition rate of 53% was observed during their study.\n\nA recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) found that text messages were a useful communication method to promote weight loss in overweight adults. A text message intervention was designed to help individuals lose or maintain weight. Patients were exposed to 4 months of either monthly weight control literature or an intervention that included personalised text messages two to five times daily. After 4 months, the intervention group (n = 33) lost significantly more weight than the comparison group (n = 32; 2.88 versus 0.91 kg, 95% confidence interval = \u00c00.34 to \u00c03.6 kg; P = 0.02) after adjusting for sex, baseline weight and age  (Patrick et al., 2009) .\n\nAnother RCT  (Haapala et al., 2009)  involved overweight adults either joining an experimental group to use a mobile telephone-based weight-loss programme encouraging gradual reduction in oral intake or a control group receiving no intervention. Experimental group patients were sent immediate tailored feedback based on their responses. At 12 months, the experimental group had lost significantly more weight than the control group (4.5 AE 5.0 kg versus 1.1 AE 5.8 kg; P = 0.006) and had greater WC reductions (6.3 AE 5.3 cm versus 2.4 AE 5.4 cm; P = 0.0001). Although there is some evidence for the use of mobile telephone technology in supporting weight management interventions, few studies have used text messaging to extend the practitionerpatient relationship following initial face-to-face contact.\n\nMobile telephones can offer the opportunity to build on and monitor the lifestyle habits seen in successful weight management. Text messaging is a low cost, portable contact method that enables two way practitioner-to-patient communications. Utilising this method of 'remote support' can be an effective way to support patients in weight management beyond their attendance at a weight management group (WMG). Giving personalised feedback on responses equips patients with a behavioural strategy to help sustain positive lifestyle changes  (Patrick et al., 2009) .\n\nThe present study aimed to contribute to the knowledge gap of whether a personalised text messaging initiative [Lifestyle, Eating and Activity Programme (LEAP) Beep] could be effective and acceptable to patients in promoting positive weight outcomes (weight maintenance or further weight loss) and improved attendance at LEAP (Lifestyle, Eating and Activity Programme) WMG followup appointments."

The increased consumption of fruit and vegetables can offset high-fat and high-calorie foods  (Robinson, 1999) . Therefore, fruit and vegetable intake was used as a proxy for a low-fat diet. In total, three measures were chosen as proxy markers of a healthy lifestyle (low-fat diet, regular exercise, breakfast consumption). Patients were each given a target to achieve for fruit, vegetable and breakfast consumption (five portions per day; breakfast daily). Each patient was loaned a pedometer (model 56 012; Silva Sweden AB, Sollentuna, Sweden) and set an individual step target. Twice weekly for 12 weeks, patients were sent reminder text messages to text the practitioner their data. Patients sent back one weekday and one weekend message. If no response to the request for data was received on the day of sending, a second identical request message was sent the following day and the third day if necessary. Dependant on received data against personal targets, patients were sent personalised responses; either congratulatory if their data met their target or an encouraging response with practical ideas on improvement if they failed to meet the target. The control group was sent no text messages. Following intervention, LEAP Beep patients completed an anonymous qualitative satisfaction survey."

      "text": "Conventional text messaging is an unsecured mode of communication between practitioner and patient. To comply with the NHS Confidentiality Code of Practice (Department of Health, 2003) a BlackBerry device (BlackBerry 8700v Enterprise; BlackBerry, Ontario, Canada) was used to convert e-mails to text messages and vice versa, using a downloaded conversion application (SMS2DESK; Cortado SMS2Desk, Cortado, CO, USA). This application was synchronised with the practitioner's OUTLOOK 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) e-mail system. E-mail to text messaging conversion enabled all communication from practitioner to LEAP Beep patient to be printed off and documented. This would not have been possible using a conventional mobile telephone for text messaging. To enhance data security, patients were instructed to code their lifestyle data; for example, a text message received by the practitioner containing the data '4462fv5bfyes' represents 4462 steps walked on that day, five fruit and vegetables portions consumed and breakfast eaten.\n\nPatients were advised that text messages were solely for communicating data about lifestyle behaviours; any other questions or comments required face-to-face contact or a telephone call to the practitioner."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Previous studies have focused on text message interventions as being the main and initial mode of contact between practitioner and patient  (Joo & Kim, 2007; Haapala et al., 2009; Patrick et al., 2009) . The present study was the first to use text messaging in a dietetic environment to examine whether clinical and QOL parameters could be enhanced following initial attendance at a WMG. Improvements in weight, waist circumference, BMI, QOL and score for depression were observed in the intervention group. This study demonstrated that LEAP\n\nBeep is effective at supporting patients post-attendance of an intensive weight-loss group (LEAP). LEAP Beep enabled feedback from the practitioner to the patient in the period following attendance at a WMG. Direct comparison of LEAP Beep with other weight management interventions is challenging because no equivalent interventions are currently employed. LEAP Beep produced similar results (1.6 kg weight loss; P = 0.013) to a previous Korean study  (Joo & Kim, 2007) . However, it should be emphasised that LEAP Beep was used as an extension to the existing LEAP programme where patients had already lost an average of 4.4 kg  (Donaldson & McKenna, 2010) . This prior weight loss combined with the effect demonstrated through LEAP Beep (1.6 kg additional weight loss) meant that patients had lost 5.6 kg at 6 months of dietetic input. Supporting patients to achieve modest amounts of weight loss leads to widely recognised health benefits in many important clinical parameters. The benefits of a 10-kg weight loss in a patient weighing 100 kg have been described in relation to mortality, blood pressure, angina, lipid level and diabetes management and risk  (Jung, 1997) .\n\nThe control group gained 0.7 kg over the 12-week intervention period, as supported by the results of a study by  Wing et al. (2006)  showing that weight losers will regain weight following intervention in the absence of maintained support. The present study is indicative that text messaging may slow down or hinder weight regain following loss.\n\nPractitioners traditionally focus on measurable changes in health parameters such as weight and waist circumference to determine the success of weight management  interventions  (Donaldson & McKenna, 2010) . In some interventions, patients' own views are largely overlooked; however, the patient is usually the best judge of their own wellbeing state  (Fallowfield, 2003) .\n\nEvaluating QOL extends the scale of treatment efficacy beyond weight loss and creates a valuable patient-centred viewpoint  (Kushner & Foster, 2000) . Assessing QOL benefits practitioners because it determines the patient's relationship with and overall impact on their condition. This provides further information beyond that collected by conventional medical and clinical measures and is important for helping to understand the wide variation within individual responses to obesity  (Fontaine & Barofsky, 2001) . Obese people report that an impaired QOL and increasing impairments are related to increasing levels of obesity  (Fontaine & Barofsky, 2001) . LEAP Beep produced improvements in QOL scores between intervention and control groups (7.8 points; P = 0.134), representing an increase in QOL. An improvement of 7.7-12 points on IWQOL total score is considered to be meaningful  (Crosby et al., 2004) .\n\nDepression has been linked with weight regain and is a common feature of obese people accessing weight management treatment  (Elfhag & R\u20ac ossner, 2004) . Lower depression scores are a characteristic of people recovering from weight relapses compared to those that do not recover. A relative success in weight management is where a reduction in depression is seen  (Phelan et al., 2003) . A small improvement in self-reported depression was demonstrated through LEAP Beep.\n\nThe present study showed that maintaining regular contact with patients encouraged better attendance at weight checks. Whether regular attendance promotes weight management or simply whether successful weight losers attend because they want a practitioner to greet them with a congratulatory response is hard to determine. There is the potential that the motivated intervention group would have attended follow-up weight checks independently of the text messaging facility. In addition, the improvements to QOL may have made attendance at weight checks for the intervention group a less daunting prospect than for the control group where weight gain was seen. However, regular monitoring of weight is a characteristic common to successful weight losers and maintainers and therefore any feature that attracts patients for weight monitoring is beneficial  (Wing & Hill, 2001) .\n\nThe qualitative survey data in the present study provided an insight into the usefulness of the programme from the patient's perspective. Many patients commented that the programme helped them to maintain their weight loss and provided continued goals to work towards. Haapala et al. (2009)  showed that the immediacy of response is an important aspect in a text messaging programme. Immediate feedback is reliant on the practitioner's availability. There is the potential for unrealistic patient expectation of feedback. During LEAP Beep, the practitioner had access to a Blackberry that enabled out of hours feedback to the intervention group. Compared to messages sent and received during conventional working hours (Monday to Friday, 09.00 h until 17.00 h), there was no real difference in the content of the text messages from either party during out of hours periods. It is acknowledged that few practitioners would be willing to provide support to patients during the evenings and weekends on a regular basis. Unfortunately, these are the high risk times for unhealthy behaviours  (Bj\u20ac orvell et al., 1985 & Johnson et al., 1995)  and potentially when patients need practitioner support the most.\n\nMobile telephones are popular, portable, convenient and are highly distributed across income and ethnic groups  (Gerber et al., 2009) . Text messaging is a suitable medium for personalising information and delivering it quickly. Texting takes advantage of push technology; data are transmitted to a user without them necessarily making the request. In comparison, other technology-based interventions often entail logging on to an Internet site or calling a telephone number and may be affected by poor reception and prove disruptive. Text messages are acceptable as a result of the ability to read messages discretely and the speed of sending/receiving messages  (Gerber et al., 2009) . However, it is acknowledged that some people, such as the elderly or those with low literacy skills or lower disposable income, may not have access to or want to use a mobile telephone.\n\nCost effective and successful weight management methods are highly desirable  (Berkel et al., 2005) . Excluding practitioner time and initial set-up, the texting cost of LEAP Beep week was \u00a30.14 per patient per week and required less than 5 min to deliver a tailored intervention. This compares favourably to 1 h of dietetic time in outpatient clinic costing \u00a331  (Curtis, 2011) . In 1 h, a practitioner could see four face-to-face, follow-up patients or support approximately 12 patients using text messaging, potentially without the associated travel time and fuel costs that conventional clinics incur. Text message supported weight loss is an example of a low cost/high benefit intervention."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The present controlled study included a retrospective analysis. Analyses of this type are more prone to bias and confounding data. As seen in another adult weight management study comparing effectiveness of interventions, patients may be influenced and motivation heightened by the act of taking part in such a research study  (Truby et al., 2006) . The patients that opted into the intervention group may have already been more motivated to make lifestyle change than the control group. The commitment for people in their late 50s to engage in 3 months of text messaging is considerable. Combining this with the lack of intervention group attrition could contribute to the idea of already high patient motivation. Research into weight management options for UK adults showed that older patients were more likely to complete the study than their younger counterparts [mean (SD) age 41.6 (9.9) versus 36.8 (10.4); P < 0.001]  (Truby et al., 2006) . This could present some possible selection bias for LEAP Beep.\n\nPatients in LEAP Beep were already under the care of Leicestershire Nutrition and Dietetic Services and selfselected into both the treatment and the study. Self-selection into (or out of) a study influences the degree to which the results can be generalised and has consequences for wider adoption  (Heron & Smyth, 2010) . The present study was reliant on accurate lifestyle data (steps, fruit, vegetable and breakfast consumption) being reported by the patient. There is potential for inaccuracies in selfreporting, especially in the overweight and obese  (Lissner et al., 2000) .\n\nPedometers are regarded as strong motivators of behaviour change and simply the act of wearing a pedometer has been shown to increase physical activity  (Hultquist et al., 2005; Tudor-Locke & Lutes, 2009) . This presents potential selection bias for LEAP Beep."

      "title": "Study strengths",
      "text": "LEAP Beep has demonstrated early efficacy for a responsive text messaging system to promote healthy behaviours on a frequent basis. The validity of the present study is enhanced by the naturalistic setting of data collection (i.e. it was carried out in a real practice setting and reflects normal clinical practice). The intervention was delivered by a dietitian within a normal working environment and no incentives were given to patients."
    },
    {
      "title": "Future considerations",
      "text": "Outlining timescales for sending and receiving data would ensure both patient and practitioner have realistic expectations about contact frequency. Assuming that the mobile telephone is switched off during undesirable times for the practitioner, patients should be encouraged to text data at any time of the day, thus opening up potential for more accurate and convenient reporting for populations such as shift workers. Patients should advise when they are travelling out of the UK during the intervention period to alleviate expensive overseas messages for both parties and to avoid missed messages.\n\nA comparison to identify whether a one-way messaging system (practitioner-patient) eliminating the burden of responsive texts would yield similar weight-loss results would be valuable. Responding to LEAP Beep text messages was manageable, although larger group numbers would require more response time and weight-loss benefits may be independent of practitioner feedback. Further improvements to automation at the same time as maintaining individual support are necessary to ease practitioner burden. Whether full automation would lack the necessary personal touch warrants further investigation. Future research into the longevity of text message induced weight loss should be considered.\n\nFinally, the present study demonstrates that providing further dietetic contact after an initial weight-loss intervention is effective and yields a desirable weight outcome. Patients sent their data at a time that was convenient to them, with the added bonus of practitioner feedback on their behaviours. Offering patients the opportunity to send and receive data around diet and exercise via mobile telephone opens up increasing possibilities for patient to practitioner support. Text messaging offers an innovative, cost effective and convenient mode of brief information exchange with patients who are involved in weight management programmes. Dietetic services should give serious consideration to the advantages for both practitioners and patients of offering continued weight management support via text messaging."
