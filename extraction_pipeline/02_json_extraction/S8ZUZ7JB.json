  "title": "A systematic review of motivational interviewing in healthcare: the potential of motivational interviewing to address the lifestyle factors relevant to multimorbidity",
  "abstract": "Internationally, health systems face an increasing demand for services from people living with multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is often associated with high levels of treatment burden. Targeting lifestyle factors that impact across multiple conditions may promote quality of life and better health outcomes for people with multimorbidity. Motivational interviewing (MI) has been studied as one approach to supporting lifestyle behaviour change. A systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of MI in healthcare settings and to consider its relevance for multimorbidity. Twelve meta-analyses pertinent to multimorbidity lifestyle factors were identified. As an intervention, MI has been found to have a small-to-medium statistically significant effect across a wide variety of single diseases and for a range of behavioural outcomes. This review highlights the need for specific research into the application of MI to determine if the benefits of MI seen with single diseases are also present in the context of multimorbidity.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Multimorbidity is defined as the diagnosis of more than one long-term condition in one person  [1] . Epidemiological research has found high prevalence rates for multimorbidity  [2] [3] [4] . This is particularly true in primary care, with studies in Scotland, Australia, and the USA identifying rates of 23.2%  [2] , 37.1%  [3] , and examined specific comorbidities  [19] . Expert consensus recommendations emphasize supporting behaviour change to address lifestyle factors  [19, [21] [22] [23] . In Canada, Fortin and colleagues examined the association between lifestyle factors and multimorbidity in 1,196 subjects and found that smoking, a diet lacking fruit and vegetables, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, and excess weight, are all factors associated with an increased likelihood of multimorbidity  [24] . Furthermore, the likelihood of multimorbidity increased with each additional unhealthy lifestyle factor  [24] . Medication adherence may also be important, given its impact on chronic condition management  [25, 26] . The World Health Organization also promotes a greater focus on patient-centred skills, highlighting communication and support for behaviour change in chronic illness  [23] . With its emphasis on the individual patient and focus on health-behaviour change, Fortin and colleagues suggest that motivational interviewing (MI) may be a useful intervention for the lifestyle factors impacting on multimorbidity  [24] .\n\nMI has been formally defined as \"\u2026a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion\"  [27] . MI is characterized by the use of communication skills, such as open questions, reflective listening to express empathy, and emphasis on patient autonomy in a clinical session  [27] . First described by Miller in 1983  [28] , the original application of MI was in treatment programmes for people with addictions, and subsequent studies demonstrated good clinical outcomes  [29] . More recently, MI has been seen as a potentially effective intervention in physical healthcare settings  [30] . This has been accompanied by an increase in the publication of primary research  [31]  and systematic reviews of MI  [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . MI has been found to have a small-to-medium effect across settings and a range of target behaviours  [33, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Lundahl and Burke  [41]  reviewed the findings of four meta-analyses in 2009, and found that MI was significantly more effective than no treatment, and equivalent to other treatments for a range of behaviour-change outcomes. Given the breadth of application of MI, and its patient-centred focus, further evaluation of its potential in multimorbidity care is warranted.\n\nThis systematic review identifies research papers of MI in healthcare where authors have used systematic review methodology to identify primary intervention trials and have also conducted a meta-analysis. This is the first systematic review of the literature to specifically examine meta-analyses. This systematic review has three objectives. Firstly, we will examine the evidence for MI in healthcare and specifically for multimorbidity, including the effectiveness of MI for addressing the lifestyle factors relevant to multimorbidity. Secondly, given the widespread impact of multimorbidity on the healthcare system and the recommendation to integrate multimorbidity intervention into existing healthcare  [19] , we will examine whether MI can be delivered effectively by a range of healthcare providers. Finally, based on this analysis of the reviews, we will consider and discuss the potential of MI in clinical work of patients with multimorbidity."

AMSTAR items include the design and conduct of the systematic review, the presentation of review data, the scientific quality of the methods for formulating conclusions, publication bias, and conflict of interest. A score of 1 is allocated to each item that fully meets the specified criteria for each of the 11 AMSTAR items. A score of 0 is allocated if the item is not met or if there is insufficient information presented in the review article to meet the criterion.

      "text": "Overall, the included systematic reviews were of a good quality. Similar to other studies  [55, 56] , some items on the AMSTAR tool were not met by any publication.\n\nItems requiring more extensive statements may be affected by publication parameters. This review has synthesized significant amounts of information, and the quality of the reviews supports the conclusions drawn. This review is limited by the fact that included reviews evaluate the effectiveness of MI for single diseases. We have examined the evidence for the lifestyle factors relevant to multimorbidity, in the absence of specific multimorbidity studies. We are therefore inferring from the available evidence about the potential of MI for multimorbidity; in particular, its potential to address lifestyle factors impacting on the health of patients with multimorbidity.\n\nAdditionally, a potential limitation of this review is that selection was limited to English-language publications. In this case, publication bias may be ameliorated by statistical assessment of publication bias in 75% of the included systematic reviews, and searching of grey literature in 50%. There was also a lack of information about cost-effectiveness. The systematic review by Lai and colleagues identified two trials that reported information about cost, but the information was insufficient to draw any conclusions  [34] . While some authors of the included systematic reviews suggested that MI may be more cost-effective than other interventions as it is a briefer intervention  [40, 50, 53] , the need for specific cost-effectiveness analyses was identified as an important consideration in future research  [37, 40, 53] ."

      "title": "Relating the findings to the existing literature",

The Cochrane Review undertaken by Smith and colleagues  [19]  only identified 10 randomized controlled trials of intervention for multimorbidity and none of these included MI. Despite the lack of intervention trials, expert consensus recommendations identify patient-centred care and communication skills, promoting healthy behaviours, and integrating intervention into routine healthcare as core elements for multimorbidity intervention  [4, 12, 19, 23, 24] . Indeed, some of the authors of the included reviews propose implementing MI as an intervention in routine healthcare  [33, 36, 39, 40, 48, 52]  and for the multiple behaviour-change challenges inherent in primary care practice  [48] ."

All of these behaviours are relevant to people living with multimorbidity.\n\nFurther research may benefit from a greater focus on clinician proficiency, and a greater emphasis on the effectiveness of MI when delivered by a range of clinicians. Future research also needs to include treatment fidelity measures  [37]  to ensure the intervention being studied is indeed MI. In addition, it may also be helpful to use treatment fidelity measures with treatment as usual or comparison conditions to evaluate the degree to which MI can be differentiated from baseline communication styles in routine healthcare delivery  [60] ."
