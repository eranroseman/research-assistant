  "title": "Effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep or nutrition on emotional, behavioural and eating disorders in adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024591285). Eight databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to September 2024. Eligible studies included participants in early (11-14 years), middle (15-17 years) and late (18-21 years) adolescence with clinical diagnosis or self-report of emotional, behavioural, or eating disorders, where interventions targeted physical activity, sedentary behaviour, nutrition, or sleep. The cochrane risk of bias 2.0 (ROB2) and cochrane grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation tool (GRADE) were applied. Pooled effect sizes were calculated as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals using random-effect models. Results: Nine RCTs involving 3,703 participants were analysed across emotional, behavioural, and eating disorders. The meta-analysis yielded a significant reduction in anxiety (  6 Studies, 2086 participants, SMD [95% CI] = -0.19 [-0.37, -0.01], I 2 = 71%, with positive effects for sleep focussed interventions as well as multimodal interventions (PA, SB, diet, sleep) and eating disorders (3 studies, 732 participants, SMD [95% CI] = -0.23 [-0.44, -0.02], I 2 = 38%, with positive effects for diet and combined diet/PA interventions). In contrast, depressive (7 Studies, 1855 participants, SMD [95%CI] of -0.12 [-0.28, -0.04], I 2 59%) and behavioural disorders symptoms (2 studies, 560 participants, SMD [95%CI] = -0.71 [1 .77, 0.36], I 2 = 95) showed no significant pooled effect. The cumulative evidence was weakened by high heterogeneity of trial design and low overall certainty of evidence as indicated by ROB2 and GRADE assessments. Across interventions, trials characterized by higher session frequency, greater intensity (e.g., more vigorous physical activity), longer duration, and hybrid delivery methods, including some face-to-face counselling were associated with larger effect sizes but reduced scalability. Discussion: These findings suggest that mHealth interventions incorporating health behavior modifications may effectively reduce anxiety and eating disorder symptoms in adolescents. However, modest and mixed effects on depression and behavioural disorders, together with a low number of included studies, considerable heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence, underscore the need for further high-quality RCTs to evaluate long-term efficacy. Combining mHealth interventions with standard clinical care may enhance symptom improvements in adolescents.",

      "text": "Introduction: Mental health conditions are highly prevalent among adolescents, affecting one in seven individuals and accounting for 15% of the global disease burden in this age group. The promotion of health behaviours including physical activity, nutrition, and sleep, and reduction of sedentary behaviour, has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of mental health conditions in adolescents. However, addressing this public health challenge at a population level requires scalable interventions, such as mobile health (mHealth) interventions. However, the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in achieving clinically meaningful mental health improvements for adolescents with emotional, behavioural, or eating disorders remains unclear. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth behaviour change interventions aimed at improving physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB), nutrition, or sleep on outcomes related to emotional, behavioural, and eating disorders in adolescents."

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Globally, it is estimated that one in seven (15%) adolescents experiences mental health conditions  (1) , yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated. The most prevalent disorders in this age group are emotional, behavioural, and eating disorders  (2, 3) . Emotional disorders typically include anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, and social anxiety disorder) as well as depressive disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, dysthymia). Behavioural disorders encompass attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorders, and addiction disorders-including substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis) and gaming disorder. Additionally, eating disorders-particularly anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa-represent significant concerns. These disorders often co-occur and are associated with significant long-term consequences, including impaired academic performance, impaired social functioning, and increased risk of chronic physical and mental health conditions in adulthood  (4, 5) . Given their high prevalence in adolescents, these mental health conditions are the focus of this review.\n\nAdolescents are a vulnerable population due to ongoing brain development, particularly in areas responsible for emotional regulation, impulse control, and decision-making; making them more susceptible to mental health challenges  (6, 7) . This period is also marked by identity formation, heightened sensitivity to peer influence, and increased exposure to digital and social media, all of which contribute to psychological distress and potential behaviours such as less healthy diets, physical inactivity, and substance use  (8, 9) . Many mental health conditions first emerge during adolescence  (10) , yet stigma, lack of awareness, and limited access to services often delay intervention  (11) . Additionally, adolescents differ from adults in their psychological needs, experiencing greater emotional variability and heightened sensitivity to reward and peer validation while still developing executive functioning skills  (12) . These factors make them more reactive to stress and external influences and create unique barriers to help-seeking, as they often rely on parents, schools  (13) , or digital resources for support  (14) . Given these developmental differences, interventions designed for adults may not be applicable, underscoring the need for age-specific, developmentally appropriate approaches  (15) .\n\nAdolescence represents a developmental stage during which the formation of social and emotional habits is critical for long-term mental health. During this period, individuals typically establish sleep routines, engage in regular physical activity, and develop coping, problem-solving, interpersonal, and emotional regulation skills  (1) . Modifiable health behaviours, including physical activity, sedentary behaviour, nutrition, and sleep, play a pivotal role in mental health outcomes in adolescents  (16, 17) . For instance, physical activity has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, while poor sleep and unhealthy dietary patterns are associated with increased risk of emotional and behavioural disorders  (18, 19) . Given the widespread use of digital technologies among adolescents, mobile health (mHealth) interventions [e.g.,  (20) ], delivered via digital technologies such as smartphone apps, wearables, and SMS, offer a promising avenue for addressing these behavioural factors in adolescents. These interventions are cost-effective, scalable, and capable of reaching diverse populations, including those in underserved or remote areas  (21) .\n\nPrevious systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the role of behavioural interventions in improving mental health outcomes, providing valuable insights but also revealing significant limitations. For example, Firth et al.  (17)  conducted a meta-review on the impact of behavioural psychiatry, identifying strong evidence for the benefits of physical activity, improved diet, and better sleep on mental health across various populations. Their findings indicated that physical activity had a moderate to large effect on reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the review primarily focused on adult populations and did not specifically address the unique developmental and psychological needs of adolescents. Similarly, Hoare et al.  (19)  systematically reviewed the associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health among adolescents, finding that excessive screen time and sedentary behaviour were linked to poorer mental health outcomes. However, their review did not explore the potential of interventions to mitigate these effects, nor did it consider the role of digital tools in addressing sedentary behaviour. Khan et al.  (18)  examined the therapeutic potential of physical activity for mental health, concluding that exercise interventions could significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, their review did not focus on adolescents or the integration of digital technologies. Furthermore, while previous reviews have contributed to understanding the role of individual health behaviours, they often lack a comprehensive approach that considers the interplay between multiple health behaviours factors (e.g., physical activity, nutrition, and sleep) or their collective impact on mental health and the interconnectedness of emotional, behavioural, and eating disorders, which often co-occur and share common underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe behavioural factors addressed by mHealth interventionsphysical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet, and sleep-are all known to influence adolescent mental health through various biobehavioural pathways. Regular physical activity may reduce risk of depression and anxiety through endorphin release and reduced muscle tension, decreased inflammation and improved neuroplasticity  (22) . Meta-analytical evidence confirms exercise's efficacy in alleviating mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms in youth and adults. Likewise, diet quality is linked to mental health; high-fat/sugar diets correlate with poorer mood and higher stress, while nutrient-rich diets support emotional well-being  (23) . Nutrient deficits (e.g., omega-3, vitamins) or fluctuations in glycaemic balance can affect brain function and mood regulation. Improving diet through an intervention might therefore confer small psychological benefits-yet if done in a restrictive or weightcentric way, it could also provoke anxiety. Lastly, sleep is crucial for mental health, with poor sleep linked to elevated depression and anxiety  (24) . Even in clinical samples, youth with sleep disturbances show significantly higher internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Thus, interventions that successfully improve sleep hygiene (earlier bedtimes, reduced screen use at night, etc.) can in turn reduce emotional lability and irritability.\n\nAnother gap in the literature is the limited focus on mHealth interventions, despite their growing use in health care  (25) . For example, Free et al.  (21)  demonstrated the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in improving health service delivery, however, their review did not specifically address mental health conditions nor adolescent populations. Moreover, many existing reviews  (26, 27)  have not systematically evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting multiple health behaviours in improving mental health outcomes. This represents a significant oversight, given the potential of digital tools to deliver integrated, personalized, and scalable interventions that address the complex interplay between health behaviours and mental health.\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address these gaps by evaluating the effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting physical activity, sedentary behaviour, nutrition, or sleep on emotional, behavioural, and eating disorders exclusively in adolescents aged 11-21 years. Additionally, this review explored the mechanisms behind health behaviour change interventions with more than one target behaviour, offering insights into how mHealth interventions can be optimized to address the unique mental health challenges faced by adolescents. The findings will inform the development of targeted, evidence-based mHealth strategies to address the interconnected challenges of mental health and health behaviours in adolescents, ultimately contributing to improved well-being and reduced disease burden in this critical age group."

The target population included adolescents aged 11-21 years with emotional, behavioural, or eating disorders, either diagnosed or self-reported. Eligible interventions were digital behavioural mHealth interventions delivered via mobile applications, wearable devices, or SMS-based communication, aimed at improving physical activity, sedentary behaviour, nutrition, or sleep. \"Eligible studies were required to deliver the main behaviour-change content predominantly (\u226575% of contact time) via digital technologies (e.g., apps, web platforms, SMS). Ancillary non-digital elements-such as a one-off orientation session, brief therapist feedback, or parent-directed materialswere permitted provided they remained clearly secondary to the digital component.\" Control groups included no intervention, active controls, treatment as usual, waitlist controls, or attentionmatched sham interventions. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet or sleep interventions delivered via traditional methods (e.g., face to face) as a comparison to digital interventions were not eligible to be included. Primary outcomes were changes in emotional disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), behavioural disorders (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorders, addiction), and eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) measured at baseline and post-intervention. Only studies reporting validated outcome measures were eligible (e.g., qualitative assessments were excluded). Inclusion was limited to RCTs and it's derivations (e.g., cluster RCTs, waitlist-controlled trials, and quasi-RCT's). Observational studies, case reports, prevalence studies, and theoretical papers were excluded. No language or publication date restrictions were applied. Information sources and search strategy A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMCARE, PEDro, and Web of Science. Search terms were developed based on Medical Subject Headings and free-text keywords related to mHealth, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, nutrition, sleep, and mental health outcomes.

Nine reviewers (HB, ZY, JF, CG, AS, BS, KW, SS, and MA) independently evaluated the risk of bias for each study in duplicate, with a third reviewer (HB) consulted to resolve any discrepancies. The ROB2 tool provides predefined criteria for evaluating methodological rigor in each domain, ensuring a standardized assessment of study quality. Reviewers were required to apply these criteria systematically and substantiate their judgments with specific textual evidence from the studies. The resulting assessments were integrated into the overall synthesis to evaluate the quality and reliability of the evidence base.

In cases where multiple measures were reported for the same outcome, the most clinically relevant and methodologically valid measure was prioritized.

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, with values exceeding 75% indicating considerable heterogeneity, values between 50% and 75% suggesting substantial heterogeneity, and values below 40% reflecting limited heterogeneity. The Restricted Maximum-Likelihood (REML) method was employed as the heterogeneity estimator to provide an unbiased variance estimate. Confidence intervals for the summary effect were calculated using the Wald-type method. To evaluate potential publication bias, contour-enhanced funnel plots, Egger's test, and Begg's test were applied.

At the study level, eight of the included studies (88%)  (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42)  were conducted in countries with a human development index >0.9, with an even distribution across early adolescence (11-14 years, 44%, n = 4) and late adolescence (18-21 years, 44%, n = 4), and only one study  (40)  focusing on middle adolescence (15-17 years, 11%, n = 1) and also being the largest study with n = 1,349 participants. The mean age across studies was 15.93 \u00b1 2.11 years. Female participants accounted for 71% (n = 2,297) of the total sample, with two studies exclusively targeting female populations  (37, 38) . Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprised 33% (n = 3) of the studies, with the remainder consisting of cluster RCTs (33%, n = 3), waitlist-controlled trials (22%, n = 2), and quasi-RCTs (11%, n = 1). The studies collectively included a total of 3,219 participants with overall sample sizes considerably varying from n = 100 up to n = 1,349, with a mean of 178 \u00b1 202 participants per study arm. Nearly two-thirds of the total sample was provided by the study of Fitzsimmons-Craft et al.  (  At intervention level, diet was the most targeted health behaviour across studies (66%, n = 6), followed by physical activity (55%, n = 5) and sleep (55%, n = 5), while sedentary behaviour was targeted in 22% (n = 2) of studies (n = 4 studies targeted multiple health behaviours at once). Multifactorial interventions, such as SidekickHealth  (36)  and LIFEGOALS  (41) , addressed multiple health behaviours, often applied to mild mental health conditions (see Table  1 ). Conversely, interventions targeting more severe conditions, such as those by Anastasiadou et al. (35) and Lahtinen et al. (40), typically only focused on one health behaviour. Interventions for moderate to severe disorders Baumann et al. 10.3389/fdgth.2025.1593677 Frontiers in Digital Health were associated with higher session frequency and intensity (see FITT principles in Table 1) and higher app engagement related to the targeted health behaviour. As presented in Table 1, studies with multi-behavior approaches, higher session frequencies, longer duration, hybrid delivery formats show improved adherence and more robust outcomes. For instance, in their study, Anastasiadou et al. (35) implemented seven sessions per week with high intensity diet related CBT + TC App sessions for moderate to severe cases of eating disorders. In Contrast, Zhao et al. (44) applied three sessions per week with high intensity physical activity for mild to severe forms of ADHD. In contrast, interventions for milder mental health cases often featured lower frequencies or self-paced formats, such as in the study by Fitzsimmons-Craft et al. (37), which used a self-paced approach for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorders. Intervention durations varied widely, averaging 10.5 \u00b1 8.5 weeks. The study by Fitzsimmons-Craft et al. (37) reported the longest intervention period of 32 weeks, while shorter durations were observed in the studies by Zhao et al. (44) (4 weeks) and Werner-Seidel et al. (  42 ) (6 weeks). Delivery approaches for both intervention and control groups (there was a total of 18 study arms across the 9 included studies) were predominantly appbased (61%, n = 11 study arms), with additional approaches also including web (11%, n = 2 study arms), face-to-face (17%, n = 3 studyarms), augmented reality (5%, n = 1 studyarm), and diarybased interventions (5%, n = 1 studyarm).\n\nAt the outcome level, emotional disorders were the most frequently addressed disorder group (55%, n = 5), followed by eating disorders (33%, n = 3) and behavioural disorders (11%, n = 2). Disorder severity was predominantly moderate (40%, n = 6), with fewer studies addressing mild (33%, n = 5) or severe (27%, n = 4) conditions. Emotional disorders were predominantly assessed using validated psychometric instruments, with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) applied in 3 of the 5 studies focused on emotional disorders and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) in 2 of these 5 studies. Eating disorders were evaluated using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) in all 3 of the eating disorder of studies. Behavioural disorders, including ADHD, were with the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV Scale (SNAP-IV)  (44)  or by frequency measures of specific behaviours  (37) . Across all categories, standardized assessment tools were consistently employed to ensure methodological rigor and comparability across studies. The majority of studies targeting eating disorders, such as the studies by Fitzsimmons-Craft et al.  (37)  and Hahn et al. (38), exclusively included female participants. In contrast, studies addressing emotional disorders, such as Egilsson et al. (36), had more balanced gender distributions (47% female, n = 147). Studies targeting severe disorders with behavioural mHealth interventions demonstrated lower effects sizes then Studies targeting mild to moderate disorder symptoms."

      "text": "Although the data from nine studies were insufficient to conduct any subgroup analyses, there was adequate information available to perform meta-analyses on emotional disorders, including depression and anxiety, as well as eating disorders and behavioral disorders (see Figure  2 ). Heterogeneity was lowest for eating disorders and highest for behavioural disorders. Study contributions to the pooled effects varied from 8% to 51%. The forest plots in Figure  2   In contrast, depressive [7 studies, 1,855 participants, SMD (95%CI) of -0.12 (-0.28, 0.04), I 2 59%] and behavioural disorders symptoms [2 studies, 560 participants, SMD (95% CI) = -0.71 (-1.77, 0.36), I 2 = 95] showed no significant pooled effect. To illustrate findings, Figure  3  further depicts these relationships by mapping the targeted health behaviours to the corresponding mental health outcomes, highlighting the heterogeneity in intervention target behaviours and outcome measures across studies. It presents an overview of the included studies categorized by their targeted health behaviour and primary mental health outcomes and indicates, if the meta-analysis results showed a symptom reduction (green arrow) or symptom exacerbation (orange arrow). The diagram illustrates the complexity of the relationships within the integrated studies by mapping specific mHealth intervention target behaviours to the respective mental health outcomes. The origin and termination points of each arrow were chosen intentionally to convey two pieces of information: (i) the health behaviour(s) targeted by the intervention and (ii) the mental-health outcome(s) evaluated in the study. Grey frames aggregate related constructs in order to visualise the degree of specificity or breadth with which individual studies addressed behaviours and outcomes. (i) Intervention side (left): When an arrow originates at the boundary of the grey frame that Forest plots and risk of bias assessment for (a) depression, (b) anxiety, (c) eating disorders and (d) behavioural disorder outcomes (\"+\" = low risk of bias, \"?\" = unclear risk of bias), \"-\" = high risk of bias). encloses all four health behaviours [sedentary behaviour (SB), sleep, diet and physical activity (PA)], the corresponding intervention targeted all four behaviours [e.g.,  (41) ]. If the arrow begins at one specific behaviour (e.g., PA), the intervention focused exclusively on that behaviour [e.g.,  (44) ]. (ii) Outcome side (right): Arrows that terminate at the outer margin of a grey frame (e.g., \"Emotional Disorders\") indicate that the study reported outcomes at the category level, without differentiating between individual disorders [e.g.,  (20) ]. Arrows that end within a specific disorder box (e.g., \"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\") signal that outcomes were assessed for that particular diagnosis only, as illustrated by Zhao et al.  (44) .\n\nThe figure highlights the variability in intervention approaches, with some studies employing multimodal strategies, integrating multiple health behaviours  (36, 39, 41) , while others focus on a single behavioural target  (35, 37, 40, 43, 44) . This differentiation is visually represented by the origin and termination points of the arrows, indicating the specific behaviours addressed and their corresponding mental health outcomes. A similar pattern is observed in the scope of the targeted outcomes. While some studies address broad categories of mental health conditions, such as emotional disorders  (36, 40) , others focus on specific disorders, such as ADHD  (44) . Furthermore, some studies target multiple specific and grouped mental health outcomes simultaneously  (37) , demonstrating the heterogeneity of the evidence base."

For behavioural and eating disorder outcomes, the number of studies included was too small (n \u2264 6) to perform a funnel plot analysis. For depression outcomes, the plot showed symmetry, indicating minimal publication bias. The removal of one influential study reduced heterogeneity from 52.82% to 14.76%, suggesting that the results are reliable with minimal variability. In contrast, anxiety outcomes revealed slight asymmetry, pointing to moderate publication bias. Behavioural disorders, with only two studies available, provided limited data for analysis. For eating disorders, the pooled effect size (-0.40) suggested a moderate reduction in symptoms, but the scarcity of data weakened the robustness of the findings.\n\nAcross all outcome categories, depression and anxiety outcomes demonstrated minimal bias and manageable heterogeneity, while eating disorder results showed greater variability and sensitivity to outliers. Behavioural disorder findings were constrained by insufficient data. An additional leave-one-out analysis revealed varying degrees of influence by individual studies across outcomes. For behavioural outcomes, the analysis was limited due to the small number of studies (n = 2), making meaningful interpretations of influence of heterogeneity impossible.

For anxiety symptoms, the pooled effect size ranged from -0.26 to -0.14, with two studies significantly affecting the results (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.016). Removing one study reduced heterogeneity from I 2 = 65.56 percent to I 2 = 45.61 percent, while removing another increased it to I 2 = 72.09 percent. Overall, while the results are generally stable, specific studies had a disproportionate impact on the pooled effect sizes and heterogeneity, particularly for depressive symptoms, eating disorders, and anxiety symptoms, underlining the importance of study-level characteristics and their role in driving heterogeneity."

In broad terms, the certainty of the findings is largely compromised by serious issues in study design and reporting-most notably, risk of bias and imprecision consistently affected the reliability of the effect estimates. Although a greater number of studies underpin the depression and anxiety outcomes, these were nonetheless downgraded on multiple fronts, resulting in low confidence regarding the observed effects. For eating disorders, the evidence, albeit based on fewer studies, demonstrated somewhat greater consistency and precision, which translated into a moderate level of certainty. In contrast, the very limited evidence available for behavioural disorders was marked by pronounced inconsistency and a strong suspicion of publication bias, leading to an overall classification of very low certainty."

      "text": "Our review found that mHealth interventions targeting behaviours like physical activity, diet, and sleep can lead to reductions in anxiety symptoms among adolescents, even when formal psychotherapy is not provided (see Table  1 ). Positive effects were found in sleep focussed interventions as well as multimodal interventions (PA, SB, diet, sleep) particularly effective interventions being the SidekickHealth App  (36)  and the Sleep Ninja App  (42) , SB-ED-App  (37)  and the MBP-Webapp  (40) . This aligns with prior research showing that both digital cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) programs and health behaviour interventions can-especially in mild conditionseffectively reduce anxiety in adolescents, as demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis  (47) . Blending online modules with therapist support (a \"hybrid\" model) could also harness the convenience of technology and the personal connection of face-to-face therapy  (48) , but would also limit scalability. Of course, this does not diminish the value of therapy for more severe or complex anxiety disorders, but it underscores the potential of accessible behavioural modifications as an early-line or adjunct strategy. Several trials in this review that used a combination of sleep and physical activity interventions  (40, 42)  have reported meaningful reductions in adolescent anxiety symptoms which aligns with those reported in previous systematic reviews in adults  (18, 49, 50) . Improvements in anxiety symptoms were noted across various studies, even when mHealth interventions focused on all behavioural outcomes simultaneously (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet and sleep [e.g.,  (36) ] rather than including standard psychological therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy  (51) . This aligns with broader evidence that behavioural adaptation (e.g., regular exercise) and healthy routines exert anxiolytic effects in young populations. A systematic review concluded that physical activity effectively reduces anxiety in adolescents and young adults, with active participants experiencing greater symptom reduction than inactive controls  (52) . Potential mechanisms include improved autonomic regulation, changes in neurotransmitter levels, anti-inflammatory effects, and increased neurotrophic factors  (53) . mHealth interventions also often improve sleep quality, which can break the vicious cycle between insomnia and anxiety  (54) . Better sleep and fitness contribute to improved emotion regulation and reduced anxiety  (52) . While these behavioural changes help, they may not fully resolve symptoms in all adolescents, particularly those with severe anxiety. A stepped-care approach-starting with mHealth tools in mild conditions and progressing to therapy in more severe cases if needed-may be most effective: beginning with behavioural mHealth tools to capitalize on adolescents' receptivity to tech-based coaching and then stepping up to blended or face-to-face therapy if needed for those who do not respond sufficiently."

      "text": "The meta-analytic results on eating disorders suggest that welldesigned digital tools-especially those integrating parental support or professional guidance-can reduce behaviours like binge eating, restrictive dieting, or unhealthy weight control in young people. Positive effects were found for diet only and combined diet/physical activity interventions, with particularly effective interventions being the TC-App used by Anastasiadou et al.  (35) , the SB-ED-App used by Fitzsimmons-Craft et al.  (37)  and the MyFitnessPal-App used by Hahn et al.  (38) . However, focusing too narrowly or intensively on eating behaviour in an intervention can, in some cases, heighten anxiety or depressive symptoms. There is evidence that certain diet-tracking and fitness apps-particularly those emphasizing calorie counting, weight goals, and quantitative feedback-might inadvertently exacerbate anxiety or disordered eating thoughts in vulnerable users  (55) . Based on the meta-analytic findings, trials that\n\nTABLE 2 Summary of findings, based on GRADE approach.

This pattern suggests that while the intervention effectively targeted the eating disorder construct, it may have inadvertently led to an exacerbation of other related psychological symptoms. One interpretation is that the reduction in eating disorder symptoms could be accompanied by compensatory processes, wherein the focus on one clinical domain shifts or unmasks underlying vulnerabilities in other domains, such as anxiety and depression  (56) . These findings underscore the complexity inherent in treating multifaceted psychopathologies. Consequently, the meta-analytic results highlight the need for integrated treatment strategies that concurrently address both eating disorder symptoms and comorbid affective disturbances, rather than focusing on a single symptomatic domain  (57) . Digital interventions should avoid an exclusive emphasis on caloric intake or weight, and instead incorporate elements addressing body image, emotion regulation, and self-compassion to mitigate potential harms  (57) . It is worth noting that not all research agrees on the risks of dietary selfmonitoring. Some studies  (58)  have found that introducing tracking in a careful, time-limited way does not necessarily worsen mental health. For example, a randomized trial with young adult women (at low eating disorder risk) showed that one month of using a calorie-counting app did not increase eating disorder symptoms, anxiety, or depression, compared to a no-intervention group  (38) . This suggests that the impact of eating-focused digital tools can vary depending on the population and how the tool is implemented. In low-risk individuals or when paired with protective guidance, self-monitoring might be benign or even helpful for building awareness. However, among adolescentswho often face peer pressure about appearance and may be more impressionable-a purely diet-centric app or intervention could be problematic  (59) . Thus, the context and design of mHealth eating interventions are crucial. Emphasizing balanced nutrition, mood tracking, and positive psychology (rather than just restricting foods or hitting weight targets) may help ensure that improvements in eating behaviour do not come at the cost of worsened anxiety or mood  (60, 61) . Integrating mental health support or modules on coping with food-related stress can further safeguard against unintended negative effects (62)."

      "title": "Depression",
      "text": "Unlike anxiety, which sometimes shows quick wins from behavioural activation, depression may involve an anhedonia and motivational deficit that makes it harder for adolescents to initiate or sustain healthy behaviours without additional support  (63) . This may explain why depression outcomes improve more gradually and may require multi-component interventions  (64) . This review suggests that the impact of behavioural mHealth interventions on depression in adolescents may be limited. This aligns with clinical understanding that adolescent depression manifest deeply and requires intensive interventions  (65, 66) . In our review, improvements in depressive symptoms were small and inconsistent. This is consistent with meta-analytic findings in the literature many digital or behavioural interventions do yield short-term reductions in adolescent depressive symptoms but often rebound  (57) . For instance, a comprehensive multiverse meta-analysis of digital depression interventions found moderate effect size immediately post-intervention but also noted that effects tended to diminish at follow-ups beyond 24 weeks  (67) . It is important to acknowledge that some behavioural interventions do confer benefits for depression. Regular physical activity, for example, has been associated with mood improvements in youth  (68) . A meta-analysis of exercise interventions for adolescents with depression reported a statistically significant antidepressant effect in favour of exercise groups over controls  (69) . This indicates that structured exercise can indeed reduce depressive symptoms to a meaningful degree, supporting its use as a complementary treatment. In practice, depressive symptoms in adolescents often involve biological, psychological, and social factors that may not be fully remedied by health behaviour change alone.\n\nCoaching, therapy, or even medication might be necessary to augment mHealth programs for depression, ensuring the adolescent stays engaged long enough to benefit."

This is perhaps surprising given that ADHD has a strong neurodevelopmental basis-it is linked to underlying structural and functional brain differences (70) that behavioural interventions alone might not fully overcome  (71, 72) . That said, there is evidence that structured exercise programs can provide small benefits for youth with ADHD (73), even if they are not a standalone cure. Physical activity has attracted attention as a complementary intervention for ADHD due to its potential effects on executive functioning and self-regulation  (74) . Some studies in our review  (44)  noted slight improvements in attention span, mood, or hyperactivity levels following regular exercise in adolescents with ADHD. A systematic review by Neudecker et al. found the largest positive effects from mixed exercise programs (combining aerobic and coordinative activities) on ADHD symptomatology and motor skills  (75) . However, the findings across studies were highly heterogeneous and often inconsistent. Differences in exercise type, frequency, and study design led to variable outcomes, and the review ultimately concluded that no evidence-based exercise prescription for ADHD could yet be determined  (75) ."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "This review was preregistered and conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and used high quality standards, such as ROB2 assessment and GRADE. Only randomized controlled study designs, including randomized controlled trials, waitlist-controlled trials, quasi-RCTs, were included, and comprehensive literature searches were conducted. A robust assessment of study quality, risk of bias, and heterogeneity using the GRADE framework further bolstered the evaluation. In addition, the systematic application of FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principles enabled a detailed comparison of intervention characteristics, while the collaboration of a large, multidisciplinary author group enhanced the review's overall robustness. Despite these strengths, the review has three main limitations that warrant caution in interpretation: First, the small number of primary studies (n = 9) and the moderate to high heterogeneity observed, particularly for depression and behavioural disorders, limit the generalizability of the findings. The certainty of evidence table underscores these limitations, indicating that the small to moderate pooled effects should be interpreted with caution. Second, high attrition rates, which are well-documented in mHealth studies (76) may inflate the apparent efficacy seen in completers compared to the real-world scenario. For physical activity and sedentary behaviour interventions that address mental health disorders via mHealth interventions, more high-quality RCTs are needed to yield robust meta-analytic conclusions. Expanding our understanding of how mHealth interventions support health behaviours in adolescents is critical for guiding future intervention development and providing ongoing support. Third, an additional limitation of this review is the considerable gender imbalance in the included studies, with female adolescents representing 71% of the total sample. This predominantly female representation, particularly pronounced in studies addressing eating disorders, raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to male adolescents, who may exhibit distinct clinical presentations and respond differently to mHealth interventions. Future research should aim for balanced or gender-specific study designs to better understand genderspecific effects and ensure broader applicability of the findings. Additionally, the relatively short duration and follow-up periods observed in the included studies limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions about the long-term effectiveness of mHealth interventions on mental health outcomes. Given that behavioural and psychological changes may require sustained engagement over time, future research should prioritize longterm follow-up assessments to verify the durability of observed symptom improvements and to identify potential delayed effects or relapses following intervention cessation."

      "text": "The findings suggest that mHealth interventions offer a scalable approach to promote mental health in adolescents, at least for anxiety and eating disorders. Given the widespread access to smartphones, these interventions can complement standard clinical care, particularly mild conditions and in resource-limited settings where traditional face-to-face services are scarce. Although available study data was limited, multicomponent interventions that integrate physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet, sleep, and are complimented by psychological components appear to offer the most consistent benefits. Enhancing these interventions with interactive features such as gamification  (77) , self-monitoring, and personalized feedback could further boost adherence and long-term behavioural change  (78) . Importantly, integrating mHealth tools with standard care, rather than replacing traditional therapies, may optimize outcomes for adolescents with more severe symptoms.\n\nBased on our findings, we recommend mHealth interventions particularly for adolescents with milder symptom presentations, as these groups appear to benefit most from app-based approaches. The effectiveness of interventions increases with frequency and intensity of engagement, indicating that encouraging regular use and adherence could optimize therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, app-based approachesespecially those incorporating hybrid delivery, structured sessions, and multimodal health behaviour targeting-should be prioritized. For practical implementation, we propose a steppedcare approach: initially offering fully digital solutions for milder symptoms and gradually progressing towards hybrid interventions or therapist-supported apps for cases showing greater severity or complexity.\n\nFuture research should focus on conducting well-powered, high-quality long term RCTs (preferably with follow up measurements) to investigate the comparative effectiveness of various mHealth intervention components. Research should aim to isolate the impact of features like personalized coaching, peer support, and gamification to determine which strategies best foster engagement and mental health improvements. Given the moderate to high heterogeneity observed in current studies, it is imperative to explore how individual differences (such as developmental stage and baseline mental health status) influence intervention efficacy. Long-term follow-up studies are necessary to assess the durability of improvements in anxiety and eating disorder symptoms, as many digital interventions suffer from high dropout rates. Enhanced strategies to improve sustained engagement-such as adaptive content, push notifications, and social reinforcement-should be a priority. Additionally, future research should consider tailoring mHealth interventions  (79)  to diverse adolescent populations, addressing factors like gender, socioeconomic status, and cultural context to promote equity in mental health care."

      "text": "This review highlights the potential for mHealth interventions to address adolescent mental health, particularly for anxiety and eating disorders. Although digital interventions offer a promising, scalable solution, their effectiveness depends on the integration of multiple lifestyle components and strategies to maintain user engagement. Despite the methodological rigor demonstrated by the predominance of randomized controlled trials, challenges remain with inconsistent reporting of engagement metrics and risk of bias, suggesting that future research should aim to standardize intervention protocols and enhance adherence strategies  (80, 81) . As highlighted in previous research  (15) , these trends highlight the potential of integrated, well-supported mHealth interventions tailored to the developmental needs of adolescents  (79, 82)  while also identifying areas for improvement in future studies. The findings underscore the need for highquality research to refine intervention strategies, optimize delivery formats, and ensure long-term benefits for adolescents. As the field advances, a balanced approach that combines mHealth with traditional clinical care will likely yield the most sustainable outcomes."
