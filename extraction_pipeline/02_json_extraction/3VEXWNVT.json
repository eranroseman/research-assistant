  "title": "TEAM-BASED HOME BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING FOR BLOOD PRESSURE EQUITY A PROTOCOL FOR A STEPPED WEDGE CLUSTER RANDOMIZED TRIAL",
  "abstract": "We will address the following research questions and hypotheses (Table  2):  1. Can TB-HBPM be feasibly implemented in primary care? 2. Will implementation improve rates of blood pressure control and mitigate disparities in blood pressure between Black and White patients? 3. Will TB-HBPM be financially viable? 4. What generalizable insights can we derive from this trial? \n METHODS \n Study overview Rationale for the TB-HBPM. Systematic reviews provide strong evidence that HBPM improves HTN management by engaging patients in self-management, fostering improved medication and lifestyle adherence, generation of reliable and actionable data, reducing clinical inertia (failing to intensify medication when indicated), and most critically by providing a means to manage HTN outside of office visits by providing for real-time HTN medication adjustments.  3, 12, 13 Effective implementation and sustainability for HBPM requires a team. Busy primary care clinicians cannot do this alone. 14 Hence, TB-HBPM is critical to the effective implementation of HBPM in primary care.  13, 15, 16 We address the lack of scientific knowledge regarding effective strategies for implementing and sustaining TB-HBPM in primary care. \n Conceptual Model",

[7] [8] 10] We address this translational gap for TB-HBPM. First, we operationalize TB-HBPM (the intervention) using the components in the Chronic Care Model(Figure  1 ).  11 Second, we develop and deploy implementation strategies that target key barriers and leverage facilitators."

The prepared team optimizes antihypertensive medication management, promotes patient adherence to medications and behavioral changes through self-management support, and supports patient lifestyle changes improving HTN control.  24 We address relevant selected determinants of health, e.g. affordability of devices, BP knowledge, digital health literacy, and material hardships through free BP devices, ease of reporting BP readings through texting, culturally adapted BP education materials, proactive outreach to patients, linkage to community resources and progress reports that are stratified by race."

The overall rate of control i.e., last <140/90 mm Hg, across all eight suites is 51%. Rates of control are slightly lower for African Americans (48%), slightly higher for Latinx patients (56%), and patients with Medicaid (53%). Hypertension control is based on the American College of Cardiology/American Health Association (ACC/AHA) criteria i.e., <130/80 is 22%. Notably, the mean BPs for patients with hypertension were 140/78.

Clinicians receive training in BP management, optimal BP targets or goals, use of the EHR digital health portal to access patients' texted BP readings, and an EHR office visit template that automatically pulls EHR data and expedites community referrals.

      "title": "Realist Evaluation",
      "text": "A realist evaluation is a type of theory-driven evaluation that develops a form of theory -called a program theory. A program theory is an evidence informed explanation of causation within a program that focuses on elucidating how a program or intervention is meant to work, why, for whom and in what contexts. This approach is increasing used to enable the assessment of complex interventions whose outcomes are influenced by context  30  and allows us to test (i.e. confirm, refute, or refine) our assumption that the implementation strategies within our intervention listed in Table  1  will lead to the desired outcomes. First, we will develop an initial program theory which is a more speculative version of the program theory we wish to end up with at the conclusion of the study. During the realist evaluation, we will gradually refine our initial program theory using the primary data we collect so we have an understanding of how, why and for whom the different strategies fit together. This approach will facilitate an understanding of how the implementation strategies affect the external and internal context of clinicians, staff, and patients, triggering changes in reasoning that affect RE-AIM outcomes, under what circumstances, and for whom. We will use mixed methods to collect the primary data needed on each RE-AIM dimension in both data collection and analysis.\n\nThe causal explanations within a program theory developed in a realist evaluation are expressed in a particular form -namely the context-mechanism-outcome-configuration or CMOC. They set out the relationship between contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes.  31, 32 Within a CMOC (in its simplest form) the causal claim is that within this context, a mechanism was 'triggered' which in turn caused this outcome. During the study, we will collect primary data that enables us to test prespecified assumptions (Table  2 ) by stating them as CMOCs. For example, the fourth assumption in Table  2  can be stated: when well-functioning teams are challenged with gap reports (Context), they are more likely to enter into discussion about solutions (Outcome), because psychological safety is present (Mechanism).\n\nTo conduct the realist evaluation, we will obtain data using rigorous methods from the following sources: individual realist interviews with clinicians, staff, managers, and patients throughout the trial,  30  field notes by the trainer and staff throughout,  33  and random audio recordings from team huddles, meetings, debriefs and patient training,  34  and adaptations based on the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (FRAME).  35 We will purposively sample patient, staff, and clinician participants (20 from each group) with varying levels of engagement.\n\nWe will enter and code these data, along with relevant quantitative data from RE-AIM, into software designed to assist with qualitative data analysis (MAXQDA, Berlin). Our initial deductive codes (based on our initial programme theory) will be for the use of reports; delegation of tasks; follow-up; level of participation from members; active problem-solving; self-reflection and; steps taken to improve control and equity. Where needed we will also inductively create new codes to capture additional concepts. We will use a tried and tested realist logic of analysis to analyze our data.  36 In practice, this means that we will read and interpret the data to help us understand how factors yielding trial outcomes. For example, if a patient began using HBPM, we would use our data to determine why they did this (i.e., data to explain the mechanisms). We would also use our data to explain in what contexts they would do this. Through iterative cycles of this process, we would be able to form CMOCs that explain the various contexts when patients use HBPM. We would also use our data to explain how any CMOC we develop relates to each other. For example, we would use collected qualitative data to understand how any CMOCs that explain why patients use HBPM relate to ones about why and when clinicians might offer HBPM. Finally, we would use the data to link each of the implementation strategies with each CMOC. By doing so we will gradually refine our program theory so that it not only contains CMOCs, but also explains how these relate to each other within it."

      "text": "We propose to use generalized linear mixed models to estimate the treatment and covariate effects in the SWCRT; these models and corresponding likelihood-based methods are the conventional tools advocated in the statistics literature for this type of study design. Our outcomes are assumed to be Bernoulli (yes/no) random variables indicating controlled blood pressure (BP) with three-levels of nesting: that is, outcome (i,j,k) represents the observation for the jth patient nested in the ith suite at the kth time point. We model the conditional probability of controlled BP given the jth patient and ith suite at the kth time point, on the logit-scale, as the sum of linear fixed and random effects. Our model includes two random effects, one for suite and a second for patient nested within suite; the random effects are assumed to be independent, and each effect has a mean-zero Gaussian distribution with variance and , respectively. Our model has three fixed effects: an intercept term representing the background BP control in the target population, separate indicators for time points, and a common treatment effect over time.\n\nOur model is an extension of the basic SWCRT model by Hussey and Hughes (2007) because our approach models patient-level heterogeneity within the suite. We propose to use Satterthwaite's method to adjust for the denominator degrees of freedom for small numbers of clusters. All the calculations will be conducted in SAS (i.e., GLIMMIX, NLMIXED in SAS, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For secondary analyses, the same mixed model regression framework described above can be generalized to allow for additional covariate adjustments without difficulty."

First, Kaiser Permanente improved control rates from 44 to 90% over 13 years or an average 3.5 mm Hg/year improvement.  37 Similar HTN control improvements, (i.e., 6%) have been obtained in safety net practice through adaptations of the Kaiser team-based approach.  38, 39 . Thus, we believe a 6% overall improvement in practice-wide wide HTN control is achievable and clinically meaningful.\n\nThere are eight practices and approximately 720 patients nested within the practice for a total of 5800 patients. We used the above model to compute statistical power via a Monte Carlo simulation study. To match the actual study setting as closely as possible, we let each practice have 10 providers a piece for a total of 80 providers (in fact, there are 83 providers). We assumed that each provider sees 72 ps for a total of roughly 5800 participants (including those who join after the inception cohort). The variance components and for the suite and patient-withinsuite random effects, respectively, are unknown for this population and so we used reasonable values from some of our of prior studies. For each scenario, we estimated the intra-class correlation coefficient using an ANOVA method with large sample approximation via \"ICCbin\" package in R.  40  We estimated parameters in the generalized linear mixed model using the 'lme4' package in the R statistical software. If we set the standard deviations = = 4, (ICC\u22480.14), then we estimated the statistical power to be 95% for a two-sided test of the treatment effect at the nominal 5% level. If we increased the patient-within-suite standard deviation to = 8 but retained the inter-suite standard deviation at = 4 (ICC\u22480.16), then the statistical power reduces to 87% for two-sided tests at the 5% level. When we reduced the inter-suite standard deviation to \u2264 2 and = 8 (ICC<0.02), the statistical power to reject the null hypothesis was 95% using two-sided test at the nominal 5% level.. This power will allow us to explore interactions between HTN control and patient demographic factors, i.e., age (<65 vs >65), sex (M vs F), race (Black vs White), ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic), and insurance (Self-pay vs any and Medicaid vs Commercial). We will use a similar approach to examining the second primary outcome, i.e., improvement in patients transmitting HBPM readings."

We assume that HBPM intervention significantly affects both the outcome (via (a)) and the potential mediator (via (b)).\n\nThe Baron-Kenny method is to infer complete mediation if the statistical significance of the HBPM intervention disappears in the adjusted model (c) after having adjusted for the potential mediator; one infers partial mediation if the statistical significance is weakened but does not completely disappear. If there is a statistically significant effect of the intervention on the mediators, we will then assess whether changes in these mediators (e.g., targets, intensification), are associated with changes in improved."

Marginal revenue will be based on billing using RPM and CCM CPT codes for a diagnosis of hypertension, e.g., ICD-10 110.x, in addition to CPT codes for visits for the cohort. We will capture all types of visits including traditional office visits, telehealth visits, and patient group visits. Office visits will be identified based on CPT codes, e.g., 99213, 99214, etc. Telehealth visits involve the use of modifiers, e.g., 95 for video and 93 for phone visits. Group patient visits will be identified based on standardized smart phrases. Thus, CPT codes and billing data will allow us to calculate corresponding marginal changes in revenue for the cohort.\n\nThe main health-system costs are personnel-related. First are recruitment, enrollment, and training costs. We will measure these costs by recording the hypertension coordinator's time. We will also measure time spent in current team meetings where HTN/HBM is discussed. We will flag these HTN-related meetings (and training), and capture attendance, duration, and frequency of meeting/training based on clinician and staff type. Physician and pharmacist time for HTN (which can be converted into costs based on the type of professional) will be estimated using EPIC time audits. All healthcare-staff-related time spent on the study including enrollment, meetings, and patient care will be converted to costs by multiplying the time by the category of personnel attending based on salary/benefits ($/hour). Prices for Twistle and Xealth infrastructure and other health-system costs will be included.\n\nThe first patient-cost item will be blood pressure cuffs. Some of these cuffs were donated, and some will be provided by patients' insurance companies, but any co-pays or other patient costs for cuffs will be measured.\n\nPatient costs include BP measurement (times/day x number of days per month x months). We will adopt a similar approach for assessing patient time to that taken for assessing clinician time.\n\nSpecifically, we will record patient time spent in enrollment/training. We will measure travel costs by calculating the distance from the patient's home to the clinic.\n\nWe will measure the marginal change in clinic visits related to HBPM, regardless of type. Thus, we will record all clinic visits and associated diagnosis and CPT codes and compare clinic visits to historical averages (or time of the study) to determine the marginal cost, which could be positive or negative.\n\nAdditional medication costs can be estimated based on mean changes in the number of antihypertensive medications with estimates of both the medication costs, both average wholesale price (payer perspective), and out-of-pocket costs (patient perspective). Finally, we will conduct sensitivity analyses that consider costs based on hypertension-related emergency department visits."

      "text": "TB-HBPM is an evidence-based intervention, but there is limited scientific knowledge regarding optimal strategies for implementing it equitably in primary care. This project adopts the CCM model as a framework for implementation. Demonstration of effectiveness and understanding of implementation challenges could help reverse declines in blood pressure control and stagnating age-adjusted mortality from CVD. We adopted a highly collaborative process for implementation involving weekly meetings with the research team, clinical team, and ultimately institutional representatives for digital health. This process enabled us to adapt processes to stakeholder input during the critical planning period.\n\nWe made several adaptations. We shifted from reliance on blue tooth with potential to exclude older less technological adults to comparatively easy-to-use, text messaging. These adaptations highlight the challenges of balancing feasibility, costs, equitable access, and institutional requirements resulting from its support for clinical pathways involving texting. Findings from this project will contribute to the science of implementation of HBPM, and health equity, and inform future research.\n\nAcknowledgment: Special thanks to Joann Leslie for assistance with communications and editorial assistance in preparing and processing this manuscript. Table 1. Determinants, Chronic Care Model Components, Operationalization, and Implementation Strategies Determinants CCM Components Operationalization Implementation Strategies Integration with the proposed clinical texting system Health Care System Transmission of BP data to the team Partner with the onsite pharmacy for ordering BP devices Train patients, clinicians, and staff in the use of the texting system Establish workflows for patients to leave the visit with a BP cuff in hand based on an agreement with the onsite pharmacy Lifestyle education Community Non-pharmacological Management of HTN Partner with organizations that provide HTN lifestyle education to patients Absence of a user-friendly BP device that can transmit data HBPM using a validated device Omron 5 (Model BP 7250) Adopt a system for patient entry of BP value using texting 20 Lack of teams focused on improving HTN Delivery system design Team-based management of BP Train teams in how to remotely monitor BP, bill, use decision support and collectively adapt based on feedback Incorporate clinical pharmacists into the team for expert management Absence of detailed knowledge of ACC/AHA guidelines Clinical Information Systems Clinician training Content experts and clinician leaders will provide training Absence of information systems for population management of HTN Digital Health portal in the EPIC EHR Clinicians can view graphs of each patient's BP along with the mean BP for past two weeks. Absence of feedback on performance Feedback reports to Teams The research team will generate monthly reports to teams on patients' BP control and enrollment in texting Patients with uncontrolled BP without recent visits are not contacted Outreach reports to teams Clerical staff will call patients based on lists of patients with uncontrolled BP and no reading in the past 60 days Absence of CDS to reinforce best HTN and CVD Mgt including BP targets Clinical Decision Support Prompts for BP targets, ASCVD, statins, counseling to quit smoking Development of EPIC hypertension templates and smart phrases to support clinicians and team members Patients lack knowledge and skills for HBPM Patient Self-Management Support Patient training in HBPM Patient training in texting BP readings* Text messages about BP goals Text messages about lifestyle and medications Patients enter their BP readings into a secure, bidirectional texting system called Twistle\u00ae. These values are converted into 2week graphs, means, and low and high readings, are integrated into the her via a portal Training for clinicians and staff Processes for referral to lifestyle programs e.g., Healthy Living Program or YMCA Processes for referral to community programs to address social determinants of health Brief in-person training followed by text-based training in taking BP correctly Table 2. Hypothesized assumptions about how TB-HBPM might work 1. Patient engagement in Twistle-based HBPM will trigger patients' decisions regarding their adherence to medication and healthy lifestyles 2. HBPM reading sent to clinicians will trigger clinicians' recommendations for medication intensification.\n\n3. Smart phrases will trigger clinicians' decisions about lower blood pressure targets 4. Monthly (audit and feedback) reports will promote team motivation and team problemsolving to improve TB-HBPM in the presence of psychological safety"
