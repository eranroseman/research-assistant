      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The classic multi-armed bandit problem (see, e.g.,  [1] ) is perhaps the simplest model of a sequential decision making problem where one wishes to maximize the cumulative sum of rewards received over some time horizon. Faced with a finite number of alternatives, called actions or arms, the decision maker must choose between them at every time point. One has to balance the exploration of actions that have hitherto yielded low rewards, with exploitation of current knowledge about actions have yielded high rewards so far.\n\nWoodroofe  [2]  noted that, in most sequential decision making scenarios, there is likely to be some additional information available that can be useful for decision making. For example, in a clinical trial with two drugs, we might have people's genetic or demographic information available as features. If so, then rather than thinking about a two-armed bandit problem, one should think about the clinical trial as a contextual bandit problem where we want to learn how to map user features into one of the available actions, i.e., one of the two drugs in this case. Woodroofe defined this problem, albeit in the case of just one feature, but he did not call it a \"contextual bandit\" problem. Instead he called it a \"bandit problem with a concomitant variable\".\n\nAs it sometimes the case with broadly useful problems, contextual bandit problems have been considered by many different communities by many different names. They have been called \"bandit problems with side observations\"  [3, 4] , \"bandit problems with side information\"  [5] , \"associative reinforcement learning\"  [6] [7] [8] , \"reinforcement learning with immediate reward\"  [9] , \"associative bandit problems\"  [10] , and \"bandit problems with covariates\"  [11] [12] [13] [14] . The term \"contextual bandits\" was coined by Langford and Zhang  [15]  and we stick to it because it is descriptive yet short.\n\nRecent interest in contextual bandits has been driven to a large extent by personalization problems arising on the web. How to use user and webpage features to select the best ad to show to the user on a given webpage  [16] ? How to show personalized news articles to web users based on their interests  [17] ? With the emergence of mobile health, we expect that many ideas developed to show personalized ads to users on the web will be found useful in personalizing mobile health interventions to a specific person in a particular context.\n\nThe framework of Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions  [18]  has recently been put forward to unify a number of decision making problems that arise in mobile health across a variety of behavior change domains including alcohol abuse, depression, obesity, and substance abuse. There are five keys components of JITAIs: decision points, decision rules, tailoring variables, intervention options, and proximal outcomes. Contextual bandit algorithms can be used for personalizing JITAIs. The tailoring variables, such as GPS location, calendar busyness, and heartrate, form the context. The intervention options are the actions. For simplicity, we assume throughout this chapter, that there are only two intervention options: whether to intervene or not. For example, in a physical activity JITAI, the two intervention options might be whether or not to send an activity encouraging message. Once an intervention option is chosen, a proximal outcome (i.e., reward) is obtained. Again, to use the example of the physical activity JITAI, our proximal outcome might be the number of steps the person walked in the 1 h following the decision point. In JITAIs, the fundamental pattern that repeats over time is the following. mobile phone records the proximal outcome (interpreted as a reward, so higher is better) 5: done\n\nIn the rest of this chapter, we will see how the contextual bandit problem is a good way to think about the problem of personalizing JITAIs in a mobile health setting. We will look at online learning algorithms that learn good decision rules (policies) over time by interacting with the environment using a protocol very similar to the fundamental temporally-repeating pattern described above. We will first survey existing contextual bandit frameworks and algorithms to give the reader a sense of the breadth of work that has occurred in this area across several different fields including computer science, electrical engineering, operations research, and statistics. Then we will highlight the unique challenges that arise in mobile health and discuss how existing contextual bandit algorithms will need to be modified before they can be used successfully in mobile health."

      "title": "Online Learning in Contextual Bandits",
      "text": "In this section we will review the online learning literature on contextual bandit problems. The focus will be on algorithms that minimize their regret. Regret measures the difference between the reward that could have been accumulated with prior knowledge of the problem, and the reward accumulated by the learning algorithm. The precise definition depends on the setting in which one is analyzing the learning algorithm. We will consider three settings that make increasingly weaker assumptions about the data generating process. In the first setting, contexts and rewards are all stochastically generated from an iid process. In the second setting, contexts are arbitrary but rewards are stochastic. Finally, in the third setting, contexts and rewards are all arbitrary."

The following online learning protocol is followed.\n\n1: for t D 1 to T do 2: receive context X t 3: algorithm takes action A t 4: receive reward R t D R A t t 5: end for\n\nThe contexts X t are drawn from some context space X . Unless otherwise specified, we will assume that the context X t 2 R p is a vector with p components so that X \u00c2 R p . The literature has considered situations both less general (e.g., finite context space  [19] ) and more general (e.g., contexts in a general metric space  [20] ). The actions A t lie an action space A which we will assume, unless indicated otherwise, to be f0; 1g with 1 corresponding to the option of providing an intervention and 0 to not providing.\n\nA policy or decision rule W X ! A decides which action gets taken in which contexts. The value of a policy is defined as the expected reward obtained when actions are chosen according to :\n\nThe value of a policy, in turn, depends on the expected reward functions \u00c1 a ; a 2 A , defined as:\n\nNote that the value of a policy and the expected reward functions are related to each other as follows:\n\nHere D X is the marginal distribution of contexts.

If any of the maps L t are stochastic, i.e., the algorithm uses some internal randomization, then we call it a randomized online learning algorithm. Otherwise, we call it a deterministic online learning algorithm.\n\nWe will look at several different notions of regret. All of them will be of the form:\n\n\"best expected cumulative reward in a comparison class\"\n\nwhere the first term, referred to as the \"benchmark\" or \"comparator\" term measures the total expected reward that would have been obtained with advanced knowledge of the distributions (in the stochastic case) or nature's moves (in the adversarial case). The second term is the expected reward accumulated by the online learning algorithm. Note that this expectation is taken with respect to any randomness in nature's generation of contexts and rewards, as well as any randomness used by the algorithm (if it is a randomized online learning algorithm). Contextual bandit problems can be approached through several perspectives. We can adopt a regression perspective and view the problem as one of estimating the expected reward functions \u00c1 a .x/. Given estimates b \u00c1 a , we can choose the corresponding \"greedy\" policy GREEDY.b \u00c1 a / defined as GREEDY.b \u00c1 a /.x/ D argmax a2A b \u00c1 a .x/:\n\nNote that the optimal policy defined in (1) is nothing but GREEDY.\u00c1 a /.\n\nIn the case of two actions, one can also adopt a binary classification perspective and fix a set \u02d8of policies that can also be thought of as a set of classifiers. The best policy in this class is In the rest of this section, we first review approaches, both parametric and nonparametric, based on the regression perspective. Then we will consider classification based approaches that search for good policies in a restricted class."

The expected regret of a learning algorithm is defined as\n\nA simple approach for online learning in this setting is to adopt what has been called a \"certainty equivalence with forcing\" strategy in the adaptive control literature  [21] .\n\nThe idea is to choose a predetermined sequence of time points when the learning algorithm simply explores different actions. On rounds other than the exploration rounds, the algorithm \"exploits\" the current knowledge. \"Greedy\" or \"certainty equivalent\" exploitation means that the algorithm believes its current estimates of the expected reward function and takes the optimal action according to those estimates.\n\nAlgorithm 1 Linear Response Bandit Algorithm  [22]  Inputs: n 0 (initial exploration length), T a (exploration times for action a), h (localization parameter to decide which estimates to use)\n\nt D 1 to 2n 0 do Take action A t D 0 or A t D 1 depending on whether t is odd or even end for for t D 2n 0 C 1 to T do if t 2 T a then =?

The first set of estimates, e \u02c7a, are computed from data obtained during forced exploration rounds and the second set of estimates, b \u02c7a, are computed from data obtained in all previous rounds. At an exploitation round, the algorithm checks to see if there is enough gap between the quality of the two actions according to e \u02c7a. If there is enough gap, then it selects an action using the policy GREEDY. e \u02c7a/, otherwise it uses the policy GREEDY. b \u02c7a/. Goldenshluger and Zeevi establish an O.p 3 log T/ regret bound for Algorithm 1 under several assumptions including the assumption that a t are normally distributed and that a \"margin\" condition holds. Goldenshluger and Zeevi had earlier brought the margin condition from the classification literature into the contextual bandit literature  [23] . The margin condition ensures that the contexts X t are distributed such that, with high probability, the treatment effect magnitude j.\u02c71 \u02c70/ > X t j is large enough. A margin assumption is problematic in a mobile health setting where treatment effects are often expected to be small.\n\nRecently, Bastani and Bayati  [24]  have extended Algorithm 1 to the high dimensional case where the vectors \u02c7a are sparse, i.e., the number k\u02c7ak 0 of nonzero elements in \u02c7a satisfies k\u02c7ak 0 D s p. They improve the O.p 3 log T/ regret rate to O.s 2 log 2 T C s 2 log T log p/ after making assumptions similar to those made by Goldenshluger and Zeevi.\n\nLinearity of the expected reward function is not the only case that been considered for modeling the expected reward. Agarwal et al.  [25]  consider a setting where the expected reward function is assumed to lie in a general class with finitely many members. However, extending their results to general, finite dimensional, expected reward function classes is an open problem."

Their expected regret guarantees are polynomial in T where the exponent depends on the dimension p of the contexts, the margin parameter \u02dband the smoothness parameter \u02c7. They also provide almost matching lower bounds. Note these polynomial in T regret rates are much worse than the logarithmic rates in T achievable in the parametric case under margin assumptions.\n\nPerchet and Rigollet  [26]  extend the work of Rigollet and Zeevi to the case when the number of arms might be (much) larger than 2. They also extend the range of the margin parameter where the bounds hold and eliminate logarithmic gaps between upper and lower bounds. However, their algorithm requires knowledge of the smoothness parameter \u02c7. In practice, the smoothness parameter is not known. Qian and Yang  [27]  show how to use \"Lepski-type\" procedures from the nonparametric function estimation literature to select the smoothness parameter \u02c7in a data-dependent way and still achieve (near) minimax regret bounds that would be obtained assuming that the smoothness is known in advance."

With two actions, it enjoys an expected regret bound of O.\n\np T log j\u02d8j/ in the fully adversarial setting where the context and reward triples are assumed to be completely arbitrary. If an algorithm enjoys an regret bound in the adversarial setting, it can be shown that it will also satisfy the same bound when the stochastic setting, i.e., when the contexts and rewards are generated by an iid process and regret is measured as in  (5)  above.\n\nIf the policy class is huge or infinite, then enumeration of all policies is infeasible and Exp4 cannot be applied. However, in the stochastic setting, one can use the \"certainty equivalence with forcing\" idea described in section \"Parametric Estimation of Expected Reward Functions\" above. Langford and Zhang's  [15]  Epoch-Greedy algorithm (Algorithm 3) does just that. On an exploration round, it takes one of the two actions at random with probability 1=2. After an exploration round, it builds an unbiased estimator of the value of any policy as:\n\nwhere D is the dataset consisting of context, action, reward triples from exploration rounds so far. Since each action is selected at random with probability 1=2 on exploration rounds, it is easy to see that E\n\n/ where the expectation is taken over the distribution of contexts and rewards as well as with respect to the algorithm's uniform randomization to select the actions on exploration rounds. The policy selected for the next exploitation phase is then simply\n\nThis is where the computational advantage of Epoch-Greedy comes in. It never accesses the policies in \u02d8except via the operation above. All we need is a computational blackbox or \"oracle\" that can answer the \"argmax\" queries above.\n\nLet us call such an oracle an AMO (for Arg Max Oracle). If a cost-sensitive classifier implementation exists for the class \u02d8then it can serve as an AMO. Therefore, can even be infinite as long as an efficient AMO is available for it. The regret bound of Epoch-Greedy, with a finite class \u02d8, is O.T 2=3 .log j\u02d8j/ 1=3 /. This is obtained by having O.T 2=3 .log j\u02d8j/ 1=3 / epochs till time T resulting in the same number of AMO calls since exactly one AMO call is made per epoch. Langford and Zhang note that \u02d8need not be finite and that a similar regret bound can be shown for an infinite class with finite VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension. Note that for such policy classes, the regret bound of any algorithm that depends on the cardinality of the policy class (such as the one for the Exp4 algorithm in section \"Competing Against a Fixed Class of Policies\" below) becomes vacuous.\n\nEpoch-Greedy's regret guarantee of O.T 2=3 .log j\u02d8j/ 1=3 / might appear to be much worse than logarithmic regret guarantees presented in section \"Parametric Estimation of Expected Reward Functions\" above. Recall that those guarantees were under additional assumptions such as margin conditions and the constants hidden in the O. / notation depend on distribution dependent parameters such as the margin parameter. Logarithmic regret guarantees for Epoch-Greedy are possible if one is willing to make additional assumptions and allow distribution dependent constants to appear in the regret guarantee. For instance, consider a finite policy class \u02d8such that there is a unique maximizer ? of the value V. / over in \u02d8. Let > 0 denote the gap between the value of ? and that of the second-best policy:\n\nLangford and Zhang show that Epoch-Greedy also enjoys a regret bound of O..log j\u02d8j C log T/= 2 /. Note that this bound is logarithmic in T but blows up as ! 0.\n\nDudik et al.  [28]  gave an algorithm called RandomizedUCB that achieves\n\nregret with probability at least 1 \u0131. Moreover, it requires only polynomially many calls to the AMO at every round. However, its practical utility is still limited as the polynomial involved is of moderately high degree (it invokes the AMO Q O.T 5 / times per round where Q O hides logarithmic factors). More recent work of Agarwal et al.  [29]  has managed to bring down the total number of AMO calls to just O.\n\np T= log.j\u02d8j=\u0131// over all T rounds, with probability at least 1 \u0131, while still preserving the regret bound of RandomizedUCB.\n\nThe bandit algorithms discussed above appear quite attractive for use in mobile health due to the fast rate at which the regret decreases to 0. That is, user aggravation and disruption due to inappropriately timed delivery of intervention options would be minimized due to the fast rate at which the algorithm learns the best action for a given context. This is a critical point due to the high levels of app abandonment present in mobile health  [30] . However these algorithms achieve these high learning rates under the assumption that the contexts and rewards are all generated from an iid process. Suppose the context includes the user's stress level; user stress at different time points are clearly not independent. That is, a user who was stressed during the morning is more likely to be stressed in the afternoon than a user who was not stressed during the morning. Also, stress at different time points are unlikely to be identically distributed. For example, the probability that a smoker is stressed on the day before she quits smoking is probably quite different from the probability that the same smoker is stressed on the day after she has quit smoking. However, it may be that the noise level in the dynamics of the context will be sufficiently high so that a model assuming iid contexts and rewards provides a good approximation. Indeed Lei  [31]  found that in simulated experiments mimicking mobile health studies, the regret of a bandit algorithm similar to those above is robust to dependence between contexts at different times."

However, its theoretical analysis is complicated by the fact that its estimates are not based on iid samples (recall the reward depends on the action and the action is selected using data on prior rewards and prior actions) and there are no known regret bounds. Chu et al.  [32]  provide an algorithm called SupLinUCB that calls BaseLinUCB as a subroutine and show that it enjoys a regret bound of O p Tp log 3 .T log T=\u0131/ \u00c1 with probability at least 1 \u0131. The idea of taking a basic procedure like BaseLinUCB, whose statistical analysis is simplified by assuming independence among the samples, and then using a master algorithm SupLinUCB to ensure the assumption holds, goes back to the work of Auer  [33] . His work also considered arbitrary context vectors with linear expected reward functions as in  (7)  and followed some early line of work in the computer science literature  [6] [7] [8] 34] . His basic and master algorithms were called LinRel and SupLinRel. SupLinRel was also shown to enjoy a regret bound of O.\n\np Tp log 3 .T log T=\u0131// with probability at least 1 \u0131. However, LinUCB has practical advantages over LinRel. It is easier to implement and numerically more stable as it relies on ridge regression as its computational core and not on full eigendecompositions like LinRel. We would like to also point out that LinUCB has been generalized from the standard linear setting as in  (7)  to the generalized linear setting  [35]  for use with non-continuous rewards such as binary rewards."

At every time step, it draws samples e \u02c7a from the posterior distribution for \u02c7a and chooses the action with the highest mean e \u02c7> a x t according to the drawn posterior samples. Once the action is taken and the corresponding reward observed, it updates the posterior distribution for the corresponding reward parameter.\n\nAgrawal and Goyal  [41]  analyze Algorithm 5 and prove a regret bound of O \u00c2 p q T 1C .log T log.1=\u0131// \u00c3 with probability 1 \u0131. Here 2 .0; 1/ is a tuning parameter. Thompson sampling had been applied to contextual bandits [42] before Agrawal and Goyal's work but finite time regret bounds were not available. Agrawal and Goyal's regret analysis holds under much weaker assumptions that made to derive the Thompson Sampling algorithm itself. First, the regret analysis itself Algorithm 5 Thompson Sampling Algorithm [15] Inputs: 2 (variance parameter used in the prior and in the reward linear model) A a D I p p ; b a D 0 p 1 for all a for t D 1 to T do Compute O \u02c7a D .A a / 1 b a for all a Sample e \u02c7a from NORMAL.

It holds for every \u02c7a choice as long as it is bounded. Second, it does not assume that the rewards are actually drawn from a normal distribution. It does require the linearity assumption in  (7)  to hold but the rewards are only assumed to be sub-gaussian.\n\nAs discussed above, this section does not require that the contexts are iid. Thus the bandit algorithms considered here can accommodate settings in which the contexts can have arbitrary relationships one with another. Despite this, as discussed above, for some algorithms one can guarantee how fast the algorithm learns with time. This may be useful in mobile health particularly in areas of science where the dynamic evolution of the contexts over time are not yet well understood, for example when the context includes craving for substances or alternately physiological and perceived stress. However, this setting continues to be potentially problematic in that how users respond to interventions (e.g., reward distribution given context) can change with time. For example, the relationship between self-efficacy and relapse to smoking appears to change as time increases from the quit date  [43] ; this is likely to mean that the distribution of the reward as a function of an intervention option and a context involving self-efficacy is likely to change with time as well."

Second, the online learning algorithm may be a randomized one and could be using additional randomization to select its actions A t . The expectation above is with respect both possible sources of randomness.\n\nWe know of only one paper that gives bandit algorithms in this setting. Slivkins  [20]  considers this setting in Section 7 of his paper. In this chapter, we have mostly focused on the case of two actions, i.e., A D f0; 1g and our context space X has often been a subset of R p . He considers a much more general case when A ; X are metric spaces. In our specific setting, his assumptions on the expected reward functions is that they are Lipschitz with respect to some norm k k defined on R p : 8t; x; x 0 ; a; a 0 ; j\u00c1 a t .x/ \u00c1 a t .x 0 /j \u00c4 kx x 0 k:\n\nHis algorithm achieves a regret bound of O.T 1 1=.2Cd X / .log T// where d X is the covering dimension of the context space X under the metric kx x 0 k.

A special case of the above setup when there is only one unchanging context, x t D x, reduces to the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem with K arms (we have focused on the K D 2 case in this chapter). This problem was first considered by Auer et al.  [44] . Their Exp3 algorithm obtains an expected regret bound of O.\n\np KT log K/ which can be improved to O. p KT/ using a different algorithm  [45, 46] . They also present a variant Exp3.P that enjoys a bound on the regret not just in expectation but with high probability. More interesting in the contextual bandit setting is their Exp4 algorithm. Exp4 applies in the case when there are a finite number of \"experts\" each suggesting an action to take at a given round. We can identify their experts with policies in the set \u02d8if the set is finite. We present the Exp4 algorithm as Algorithm 6. They prove an expected regret bound of O.\n\np KT log.j\u02d8j// for Exp4 which reduces to O. p T log j\u02d8j/ when K D 2. Even though the regret bound can tolerate very large policy classes, the implementation of the algorithm itself is practical only for very small policy classes since Exp4 maintains a weight for each policy in the class.\n\nHigh probability guarantees matching those of Exp4 have been obtained by Beygelzimer et al.  [47]  using their Exp4.P algorithm. Note that the same paper also presents an algorithm VE for the stochastic setting when the context and reward tuples are drawn iid from a fixed distribution. Even if \u02d8is an infinite class but the VC dimension of \u02d8is d < 1, VE enjoys a regret bound of O. p dT log.T=.d\u0131/// with probability at least 1 \u0131.\n\nAt least conceptually, the Exp family algorithms provided in this section appear rather promising because they require the least restrictive assumptions on the rewards in order to learn.

      "title": "Finding a Good Initial Policy",
      "text": "Good initialization of the learning process is very important. If the algorithm chooses very bad actions in the beginning, it can have a negative impact on health outcomes and user engagement. One possibility is to consult domain experts and use an expert derived policy at the start. However, it might turn out to be difficult to turn intuitive judgements of domain experts into a precisely stated policy. Moreover, mobile health is a relatively new area and often domain experts lack sufficient knowledge of what works and what does not when interventions are delivered through mobile devices and wearables.\n\nWe think that it is much better to proceed in an evidence-based manner and initialize the policy using data previously gathered, say in a microrandomized trial  [48] . Data from a microrandomized trial can be used for a variety of purposes including estimation of the value of a policy in question. If candidate policies can be evaluated then a good one can be selected from a set of policies. Microrandomized trials offer very high-quality data. But even less high quality data can be useful. For example, if the policy that generated data in a mobile health study is exactly or partially known then one can still form reasonable estimates of the value of a given policy. The problem of using an existing batch of data gathered under one policy to reason about the value of another policy is called the problem of \"offline learning\" or \"offline evaluation\". There is work in both the computer science  [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] , as well as the statistics literature on this problem  [54] [55] [56] [57] ."

      "text": "Progress in mobile health will occur when human-computer interface researchers, machine learning researchers and statisticians work in close collaboration with domain scientists such as behavioral scientists. On the one hand, we need guidance from theories of behavior change to guide the development of mobile health interventions. On the other hand, the policy learned using online learning algorithms needs to be communicated back to behavioral scientists so that they can interpret it in light of their theories or use it to change and refine existing theories. This communication is facilitated by learning interpretable policies. Using policies represented by large decision trees, deep neural networks or kernel methods may not lend themselves easily to interpretation.\n\nLei  [31]  has explored the use of actor-critic methods from the reinforcement learning literature in setting of contextual bandits. The critic part is responsible for estimating the expected reward function and can use very flexible non-parametric and non-linear regression methods. The actor part is responsible for generating a policy using the estimates provided by the critic. Since only the policy needs to be communicated to the domain scientist, we just need to keep the actor architecture simple by choosing a low-dimensional interpretable policy parameterization."

      "title": "Assessing Usefulness of Contextual Variables",
      "text": "Contextual variables in mobile health are often costly to acquire. If they are passively sensed by the phone (e.g., GPS location) or a wearable (e.g., heartrate), acquiring them drains the battery. If they are actively acquired by asking the user a self-report question (e.g., about their mood), acquiring them incurs user burden. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that enable researchers to decide whether or not a contextual variable is useful for deciding which intervention to deliver. For example, suppose we use the following interpretable parameterization for a stochastic policy .x/ D exp.\u02c7>x/ 1 C exp.\u02c7>x/ :\n\nNote that maps the context to OE0; 1 instead of f0; 1g and should be interpreted as the probability to taking action 1. This is called the \"Gibbs\" or the \"expit\" parameterization. If we simply output an estimate b \u02c7at the end of the learning process, it is not very useful for assessing usefulness of variables. We need to provide confidence intervals for these estimates. Then, we can see whether a 95% confidence interval for, say, b \u02c71, contains zero or not. This will provide researchers with an evidence-based method to decide whether the first contextual variable in the context x is useful or not. We have not seen many tools to enable such reasoning in existing contextual bandit algorithms. An exception is the work of Lei  [31]  mentioned above that does construct confidence intervals for the policy parameters estimated using their actor-critic online learning algorithm."

If we perform computations on the phone we need to think about implementing the learning algorithms very efficiently in order to not put an undue burden on the phone's performance and battery life. If we perform computations on the cloud, we need to minimize data transfer between the phone and the cloud to save the phone's resources. We also need to take into account occasional failures, due to a bad network reception or drained battery. These failures can cause the learning algorithm to not be able to push fresh data to the cloud or pull the latest policy or action recommendation from the cloud. There is little work on designing and proving guarantees about contextual bandit algorithms that are resilient to such failures.\n\nAnother question that needs work is how to tradeoff the frequency of learning with the noise level in the data. All algorithms presented above make an update whenever an action is selected and a reward is observed. If the data is very noisy then we might have the learning algorithm update its policy at larger time intervals so as to acquire more information. What should be the time intervals at which our learning algorithm updates the policy? To answer this question, one will have to consider the computational complexity of the update as well the amount (governed perhaps by a step size parameter) by which a single update changes the policy."

      "title": "Robustness to Failure of Assumptions",
      "text": "Algorithms designed for the worst-case adversarial framework can perform suboptimally when data is actually generated stochastically. Algorithms that have guarantees under stochastic assumptions can behave badly when the specific stochastic assumptions underlying their analysis are not met. In mobile health, where the consequence of such non-robustness is worse health outcomes for people, we need to pay serious attention to such issues. Three assumptions that make repeated appearance in the theoretical analyses of contextual bandit algorithms are independence, stationarity, and absence of the impact of actions on the user's future contexts. Any candidate online learning algorithm needs to be tested for reasonable departures from these ideal assumptions in simulations before being deployed in a real study with users. Existing algorithms need to be analyzed under weaker assumptions, if possible. Otherwise, attempts should be made to quantify the degradation in performance in non-ideal settings. New algorithms that are more robust to failure of assumptions need to be designed and associated guarantees provided.\n\nSome contextual bandit algorithms enjoy regret guarantees only in expectation. But an algorithm whose regret is small in expectation, but has high variance, can have very serious consequences in mobile health. High variance in regret means that occasionally, the algorithm performs very poorly and its regret is much larger than the provided guarantee. The will translate into adverse health outcomes for some people in the cohort being studied. High probability guarantees on the regret are better than guarantees in expectation but they are simply the first step in the direction of designing learning algorithms that better manage the risk of hurting people's health outcomes. There is some work on risk-aversion in multi-armed bandit problems  [58, 59] . It is possible that some of the techniques developed there can be useful for contextual bandit learning algorithms too."

      "title": "Costly to Acquire or Missing Contexts and Rewards",
      "text": "As noted above, contextual variables can be costly to acquire in a mobile health setting. Even rewards can be costly to acquire especially if they cannot be passively sensed and we have to rely on user self-reports. If a variable is indeed useful for decision-making then choosing not to acquire it will lead to sub-optimal decisions. Similarly, we cannot simply decide to not acquire the reward variable because doing so will hamper the ability of the learning algorithm to learn from observed rewards. The key is to acquire costly variables judiciously. We can maintain predictions of such variables and acquire them only when uncertainty about them increases beyond a threshold. If the costs associated with acquisition can be quantified then it can be formally included in the definition of regret. Currently, we do not have much guidance on how to deal with costly to acquire contexts and rewards.\n\nAnother aspect not treated properly in the existing literature is missingness of contextual variables and rewards. Maintaining predictions of variables that can be potentially missing, of course, helps. However, missingness of self-reported data can also indicate one or more of the following: high user stress, high user busyness and low user engagement. Thus, missingness can itself be used as a contextual variable to use in decision-making. More research is needed to fully integrate support for missing data in existing contextual bandit algorithms."
