      "text": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in low-and-middleincome countries (LMICs) is rising, and the long-term complica-tions entail a substantial burden of disease and financial costs  [1] [2] [3]  . In Bangladesh, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing in both urban and rural areas, and the number of adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is estimated to double from 7.1 million in 2015 to 13.6 million in 2040  [ 4 , 5 ] . The majority of patients with type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh have uncontrolled diabetes with a high prevalence of risk factors that might contribute to early development of complications  [6]  .\n\nDiabetes imposes a severe impact on physical and mental health and quality of life in the Bangladeshi population  [7] [8] [9]  . A large case-control study in an urban area of Bangladesh comparing 591 type 2 diabetes adults with 591 age, sex and residence matched controls reported that patients with type 2 diabetes reported almost twice the rates of depression and that depression was significantly associated with diabetes independent of sociodemographic and comorbidity  [10]  . This case-control study showed that patients with type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh paid on average six times more for healthcare services than non-diabetics  [11]  . According to the Asian Development Bank, almost one-fourth (24.3%) of the Bangladeshi population live below the poverty line in 2019  [12]  . Hence, it is crucial to develop effective and cost-effective interventions in the management of diabetes.\n\nMobile phone use has increased globally, especially in LMICs. In Bangladesh, the number of mobile phone subscribers increased from 86.5 million in 2012 to 163.4 million in 2019 and reached all segments of the population  [ 13 , 14 ] . Evidence suggests that mobile phone health (mHealth) interventions might be an effective, relatively low-cost approach in the treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart diseases, depression, smoking, hypertension among others  [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24]  . Previously, we demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial that a text messaging intervention was effective at substantially reducing glycemia in type 2 diabetes patients in Bangladesh  [25]  . Given the limited financial resources available and the rapid rise in the number of mobile phones, mHealth is a promising tool to alleviate the burden of diabetes and financial costs for patients, the health system, and society  [26]  . Mobile phone text messaging programs have been shown to be cost effective in smoking cessation  [ 27 , 28 ] {Patel, 2017 #164}  [61]  . A recent telehealth program in the UK for patients with depression showed an incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gain of 0.001 (95% CI -0.023 to 0.026) with net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a320 0 0 0 at 12 months  [29]  . A pilot telehealth program in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reported average saving of \u00a31023 ($1280) per patient per year  [30]  . Another telehealth program for patients with increased cardiovascular disease risk showed an incremental QALY gain of 0.012 (95% CI -0.001 to 0.026) with net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a320 0 0 0 per QALY (95% CI -58 to 291)  [31]  . The TEXT ME study showed that for a target population of 50 0 0 0 patients with coronary heart disease, the intervention is expected to lead to 563 fewer myocardial infarctions, 361 fewer strokes and 1143 additional QALYs with an overall saving of $10.56 million for the health system over the patients' lifetimes  [32]  . The few mHealth cost-effectiveness studies in people with diabetes are from high-income countries, and evidence from LMICs is scarce  [ 26 , 33 ] . In this study, we aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a text messaging intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh."

      "text": "This was a 6-month, prospective, parallel-group, individual, randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging in addition to standard care compared with standard care alone for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study protocol has been published  [14]  . In short, participants were adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the last 5 years attending the outpatient department of the Bangladesh Institute of Health Science (BIHS) hospital between September 2013 and August 2014, on oral medication with access to mobile phones, and able to read text messages. The diabetes status of participants was confirmed by a BIHS attending physician as per World Health Organization guidelines  [14]  . All patients provided written informed consent at enrollment. The study protocol (PR#13,068) was approved by the Research Review Committee and Ethical Review Committee of the International Center for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) and received an Ethical Commit-tee waiver from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (LMU) and BIHS. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki 2008. This trial was registered with the German Clinical Trial Registry (drks.de), DRKS0 0 0 05188."

Some 105 text messages were sent to 50 random individuals with diabetes in the pre-test stage using snowball sampling. Feedback from the participants led to adaptation of the contents of text messages, and 90 messages were finally selected. The text messages were developed based on the principles of Behavioral Learning Theory and the Transtheoretical Model of behavioral change  [ 37 , 38 ] . Participants in the intervention group received the 90 text messages randomly, once a day over a 6-month period, i.e., each patient received a text message twice over the follow-up period.\n\nExamples of text messages: 'A healthy diet will keep you healthy and happy'; 'If you are stressed, stop your work. Go for a walk and relax!'; 'Taking medication timely will help to keep your blood sugar in control and avoid complications'. A text messages delivery website was created, and messages were delivered with technical support from a commercial telecom operator Grameenphone Bangladesh."

      "text": "The reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as well as improvements in quality-adjusted life over the 6-month follow-up period were chosen as measures of effect. This choice was informed by previous economic evaluations of mHealth or eHealth interventions on glycemic control reporting percentage reductions in HbA1c and QALYs as effect measures  [41] [42] [43]  .\n\nHbA1c reduction: The effect of the intervention on the primary endpoint (HbA1c) was reported previously  [25]  . We revisited this analysis using a multivariate linear regression model, adjusted for age, sex, and baseline values, following intention to treat principles to quantify HbA1c as an effect measure. In order to approximate the potential long-term effects of the observed HbA1c change, we used the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine to calculate and compare the absolute 10-year risk of fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in the routine care and intervention group (UKPDS Risk Engine, Oxford University Innovation Ltd, 2001). The risk engine is based on a series of risk factors and demographic information. We ran the model developed for Asians, with mean characteristics of the entire study population once with the adjusted HbA1c mean of the intervention group and once with the HbA1c mean of the control group.\n\nQuality-adjusted life years (QALYs): Health-related quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L)  [44]  . The EQ-5D-3L is a multi-attribute descriptive system comprising five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each of which has three response levels (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems). The 243 resulting health states can be converted into a single preference score, the EQ-5D index score, based on time trade-off valuations derived from valuations of the general population. As a value tariff based on the preferences of the Bangladeshi population is lacking, preference scores were calculated using the value tariff for the UK  [45]  .\n\nAccumulated QALYs, a commonly used measure in economic evaluations that combines the quality of life and length of life  [46]  , were derived over the 6-month intervention period for both groups by estimating the area under the utility curve assuming a constant change from baseline to follow-up."

      "title": "Incremental costs",
      "text": "Incremental costs for interventions were categorized into program costs and intervention costs  [40]  . Program costs include expenses for developing study content, study start-up and support for ongoing implementation, whereas intervention costs refer to recurrent costs resulting from the delivery of the intervention content and incremental healthcare costs resulting from differences in the utilization of health care resources. As expenses for developing the intervention are marginal as soon as it is launched to a larger population, these were not considered in our calculation. Patient costs for maintaining the intervention were derived from internal accounting and included unit salary costs multiplied by intervention-allocated time of the research staff involved. Patient costs for the SMS service were derived from invoices from the mobile operator. Information on healthcare utilization was unavailable at follow-up, so these costs were not incorporated in our evaluation.\n\nEstimated total incremental costs for the intervention were divided by the number of participants randomized to the intervention group to obtain incremental per capita costs. Discounting rates were not applied. All costs incurred in Bangladesh Taka (BDT) were converted to US dollars (US$), using the conversion rate of December 31, 2013 (study period) in a first step  [47]  . Then, US$ were converted to international dollars (Intl.$) adjusting for the estimated purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor specific for Bangladesh  [48]  ."

The sex-and age-adjusted difference in HbA1c between the intervention and the control group averaged -0.64% (95% CI: -0.95; -0.33). Using the UKPDS risk engine it was estimated that an HbA1c reduction of 0.64% in this sample would approximately yield an absolute 10-year CHD and stroke risk reduction of 0.5% and 0.0% respectively.\n\nThe adjusted difference in the EQ-5D index at follow-up was 0.04 units (95% CI: 0.00; 0.08), translating to a difference of 0.010 (95% CI: 0.0 0 0; 0.021) QALYs, i.e., about 3.65 quality-adjusted days   (not statistically significant) over the 6-month period.

The same effect on ICER would be observed if the effect on incremental accumulated QALYs was double (18 Int.$/1% HbA1c reduction and 1203 Int$/QALY gained) or half as big (76 Int.$/1% HbA1c reduction and 4812 Int$/QALY gained) as observed in the trial.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This randomized trial one of the first to present evidence on the cost-effectiveness of a text messaging intervention for type 2 diabetes in a LMIC. Results showed the intervention was an effective and potentially cost-effective strategy, highlighting the attractiveness of mHealth solutions for diabetes control. Our results are similar to a study by Ramachandran and colleagues in southeast India reporting significant reductions in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in urban working men with impaired glucose tolerance who received text messages {Ramachandran, 2013 #421}  [62]  . The findings of our study differed to a recent study by Fottrell and colleagues  [49]  , who showed no significant effect text messages on diabetes status. The differences in population demographics, randomization, and text messages contents, duration are different in these studies. The study showed a positive effect (albeit not statistically significant) on health-related quality of life and resulting accumulated QALYs over the observation period. The calculation of the incremental costs showed that the text messaging intervention can be delivered at costs of 24 Int.$ per patient, resulting in ICERs of 38 Intl.$ per 1% reduction in HbA1c and 2406 Intl.$ per QALY gained. With this, the intervention is likely more cost-effective than similar mobile phone interventions in the US, where studies have reported 491$  [41]  and 29,869$  [42]  per 1% unit reduction in HbA1c, or 65,167$ per QALY gain  [43]  . Compared with similar mHealth interventions for diabetes patients carried out in different settings, the intervention was comparable but less resource-intensive  [18]  and more effective  [50]  . However, as intervention times, evaluation methods and settings, and the underlying population differ markedly between these studies, direct comparison is difficult. Moreover, this evaluation is limited to the 6 months trial horizon and a sustained improvement of HbA1c is expected to lead to additional positive long-term health outcomes and cost savings. According to the updated UKPDS risk equations (UKPDS 82) a decrease in HbA1c by 1.5% would lead to a gain in life expectancy of 0.15 years in the UKPDS trial cohort  [51]  . Noteworthy, this estimate neither fully captures the potential improvements in quality of life that occur from the prevention of non-fatal microand macro-vascular events nor the potential savings in health care spending associated with the prevention of those events. However, the applicability of those equations to a Bangladeshi patient co-hort is uncertain and the expected gain in (quality-adjusted) life expectancy in our sample therefore unknown. Therefore, long-term studies and evaluations are needed to improve the evidence base about the potential cost-effectiveness of such kind of interventions.\n\nNo formal willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold exists for Bangladesh. However, according to guidelines from the WHO, one to three times a country's per capita gross domestic product could be used to represent the threshold for a highly costeffective intervention for averting a disability-adjusted life year (DALY)  [40]  . Analysis of WTP for an additional QALY in industrialized countries showed that WTP thresholds averaged around twice the per capita gross national income. Applying this concept to Bangladesh yields a WTP threshold of 7120 Intl.$ (year 2015) per QALY and indicates that the intervention is potentially highly cost-effective.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the text messaging intervention, there is considerable potential for upscaling and reaching a broader population of patients  [52]  . Moreover, a previous study demonstrated that participants with type 2 diabetes attending a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh were willing to pay a modest fee for receiving diabetes related SMS, which might help to develop a sustainable model for future clinical implications  [53]  . The intervention meets the major requirement of being technically simple; however, barriers such as the lack of experienced professionals for scaling the intervention and the often ineffective transmission of scientific evidence into a real world setting need to be overcome  [54]  . Performing a basic budget impact analysis assuming linear scaling effects and costs and assuming that all people with type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh (7.1 million) receive the intervention yields costs of around 340 million Intl.$ and additional 14,200 QALYs annually.\n\nThis study has two major limitations. The first is that we had no information on the use of healthcare resources over the follow-up period. One would assume that participants receiving reminders to take their medication and to visit their physician regularly would do so, resulting in an increase in healthcare utilization and costs. However, the severity of these limitations is hard to quantify. Second, indirect costs related to hospitalization, healthcare facility use, household level costs and costs for medication, transport and blood tests were planned but were not available. Another major limitation is the short follow-up duration of the study and lack of data on those lost to follow up. It is questionable whether text messaging could alter habits such as inadequate medication adherence or health behavior within several months and show significant improvement in complex constructs such as quality of life. Evidence about the long-term impact of mHealth interventions on quality of life, self-management, and health behavior is lacking  [ 33 , 55 ] . This also has major implications for the potential cost-effectiveness. If the effects of an ongoing intervention are expected to dilute after a couple of months, the intervention will be less cost-effective in the long term. In contrast, if the effects of an ongoing intervention are constant over time, then the intervention will be more cost-effective than suggested by the within-trial analyses, as upfront costs for design will be attributable over a longer time horizon.\n\nAnother limitation is that the power of our study was sufficient to show significant changes in the primary outcome (HbA1c) but may be insufficient for secondary outcomes and quality of life. Furthermore, as no EQ-5D value set is available for Bangladesh, QALY calculation was based on the preferences of the UK population and not on the preferences of the Bangladeshi population. Finally, the rather pragmatic extrapolation of the impact of the improvement in glycemic control on the 10-year CHD and stroke risk also has its limitations. First, the UKPDS engine is outdated, and the Asian Indians included in the UKPDS lived in the UK. Second, it is known that HbA1c has a larger effect on microvascular than on macrovascular complications, and therefore does underestimate the potential benefits to a patient's health. As participation in the trial required living in a metropolitan city, ability to read mobile phone text messaging and taking oral medication, findings may not be generalised to Bangladeshi population and should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThe findings of this study have implications for health policy and future research in Bangladesh. It is possible that large-scale implementation of the text messaging program would mean lower costs per patient improving communication, health behavior and access to equitable care  [56]  and could be scaled us by the Government health programs  [57]  . Evidence suggests that text messaging programs might are largely beneficial clinically and for the healthcare systems  [58]  {Zurovac, 2012 #336}  [63]  . Furthermore, a small change in HbA1c at an individual level might be a potential cost savings for the healthcare systems at a population level  [59]  . A text messaging program would be more beneficial in lowresources settings including rural and remote areas where there is lack of trained healthcare professionals to improve diabetes knowledge and proving lifestyle advice for diabetes and other chronic diseases  [60]  . Text messages were sent at random and future research whether select messages tailored to participants particular stage of change and personalization would have a more substantial impact is warranted. In addition, future trials should consider the collection of detailed costing information including costs for text messaging platform, message delivery, human resources and training costs, maintenance and equipment costs.\n\nIn conclusion, a text messaging intervention in type 2 diabetes patients with oral medication in low-resource settings was costeffective in the short term. The findings of this study may have implications for large-scale public health initiatives for diabetes care in other LMICs and similar settings. Longer study followups including a detailed assessment of patient healthcare utilization are needed to further strengthen the evidence on the costeffectiveness of mHealth interventions for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
