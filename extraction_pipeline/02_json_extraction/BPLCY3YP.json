  "title": "Pharmacist-Led Digital Health Interventions for Patients with Diabetes: A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Digital health interventions have emerged as a promising approach for patient care. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of pharmacist-led digital health interventions for patients with diabetes. The PubMed database was used to select randomized controlled trials that assess the effectiveness of digital health interventions on clinical outcomes among patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes from January 2005 to May 2024. We included randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies on type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, analyzing the effects of all digital health interventions by pharmacists, including telephone-based intervention, web-based intervention, and mobile health application, as compared to usual care. The outcomes were a reduction in HbA1c, changes in medication adherence, and reduction of adverse effects. We used the PRISMA reporting standard to implement and report the results. A total of 19 studies were included. Among these, the included digital health interventions were telephone monitoring (n = 15), webbased intervention (n = 2), mobile health application (n = 1), and text-message reminder (n = 1). The findings showed variability: around half of the studies (n = 10, 52.63%) indicated that patients receiving digital health interventions had reduced HbA1c levels compared to those receiving usual care, while five studies (26.31%) found no difference between the intervention and usual care. Five studies (26.31%) showed that such interventions increased medication adherence, while two studies (10.53%) found no difference when compared to standard care. Effectiveness of the intervention is related to several factors, including practicability and patient engagement, frequency of the intervention, and the provision of personalized communication. Tailoring interventions to individual patient profiles and providing adequate support for enhancing practicability of these tools may improve their effectiveness. Further research assessing the cost-effectiveness of such intervention is necessary to inform healthcare policy.",

      "text": "Diabetes is a progressive and chronic metabolic disease, characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, which over time can result in organ damage and increase the risk of other metabolic conditions such as renal impairment, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.  1 Diabetes affects about 422 million people worldwide and is the cause of 1.5 million deaths each year, of which the majority are living in low-and middle-income countries.  2 Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of diabetes treatment, involving antidiabetic agents such as insulin, sulfonylureas, and biguanides.  2  Various factors may influence treatment outcomes among patients with diabetes, such as medication adherence, the presence of medicationrelated problems, and dietary compliance, which underscore the importance of personalized care and monitoring. Previous study conducted regarding medication adherence of diabetic patients showed that about 50% of patients were non-adherent towards their prescribed antidiabetic medication.  3 harmacists play an important role in diabetes management, particularly through direct patient monitoring. Unlike other healthcare professionals, pharmacists have the advantage of more frequent patient interactions, as they do not require prior authorization for consultations.  4 Previous study showed that pharmaceutical care was associated with reductions in HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) by 1.24% in 2 years compared to the control group, which only reduced by -0.59%.  5 Orabone et al evaluated a pharmacist-managed diabetes program and found that pharmacist interventions in primary care resulted in reduced HbA1c and increased medication adherence.  6 igital health interventions (DHI) are defined as the use of digital and information technology to support and enhance health systems, patient care, and health outcomes.  7 The adoption of digital health intervention can further improve diabetes management by providing tools for continuous monitoring and personalized patient engagement. Pharmacist-led digital health intervention has some advantages including cost and resource efficiency. To our knowledge, no study has systematically reviewed the effectiveness of pharmacist-led digital health intervention for patients with diabetes. Therefore, the objective of this review was to summarize the characteristics and effectiveness of pharmacist-led digital health intervention for people with diabetes."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess the effectiveness of pharmacist-led digital interventions for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, assessing outcomes related to diabetes treatment, such as HbA1c and FBG, medication adherence, and reduction of adverse effects. Overall, the results were inconsistent. Around half of the studies (n = 9, 47.37%) showed that these interventions reduced HbA1c compared to usual care, while five studies (26.31%) showed there was no difference between the intervention and the control group.  9, 15, [18] [19] 9] [20]  Four studies (21.05%) showed an increase in medication adherence compared to the control group,  11, 14, 15, 25  while two studies (10.53%) showed no difference compared to the control group.  8, 18 he effectiveness of the intervention is influenced by several factors, including its practicability and patient engagement, the frequency of intervention, the provision of personalized communication, and the integration with clinical care through automation.\n\nWe found that telephone-based monitoring was the most frequently used (n = 15, 78.95%) digital health intervention. Similarly, a previous systematic review evaluating the use of digital technology by community pharmacists to improve public health also found that telephone-based interventions were the most commonly used digital health intervention method compared to other strategies such as mobile application and web-based intervention.  28 We observed that telephone-based interventions showed superior efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels and increasing medication adherence compared to other forms of digital health interventions. Telephone-based interventions are relatively more straightforward, which might explain their effectiveness in this demographic. For instance, a study focusing on digital health interventions for younger individuals (aged 16-35 years) found that web-based interventions, such as mental wellness websites, were more commonly utilized.  29 This suggests that the simplicity of the intervention's approach may play a crucial role in its adoption and effectiveness, particularly among older patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes.\n\nIn our review, several studies (n = 7, 36.84%) found no significant difference in diabetes outcomes between the digital health intervention and usual care. The impersonal nature of these tools, ie, the lack of direct human interaction and personalized communication, which can add additional burden of care to both providers and patients, was cited as a barrier to the implementation of this intervention.  30 In addition, access to digital technology, behavioral factors, and issues related with practicability of the intervention may also hinder the effectiveness.  21, 22 Future studies should consider these factors when designing interventions for patients with diabetes.\n\nAnother reason would be the frequencies of interventions. Three out of five studies utilizing telephone-based interventions that showed no significant difference had a frequency of phone calls ranging only from one to six. This suggests that a limited number of calls were insufficient to produce a meaningful impact on patient outcomes. In a study by Lauffenburger et al, patients did not receive the necessary frequency of interventions. Of the 700 patients, only 202 responded to the first call, 106 (52.5%) continued to the second call, and only 52 (25.7%) received three or more calls. This low frequency of interventions was likely insufficient, especially given the extended 12-month follow-up period.  18  similar outcome was observed in one study, where no significant improvement in HbA1c levels was found. 19  Although the study used a phone call system, the calls had a median duration of less than 5 minutes, which appeared insufficient to yield significant results.\n\nThe follow-up period in the studies included in our review ranged from 3 to 24 months. Although 3 months is relatively short, this period was considered sufficient for evaluating HbA1c levels, as demonstrated in two studies.  11, 13 This assessment is based on the average 3-month lifespan of red blood cells, allowing HbA1c levels to reflect any changes in lifestyle or medication adherence resulting from the intervention.  31 However, extended follow-up periods would offer a more comprehensive view of the long-term impact of digital interventions on medication adherence and disease management. Prolonged intervention duration may also gradually influence patients' medication-taking behaviors.  32  study done by Schiff et al showed that patients in the intervention arm is more likely to have adverse effects. This could be caused by the fact that the DHI used in this study works as a media for patients to report adverse drug reactions and its severity. Therefore, the fact that patients in the intervention arm is found more likely to have adverse effects is favorable in terms of early detection of adverse events, and early detection leads to early management of adverse reactions. This makes it easier for medical practitioners including pharmacists to plan change of therapy regimen and education regarding hypoglycemia for diabetic patients, as awareness on symptoms of hypoglycemia is really important.  33 n a study utilizing automated text-message reminders, the messages remained personalized by the pharmacist, tailored to each patient's profile with specific information on physical activity, diet, and daily lifestyle choices.  14 The automated text messaging yielded positive results, including a reduction in BMI and improved medication adherence; however, it did not lead to significant changes in HbA1c levels. A limitation of automated messaging is the absence of direct pharmacist interaction, which restricts opportunities for patient feedback and questions, thereby diminishing the pharmacist's supportive role. Additionally, studies should explore integrating automated and semi-automated interventions to balance the time efficiency and personalized care provided by pharmacists. Although automated interventions like personalized text messaging showed promising results in improving medication adherence, the absence of direct pharmacist interaction may limit their overall impact. Hence, future studies should investigate hybrid approaches combining automated systems with opportunities for pharmacist feedback. For example, in the study done by Gillani et al, direct pharmacist intervention is still better than telemonitoring and usual care, proving the importance of direct pharmacist involvement.  22 igital health intervention could be used not only for disease monitoring but also to assist in the drug management process, eg, the clinical decision support system (CDSS) that provides medication safety alerts to reduce medication errors, such as dosing errors, contraindications, and drug-drug interactions in diabetes treatment.  34 As shown by the study done by Schiff et al, with the help of DHIs, pharmacists could document more adverse events compared to usual care, showing that DHIs could as well help in the process of early detection of adverse events.  16 Nevertheless, this review indicates that there are still few studies addressing digital intervention for medication safety in diabetes. This review could serve as a foundation for further improving existing digital health interventions to enhance their effectiveness.\n\nPharmacist-led digital interventions for other chronic diseases, such as hypertension, have shown that medication management through digital interventions improved blood pressure control.  33 Similar research conducted for patients with dyslipidemia demonstrated that a basic internet-based health management platform is moderately effective in controlling the patient's diet, physical activity, and tobacco use, thereby providing adequate protection against dyslipidemia.  35 These studies demonstrated that digital health interventions have the potential to improve disease control for chronic diseases.\n\nThis study has several potential limitations. First, only the PubMed database was used as a source for articles. However, the decision to limit the search to PubMed was guided by the scope of our research. Our systematic review primarily focused on biomedical and clinical studies, for which PubMed serves as a highly comprehensive and widely recognized source. Second, although all the included studies employed RCTs, there remains a potential risk of selection  https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S494584\n\nJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2025:18 bias, particularly in unblinded trials where restricted randomization is utilized to maintain equal group sizes.  36 eterogeneity in the types of interventions included in this review may limit the generalizability of the findings.  37 The strengths of this review include its unique focus on pharmacist-led digital health interventions and its broad inclusion of various clinical outcomes, including HbA1c levels, medication adherence, and adverse effects. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted impact of these interventions on patient health and supports evidencebased decision-making in digital health care."
