  "title": "Digital versus nondigital behavioral interventions on cardiovascular risk reduction: systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to assess whether digital behavioral interventions improve cardiovascular risk factors more effectively than nondigital behavioral interventions. Methods: We searched 7 electronic databases from January 1, 1990, to April 4, 2024. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the effects of digital versus nondigital interventions on body composition, blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid concentrations. We also conducted subgroup analyses based on intervention duration, risk of bias, and intervention types. We reported outcomes as mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. \n Results: We included 34 randomized controlled trials with 17 389 participants. The meta-analysis found no significant differences between digital and nondigital behavioral interventions for 11 cardiovascular risk factors. However, subgroup analyses showed that digital dietary interventions significantly reduced body weight (MD = -0.66, 95% CI [-1.26, -0.06]), body mass index-BMI (MD = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.43, -0.07]), and fasting blood glucose (MD = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.57, -0.05]) compared to nondigital interventions. Digital physical activity interventions lowered total cholesterol (MD = -3.55, 95% CI [-4.63, -2.46]) compared to nondigital interventions. Combined digital interventions (dietary, physical activity, and smoking cessation) significantly decreased BMI (MD = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.36, -0.04]) compared to nondigital interventions. No significant differences were found by risk of bias or intervention duration. Conclusions: Digital behavioral interventions are as effective as nondigital interventions in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, making both essential components of cardiovascular disease prevention and management.",

      "text": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant global health concern, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality worldwide.  1 Nearly 70% of CVD cases and related deaths are attributable to modifiable risk factors. These risk factors include high body mass index (BMI), high fasting plasma glucose, elevated blood pressure, and lipid abnormalities, such as elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, high triglycerides, and increased total cholesterol.  2, 3 ehavioral interventions, which include modifications in dietary habits, physical activity (PA), and other health behaviors, play a significant role in preventing and managing cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus.  [4] [5] 5] [6] [7]  The importance of multifactorial behavioral interventions in improving health outcomes, quality of life, and reducing healthcare costs is well documented.  [7] [8] 8] [9]  The World Heart Federation Roadmap emphasizes the necessity of enhancing health literacy, self-management strategies, and national policies to promote healthier behaviors, with a growing emphasis on integrating digital health interventions.  10 he emergence of digital technologies has transformed healthcare delivery, offering novel platforms for disseminating behavioral interventions and promoting behavior change.  9, [11] [12] ] [13] [14]  Digital behavioral interventions are delivered through technologies including smartphone applications, wearable devices, telehealth programs, and online platforms.  15, 16 These interventions offer unique opportunities to improve the accessibility, engagement, and scalability of behavioral modification programs.  17 These interventions have shown promising results in enhancing healthy behaviors and related clinical outcomes, such as medication adherence.  9 espite the increasing adoption of digital health interventions, uncertainty remains regarding their comparative effectiveness against traditional nondigital interventions in mitigating cardiovascular risk factors. Some studies suggest positive outcomes associated with digital interventions,  11, 18  but others highlight possible limitations, including issues with adherence/user engagement and long-term sustainability.  19, 20 lthough numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of behavioral interventions, direct comparisons between digital and nondigital approaches remain limited. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the relative efficacy of digital versus nondigital behavioral interventions can help to inform evidence-based decision-making in healthcare policy and clinical practice. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness of digital and nondigital behavioral interventions in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, providing insights to inform evidence-based healthcare strategies."

These studies had to be randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults aged \u226518 years, without restrictions based on sex or disease status, and must have directly compared digital and nondigital interventions. Digital behavioral interventions use electronic or online technologies to promote behavior change, such as mobile health apps, web platforms, wearable devices, virtual reality, and social networking tools. These interventions often include features like selfmonitoring, goal setting, and tailored feedback. In contrast, nondigital behavioral interventions do not rely on electronic technologies and typically involve face-to-face interactions, such as in-person training, counseling, and health education, or paper-based materials like educational booklets.\n\nThe included RCTs had to report 1 or more of the following outcomes: body composition (including body weight, BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure, blood glucose (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting blood glucose), or blood lipids (including LDL HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol).\n\nWe excluded studies that did not assess the effectiveness of digital and nondigital behavioral interventions in improving cardiovascular risk factors, as well as other types of studies and publications like systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohorts, case-control, and cross-sectional studies, conference abstracts, editorials, and letters. Additionally, we excluded RCTs involving pregnant or postpartum women, publications in languages other than English, feasibility or pilot studies, and trials with fewer than 30 participants per arm."

The duration of interventions was classified according to median duration: The first group consisted of interventions with a duration of \u226426 weeks, while the second group had a duration of >26 weeks. The risk of bias was categorized into 3 groups: low risk of bias, some concerns, and high risk of bias. Types of behavioral interventions include PA, dietary habits, alcohol use, smoking cessation, and sleep management, either alone or in combination. We did not report the meta-regression results, as no statistically significant differences were found for any of the 11 risk factors.\n\nWe tested for differences between subgroups using the Q-test, with the null hypothesis indicating there is no difference in effect sizes between the subgroups. In meta-analyses involving 10 or more studies, publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. Egger's regression intercept, which assesses the correlation between effect sizes and standard errors, was used to detect funnel plot asymmetry, with a significant association (P-value <.05) suggesting potential publication bias.  25 All analyses were performed using the metacont function from meta package (version 6.5-0) in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; R version 4.2.0)."

Most studies were conducted in the United States (n = 23), followed by Spain (n = 3) and China (n = 2), with the remaining studies (n = 6) conducted in Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Bangladesh, South Korea, Germany, and Turkey.\n\nAmong the included studies, the majority (n = 15, 44.1%) targeted adult individuals aged \u226518 years with cardiometabolic risk factors such as overweight, obesity, prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, or elevated risk for coronary heart disease.  27, 28, 31, [33] [34] [35] 41, 42, 44, 46, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59  A subset of the studies (n = 6, 17.6%) enrolled adult participants with chronic conditions, including type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, or colorectal polyps.  32, 48, 49, 51, 56, 57 A single study was conducted among adult participants with mobility disorders (n = 1).  29 Three studies were conducted in adult female participants, where 1 study was conducted among females with prehypertension,  39  the second among females with prediabetes,  26  and the third among female breast cancer survivors with a BMI \u226525 kg/ m 2 .  40 Nine studies (n = 9) included healthy adults (\u226518 years) with no chronic conditions, or individuals without any selfreported eating disorder.  30, [36] [37] [38] 43, 45, 47, 0, 53  Of the total included studies, the most common behavioral interventions were a combination of PA and diet (PA + D) (n = 26), followed by PA alone (n = 5), diet (D) alone (n = 2), and one that incorporated PA, diet, and smoking cessation (PA + D + Sm). Intervention durations ranged from 6 to 104 weeks, with a median duration of 26 weeks.\n\nThe main digital intervention delivery modes included mobile health (mHealth) or telehealth, web-based platforms, wearable devices, virtual reality, and social networking apps, which delivered messages and instructions via text, images, audio, and videos. These tools facilitated self-monitoring, goal setting, and tracking of behaviors, including PA and calorie intake, with regular reminders and tailored feedback to maintain engagement. Web-based platforms offered interactive help queries for expert advice on behaviors, including nutrition and PA. Nondigital interventions are approaches that do not rely on electronic or online technologies, and the delivery modes include face-to-face interactions, such as in-person training, health education, and counseling, as well as paper-based materials, like educational booklets, without in-person or online supervision (Table  1 )."

Although the overall results showed no statistically significant differences in effect between digital and nondigital interventions, the subgroup analyses revealed significant differences. Digital dietary interventions had a significantly greater effect in reducing  that approaches hold promise promoting cardiovascular health among diverse populations.  8, 11, 60, 63 However, digital behavioral interventions offer unique advantages that can enhance accessibility, engagement, and scalability compared to traditional nondigital interventions.  13, [64] [65] 5] [66]  The integration of smartphone applications, wearable devices,  Downloaded from  https://academic.oup.com/abm/article/59/1/kaaf043/8176526  by Toni Tripp-Reimer user on 15 August 2025 ann. behav. med. (2025) 59:1-17\n\ntelehealth and online platforms individuals with and personalized tools to monitor and manage their health behaviors effectively.  64 For instance, exercise prescriptions alongside focused behavioral counseling can be efficiently managed through digital interventions. Additionally, digital interventions can potentially reach a broader audience, including individuals with limited access to traditional healthcare services or those residing in remote areas.  13, 17, 60, 66 Furthermore, digital behavioral interventions can also be cost-effective, which is a considerable advantage over nondigital interventions.  67 ne of the key strengths of digital interventions is their ability to deliver tailored and interactive content, enhancing user engagement and motivation.  17, 64 By leveraging features such as real-time feedback, goal setting, and social support networks, digital platforms can empower individuals to make sustainable behavioral changes and adhere to treatment regimens.  61, 65 The flexibility of digital interventions allows for continuous monitoring and adjustment of interventions based on individual preferences and progress, thereby optimizing intervention effectiveness over time.  61 Moreover, digital interventions offer opportunities for data-driven decision-making and personalized interventions through advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms.  61 By analyzing user-generated data, digital platforms can identify patterns, trends, and predictors of cardiovascular risk, enabling healthcare providers to deliver targeted interventions tailored to individual needs.  61 Despite these advantages, digital health interventions face challenges, particularly in engaging diverse populations, such as individuals with low digital literacy, those with low socioeconomic status, those living in remote areas, and those with limited tracking participation, as sustained engagement can be difficult.  64, 68 Conversely, conventional face-to-face interventions offer distinct advantages, such as behavioral counseling, prompt feedback, positive rapport, and the use of verbal, nonverbal, and contextual cues that promote interpersonal connections and facilitate behavioral change.  69, 70 espite these benefits, they often come with higher costs for staffing and facilities, challenges with accessibility and scalability, and variability in outcomes influenced by facilitator experience.  70, 71 Considering these strengths and limitations, along with the varied needs across different settings and contexts, implementation strategies that integrate digital and nondigital interventions hold promise for optimizing their effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nWhile this meta-analysis provides valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, subgroup analyses revealing significant differences were based on a limited number of trials for certain outcomes, necessitating cautious interpretation of the findings and indicating the need for larger studies within each subgroup to validate these findings. In addition, none of the included studies reported body composition indices, such as the waist-hip ratio (WHR). Thus, future studies should consider and assess the effect of behavioral interventions on anthropometric measures of abdominal obesity, including the WHR, as these measures are suggested to be superior to BMI in predicting cardiovascular risk.  72, 73 Second, significant unexplained heterogeneity was observed among subgroups, suggesting variability in intervention effects across studies. This highlights the importance of identifying and addressing sources of heterogeneity through more robust study designs and standardized methodologies. Future research should explore innovative approaches to optimize the effectiveness of digital interventions, such as incorporating gamification elements, virtual reality experiences, and artificial intelligence algorithms. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term sustainability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions in real-world settings.\n\nThird, the meta-analysis did not exclude populations based on disease condition, which may have resulted in a heterogeneous sample where intervention effects could vary significantly between individuals with different health statuses (eg, CVD vs non-CVD, prediabetes vs diabetes). Fourth, the analysis did not account for certain intervention characteristics, such as intensity, delivery modes (eg, SMS vs web-based, in-person vs paper-based), as well as mechanisms of change or the presence of additional interventions like medication adherence, which could further influence the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. Moreover, varying intervention durations across included studies may introduce variability in outcomes and limit comparability. Focusing on specific intervention types, durations, or standardized follow-up periods in future primary studies and meta-analyses could provide more precise estimates of intervention effects over time.\n\nFifth, methodological limitations, such as a high risk of bias in some studies, may have influenced the validity and reliability of the findings. Prioritizing high-quality RCTs with rigorous methodological standards is essential to minimize bias and enhance the reliability of the evidence in future research efforts. Finally, despite efforts to assess publication bias, its presence cannot be entirely ruled out. Including unpublished studies or conducting sensitivity analyses could help mitigate potential biases and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of digital and nondigital behavioral interventions on cardiovascular risk reduction."

Similarly, digital PA interventions significantly lowered total cholesterol, whereas digital PA + diet + smoking (PA + D + Sm) interventions significantly reduced BMI compared to nondigital interventions. Those who showed statistically significant differences between digital and nondigital interventions had effect sizes that fell short of established clinical significance thresholds for most cardiovascular risk factors; however, they still possess clinical relevance, highlighting the potential for significant health improvements. These differences could be attributed to the features of digital interventions, which often employ multichannel communication approaches, including technology-assisted supervised exercise programs. Such features may enhance engagement and adherence, positively influence exercise and dietary behavior, and potentially contribute to the observed effects on cardiovascular risk factors. 43, [60] [61] [62] Thus, it is important to consider the evolving nature of digital technologies and their potential impact on cardiovascular risk reduction.The findings of this study indicate that digital and nondigital behavioral interventions have comparable effects on various cardiovascular risk factors, including body composition, blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood lipids.
