  "title": "A hybrid encryption framework leveraging quantum and classical cryptography for secure transmission of medical images in IoT-based telemedicine networks",
  "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the transmission of medical reports in the form of scan images for collaborative diagnosis is vital for any telemedicine network. In this context, ensuring secure transmission and communication is necessary to protect medical data to maintain privacy. To address such privacy concerns and secure medical images against cyberattacks, this research presents a robust hybrid encryption framework that integrates quantum, and classical cryptographic methods. The proposed framework not only secure medical data against cyber threats but also protects the secret security keys. Initially, a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is employed to generate a shared key, which is then used to secure the symmetric keys via One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption. Next, bitplanes are extracted from each color component. The rows and columns of the extracted bit-planes are scrambled using random sequences which are generated by a 6D hyperchaotic Chen system and the Ikeda map. To further increase confusion in the original data, multiple-step pixel scrambling operations such as pixel shuffling, pixel value shuffling, and rotational and flipping operations are implemented. After the confusion phase, a combination of affine transformations with non-linear functions, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with complex modulation, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with random phase modulation, bilinear transformation, and nonlinear polynomial mapping are employed to create diffusion in the scrambled components. These multiple encryption operations aim to maximize randomness in the final ciphertext image. Additionally, to reduce computational complexity, only the Most Significant Bit-Planes (MSBs) are encrypted, as they contain more than 94% of the plaintext information. Several experimental results and analyses are conducted to assess the proposed encryption framework, including entropy analysis, key sensitivity analysis, correlation analysis lossless analysis, and histogram analysis. Furthermore, the framework is tested against various cyberattacks such as brute-force attacks, clipping attacks, and noise attacks on the ciphertext images, to demonstrate its resilience against such threats. The evolution of the Internet from digitization to intellectualization is transforming daily life and industry 1 . As the transfer of digital data, specifically digital images, occurs in huge amounts between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is necessary to secure them from eavesdropper access. Developing a robust technology to secure digital images is not enough because IoT devices such as smartphones and tablets are very resource-constrained, including limited power and limited storage 2 . As digital images contain a huge amount of data with a high correlation between image pixels, while developing algorithms for securing digital data, it should be kept in mind that they should be capitalised with such IoT devices having limited resources. To protect image information from unauthorised access, three main technologies, such as encryption methods and steganographic techniques, and techniques for securing encryption secret keys have been frequently used in the past several years  [3] [4] [5]  . Image encryption includes several approaches such as frequency",

      "text": "domain encryption  6  , spatial domain encryption, compressed sensing  7  , and encryption based on optical and quantum computing  8, 9  . Spatial domain encryption modifies pixel values directly, while transform-based encryption uses transformations to alter pixel values in both the spatial and transform domains. Compressive sensing incorporates both compression and encryption to enhance the processing time while also increasing the chances of losing data due to decryption. A new image encryption approach that enhances the use of encryption icing with optical properties  10  . Quantum image encryption, on the other hand, employs quantum encoders to secure digital images from cyber threats  11  . It is worth noting that encryption methods based on quantum phenomena are rather superior to those classical methods, which are logistic in nature. Most of the encryption techniques have a positive impact depending on the purpose of use  [12] [13] [14] [15]  . For example, the advanced encryption standard (AES)  16  is very effective when enhanced privacy is needed over digital pictures, but when it comes to IoT devices, it is not suitable as it has multiple encryption rounds and also includes very high-resolution encrypted images that take large storage space. However, with the growth in quantum computing, even the most secure algorithms like AES could become vulnerable.\n\nTo overcome the vulnerabilities related to the high latency and weak security, quantum operations such as quantum scrambling, and quantum substitution can be utilized. The scrambling process rearranges positions of the image pixel using random numbers generated by methods such as Blum Blum Shub  17  , chaotic systems  7, 11, 18  , ChaCha20  19  , and Random Number Generation Uniform (RANDU)  20  . Among them, chaotic systems are very reliable due to their robust properties, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, aperiodicity, topological mixing, and ergodicity. However, pixel permutation alone does not provide strong security for images, as it only rearranges pixel positions without altering the pixel values themselves  21  . Combining scrambling with diffusion provides stronger encryption by reducing the image pixel correlations. An effective encryption should use both permutation and diffusion for strong protection. Traditional encryption methods such as AES, and DES are unsuitable for real-time applications like video conferencing due to limited efficiency and security. However, quantum image encryption provides enhanced security and efficiency by leveraging quantum mechanics.\n\nIn this research, a robust and time-efficient hybrid quantum encryption framework is proposed. The proposed encryption framework utilizes QKD for key management, where a shared key is generated through QKD and then encrypted using a One-time Pad (OTP). This combination ensures that the secret keys are highly secure which makes it virtually impossible for eavesdroppers to recover the original secret keys. Moreover, the encryption process begins by extracting the R, G, and B components from the plaintext image. Bit-planes are then extracted from each color component of the input image. As most of the plaintext information present in the Most Significant Bit Planes (MSBPs)  22  , therefore, only these bit-planes are selected for encryption to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed encryption framework. The remaining, unencrypted bitplanes are simply combined to form pre-ciphered images for each color component. For the encryption of the MSBPs, random sequences are generated using specific initial conditions and control parameters of the chaotic maps such as 6D hyper Chen chaotic map(6DHCCM), and Ikeda map that act as secret keys. These sequences are employed to perform three types of scrambling: pixel scrambling, pixel value permutation, and rotation and flipping. Additionally, the process of generating random sequences is extended to enhance the diffusion process using XOR operation. Further diffusion is achieved by applying a variety of operations, including Affine transformations with nonlinear functions, discrete cosine transform (DCT), wavelet transform with random phase modulation, bilinear transformation with complex weights, and nonlinear polynomial mapping to produce the final encrypted image. The contributions of the paper are as follows:\n\n\u2022 A novel hybrid encryption framework is proposed that combines quantum and classical cryptographic techniques developed to secure the transmission of medical images in IoT-based telemedicine networks. \u2022 In the proposed work, QKD is combined with OTP encryption to generate shared keys and secure the symmetric secret keys, which enhances the key management process. \u2022 To reduce the computational complexity, bit-planes are extracted from the color components of the medical images and scramble only such bit-planes that contain the majority of the image information (over 94%) using random sequences generated by a 6D hyperchaotic Chen system and the Ikeda map. \u2022 Instead of using a single scrambling step, three-step pixel scrambling operations such as pixel shuffling, pixel value shuffling, and rotational and flipping operations are applied to create randomness in the plaintext image. \u2022 In the diffusion phase, affine transformations with non-linear functions, DCT with complex modulation, DWT with random phase modulation, bilinear transformations, and nonlinear polynomial mapping are combined to maximize randomness in the encrypted images.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 offers a brief summary of existing works including their advantages and vulnerabilities. Also, this section provides the advantages, vulnerabilities, and possible solutions to overcome such vulnerabilities. Section 3 delivers a comprehensive explanation of the foundational knowledge necessary for the development of the proposed encryption framework. Section 4 presents a step-by-step explanation of the proposed encryption framework. In Section 5, the experimental results and analysis of the proposed encryption framework are discussed. Section 6 presents a concise discussion of the entire proposed work, along with an overview of the advantages of utilizing multiple encryption layers within the framework. Finally, Section 7 concludes the entire proposed research, highlights the limitations of the proposed work, and also provides a few recommendations for future research to address these limitations."

      "text": "The development of image encryption techniques has seen substantial progress, incorporating contemporary technologies to enhance data security. This section explores the existing encryption schemes and investigates their vulnerabilities. For instance, In  23  , Hu et al. proposed a quantum image encryption method using a qubitlevel scrambling  23, 24  . This approach enhances operational effectiveness by the use of hyperchaotic states and sometimes controlling periodic windows, while the diffusion and scrambling methods aid image encryption further. Quite, the scheme is not effective if the parameters of the chaotic maps and quantum model are not efficiently selected.\n\nIn  25  , He et al. proposed a quantum image encryption algorithm, that enhances quantum image preparation by optimizing quantum circuits to reduce auxiliary qubits. The algorithm also deals with non-random key issues with a modified logistic map  26  and enhances security with row-column-based permutation  27  . However, vulnerabilities may arise if the circuit optimization or permutation methods are exploited, and the encryption could be weakened if the improved logistic map lacks adequate randomness or security. In 28 , Mohamed et al. proposed a quantum-based framework for the encryption of digital images. They perform pixel diffusion and pixel permutation by using quantum operations like Hadamard gates  29  and quantum-controlled gates  30  and perform key generation using a hyperchaotic system, bloomschaotic sequences, and circular shits for permutation. This scheme poses a risk of attacks owing to the hyperchaotic being predictable. In 31 , Gao et al. proposed quantum DNA-based cryptographic techniques. To round off the pixel transformation images of the new frame, alternation of colours of particular pixels within the images is achieved using Hilbert scrambling  30  . Their scheme is vulnerable to attacks due to weak management of the inverse operations and the key matrix. In 32 , Zhang et al. presented quantum image cryptosystems that include superposition states in reversible pixel scramblers. It also incorporates a pixel reordering feature in which a feature-orientated order of the image is processed with sequential cries. In 33 , Wen et al presented an encryption scheme based on chaos-based block scrambling and confusion-diffusion operations. It encrypts the digital images using multiple cryptographic operations, such as block-wise scrambling, and rotation. It also satisfies cryptographic criteria for confusion, diffusion, and avalanche effects.\n\nIn  34  , Rehman et al. proposed an encryption framework for the protection of color image schemes dependent on OTP keys and chaos theory with a rotor machine concept. The image pixel rows and columns are transformed and rotated to create new configurations for substitution. Vulnerabilities arise in their scheme due to the predictable patterns of the rotor rotation and chaotic sequences. Moreover, the one-time keys and chaotic maps are not securely managed or sufficiently randomized. In  35  , Kumar et al. introduced an encryption scheme that converts digital images into a 2D difference matrix using a median edge detector. The image is then encoded with a bit-plane representation to reduce the size and enable the embedding more secret data. In 36 , Zhu et al. performed cryptanalysis of encryption frameworks using bit plane extraction to find the key streams for bit-level permutation and XOR diffusion. This independence allows attackers to recover the permutation and diffusion keys through chosen plaintext attacks using just two specific plaintext images and their ciphertexts, exposing a significant vulnerability in the encryption system. In 37 , Sing et al. presented a chaotic system based encryption scheme in which key is initialized with confusion-diffusion operations. While the method offers strong security and high speed, it is not enough to resist cyberattacks because of the exploitable patterns in the object detection process. A summary of the existing works is provided in Table  1 ."

In 6D, visualization can be challenging, but projections of the attractor into lower-dimensional spaces (such as 3D) reveal intricate and complex trajectories as shown in Figure  1 . By analyzing various 3D projections of the system-such as \u03d61 -\u03d62 -\u03d63, \u03d64 -\u03d65 -\u03d66, and combinations involving other dimensions, it can be seen that each projection reveals unique patterns and interactions among the state variables, which can be utilized to generate diverse and unpredictable pseudorandom sequences for encrypting image pixels. Moreover, 3D projections of the 6D hyperchaotic Chen system highlight its complex trajectories and high sensitivity, which enable it to disrupt predictable image information when used in pixel scrambling.\n\nThe values of the state variables \u03d61, \u03d62, \u03d63, \u03d64, \u03d65, \u03d66 are obtained through numerical integration of the 6D Hyperchaotic Chen System's differential equations, and these values are computed over time and are not fixed but rather evolve according to the system dynamics.

      "text": "Our proposed encryption framework begins with the implementation of QKD for generating secret keys. QKD allows multiple parties to generate shared secret cryptographic keys, which can be used for secure communication. In the proposed research, the BB84 algorithm, which is proposed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard  40  , is used to secure the actual symmetric keys that are used in the generation of the chaotic sequences.\n\nAlice randomly prepares a sequence of quantum bits (qubits), where each qubit can be in one of four possible states, based on two different bases: Rectilinear (+) and Diagonal (\u00d7). The rectilinear (+) and the diagonal (\u00d7) basis states are |1\u27e9 (bit value 1), |1\u27e9 (bit value 1) and\n\n, respectively. Now Alice prepares a sequence of 8 qubits. For this example, bit sequence (b) is (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0), and basis choice (bB) are (+, \u00d7, +, \u00d7, +, \u00d7, +, \u00d7). Here, the Rectilinear basis + is represented as |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9, and the Diagonal basis \u00d7 is represented as |+\u27e9 and |-\u27e9. Bob randomly chooses his measurement basis. For instance, Bob's basis (b B \u2032 ) are (\u00d7, +, +, \u00d7, \u00d7 +, \u00d7, + ). Now Bob will measure the qubits and obtain the following results as mentioned in Table  2  Now Alice and Bob publicly compare their chosen bases and retain only those bits where their bases match.\n\n\u2022 Alice's Bases:\n\nThe retained bits will be 1,0,0,0,1,1. Therefore, Alice and Bob both have the shared key of 1,0,0,0,1,1. No, the following procedure is used to encrypt the symmetric key.\n\n\u2022 Define the symmetric key: Assume \u03b1 = 3.49. Convert \u03b1 to binary, which is \u03b1 binary = 11.011111.Suppose a scaling factor of 100 is used (two decimal places), 3.49 \u00d7 100 = 349 \u2192 -349 in binary is 1010111012. Now pad the binary of 100011 to match the length of 101011101:\n\nThis merged output (M) is sent over the public channel. The receiver, knowing both the shared key and the merged output, performs XOR again to recover the original symmetric key \u03b1. This ensures that even if the merged output is intercepted by the eavesdropper, without the shared key, it is impossible to recover the symmetric key.\n\nBits Qubits Measured results 1.

To recover \u03b1, Eve needs to compute:\u03b1 = M \u2295 K.\n\nChallenge for Eve: Eve knows M , but M depends on both \u03b1 and K. K is unknown to Eve. Therefore, the XOR operation is such that every possible key K could correspond to a different symmetric key \u03b1. This means that without knowing K, Eve cannot uniquely determine \u03b1.\n\nCase 2: Randomness of K: Assume K is a random string of bits, generated independently of \u03b1. Since K is random and known only to Alice and Bob, the merged output M can be any random binary sequence of the same length as \u03b1. Therefore, for every possible value of M , there is an equally likely K that could correspond to any possible \u03b1. Thus, from M alone, the probability distribution of possible values of \u03b1 is uniform over all possible values, providing no information about \u03b1.\n\nCase 3: Conditional Entropy: The conditional entropy H(\u03b1|M ) represents the uncertainty about \u03b1 given M . Since K is random and unknown to Eve, the conditional entropy remains high: H(\u03b1|M ) = H(\u03b1). This means that knowing M does not reduce the uncertainty about \u03b1."

The visualized results are displayed in Figure  8 . The decrypted image, shown in Figure  8 (e), demonstrates that the information in the plaintext image is still visible, although some noise remains in the recovered image. This indicates that while the exact pixel values are not fully restored, the content of the plaintext image is still easily recognizable. This result shows that the proposed encryption framework is effective in resisting noise attacks.\n\nTo perform a cropping attack analysis on the encryption framework, 20% portion of the ciphertext image is cropped and then attempt to decrypt the plaintext image from this cropped version.

The ability of the framework to maintain the integrity of the plaintext image under such conditions shows its robustness and effectiveness in handling attacks that involve manipulating or removing portions of the ciphertext. Several noise and cropping curves are generated for different images to demonstrate how much plaintext data can be recovered after adding external salt and pepper noise at varying percentages from 10% to 50%, with a step size of 2%.

For real-time applications and low-memory devices, such as IoT devices, the encryption framework must minimize the time required to encrypt plaintext images. To determine the computational complexity of the proposed encryption framework, MATLAB commands 'tic' and 'toc' are used to measure the elapsed time between two points in a script. The 'tic' command records the current time when it is executed, capturing the precise time in seconds since a fixed reference point in the past.

Moreover, apart from the encryption scheme in  45  , the proposed encryption framework outperforms other comparable encryption schemes in terms of computational complexity.\n\ncyberattacks. Additionally, the integration of multiple encryption techniques aims to maximize randomness in the plaintext data to enhance protection against cyber threats. For instance, using a single encryption method, such as a permutation operation that makes the encryption vulnerable to various attacks. When only a permutation function is applied to a plaintext image, the process remains insecure, as it only rearranges pixel positions without altering their values. This means that key patterns and structural information within the original image are largely preserved which makes it easier for attackers to reconstruct the image. Moreover, a ciphertext-only attack (COA) becomes possible when only a permutation is employed. In such cases, an attacker can take advantage of the statistical characteristics of the image, including patterns in color distribution or variations in intensity, to partially or completely reconstruct the original image. One more significant weakness of a permutation-only encryption method is its vulnerability to known-plaintext attacks (KPA). When an attacker has access to both the encrypted image and its corresponding plaintext image, they can analyze the pixel rearrangements to determine the permutation pattern. This ability to exploit statistical features makes the encryption scheme highly susceptible to reconstruction efforts. Furthermore, histogram analysis also presents a significant threat to permutation-only encryption. Since permutation does not change pixel values, the histogram of the encrypted image remains identical to that of the original image. This similarity enables attackers to analyze the histogram which provides statistical clues about the structure and content of the original image. Finally, the lack of diffusion in permutation-only encryption schemes makes them particularly weak. According to Claude Shannon  49  , an encryption scheme can be considered secure only if it incorporates both confusion and diffusion operations. Therefore, the proposed encryption framework effectively integrates multiple encryption methods to create both confusion and diffusion in the plaintext data. This ensures strong security with low latency, as demonstrated by statistical security analyses, computational evaluations, and comparisons of the proposed encryption scheme's strength with existing encryption methods presented in Section 5."

By leveraging QKD for the generation of secure shared keys and integrating classical cryptographic methods, the proposed framework addressed several security concerns such as weak key management, and weak security of the digital data. The proposed framework employed multiple encryption techniques, such as pixel shuffling, bit-plane extraction, and various transformation techniques for the enhancement of the confusion and diffusion between the plaintext image pixels. Experimental results demonstrated the robustness of the proposed encryption framework. The proposed encryption framework achieved impressive values in entropy, correlation, and key space, which are 7.999, 0.0001, and 2 741.67 , respectively. Moreover, the proposed framework is also tested against different cyber threats, including noise, cropping, and brute-force attack. It is found that after the addition of the external noise and cropping various portions of the ciphertext image, the proposed framework remains capable of decrypting over 90% of the plaintext image. This also showed its capability to protect sensitive medical data against unauthorized access and tampering. Additionally, the proposed encryption framework is wellsuited for real-time and IoT applications where fast processing speed is required. This is demonstrated by the computational complexity analysis, where it is observed that the proposed encryption framework can encrypt plaintext color images of sizes 256 \u00d7 256 or 512 \u00d7 512 within one second.\n\nThe proposed encryption framework can be further enhanced by incorporating visual cryptography using DWT.
