We're really interested in learning about everyone's unique experiences. You are the expert. We are here to understand your perspectives and experiences, so we will not be sharing our opinions. I'll be mostly asking questions and [second interviewer] will take some\n\nnotes. At the end, I'll pass it over to [second interviewer] to see if they have any additional questions. 1. First, I'd like to start by learning a little more about how you use technology and your phone in general. How often do you use your smartphone? [Use probing questions as needed As you read in the study information sheet. the purpose of the study is to learn about how and why you have used mood tracking apps, what you found useful & problematic about these apps, and how mood tracking apps can better serve users. I see that you've used [app namerefer to Demographics Sheet]. 2. What prompted you to first start using this app? PROMPT: Maybe it was a life event, or a suggestion or encouragement from family member or friend. If they have used more than one app \u2192 in general... 3.

      "text": "Protocol Remember: At each stage, we are interested in why the participant categorized something the way they did. This includes those categorized as not interested. Be sure to probe and encourage them to explain their choice of category.\n\n1. Data Entry Screens: Ask participant to categorize data entry screens into \"Interested\" and \"Not Interested\" a. Take the \"Interested\" data entry screens, and have participant categorize these into \"Too Specific\", \"Too General\", \"Just Right\" 2. Data Review Screens: Ask participant to categorize data review screens into \"Interested\" and \"Not Interested\" a. Take the \"Interested\" data review screens, and have participant categorize these into \"Too Complicated\", \"Too Simple\", \"Just Right\" Script Now that we have a sense of the apps that you have used and how you feel about them, I'd like get your thoughts on these cards with screenshots from some mood tracking apps to better understand what would and would not work well for you. To understand this, I'll ask you to categorize some screenshots from mood-tracking apps.\n\nLet's start with these screenshots which show different ways you can enter information into an app. I'll hand you these cards one by one, and you will put it into the \"Interested\" or \"Not interested\" category, depending on how you feel about the way the app collects information.\n\nPlease talk aloud as you're deciding which category each card should go in. The categories are just suggestions. You're welcome to create your own categories or place a screenshot between multiple categories. You're also free to recategorize something at any time."

Now let's look at a new set of screenshots. These cards show ways different apps present information back to you, and how you can review the information you have entered.\n\nLet's start the same way as before: please tell me if you are \"Interested\" or \"Not Interested\" in how these apps show information, using these categories.\n\n\u2022 Why did you place this screenshot in this category?\n\n\u2022 Why did you feel this category was a better fit than the other categories? So let's take these apps you put in the \"Interested\" category and talk a little more about them.\n\nWe'll use the categories \"Too Complicated\", \"Too Simple\", \"Just Right\" to talk a bit more into these apps. Thinking some more about these apps, please categorize these. Again, feel free to talk aloud, I'd really like to understand your reactions and thoughts on these screenshots.\n\n\u2022 Why did you place this screenshot in this category?\n\n\u2022 Why did you feel this category was a better fit than the other categories?\n\n\u2022 What about this screen would you find useful?"
