  "abstract": "Background: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases, traditional health management models are encountering significant challenges. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into chronic disease management has enhanced patient care efficiency, optimized treatment strategies, and reduced healthcare costs, providing innovative solutions in this field. However, current research remains fragmented and lacks systematic, comprehensive analysis. Objective: This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of AI applications in chronic disease health management, aiming to identify research trends, highlight key areas, and provide valuable insights into the current state of the field. Hoping our findings will serve as a useful reference for guiding further research and fostering the effective application of AI in healthcare. Methods: The Web of Science Core Collection database was utilized as the source. All relevant publications from inception to August 2024 were retrieved. The external characteristics of the publications were summarized using HistCite. Keyword co-occurrences among countries, authors, and institutions were analyzed with Vosviewer, while CiteSpace was employed to assess keyword frequencies and trends. Results: A total of 341 publications were retrieved, originating from 775 institutions across 55 countries, and published in 175 journals by 2,128 authors. A notable surge in publications occurred between 2013 and 2024, accounting for 95.31% (325/341) of the total output. The United States and the Journal of Medical Internet Research were the leading contributors in this field. Our analysis of the 341 publications revealed four primary research clusters: diagnosis, care, telemedicine, and technology. Recent trends indicate that mobile health technologies and machine learning have emerged as key focal points in the application of artificial intelligence in the field of chronic disease management. Conclusion: Despite significant advancements in the application of AI in chronic disease management, several critical challenges persist. These include improving research quality, fostering greater international and inter-institutional collaboration, standardizing data-sharing practices, and addressing ethical and legal concerns. Future research should prioritize strengthening global partnerships to facilitate cross-disciplinary and cross-regional knowledge exchange, optimizing AI technologies for more precise and effective chronic",

      "text": "Chronic diseases are defined as disorders that persist for a long period, typically lasting more than 3 months, and are generally considered incurable. These diseases are characterized by high prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and disability  (1) . According to the World Health Organization, chronic diseases account for 41 million deaths annually, nearly 74% of all global deaths, with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes responsible for approximately 33.3 million deaths  (2) . Furthermore, the socioeconomic burden of chronic diseases is substantial, encompassing both direct medical costs and indirect costs, such as loss of productivity, caregiving expenses, and economic losses due to premature death. A study in the United States found that direct medical costs associated with chronic diseases account for 86% of total healthcare expenditures  (3) . As the incidence of chronic diseases continues to rise, their economic impact has become increasingly significant, particularly for low-and middle-income countries and regions, further exacerbating their economic burden. In summary, chronic diseases not only pose a threat to individual health but also have widespread adverse effects, including medical burdens and economic pressures globally. Therefore, comprehensive and systemic measures are urgently required to alleviate the escalating burden they impose.\n\nHealth management refers to the process of helping patients effectively improve their health through comprehensive monitoring, assessment, intervention, and maintenance of their health status  (4) . Specifically, its core objectives are to alleviate the occurrence and development of diseases, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the overall quality of life. In practice, health management not only targets individuals but also groups, aiming to enhance self-management awareness and abilities through health education. Moreover, it utilizes health information collection, testing, assessment, and personalized management programs, along with interventions for lifestyle-related health risk factors, to continuously improve health outcomes  (5) . Research has consistently shown that health management can significantly reduce the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of chronic diseases by employing early screening, risk assessment, personalized interventions, and long-term follow-up  (6) . As a result, to address the growing public health crisis caused by chronic diseases, many countries are actively building comprehensive health management systems  (7) . Nevertheless, due to the ongoing shortage of medical resources, the health management needs of patients with chronic diseases have yet to be fully met.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a field of study that simulates and extends human cognitive functions through computer technology, with the goal of assisting or augmenting human capabilities in complex tasks  (8) . Since its introduction in 1956, the application of AI in healthcare has continuously expanded, encompassing areas such as patient care, medical education, and clinical decisionmaking  (9, 10) . More specifically, in chronic disease management, AI enables comprehensive management, from early screening to ongoing care, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of disease prevention and treatment  (11) . While research demonstrates that AI can enhance patients' quality of life and reduce strain on healthcare resources by optimizing health management strategies and improving chronic disease risk diagnosis  (12) (13) (14) (15) , there is still considerable uncertainty regarding AI's full role in chronic disease management  (16) (17) (18) . Although some progress has been made in integrating AI into this field, the research topics, patterns, and trends related to AI-driven chronic disease management remain poorly defined. This lack of clarity presents challenges for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare providers seeking to identify the most effective AI applications in chronic disease management. One significant gap in the current body of research is the absence of comprehensive bibliometric analyses specifically focused on this intersection of AI and chronic disease management  (19) .\n\nBibliometrics, as a research tool, provides valuable insights through the application of mathematical and statistical methods to analyze published literature. It helps to map out research trends, publication patterns, and the relationships between various studies in a given field  (20, 21) . By identifying influential research works, emerging themes, and collaboration networks, bibliometric analysis can clarify the development of a particular research domain. Given the unclear research direction and limited systematic evaluations in AI-driven chronic disease management, conducting a bibliometric analysis is critical. This analysis will help identify gaps, guide future research efforts, and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how AI can be applied effectively to improve chronic disease outcomes. Hence, this study aims to fill the void by performing a bibliometric analysis in this area, providing an essential foundation for subsequent research. This study employs bibliometric methods to analyze the current landscape of research on the application of AI in chronic disease health management. By doing so, it seeks to identify prevailing research trends, key topics, and emerging areas of interest. Instead of attempting to cover every aspect of AI's impact on chronic disease management, this study focuses on providing a comprehensive overview of current research trends, identifying key gaps, and suggesting potential directions for future exploration. Through this refined approach, the study aims to offer actionable insights for researchers, guiding them toward promising areas of further exploration. Additionally, the findings provide practical implications for policymakers, healthcare providers, and technology companies, helping to inform decision-making processes and optimize the integration of AI in healthcare systems."

Figure  1  presents a comprehensive overview of the literature screening process and the framework for visualized analysis. Additionally, Figure  2  depicts the annual publication trends. Initially, from 2004 to 2012, the average annual number of publications remained relatively low, with fewer than five articles published each year. However, starting in 2013, there was a marked increase in publications, with over 10 articles published annually from 2013 to 2017. Furthermore, between 2018 and 2024, the number of publications surged rapidly, peaking at 50 articles in 2023. It is important to note that the slight decline in 2024 may be attributed to the search cutoff in August 2024, likely resulting in some articles not yet being indexed at the time of retrieval. Despite the low publication from 2004 to 2012, there were a few citations in 2004, 2007, and 2008, with a Total Local Citation Score (TLCS) of 2. On the other hand, from 2013 to 2017, the TLCS remained high.

      "text": "Based on the bibliometric analysis results, this study systematically investigates the evolving trends in the application of AI for chronic disease health management over the past two decades. The findings reveal a notable and consistent growth in the volume of literature in this field. Specifically, from 2004 onwards, there has been a gradual yet steady rise in research focused on AI applications in chronic disease management. In particular, the period between 2013 and 2024 shows a marked acceleration in publication trends, indicating the heightened interest and investment of both researchers and clinical practitioners in this emerging area of study. Despite this positive momentum, it is crucial to recognize that the research on AI in chronic disease health management remains in its relatively nascent stages. While the rapid growth in publications is promising, the overall development of the field still lags behind in terms of quality and influence, as reflected in the declining TLCS in recent years. This suggests that although the quantity of research has increased significantly, the academic impact of these studies has not Pan et al. 10.3389/fmed.2024.1506641 Frontiers in Medicine 09 frontiersin.org Keyword co-occurrence network.\n\nTop 15 keywords with the strongest citation bursts.\n\nPan et al. 10.3389/fmed.2024.1506641 Frontiers in Medicine 10 frontiersin.org correspondingly improved, which could indicate challenges in the robustness, innovation, or clinical applicability of the recent studies.\n\nFurthermore, there is considerable room for further exploration and innovation in this field. The modest impact of early studies, coupled with the recent dip in citation influence, underscores the need for more high-quality research that can contribute meaningfully to both academic discourse and clinical practice. In this regard, future research should focus on addressing gaps in evidence, improving methodological rigor, and enhancing the translational potential of AI-driven approaches in chronic disease management. This will ensure that the expanding body of literature not only grows but also deepens the field's impact on patient care and healthcare outcomes. In summary, while the increasing volume of research in AI and chronic disease health management is a promising indicator of progress, further efforts are needed to enhance the quality, relevance, and realworld impact of this research. These findings highlight the importance of continued scholarly and clinical attention to this burgeoning field, with an emphasis on fostering innovation that bridges the gap between AI advancements and improved patient care.\n\nIn addition to the above findings, this study further reveals that the United States has established itself as a global leader in research on AI technologies in chronic disease management. This dominance underscores not only the country's significant research capacity and investment but also its extensive influence in shaping the direction of global research in this field. Nevertheless, it is equally important to acknowledge the substantial imbalance in the development of AI technologies for chronic disease management on a global scale. A detailed analysis of publication output and collaborative networks across countries and regions demonstrates that the United States accounts for over 50% of the global publications in this domain. In contrast, regions such as South America and Africa are markedly underrepresented, both in terms of research output and international collaboration. This discrepancy is further compounded by the fact that these regions engage in fewer scientific partnerships with developed countries, limiting their contributions to the broader discourse on AI in chronic disease management. This uneven development raises concerns about disparities in the application of AI technologies for chronic disease management across regions. Specifically, the lack of research and collaboration in underrepresented regions may hinder the global advancement of AI-driven solutions, ultimately affecting the equitable distribution of health management technologies. As a result, resource-limited countries and regions may struggle to access and implement AI-based innovations, exacerbating health inequalities. Therefore, to address these global disparities, it is essential that future research efforts prioritize and actively promote transnational cooperation, especially in resource-limited countries and regions. By fostering greater international collaboration, particularly with nations that are currently underrepresented in the research landscape, the global community can work toward more equitable development in AI-driven chronic disease management. This approach will not only enhance the global application of AI technologies but also contribute to more balanced and inclusive progress in global health management. In conclusion, while the United States and a few other countries continue to lead in AI research for chronic disease management, there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between developed and developing regions. Encouraging collaboration and providing resources for underrepresented regions are critical to ensuring that AI technologies benefit global health management equitably and sustainably.\n\nBy analyzing the co-occurrence of keywords, this study revealed that the main research focus of AI in chronic disease health management is centered around several prevalent chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Specifically, within the field of diabetes, the application of AI predominantly focuses on early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and continuous monitoring. For instance, AI algorithms are capable of analyzing vast amounts of patient data, including blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, dietary habits, and exercise patterns, to predict glucose fluctuations and optimize medication dosages. Consequently, this approach not only enhances the accuracy of treatment but also effectively reduces the risk of complications  (33) . Additionally, AI-powered smart devices and mobile applications provide real-time glucose monitoring, along with personalized dietary and exercise advice, significantly improving patient self-management  (34) . Similarly, AI plays a pivotal role in the management of hypertension. By integrating patients' blood pressure data, family history, and lifestyle habits, AI can predict the risk of hypertension and assist in the development of personalized antihypertensive treatment plans  (35) . Furthermore, integrating smart devices and remote monitoring technologies allows physicians to track blood pressure changes in real time and adjust treatment strategies accordingly, thereby improving patient compliance and treatment outcomes  (36) . Moreover, AI can analyze patients' overall health data to identify potential risks of cardiovascular complications and provide early warnings, contributing to preventive care  (37) . In the context of COPD, AI demonstrates considerable potential in both diagnosis and disease progression monitoring. Specifically, by analyzing pulmonary function tests, imaging data, and symptom descriptions, AI algorithms can accurately diagnose COPD and determine disease severity  (38) . Additionally, AI assists in developing personalized treatment plans, which include optimizing medication usage, respiratory rehabilitation programs, and lifestyle modifications. Supported by smart devices, AI can remotely monitor respiratory status, detect early signs of deterioration, and intervene to prevent acute exacerbations  (39) . Although significant progress has been made in applying AI to manage conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and COPD, it is important to note that AI applications in other chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), remain relatively limited. Further research is necessary to deepen AI's impact in these areas. Despite the growing body of research, systematic clinical validation and long-term follow-up data remain insufficient in chronic disease management  (40) . To fully realize AI's potential, future efforts should focus on conducting more extensive clinical trials and accumulating long-term data to ensure the safety, efficacy, and sustainability of these technologies.\n\nAnother crucial application of AI in chronic disease management lies in risk management, specifically in predicting and preventing chronic disease complications. The literature emphasizes that risk management is an emerging key research focus in AI, as it substantially contributes to enhancing patient health outcomes through individualized risk assessments. AI-driven systems, in particular, can integrate various data sources, such as medical records, genetic\n\nPan et al. 10.3389/fmed.2024.1506641 Frontiers in Medicine 11 frontiersin.org information, lifestyle factors, and real-time monitoring data to conduct comprehensive risk assessments  (41) . Such multidimensional data analysis allows AI to predict the risk of chronic disease complications with greater accuracy, enabling healthcare providers and patients to take proactive preventive measures and effectively reduce risks. For instance, AI models have demonstrated significant benefits in predicting the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetes management. By analyzing a patient's history of blood glucose fluctuations, medication use, dietary habits, and physical activity levels, AI systems can predict hypoglycemic risks in real time  (42) .\n\nWhen an elevated risk is detected, the system alerts both the patient and healthcare provider, suggesting necessary adjustments in medication or the need for dietary intervention, thereby preventing hypoglycemic events. This AI-based early warning system greatly enhances patient safety and improves quality of life. Similarly, AI models have shown promise in assessing the risk of acute exacerbations in COPD patients. By leveraging data such as respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and environmental factors like air quality, AI systems can predict the likelihood of exacerbations. Identifying highrisk patients early allows clinicians to adjust treatment plans or intensify monitoring, thereby reducing the risk of severe outcomes  (43) . Despite the promising potential of AI in risk management, several challenges persist  (44) . Foremost among these are concerns about data privacy and security, especially when integrating multiple data sources. Ensuring patient confidentiality is paramount. Additionally, the transparency and interpretability of AI models remain significant challenges. Healthcare providers and patients need to understand how AI-generated risk assessments are made to ensure that clinical decisions are well-informed. Moving forward, research should focus on improving the transparency and interpretability of AI models while simultaneously strengthening data privacy protection measures. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the safe and effective implementation of AI technologies in chronic disease risk management.\n\nIn recent years, the application of machine learning in chronic disease health management has gained increasing attention, as reflected by the rising prevalence of related keywords in bibliometric analyses. This research area has become a hotspot, with machine learning algorithms showing significant advantages, particularly in disease diagnosis, personalized treatment plan development, and patient behavior prediction. To begin with, disease diagnosis is a key application of machine learning technology. By analyzing large volumes of electronic health records (EHR), medical images, genetic data, and lifestyle information, machine learning models can significantly enhance the accuracy of early disease diagnosis  (45) . For example, in diabetes management, machine learning algorithms can integrate blood glucose records, genetic information, and body mass index (BMI) to predict the risk of developing diabetes, thus facilitating early intervention. Unlike traditional diagnostic methods, these models can automatically identify complex patterns, resulting in more precise diagnostic outcomes  (46) . Furthermore, machine learning holds great promise in developing personalized treatment plans. By leveraging individual patient data, these models can predict the effectiveness of various treatment options, aiding clinicians in tailoring treatment plans to the specific needs of their patients. For hypertension management, machine learning models can analyze drug response history, blood pressure trends, and lifestyle habits to optimize antihypertensive dosage and medication type, reducing side effects and enhancing treatment efficacy  (47) . In addition to diagnosis and treatment planning, machine learning has broader applications in chronic disease management, including resource optimization and health monitoring. Machine learning models enable healthcare providers to allocate resources more efficiently, predict which patients require more intensive medical interventions, and optimize healthcare resource utilization. Additionally, smart wearable devices combined with machine learning algorithms can continuously monitor chronic disease patients, detect abnormalities in real-time, and provide personalized health advice promptly  (48) . Despite the potential of machine learning in chronic disease management, the field is still in its early stages, and further exploration is necessary. In particular, challenges remain regarding model generalization and clinical validation  (49) . Current machine learning models may demonstrate unstable performance when applied to different populations and datasets, limiting their broader applicability in real-world clinical settings  (50) . Therefore, future research should prioritize developing more robust and interpretable machine learning models to enhance their adaptability across diverse scenarios. Additionally, large-scale clinical trials and data sharing will be crucial for validating the effectiveness of these models. Only through rigorous clinical validation can the safety and reliability of machine learning technologies be ensured, thus promoting their widespread application in chronic disease health management."
