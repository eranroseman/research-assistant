  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE COVID-19 vaccine uptake among urban populations remains low. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether text messaging with outbound or inbound scheduling and behaviorally informed content might increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. \n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial with a factorial design was conducted from April 29 to July 6, 2021, in an urban academic health system. The trial comprised 16 045 patients at least 18 years of age in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with at least 1 primary care visit in the past 5 years, or a future scheduled primary care visit within the next 3 months, who were unresponsive to prior outreach. The study was prespecified in the trial protocol, and data were obtained from the intent-to-treat population. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:20:20 ratio to (1) outbound telephone call only by call center, (2) text message and outbound telephone call by call center to those who respond, or (3) text message, with patients instructed to make an inbound telephone call to a hotline. Patients in groups 2 and 3 were concurrently randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive different content: standard messaging, clinician endorsement (eg, \"Dr. XXX recommends\"), scarcity (\"limited supply available\"), or endowment framing (\"We have reserved a COVID-19 vaccine appointment for you\"). \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who completed the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine within 1 month, according to the electronic health record. Secondary outcomes were the completion of the first dose within 2 months and completion of the vaccination series within 2 months of initial outreach. Additional outcomes included the percentage of patients with invalid cell phone numbers (wrong number or nontextable), no response to text messaging, the percentage of patients scheduled for the vaccine, text message responses, and the number of telephone calls made by the access center. Analysis was on an intentionto-treat basis. RESULTS Among the 16 045 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 36.9 (11.1) years; 9418 (58.7%) were women; 12 869 (80.2%) had commercial insurance, and 2283 (14.2%) were insured by Medicaid; 8345 (52.0%) were White, 4706 (29.3%) were Black, and 967 (6.0%) were Hispanic or Latino. At 1 month, 14 of 390 patients (3.6% [95% CI, 1.7%-5.4%]) in the outbound telephone callonly group completed 1 vaccine dose, as did 243 of 7890 patients (3.1% [95% CI, 2.7%-3.5%]) in the text plus outbound call group (absolute difference, -0.5% [95% CI, -2.4% to 1.4%]; P = .57) and 253 of 7765 patients (3.3% [95% CI, 2.9%-3.7%]) in the text plus inbound call group (absolute difference, (continued) Key Points Question Can text messaging with behavioral insights increase participation in COVID-19 vaccine outreach? Findings In this randomized clinical trial comprising 16 045 participants, text messaging did not result in a higher response rate than outbound telephone calls. Behaviorally informed messaging did not result in a significantly higher response than usual content. Meaning Text messaging offers a low-cost alternative to outbound telephone calls, but additional efforts are needed to increase vaccine uptake.",

      "text": "Despite considerable public health efforts to increase rates of COVID-19 vaccination, uptake remains limited. Lower vaccination rates among some racial and ethnic and sociodemographic groups exacerbate existing disparities in COVID-19 infection and its outcomes.  1 allenges of vaccine acceptance occur alongside logistical challenges of large-scale equitable vaccine outreach. In the initial phases of vaccine outreach, health systems and the government often relied on complex scheduling processes that required internet access and smartphones. Prior to this trial, our health system relied on emails and the patient portal within our electronic health record (EHR) to offer the vaccine to a large population of patients, but the experience revealed racial and ethnic and socioeconomic differences in uptake.\n\nWe aimed to overcome these challenges with 2 approaches. One was to switch to text messaging, which has facilitated more efficient and equitable outreach by health systems, as most patients have and use a telephone with texting capabilities.  2, 3 The second approach was to deploy insights from the field of behavioral science, as humans have systematic biases or heuristics that impede participation in health prevention activities.  [4] [5] 5] [6]  However, these same biases can often be overcome or even harnessed with different message frames that increase uptake of screening and vaccination.  [7] [8] 8] [9]  The concept of endowment suggests that people place higher value on items in their possession. If the vaccine is described as already reserved for the patient, that approach could take advantage of this sense of ownership, as patients may feel remorse giving up the allocated vaccine.  7, [10] [11] 1] [12]  Humans are also motivated by a sense of scarcity, placing more value on objects that are less readily available, which was the situation in the earlier phases of rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.  13, 14 Patients may also trust the recommendation of their primary care clinician to overcome hesitance and receive the vaccine by leveraging the behavioral principle of social norms.  [15] [16] 6] [17]  Finally, reducing logistical barriers or the number of steps in the process to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine might make it easier for patients to receive the vaccine. For example, pairing text messaging with outbound telephone calls by the call center to patients reduces the effort by patients but also requires that the patient be available to answer, while an inbound telephone hotline allows patients to call directly at a convenient time as well as providing a sense of exclusivity. We conducted a randomized clinical trial among residents in the city of Philadelphia, a larger city with a diverse population, providing outreach to unresponsive and previously unavailable patients, and concurrently evaluated text messaging and scheduling workflows with messaging informed by behavioral science principles."

Among the patients receiving text messaging (groups 2 and 3), patients were additionally randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio in a factorial design to 4 different types of messaging content, informed by principles of behavioral science: standard messaging, clinician endorsement, scarcity, and endowment. These behavioral principles were identified through preliminary work done by our team to understand patient motivations. The study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pennsylvania. A waiver of informed consent was obtained because the study posed minimal risk to patients, was embedded in clinical operations, and could not have been practicably carried out without the waiver.  18 The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan appear in Supplement 1. This trial followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline for randomized studies.\n\nThe major changes to the protocol before trial launch include expansion of the inclusion criteria to all adults, altering group 3 to allow for patients to call a scheduling hotline, and reducing the number of patients in group 1 to accommodate limited call center capacity. There were no major changes to the protocol after trial recruitment."

Patients in group 1 received a telephone call to schedule their appointment from an access center representative at the health system. Access center representatives made up to 3 telephone call attempts. Patients randomly assigned to this group did not receive any text messaging.\n\nAll eligible patients randomized to the text message groups received text messaging about the COVID-19 vaccine from our health system. The first message (sent at 9:30 AM) introduced the vaccine outreach and required the patient to confirm their name (\"Hello, this is Penn Medicine reaching out to you about your interest in the COVID-19 vaccine. Can you confirm you are XXX?\"). It also allowed for patients to opt out of further outreach (by replying with a text message of \"STOP\").

      "text": "Our main finding was that text messaging scheduling outreach did not result in statistically detectable increases in vaccine uptake compared with outbound telephone calls. In addition, there was no statistically significant increase in vaccine uptake with behaviorally informed messaging compared with standard content. Across all forms of outreach, the overall response rate was 3.2%\n\n(510 of 16 045) at 1 month and 4.2% (673 of 16 045) at 2 months, which is lower than was anticipated when the trial was launched.\n\nThere are a few reasons that might explain the null findings. This trial took place from April to July 2021, when the vaccines were already available in Philadelphia. There were considerable efforts by public health agencies and other health systems to increase vaccine uptake. Our health system had also reached out to patients via email and the electronic patient portal, so the trial participants included those who were nonresponders and less likely to respond to another outreach attempt, or patients who did not have an email or patient portal account. The lower-than-anticipated response rate made it more difficult to detect differences in response to the different interventions. There is also the possibility that the privacy requirement for patients receiving text messaging to confirm identity may have added friction to the process and reduced the response rate. Owing to the public health imperative in increasing vaccine uptake, all patients in the trial received an active intervention of outreach, so we did not compare with a no intervention control group.\n\nWe found that the text messaging groups had similar rates of response to the outbound telephone call outreach group. Text messaging is low cost and allows more efficient deployment of limited access center staff by triaging patients who have interest in the vaccine. From an equity perspective, outbound telephone calls or text messaging are the only option for patients without email or internet access. For example, Black patients had an overall response rate of 5.6%, compared with 1.9% for White patients, and patients with Medicaid and those with lower incomes also had higher response rates. These groups were less likely to respond to earlier outreach from the health system that was based on email or patient portal messages, which may demonstrate an advantage of text messaging and telephone calls for certain groups.\n\nAlthough the results were not statistically significant, the clinician endorsement and endowment groups had higher response rates than the other content. There is survey evidence that patients would trust their clinician's recommendation regarding the COVID-19 vaccine,  16  and identifying the primary care clinician's name makes this explicit. Describing that the vaccine is reserved for the patient in the endowment message implies that the default is for the patient to\n\nJAMA Network Open | Public Health Effect of Text Messaging on COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake JAMA Network Open. 2022;5(6):e2216649. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.16649 (Reprinted) June 13, 2022 9/12 Downloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 07/14/2025 receive the vaccine, and the patient may feel a sense of social obligation to receive the reserved vaccine.\n\nA large trial of text messaging outreach by Dai et al  23  showed that text messaging increased COVID-19 vaccine completion by 3.6 percentage points, but the baseline response rate to the invitation with no text messaging was much higher at 13.9%, because it was offered starting in January 2021. They also found a 1.1-percentage-point increase from \"ownership\" content that was similar to our endowment messaging. Another study by Santos et al  24  that offered email outreach to health system employees for the COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021 showed about a 7% vaccine scheduling rate compared with 3% in the control group, but scheduling was measured over 3 days.\n\nThese trials were conducted early in vaccine outreach when community demand was higher, while our trial was later in the rollout. They also compared the intervention group with a control group who did not receive outreach, while our trial had an active comparator group. A large trial in Rhode Island conducted at a similar time during vaccine rollout showed a null effect from behaviorally informed text messaging when compared with no outreach.  25 A large trial by Milkman et al 10 of text messaging before a primary care appointment to encourage influenza vaccination showed that endowmentframed messaging had the highest response rate, with a similar magnitude of effect to our messaging."
