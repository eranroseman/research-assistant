  "title": "Digital adherence technologies to improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes in China: a cluster-randomised superiority trial",
  "abstract": "Background Drug-sensitive tuberculosis treatment requires 6 months of therapy, so adherence problems are common. Digital adherence technologies might improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a daily reminder medication monitor, monthly review of adherence data by the health-care provider, and differentiated care for patients with adherence issues, on tuberculosis treatment adherence and outcomes. Methods We did a cluster-randomised superiority trial across four prefectures in China. 24 counties or districts (clusters) were randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control groups. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with GeneXpert-positive, rifampicin-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis, who were receiving daily fixed-dose combination treatment. Patients in the intervention group received a medication monitor for daily drug-dosing reminders, monthly review of adherence data by health-care provider, and management of poor adherence; and patients in the control group received routine care (silent-mode monitor-measured adherence). Only the independent endpoints review committee who assessed endpoint data for some participants were masked to study group assignment. Patients were followed up (with sputum solid culture) at 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome was a composite of death, loss to follow-up, treatment failure, switch to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, or tuberculosis recurrence by 18 months from treatment start, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Analysis accounted for study design with multiple imputation for the primary outcome. This trial is now complete and is registered with ISRCTN, 35812455. \n Findings Between Jan 26, 2017, and April 3, 2019, 15 257 patients were assessed for eligibility and 3074 were enrolled, 2686 (87%) of whom were included in the intention-to-treat population. 1909 (71%) of 2686 patients were male, 777 (29%) were female, and the median age was 44 years (IQR 29-58). By 18 months from treatment start, using multiple imputation for missing outcomes, 239 (16% [geometric mean of cluster-level proportion]) of 1388 patients in the control group and 224 (16%) of 1298 in the intervention group had a primary composite outcome event (289 [62%] of 463 events were loss to follow-up during treatment and 42 [9%] were tuberculosis recurrence). The intervention had no effect on risk of the primary composite outcome (adjusted risk ratio 1\u202201, 95% CI 0\u202273-1\u202240). Interpretation Our digital medication monitor intervention had no effect on unfavourable outcomes, which included loss to follow-up during treatment, tuberculosis recurrence, death, and treatment failure. There was a failure to change patient management following identification of treatment non-adherence at monthly reviews. A better understanding of adherence patterns and how they relate to poor outcomes, coupled with a more timely review of adherence data and improved implementation of differentiated care, may be required.",

      "text": "There were an estimated 10\u20226 million new cases of tuberculosis globally in 2021.  1  Declines in tuberculosis incidence and deaths have been observed over the past two decades; however, these declines are unlikely to be fast enough to reach reduction milestones for 2030, and data suggest that there was an increase in 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. China is among eight countries that contribute two-thirds of the global tuberculosis total, although, compared with 2015, by 2021 there had been a 15% reduction in tuberculosis incidence (from 65 cases per 100 000 population) and a 25% reduction in mortality (from two deaths per 100 000 population).  1  National guidelines recommend daily fixed-dose combination therapy to treat drug-sensitive tuberculosis, consisting of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin. Treatment adherence is considered important for cure and reducing recurrence of tuberculosis.  2, 3  major component of the directly observed treatment short-course strategy, introduced in China in 1992 and with national coverage by 2005, is directly observed therapy, defined as direct observation of treatment usually by a health-care worker or treatment supporter, to help improve medication adherence. However, a systematic review of treatment support using studies from China showed that only 20% of patients had directly observed therapy by a health professional and more than 50% of patients were self-administering treatment.  4 Despite this, China's treatment success for new and relapsed drugsensitive tuberculosis is reported to be 95%.  1  Digital adherence technologies, including SMS and electronic pill boxes, which support patients in their adherence to treatment, have the potential to enhance patient care through improving interactions between patients and health-care providers, and improving treatment adherence and outcomes.  5, 6 Electronic pill boxes usually involve a daily audio or visual reminder and box opening (considered a proxy for dose taken), which is digitally recorded and then used by the health-care provider either in real time or at routine visits to initiate more adherence support for patients who are having problems with adherence (referred to as differentiated care). SMS interventions include patients receiving a daily SMS reminder, sometimes combined with patients sending a text message to the health-care provider to confirm a dose has been taken. WHO's drug-sensitive tuberculosis updated treatment guidelines made a conditional recommendation, with very low certainty of evidence, for tracers (such as mobile phone SMS) or digital medication monitors to be offered to patients with tuberculosis.  7 hree studies have shown improved tuberculosis treatment outcomes with digital adherence technologies. An individually randomised trial in Kenya showed a reduction in poor outcomes (on-treatment death, loss to follow-up, or treatment failure), mainly through reducing"

      "text": "Evidence before this study We searched Medline and Embase in December, 2015, for papers published from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 1, 2015, with no language restrictions, using the terms (\"digital pill box*\" OR \"smart pill box*\" OR \"SMS\" OR \"text messag*\") AND \"TB\" OR \"tuberculosis\". We found one systematic review assessing the effect of mobile phone text messaging on treatment adherence used as a proxy for treatment outcomes and development of drug resistance. Four studies (three observational cohort studies and one randomised trial) were included in the review, meta-analysis was not conducted, and the authors concluded that there were mixed findings for the effectiveness of text messaging to promote adherence to tuberculosis treatment. Our previous study in China, published in 2015, reported improved adherence to tuberculosis treatment in patients who received text messaging or smart pill box reminders compared with those who did not. The study was not powered to evaluate treatment outcomes. Since 2019, three studies have reported improved tuberculosis outcomes using digital treatment adherence technologies. A study in Kenya assessed weekly motivational messages, daily text message reminders, an unstructured supplementary service data platform for patients to confirm daily adherence followed by text message and calls from the research team for patients who had not confirmed adherence, and clinic notification of patients with no confirmation for more than 2 days. The intervention reduced the risk of poor treatment outcomes (on-treatment death, loss to follow-up, or treatment failure) by 68%, entirely through reducing loss to follow-up. A stepped-wedge trial in Uganda assessed a text-message-based intervention, where patients received daily text message dosing reminders and were asked to confirm a dose taken using a toll-free phone number. Adherence data were reviewed at clinics visits every 2 weeks or monthly and resulted in differentiated management. The authors showed improved successful treatment outcomes (defined as cured or completed treatment) with the intervention, although only among a per-protocol population (which included 97% of patients in the control phase and 52% in the intervention phase) who enrolled within the first 2 months of treatment. In Peru, a per-protocol analysis of an individually randomised trial showed higher treatment success (cured or completed treatment) among patients who had a real-time medication event reminder monitor versus those who received standard of care. A systematic review in 2022 reported variable effects of digital adherence technologies on tuberculosis treatment outcomes."

We found that the intervention was not adequate to influence poor treatment outcomes, in particular loss to follow-up or tuberculosis recurrence. There was a failure to change patient management following identification of non-adherence at the monthly reviews. We did, however, show a reduction in treatment non-adherence in the intervention group compared with the standard of care group, similar to in our previous study, indicating that the smart pill box intervention improved treatment adherence."

In Peru, a per-protocol analysis of an individually randomised trial showed an increase in treatment success (cured or completed treatment) among patients who received a realtime medication event reminder monitor, where patients received SMS reminders if the monitor was not opened at the scheduled treatment time, escalating to sending an SMS to a previously designated relative or treatment supporter if the monitor remained unopened.  10 e aimed to evaluate the effect of a daily reminder medication monitor, monthly review of adherence data by the health-care provider, and differentiated care for patients with adherence issues, on tuberculosis treatment adherence and outcomes."

Consent was obtained at the provincial and prefecture-level CDC and from the local health authority of each cluster. We enrolled consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with GeneXpert-positive and rifampicin-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis, who were receiving daily fixed-dose combination treatment and were able to attend follow-up visits at 12 and 18 months after treatment start.

Randomisation was done by the trial statistician using Stata (version 14). After randomisation, it was identified that two clusters in the intervention group used the same dispensary, so these were combined into one cluster.\n\nCluster randomisation was justified to reduce contamination between groups and for logistical convenience: the intervention required changes to the delivery of care, so there were concerns that individual randomisation would lead to staff changing their behaviour towards patients in the control group and patients discussing care with one another.\n\nOnly the independent endpoints review committee who assessed endpoint data for some participants were masked to study group assignment."

      "text": "In all clusters, the tuberculosis doctors and relevant staff from the county-level CDC received a 3-day training on enrolment of patients, data collection, and the medication event reminder monitor. In both groups, patients were given a daily tuberculosis treatment regimen of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin, and a medication event reminder monitor to store medication. The medication event reminder monitor recorded the dates and times that it was opened for more than 2 s for patients to take their medication, and recorded a daily output to indicate that it was working. Further training was conducted after the start of the study on quality control of data and follow-up of participants after the end of treatment.\n\nIn clusters in the intervention group, the tuberculosis doctors at the county level received a 1\u20225-day training on delivering the intervention and doctors at the township and village level received a half-day training on the intervention. The medication event reminder monitor was set up to give an audio and visual reminder to take medication (daily, three times within 5 min) and attend monthly clinic visits. The default time for the daily dosing reminder was 0800 h but could be changed to an alternative time in the morning according to patient preferences. At clinic visits, the doctor could display monitor openings in the previous month on their computer, to discuss adherence with the patient. Intensive management was initiated at the first instance of non-adherence of 20-50% of treatment days when monitor was not opened as a proxy for doses missed in the previous month; township doctors would be asked to visit patients every 2 weeks and village doctors every week. At the second instance of non-adherence of 20-50% or the first instance of non-adherence of greater than 50% in the previous month, patients were switched to directly observed therapy, with medical staff observing therapy administration. Every month, staff from China CDC or the county-level CDC visited each intervention cluster to check the intervention was being implemented as planned.\n\nPatients in control clusters had the reminder functions on the medication event reminder monitor disabled. Managing doctors could not review monitor openings at clinic visits, but data were collected for the trial. In consultation with the doctor, patients chose whether to take medication under direct observation by a health-care worker, family member, or through self-administration.\n\nPatients attended monthly routine clinic visits for the 6 months of treatment. Patients had routine sputum collection for smear microscopy at 2 months, 5 months, and end of treatment. At end of treatment, an additional sputum sample was collected for solid culture (using routine laboratories) and a chest radiograph was done to help define treatment failure. Patients were telephoned at 9 and 15 months after the start of treatment and self-reported retreatment for tuberculosis. At 12 and 18 months after the start of treatment, patients attended the clinic to provide sputum for culture, have a chest radiograph, and self-report tuberculosis retreatment.\n\nMissed doses were measured by days with no opening recorded on the medication event reminder monitor, excluding days when patients reported not using the monitor because of travel or hospitalisation or when there was no medication event reminder monitor daily output to show it was working."

Treatment outcomes were based on standard national tuberculosis programme outcomes documented on the tuberculosis register (appendix pp 2-3). Recurrence was defined as a single positive culture, chest radiograph satisfying the case definition for new active tuberculosis, or self-report of retreatment. Recurrences identified by chest radiograph or self-report were reviewed by an independent endpoint review committee masked to study group assignment. This composite outcome aligns with outcomes used in previous tuberculosis treatment trials.  12, 13 econdary outcomes were poor treatment outcome (death, treatment failure, loss to follow-up during treatment, and switch to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment), loss to follow-up during treatment, poor treatment outcome or recurrence within 12 months of treatment start, time to recurrence in those who had been cured or completed treatment, and 2-month smear conversion to negative among those with a positive smear at the start of treatment. Secondary outcomes for adherence were percentage of months in which patients missed at least 20% of doses, percentage of overall doses missed, and visits attended on schedule. Process measures included inability to use the fixed dose combination treatment, number of visits by township and village doctor, medication event reminder monitor malfunctions, and withdrawal from using the medication event reminder monitor. In the intervention group, we also summarised the number of times the alarm sounded each day, and change of management due to nonadherence.\n\nVisits were defined as being attended on schedule if the number of days between visits was the same or fewer than the number of days' worth of medication given to patients at their previous visit."

In recalculation after two clusters were combined, a harmonic mean of 108 patients per cluster (due to slower than expected recruitment), allowing for 10% loss to follow-up, gave 83% power to detect a 40% risk reduction in the primary composite outcome. Sample size calculations were conducted using the Stata command clustersampsi.\n\nThe intention-to-treat population was defined as participants enrolled into the trial, excluding those who met a post-enrolment exclusion criterion (participants who stopped taking the fixed-dose combination treatment within the first month due to an adverse reaction; permanently stopped their treatment within the first month because of travel or hospitalisation; had their treatment extended due to updated diagnosis of tuberculosis pleurisy, or tracheal or bronchial tuberculosis; or had diagnosis of drug resistance due to non-rifampicin drug resistance), and participants with a change of diagnosis confirmed by the endpoint review committee. The per-protocol population further excluded participants who withdrew early from use of the medication event reminder monitor, regardless of the reason given.\n\nAll analyses were done in Stata (version 15), using the clan command.

Multiple imputation due to missing composite outcome was applied with 25 imputations (appendix pp 3-4).  15 Complete case analyses for the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations were also done. All secondary outcomes and subgroups were analysed using complete cases only. For the primary outcome using the intention-to-treat population, prespecified subgroup complete case analyses were done for area of residence (urban or rural), clinic type, age, education level, sex, and household expenditure, and post-hoc subgroup analyses were done for smear status and GeneXpert cycle threshold. All analyses compared outcomes, measured at the individual-level, in the intervention group versus the control group.\n\nThis trial is registered with ISRCTN, 35812455."

Employment as a farmer was more common in the control group (798 [58%] of 1387 patients) than in the intervention group (585 [45%] of 1282), and patients in the control group were more likely to be local residents (defined as formally registered in the prefecture) than those in the intervention group (1088 [78%] vs 883 [68%]). Patients who were not local residents were living in the prefecture temporarily (eg, for work or attending university). 88 (6%) of 1388 patients in the control group and 60 (5%) of 1298 in the intervention group had missing primary composite outcome data at 18 months (appendix p 7).\n\nUsing multiple imputation for missing outcomes, 239 (16%; geometric mean of cluster-level event rate based on mean of 25 imputations) of 1388 patients in the control group and 224 (16%) of 1298 in the 12 clusters assigned to the control group 12 clusters assigned to the intervention group 2 clusters with the same clinic later combined leaving 11 clusters 8179 patients assessed for eligibility (12 clusters) 24 clusters included in the study and randomly assigned 7078 patients assessed for eligibility (11 clusters) 1562 patients enrolled (12 clusters) 1512 patients enrolled (11 clusters) 1388 patients (12 clusters) included in the intention-to-treat population (primary analysis) 88 had primary outcome unknown, which was imputed in the analysis Harmonic mean cluster size 102 1298 patients (11 clusters) included in the intention-to-treat population (primary analysis) 60 had primary outcome unknown, which was imputed in the analysis Harmonic mean cluster size 101 5538 did not meet inclusion criteria 2663 treatment longer than 6 months* 456 not using daily fixed-dose regimen 228 aged <18 years 189 not living locally for 18 months 135 not treated locally 128 intensive phase move 78 hospitalised 80 communication impairment 15 HIV-positive 29 in prison custody 296 GeneXpert not done (233 no sputum) 1712 GeneXpert-negative 74 GeneXpert-positive and rifampicin resistant or unknown 6569 did not meet inclusion criteria 3249 treatment longer than 6 months* 683 not using daily fixed-dose regimen 250 aged <18 years 281 not living locally for 18 months 223 not treated locally 206 intensive phase move 123 hospitalised 68 communication impairment 36 HIV-positive 6 in prison custody 57 GeneXpert not done (30 no sputum) 1935 GeneXpert-negative 58 GeneXpert-positive and rifampicin resistant or unknown 28 did not consent 48 did not consent 214 met a prespecified post-enrolment exclusion criterion 77 fixed-dose combination stopped in first month 32 non-rifampicin drug resistance 32 stopped treatment due to travel or hospitalisation 33 tuberculosis pleurisy, or tracheal or broncheal tuberculosis 40 other reason 174 met a prespecified post-enrolment exclusion criterion 87 fixed-dose combination stopped in first month due to adverse reaction 14 non-rifampicin drug resistance 25 stopped treatment due to travel or hospitalisation 23 tuberculosis pleurisy, or tracheal or broncheal tuberculosis\n\nintervention group had a primary composite outcome event. There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of the primary composite outcome between groups (adjusted RR 1\u202201, 95% CI 0\u202273 to 1\u202240, p=0\u202295; adjusted risk difference 0\u20227%, 95% CI -4\u20225 to 5\u20229%).\n\nResults were similar in unadjusted, complete case, and per-protocol analyses (table 2; appendix pp 7-8). Prespecified subgroup analysis did not show significant differences in the risk of the primary composite outcome between groups by clinic type, patient age, education level, sex, or household expenditure (figure  2 ). The intervention was associated with increased risk of the primary composite outcome in clusters in urban areas (47 [11%; geometric mean] of 326 patients had composite outcome events in the control group vs 62 [21%] of 330 in the intervention group; adjusted RR 1\u202274, 95% CI 1\u202202-2\u202298). The primary composite outcome had a coefficient of variation of 0\u20223 in the control group and 0\u20224 in the intervention group.\n\nMost primary composite outcome events were due to death, loss to follow-up, treatment failure, or switch to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, which had similar percentages between the groups (203 events [14%; geometric mean] in 1350 patients in the control group vs 188 [13%] in 1283 in the intervention group; adjusted RR 0\u202297, 95% CI 0\u202269-1\u202235), and most of these were loss to follow-up on treatment (156 [10%] in the control group vs 133 [9%] in the intervention group; adjusted RR 0\u202292, 95% CI 0\u202259-1\u202244; table 2). In patients with a successful treatment outcome, recurrence rates were similar between the groups (1\u20225 recurrence per 100 person-years in the control group vs 2\u20224 per 100 person-years in the intervention group; unadjusted RR 1\u202260, 95% CI 0\u202275-3\u202242; table 2; appendix p 8). Patients in the intervention group were 64% less likely to miss more than 20% of treatment doses in a month (geometric mean 0\u20229 months [16%] of 6\u20220 months per person in the intervention group vs 2\u20227 months [46%] of 6\u20220 months per person in the control group; adjusted RR 0\u202236, 95% CI 0\u202227-0\u202250) and missed 57% fewer doses (geometric mean 16 [11%] of 160 doses per person vs 42 [27%] of 160 per person; adjusted RR 0\u202243, 0\u202234-0\u202253) than those in the control group (table 3).\n\nPost-hoc sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome and secondary adherence outcomes were consistent with the primary analyses (appendix pp 8-10).

      "text": "In this large, cluster-randomised trial of 2686 patients with drug-sensitive tuberculosis from four prefectures in China, a digital adherence technology intervention had no effect on the risk of the primary composite outcome, and secondary outcomes of death, treatment failure, or loss to follow-up during treatment. Tuberculosis recurrence was uncommon, with a 12-month risk of 1\u20229% after the end of treatment among patients who had a successful treatment outcome. Non-adherence was reduced by 57-64% in the intervention group compared with the control group, depending on the metric used, which was a greater reduction than in our previous study.  6 A systematic review of digital adherence technologies to improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes reported intervention effects in different directions.  16 In this study, the majority of patients in the control group self-administered treatment. Despite self-administration being a choice by the patient in consultation with their doctor, on the basis of national tuberculosis programme guidelines, the type of treatment support varied widely by cluster, suggesting it largely depended on the doctor's preference.\n\nThe intervention had no effect on loss to follow-up, which accounted for most of the primary composite outcome events (289 [67%] of 433 events); this might have been because there was a paucity of timely adherence data, and because of failure to change management following identification of non-adherence at monthly reviews. Rather than monthly adherence assessment, a more frequent review of adherence data by health-care workers and initiation of intensive management to assist patients who have issues with adherence are likely to be needed to reduce loss to follow-up. The Keheala intervention, evaluated in a study in Kenya, assessed weekly motivational messages, daily text message reminders, an unstructured supplementary service data platform for patients to confirm daily adherence with follow-up by the research team for patients who had not confirmed adherence, and clinic notification of patients with no confirmation for more than 2 days. The intervention was associated with a 68% (95% CI 50-79) reduced risk of poor treatment outcome (composite outcome of ontreatment death, treatment failure, or loss to follow-up), entirely through reducing loss to follow-up.  8 A steppedwedge trial in Uganda showed improved successful treatment outcomes (cured or completed treatment), including a reduction in loss to follow-up, among a perprotocol population who enrolled onto the intervention within the first 2 months of treatment.  9 The study assessed an SMS-based intervention (99DOTS), whereby patients received daily text message dosing reminders and were asked to confirm when a dose was taken using a\n\nControl group Intervention group Unadjusted mean difference (95% CI) Adjusted mean difference (95% CI) Adherence* Months in which patient missed >20% of doses per person per months of treatment toll-free number, as well as a weekly automated interactive voice response check-in. Review of adherence data at visits every 2 weeks or monthly resulted in differentiated management based on adherence. Overall, 97% of patients in the control group and 52% in the intervention group were included in the per-protocol population. The authors acknowledge that this comparison might be problematic because of selection bias. An individually randomised trial in Peru, which used a real-time medication event reminder monitor showed, in the perprotocol population, higher treatment success (cured or completed treatment) in the intervention group than in the control group (48 [98%] of 49 vs 45 [85%] of 53; RR 1\u202215, 95% CI 1\u202202-1\u202230). However, this effect was not observed in the intention-to-treat population (RR 1\u202209, 95% CI 0\u202294-1\u202227), which included four patients in the intervention group who withdrew (two voluntarily [one switched to a different regimen], and two due to suspected misuse of the monitor).  10 There was a failure to change patient management following identification of non-adherence at monthly reviews by doctors at the tuberculosis centres, despite regular visits to clusters by the national or county-level CDC to review intervention fidelity.\n\nIn our trial, despite non-adherence being higher in the control group than in the intervention group, there was no apparent intervention effect on treatment outcomes or tuberculosis recurrence, which contradicts the findings from some other studies. An analysis of the fluoroquinolone treatment trials, albeit a non-randomised comparison, showed a strong relationship between lower adherence and increased risk of unfavourable tuberculosis treatment outcomes.  3, 17 This might mean that, in the control group, treatment adherence was still high enough to result in the majority of patients being effectively treated and having no increased risk of recurrence.  18 With the granular adherence data generated by this trial, it will be important to identify whether certain patterns of non-adherence are associated with increased risk of poor treatment outcomes or treatment recurrence. In a descriptive analysis, our data showed a pattern of increased risk of unfavourable outcomes with lower adherence, in both groups, although confounding might partly explain this relationship. Alternatively, there might be differential measurement (between groups) of adherence using box-opening, resulting in adherence being similar in the two study groups. This would mean that box-opening is a poor proxy for treatment adherence. In a substudy of our previous trial, however, we did validate box-opening as a proxy using a urine test for rifampicin, and found high sensitivity and specificity.  19 uture studies could include a validation of box-opening as a proxy of dose taken using urine testing to detect drug metabolites. We also cannot discount the Hawthorne effect of the silent-mode medication event reminder monitor box in the control group improving treatment adherence, compared with usual care.\n\nAlternatively, we might have underestimated tuberculosis recurrence, although underestimation was unlikely to be differential by study group. We followed up patients for 12 months after the end of treatment, which would be likely to capture the vast majority of recurrences.  20 Recurrence in this trial, however, was very low (1\u20229% over 12 months), in particular compared with the fluoroquinolone trials, where 12-month recurrence was two to three times higher than in this trial. We used solid culture in laboratories that had quality control assessed before, although not during, the study. Sputum specimens were only collected at two timepoints after end of treatment, limiting the measurement of recurrence, and specimens might have been of lower quality compared with those collected as part of a treatment trial. Our approach for documenting recurrence, therefore, might not have been sufficiently sensitive, although we did supplement sputum specimens with chest radiographs.\n\nThis trial did show a reduction in non-adherence, measured by box-opening, in the intervention group compared with the control group, similar to in our previous study,  6  indicating improved quality of treatment with the intervention. Based on adherence data from these two pragmatic trials and programmatic experience of medication event reminder monitors in 138 counties in China,  21  the China national tuberculosis programme has planned to expand the utilisation of the monitors, albeit with real-time functions, nationwide, in their 14th 5-year plan (for 2021-25).\n\nOther digital adherence technologies have been assessed in upper-middle-income and high-income settings, including video-supported therapy, to improve treatment outcomes. These studies have shown similar or increased rates of favourable treatment outcomes with video supported therapy compared with control groups (often directly observed therapy); although, individually, all 95% CIs for the ratio effect estimate overlap 1, so are not significant.  [22] [23] 3] [24]  A study in China showed similar rates of successful treatment outcomes (cured and completed treatment) in the intervention group (video supported therapy; 109 [96%] of 203 patients) compared with the control group (directly observed therapy; 191 [95%] of 202).  23 The observation in the intervention group was done using live video and directly observed therapy required observation of treatment by a health-care worker or lay worker once every 2 days. Further evaluation of this technology in China, where directly observed therapy is not a requirement, is warranted.\n\nThis trial has many strengths, including a large sample size and an intervention that was implemented by the national tuberculosis programme rather than a research team in parallel, it was conducted across varied settings, and follow-up continued for 12 months after the end of treatment. The study does, however, have several limitations: more intensive management activities, such as home visits to patients identified as having adherence problems, did not always happen as planned; after randomisation, two intervention clusters were combined, although this had minimal impact on power; solid culture rather than the more sensitive liquid culture was used to measure recurrence; and adherence outcomes were defined using a box-opening as a proxy for doses taken.\n\nIn conclusion, the digital adherence technology intervention, involving a daily reminder medication monitor, monthly review of adherence data, and differentiated care for patients with adherence issues, was inadequate to influence unfavourable outcomes, which included loss to follow-up during treatment, tuberculosis recurrence, death, and treatment failure. Poor implementation of targeted adherence support might have contributed to no effect of the intervention on outcomes. Other trials have shown that digital adherence technologies (SMS-based and those based on medication event reminder monitors), implemented in real-time, can improve successful treatment outcomes. It is important, though, to understand the cost of delivering such interventions and also how these can be implemented in routine practice. Programmatically, treatment adherence might be sub standard and clinicians do not have adequate methods to measure dose-taking. WHO uses treatment success (cured or completed treatment) as an indicator for performance of tuberculosis programmes, although it is a poor indicator of care as treatment completion is often not based on robust measures of adherence. For evaluating digital adherence technologies, rather than relying solely on outcomes at the end of treatment, a combined endpoint of adherence and treatment outcome could be used, with adherence measured in all trial participants using digital technologies with excellent accuracy characteristics. It is important that future trials do measure end of treatment outcomes, ideally incorporating quality treat ment completion and possibly recurrence, if measured robustly, to generate strong evidence to influence policy."
