  "title": "Evaluation of Patient-Facing Mobile Apps to Support Physiotherapy Care: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile health interventions delivered through mobile apps are increasingly used in physiotherapy care. This may be because of the potential of apps to facilitate changes in behavior, which is central to the aims of care delivered by physiotherapists. A benefit of using apps is their ability to incorporate behavior change techniques (BCTs) that can optimize the effectiveness of physiotherapeutic interventions. Research continues to suggest that despite their importance, behavior change strategies are often missing in patient management. Evaluating mobile apps that physiotherapists can use to drive behavior change may inform clinical practice and potentially improve patient outcomes. Examining the quality of apps and exploring their key features that can support behavior change and physiotherapy care are important aspects of such an evaluation. \n Objective: The primary aim of this study was to describe the range of mobile apps in app stores that are intended for use by patients to support physiotherapy care. The secondary aims were to assess app quality, BCTs, and their behavior change potential. Methods: A systematic review of mobile apps in app stores was undertaken. The Apple App Store and Google Play were searched using a 2-step search strategy, using terms relevant to the physiotherapy discipline. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied: apps had to be intended for use by patients and be self-contained (or stand-alone) without the requirement to be used in conjunction with a partner wearable device or another plugin. Included apps were coded for BCTs using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1. App quality was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale, and the App Behavior Change Scale was used to assess the app's potential to change behavior. \n Results: In total, 1240 apps were screened, and 35 were included. Of these 35 apps, 22 (63%) were available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play platforms. In total, 24 (69%) were general in their focus (eg, not condition-specific), with the remaining 11 (31%) being more specific (eg, knee rehabilitation and pelvic floor training). The mean app quality score (Mobile App Rating Scale) was 3.7 (SD 0.4) of 5 (range 2.8-4.5). The mean number of BCTs identified per app was 8.5 (SD 3.6). BCTs most frequently included in the apps were instruction on how to perform a behavior (n=32), action planning (n=30), and self-monitoring of behavior (n=28). The mean behavior change potential score (App Behavior Change Scale) was 8.5 (SD 3.1) of 21 (range 3-15). \n Conclusions: Mobile apps available to support patient care received from a physiotherapist are of variable quality. Although they contain some BCTs, the potential for behavior change varied widely across apps.",

      "text": "Digital health in physiotherapy is an emergent area. It continues to gather speed with its use in both clinical practice and research growing exponentially  [1] [2] [3] . Many digital modalities, with varied functions, are relevant to physiotherapy practice; these might include the delivery of timely digital patient information and resources through websites and patient portals  [4] , digital patient assessment using connected Bluetooth and wireless-enabled devices  [5] , digital models of care (telehealth) supported by video-based consultation  [6] [7] [8] , remote monitoring of patient status through wearables  [9, 10] , and mobile health (mHealth) apps used to prescribe, monitor, and support home exercise programs  [1, 11] .\n\nMobile apps are one type of digital health modality of particular interest because of the ubiquity of smartphone use and their ability to deliver digital therapeutics  [12] [13] [14] . They are relatively inexpensive and thus scalable  [15] . They are also worthy of scientific attention within the physiotherapy community because of their ability to support interventions targeting several aspects of behavior change, otherwise known as behavior change techniques (BCTs)  [16] [17] [18] [19] . Facilitating positive behavior change in people with health conditions is often central to the management approach of physiotherapists, aimed at deriving the best possible therapeutic benefit from an intervention. For example, behavior change may be required for a person to follow physiotherapist advice regarding activity pacing or to adhere to exercise and physical activity recommendations  [1, 16, 19, 20] . BCTs can be thought of as the components of an intervention that regulate the behavior by altering cause and effect  [21] . As defined by Michie and Johnston  [22] , they may be thought of as the \"active ingredients\" that facilitate intended behaviors. Apps have the ability to incorporate and deliver numerous BCTs, which can mediate a behavioral target of physiotherapy care  [23] [24] [25] .\n\nThe app space continues to grow exponentially, with well over 300,000 health apps now available and over 200 health apps added to major app stores daily  [18] . Concurrently, despite a growing evidence base regarding the role of mobile apps in physiotherapy contexts, there remains a dearth of high-quality research using validated and rigorous scientific methods assessing the quality of physiotherapy-specific mobile apps and their behavior change aspects (eg, BCTs used and behavior change potential)  [11, 25] ."

MARS was used because of its reliability, simplicity, and wide applicability in mHealth research  [26, 32] . Its primary domains are engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information, as well as a subjective rating of quality. Each domain has questions coded on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1=inadequate to 5=excellent). Mean scores are calculated for each of the 4 domains, which are tallied and divided by the number of domains to produce an overall mean quality score out of 5. Mean scoring is used instead of total scores because individual items can be rated as \"not applicable\"  [26] .\n\nCalculating the mean scores of the engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality objective subscales and an overall mean app quality total score is how the MARS is scored. Mean scores instead of total scores are used because an item can be rated as \"not applicable.\"\n\nBoth reviewers (MM and PV) completed MARS training before scoring each app independently.

Furthermore, the BCTs in the BCTTv1 are further arranged into 16 clusters, each including similar BCTs  [21] . This clustering was helpful for coders when developing a novel codebook (Multimedia Appendix 3), as it helped clarify coding decisions when examining the behavior change potential of included apps  [25] . Any disagreements were discussed to achieve consensus.

The ABACUS focuses on 4 BCT clusters: knowledge and information, goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, and actions  [24] .

Reasons for exclusion included non-English language, costing more than Aus $10 (a currency exchange rate of Aus $1=US $0.72 is applicable), delivering its own service, irrelevant content, targeted at physiotherapist (clinician use) rather than the patient, being a bespoke or white-labeled app (ie, standard architectures licensed to a business or brand for private use), incompatibility with a current mobile device, and not a stand-alone app. This left 25 included apps for data extraction.

The secondary aims were to evaluate app quality, examine BCTs they contained, and evaluate behavior change potential. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the current landscape of apps that may be used to support physiotherapy care and shed light on their ability to facilitate behavior change and potentially improve patient outcomes.\n\nWe identified 35 eligible apps, highlighting the popularity and increasing recognition of digital strategies for supplementing physiotherapy care  [2, 36] . It must also be noted that there is a growing number of apps within the broader exercise medicine and rehabilitation science space that may not have met the specific eligibility criteria for this systematic review but may still be of value in supporting physiotherapy care  [1, 18] . The rising number of available mobile apps necessitates careful and considered evaluation and selection of apps by clinicians and researchers to ensure that patients are accessing high-quality, effective, and safe apps that are evidence-based  [1, 11, 37, 38] ."

      "text": "Analysis of the app descriptive characteristics revealed interesting findings. Just under two-thirds of apps were cross-platform compatible (available on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store). As smartphone ubiquity continues to grow, broader availability may contribute to wider accessibility and increase the uptake of apps to supplement physiotherapy care by both patients and physiotherapists  [39] . The physiotherapy profession has recognized the value of mHealth tools to serve under-resourced communities and regions  [40] . It is encouraging to note that in terms of price, the majority of the apps included in our review were free to download for patients. It must also be acknowledged that our review only examined apps that cost Aus $10 or less, which is in line with similar studies of apps for the management of arthritis, back pain, and persistent pain  [29, 31, 32, 41] . This follows similar research, suggesting that health consumers are less likely to buy health apps costing more than this  [42] . However, there may well be more expensive apps available for purchase that were not included in our review. Conversely, while there are many seemingly free-to-download apps, several of the included apps require the physiotherapist to prescribe the patient a program from a companion app or dashboard before they can use it (eg, PhysiApp and TeleHab). In situations like this, the use of apps to support care is contingent on factors such as willingness to engage with digital health, acceptance, and digital health literacy of treating physiotherapists  [2, 37, 38] .\n\nRelevant to an evidence-based profession like physiotherapy, the credibility of apps to support care remains an important consideration, and research suggests that this is a central factor in user engagement and satisfaction  [43, 44] . Less than half of the apps 16 (46%) provided clear information about the qualifications or background of the developers. Similarly, only"

      "text": "A key aim of this study was to assess the quality of mobile apps relevant to physiotherapy care. While app quality is somewhat subjective, and measurement scales continue to emerge (eg, the recently released Deakin Health E-technologies Assessment Lab framework)  [46] , the MARS remains the most used, published, and validated  [1, 26, 29] . Overall mean app quality in this study was 3.7 (SD 0.4), which is similar to previous research validating the MARS  [47] . The authors reported a mean health app quality score of 3.74 (SD 0.6) of 5 and considered this as \"moderate\" quality. Notably, there is no universally accepted threshold for interpreting MARS scores. This suggests that the current landscape of physiotherapy apps has a little way to go in terms of quality. Our MARS data for the domains of \"aesthetics\" and \"functionality\" suggested that the included apps generally offer a good user experience and technical performance. These findings align with a quality appraisal of mobile apps for self-management of persistent pain conditions  [29]  but contrast to the relatively low scores obtained for apps specific to the management of low back pain  [32] .\n\nGiven that the physiotherapy profession is an evidence-based discipline, it is alarming that we found that only 4 (11%) of included apps met MARS criterion 19 (has the app been trialed or tested and published in scientific literature). Further, only 1 (3%; ReHand, Hand Rehabilitation) has been examined in an RCT  [34, 35, 48] . However, the SMS-based precursor, which informed the development of My Exercise Messages, has undergone rigorous RCTs, showing positive patient outcomes  [48, 49] . An RCT studying the My Exercise Messages app is currently underway, and the protocol has been published  [50] . As digital physiotherapy practice evolves, a combination of (1) greater assessment and scrutiny of digital health tools (eg, apps) through standardized validated measures and (2) high-quality well-designed RCTs and systematic reviews will assist in building evidence for and ultimately trust in digital tools that can support physiotherapy care  [51] [52] [53] ."

      "title": "Behavior Change",
      "text": "Another aim was to determine the BCTs included in apps and the apps' potential for behavior change. Facilitating patient behavior change is an important aspect of physiotherapy care that may determine the effectiveness of many physiotherapy interventions  [54] [55] [56] . Analysis of target behaviors suggested that the apps included in this review most commonly targeted behaviors linked to recording information about exercise, performing therapeutic exercise, and communicating with a health professional. This is encouraging, as these behaviors are often central to the core aims of many physiotherapeutic interventions  [55, 57] . The most frequently occurring BCTs coded within the included apps were instruction on how to perform a behavior, action planning, self-monitoring of behavior, feedback on behavior, demonstration of the behavior, prompts or cues, and credible source, and these align very well to digital behavior change interventions using apps reported in literature on physical activity in osteoarthritis, various musculoskeletal conditions, and falls prevention exercise  [58] [59] [60] .\n\nThe potential for behavior change (based on ABACUS findings) could only be considered modest, given the mean ABACUS score of 8.5/21 (SD 3.1; 41%) across the 35 apps evaluated. This is similar to a recent comprehensive analysis of mobile apps to support behavior change in patients with a chronic disease or multimorbidity. In that study, mean ABACUS score was 8.07/21 (38%)  [19] . Given that the developers of the ABACUS  [24]  have highlighted that the clinical implications of ABACUS score are still to be determined, it is not possible to determine whether the apps included in this study are effective or not at changing behavior or if they are likely to be effective at improving clinical outcomes from physiotherapy care. Future prospective research is required to evaluate if the apps included in our review can change patient behavior over time."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The study has limitations. The review only analyzed apps in the English language, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Importantly, the search strategy had specific and stringent inclusion or exclusion criteria, which may lead to interpretative bias. For instance, apps had to be directly identifiable as being supportive of care between a patient and their physiotherapist. While several apps in app stores may indirectly support physiotherapy (eg, general exercise or informational apps), these were out of scope. Similarly, our search was based on a specified set of keywords, and thus, retrieval may not have captured all relevant apps. Furthermore, some apps originally identified in the search strategy were not able to be trialed for several reasons such as no free trial readily available, not available in the select region, or no response by developers for limited-time access by the study authors. A similar scenario occurred for apps that were subscription-based. In these cases, free trials were examined where possible, which may have not included full app functionality, thus potentially leading to more conservative quality, BCT, and behavioral potential scores. Regarding app quality, this was not appraised by patients themselves in this study. Should this have occurred, a different version of the MARS, the user-MARS, would have been required  [61] . It is possible that patients may achieve a different quality rating for the apps. This is an area worthy of future research.\n\nIn addition, our protocol involved apps being trialed for a minimum of 10 minutes  [25, 29] . Vaghefi and Tulu  [62]  suggest \"... most users tend to withdraw from mHealth apps before the end of the first week.\" This raises the possibility that engaging with each app for a limited amount of time can make it difficult to get a complete picture of an app, with certain features and BCTs not being immediately apparent. This was observed firsthand in the case of \"My Exercise Messages,\" which scored 14/21 on the ABACUS in this study but scored 17/21 when rated by its developers who are intimately familiar with all the features of the entire 24-week app program  [50] . The discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the more BCTs become apparent, the longer a user engages with the app over 6 months. A similar issue lies in the possibility that important descriptive data about an app may be missed or inaccurate because we relied on limited data sources. For instance, not all the necessary detailed information about an app can be found in the app itself or within its app store description. In select cases, this information may be identifiable if publications about the app exist. However, our protocol was deliberately designed to more closely mimic how a lay user would likely find and interact with an app through an app store. For these reasons, the findings reported in this study may be conservative for some apps, and it is possible that quality and behavior change scores would be higher with proper in-depth use. We thus urge readers to use caution in interpreting our findings.\n\nFinally, this study focused primarily on app descriptive characteristics, quality, BCTs, and behavior change potential. It was not an aim of this review to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of these apps in changing behavior or their efficacy toward improving patient health outcomes."

Research suggests that apps developed by or with health professionals may contribute to improved efficacy and safety, outcomes, and evidence-based care delivered by the apps [45] . However, while this may be true, a counterargument stands that while said to be developed by health professionals, it remains unclear what evidence was used in developing these apps.",
