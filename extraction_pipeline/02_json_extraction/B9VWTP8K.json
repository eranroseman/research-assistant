  "title": "Mobile phone text messaging for promoting adherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment: a systematic review",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile phone text messaging (SMS) has the potential to promote adherence to tuberculosis treatment. This systematic review aims to synthesize current evidence on the effectiveness of SMS interventions in improving patients' adherence to tuberculosis treatment. Methods: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Science Citation Index), reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings, and selected websites for eligible studies available by 15 February 2013; regardless of language or publication status. Two authors independently screened selected eligible studies, and assessed risk of bias in included studies; resolving discrepancies by discussion and consensus. \n Results: We identified four studies that compared the outcomes of the SMS intervention group with controls. Only one of the four studies was a randomized controlled trial. This was conducted in Argentina and the SMS intervention did not significantly improve adherence to tuberculosis treatment compared to self-administration of tuberculosis treatment (risk ratio [RR] 1.49, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.90 to 2.42). One of the non-randomized studies, conducted in South Africa, which compared SMS reminders to directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) reported similar rates of tuberculosis cure (62.35% vs. 66.4%) and treatment success (72.94% vs. 69.4%). A second study from South Africa, utilized SMS reminders when patients delayed in opening their pill bottles and reported increased tuberculosis cure (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.36) and smear conversion (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.42) rates compared to DOTS. In the third non-randomized study, conducted in Kenya, use of SMS reminders increased rates of clinic attendance on scheduled days compared to standard care (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.29). Using the GRADE approach, we rate the quality of the evidence as low, mainly because of the high risk of bias and heterogeneity of effects across studies. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that there is a paucity of high-quality data on the effectiveness of SMS interventions for improving patients' adherence to tuberculosis treatment. The low quality of the current evidence implies that further studies (in particular randomized trials) on the subject are needed. In the interim, if the intervention is implemented outside research settings an impact evaluation is warranted.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health concern, with an estimated 8.7 million incident cases and 1.4 million deaths in 2011  [1] . The burden of TB is highest in 22 low-and middle-income countries; mostly located in sub-Saharan Africa, where TB is fuelled by the HIV/AIDS epidemic  [2] .\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for TB treatment recommend directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) strategy to monitor patient medication adherence  [1, 3] . This strategy includes treating TB using standardized rifampicin-based regimens of six months duration for new TB cases and eight months for retreatment cases. Failure of patients to complete TB treatment results in infectivity, drug resistance, relapse and death  [4] . It is therefore important to find better ways to improving patient adherence to TB treatment.\n\nA variety of factors may impact on patient medication adherence, and thus efforts to improve medication adherence in general are more effective when they address multiple dimensions of adherence behaviours than singletarget interventions  [5, 6] . Several strategies for promoting TB medication adherence have been investigated. These nclude interventions promoting better health care provider-patient communication about adherence; developing or improving existing adherence support services that are offered by a multidisciplinary team (nurse, physician, pharmacy, patient etc.)  [6] ; directly observed therapy (which involves a health care worker, community care worker or family member directly monitoring patients swallowing their TB medication)  [4] ; staff motivation and supervision  [4] ; education and counseling  [7] ; reminder systems and late patient tracers to help patients keep appointments  [8] ; incentives and enablers  [9] ; contracts (that is written or verbal agreements) to return for appointment or course of treatment; and social support to assist the patient in being adherent, provided by community healthcare workers  [10]  or patient groups  [6] . These interventions or complex combinations of the interventions may need to be employed to promote TB medication adherence.\n\nThe number of mobile phone subscriptions is growing worldwide and stood at 6.6 billion at the end of 2012  [11] . In addition, the number of unique mobile phone subscribers at the end of 2012 was estimated to be 3.2 billion, because of the use of on average 1.85 SIM cards per individual and inactive SIM connections being included by operators in their reported global mobile phone subscription totals  [12] . However, the number of mobile phone users has continued to increase and is spreading to the most remote areas in the world. Evidently, the usefulness of mobile phone technology provides healthcare providers with an unprecedented opportunity to target health interventions to people who would otherwise be difficult to reach. Mobile phone text messaging, in particular the short messaging service, may enable healthcare providers to convey health information to patients and engage them in brief conversations. The short messaging service (SMS) has recently been proposed as a means of promoting TB medication adherence. For promoting adherence to TB treatment, text-messages can be sent daily or weekly to patients to remind them to take their medication  [13, 14]  through one way communication or two-way interactive communication (i.e. patients can receive and reply to messages)  [15] [16] [17] . Text-messages may also be used to notify healthcare providers that the patients have taken their medication  [14, 18, 19] . In addition, the text message intervention can be delivered alone or bundled with economic incentives  [14, 19] . We therefore conducted a review of the current best evidence for the use of mobile phone text messaging to promote patients' adherence to TB treatment  [20] ."

Finally, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach  [25, 26]  to assess to the quality of evidence for the effectiveness of the SMS intervention. This method results in an assessment of the quality of the body of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. Evidence is considered of high quality if \"further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect\", and moderate quality if \"further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate\". Low quality evidence implies that \"further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate\", and very low quality that \"we have very little confidence in the effect estimate\"."

      "text": "We provide detailed information of included studies in Table  2 , and summarize key features below. The non-governmental organization Bridges.org conducted a pilot study in South Africa in which daily SMS reminders were used to remind patients who self-administer their medication (i.e. not on DOTS) to take their drugs  [37] . The pilot study started in January 2002 and as of March 2005 had enrolled over 300 new smear positive TB patients at the clinic, with more than 280 having completed their 6-month course of anti-tuberculosis therapy (or 8-month course for retreatment TB). Health outcome data were only available for 221 TB patients. The health outcomes data for the 221 TB patients receiving SMS reminders were compared with that of controls (all smearpositive patients attending clinic-based DOTS who had health outcomes data for the third quarter of 2003). Bridges.org did not report the number of controls. This precluded the calculation of a risk ratio and its confidence intervals for this review. Bridges.org found the SMS intervention and the clinic-based DOTS groups were similar with regard to rates of TB cure (62.35% vs. 66.4%) and treatment success (72.94% vs. 69.4%); but the rate of completion of TB treatment was slightly higher in the SMS intervention group compared to the clinic-based DOTS group (10.59% vs. 3.0%). Bridges.org believed that the pilot produced similar results that are normal for the clinic but did not demonstrate a significant improvement. Numerous issues were attributed to the lack of additional benefit of the SMS reminders. These included problems in monitoring treatment adherence; lack of ownership of the service at the clinic due to the lack of proactive participation of staff; lack of regular feedback and interaction among all stakeholders and the fact that a significant number of patients failed to use the service as instructed.\n\nBridges.org also evaluated patient satisfaction with the SMS intervention among 26 participants using structured questionnaires. The study authors found that most patients were satisfied with the SMS reminders. The patients reported feeling \"good to think nurses at the clinic care enough to SMS you every morning\" and feeling \"more connected to the clinic than usual\", and one patient felt that she/he \"would definitely forget to take my tablets if I didn't get an SMS from the clinic  [37] .\n\nBroomhead and Mars  [38]  conducted a retrospective analysis of a 2005 pilot study of smear positive TB patients commencing a 6-month course of anti-tuberculosis therapy in South Africa, in which health outcomes in patients given a wireless pill bottle (SIMpill\u00ae) that sends an SMS to a central server notifying it of the patient taking their medication (plus standard DOTS) were compared with matched controls who received standard DOTS only. Frequency matching was utilized to match participants from the pilot study with controls in a 1: 4 ratio. We analyzed participants according to whether or not they received SMS reminders. Rates of sputum smear conversion and TB cure were provided for two scenarios. Scenario one included all 24 participants who took part in the pilot and their 96 controls. Scenario two excluded 6 participants that took part in the pilot but who subsequently died, along with their 24 matched controls, thereby reducing the cohorts to 18 participants from the pilot and their 72 controls. We used health outcomes data from scenario one for this systematic review. The study found significantly higher sputum smear conversion rates among those who received standard DOTS in combination with SIMpill\u00ae than those who received only standard DOTS (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.42). The study also found significantly higher TB cure rates in the SIMpill\u00ae -DOTS group than in the DOTs only group (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.36). These findings suggest that there was improved treatment adherence when using SIMpill\u00ae in combination with standard DOTS than when using standard DOTS alone  [38] .\n\nOwiti and colleagues  [39] , in a pilot feasibility study from Kenya, assessed the use of SMS reminders to improve clinic appointment compliance.

Interventions Intervention: MAS system. It consists of a device that attaches to the standard pill bottle or blister pack and sends an SMS every time the patient opens the bottle to a Web-base application. This is taken as a proxy for TB treatment adherence. Control: DOTS-only controls Outcomes Health outcomes (i.e. smear conversion rate and TB cure rate) served as a proxy for TB treatment adherence MAS group: Smear conversion rate = 62.5% TB cure rate = 75.0% Control group: Smear conversion rate = 38.4% TB cure rate = 32.3% Both the smear conversion rate and TB cure rate were significantly higher for the MAS group compared with the control group Smear conversion rate: RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.09-2.42) TB cure rate: RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.60 -3.36) Notes Study ID Iribarren [40] Methods A parallel design randomized control pilot study Participants 37 newly diagnosed TB patients (18 in the intervention group and 19 in the control group)\n\nappointment attendance were compared between patients receiving and those not receiving (for technical reasons) SMS reminders. The text messages were sent in Ki-Swahili one day prior to their clinic appointments using Frontline SMS platform. We took the rate of clinic appointment attendance on scheduled days as a proxy for adherence. In this study, 150 patients received at least one SMS reminder and 37 did not receive an SMS. Those who received an SMS reminder were 1.6 times more likely to adhere to scheduled clinic appointment compared to those who did not (95% CI 1.06 to 2.29)  [39] . Iribarren and colleagues  [40] , in a pilot parallel design randomized control study among newly diagnosed TB patients commencing anti-tuberculosis treatment in Argentina, randomly assigned 19 patients to standard care (self-administration of medication) and 18 to the intervention arm. The intervention arm received standard care and a SMS-based intervention which included instructing patients to \"text-in\" after self-administration of medication; delivery of SMS reminders when patient did not \"text in\"; and receipt of a bi-weekly SMS providing educational information and the option to consult during the first two-month intensive treatment phase. Educational text messages were selected based on the Informational-Motivational-Behavioral Skills Model. Text messages were sent using FrontlineSMS, which is a free automated SMS platform. The outcome of interest for this systematic review was self-reported adherence (as measured using notification rates over a 60-day period for the intervention arm and receipt of medication calendars at 60 days for the control arm). The analysis was by intention to treat. At 60 days, patients in the intervention group had a higher self-reported adherence rate than those in the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.42)  [40] ."

In two studies we used treatment outcomes as a proxy for treatment adherence while in the remaining two, we assessed treatment adherence by notification rate and clinic appointments respectively. For random sequence generation, the RCT was judged to have an unclear risk of bias because the study did not describe the process used to generate the randomization sequence. For allocation concealment, the RCT was judged to have an unclear risk of bias because the method used to conceal treatment allocation was not described. The blinding of participants and personnel was not reported in the RCT and the study was judged to have an unclear risk of bias for this component. The blinding of outcome assessors was not specified in any of the studies and the risk of bias being introduced to the studies at the time of outcome assessment was judged to be unclear. Regarding completeness of outcome data, one study was judged to have an unclear risk of bias because it was unclear whether the proportion of missing data was balanced across intervention groups. Two studies were judged to have a low risk of bias because there were no missing data. One study was judged to have a high risk of bias because no data were missing in the intervention group but 47.3% (9/19) of data were missing in the control group. This information was obtained from email communication with the study authors. Two studies had selective reporting of outcomes and were judged to have a high risk of bias. One study had inadequate information provided on selective outcome reporting and was judged to have an unclear risk of bias, while another had no selective outcome reporting and was judged to be at low risk of bias. Given the observational nature of three of the included studies, there might be other confounding variables not accounted for in the analyses. Therefore, these studies were not judged to be free from other sources of bias. For the included RCT, the lack of description of the random sequence generation process and the method of allocation concealment suggests that there might be other confounding variables not accounted for in the analysis. We provided a detailed analysis of the risk of bias in Table  3  and Figure  2 ."

      "text": "Four studies with a total of 565 participants were included in this systematic review. Three studies were observational in nature and only one was a randomized controlled trial.\n\nA meta-analysis could not be performed because there was significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity in the included studies. Overall, the included studies suggest that patients receiving mobile phone text messaging interventions had rates of adherence to TB treatment comparable to or higher than those receiving no intervention. Therefore, the findings provide mixed evidence for the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging interventions designed to promote adherence to TB treatment. Though the evidence is mixed, we cannot ignore the potential of mobile phone text messaging to transform the delivery of health messages to patients. Mobile phones have spread globally; 45% of the world's population were estimated to have access to a mobile phone at the end of 2012  [12, 44] . In addition, the use of SMS has become popular throughout the world. Globally, there were an estimated 5.9 trillion SMS messages sent in 2011 and SMS traffic is expected to reach 9.4 trillion messages by 2016  [45, 46] . This increasingly popular mode of communication can be used to deliver short health messages to people anywhere and provide interactive feedback and support to people when they need it the most. Previous research has shown that SMS interventions are effective as a means to promote multiple healthy behaviors such as adherence to antiretroviral treatment  [13] , diabetes management and control  [47] , smoking cessation  [48] , and immunization compliance  [49] [50] [51] . We have found that currently available research utilizing SMS interventions to promote adherence to TB treatment is inconclusive."

The implication of the low-quality evidence is that further improved quality research (in particular RCTs) is needed to enhance our level of certainty in the effectiveness of SMS interventions to improve adherence to TB treatment.

In contrast, there is relatively more peer-reviewed literature available on the use of SMS-based platforms for improving adherence to antiretroviral treatment  [13, 55]  A systematic review published in 2012 that included two RCTs on the use of mobile phone text messages to promote antiretroviral medication adherence found that weekly mobile phone text messaging significantly improved adherence to antiretroviral medication in HIV infected patients, compared to standard care  [13] . However, an RCT from Cameroon published in the same year that was not included in the aforementioned systematic review found that standardized motivational text messaging did not significantly improve adherence to antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected patients, compared to standard care  [55] . Studies investigating the use of SMS interventions as an aid to promoting adherence to medication in resource-limited settings will need to take into account barriers such as low-literacy levels; language barriers; lack of access to the owner of a mobile phone given that sharing of mobile phones is common in many places; restrictions on the content of text messages; issues such as habituation and the ignoring of messages when text messages are delivered too frequently; privacy and disclosure issues; poor mobile phone service provision  [17, 56, 57] ; the inability of mobile phone users to charge their phones due to lack of electricity; the inability to buy pre-paid phone cards; and the high incidence of mobile phone theft and phone number changes in some parts of the world."

Future studies should have standardized outcome measures such as TB cure, successful completion of TB treatment, and development of drug resistance. Considered in this systematic review but not found, is the potential for stigmatization and disclosure that are inherent risks in this kind of intervention. These (perceived) risks may undermine efficacy and acceptability and should therefore be studied. In addition, future studies need to pay attention to the reporting of the delivery of the intervention i.e. length of messages, content of messages, timing of messages, frequency of messages, SMS platform used to send messages (automated versus manual), and two-way versus one-way communication. These factors may influence efficacy, acceptability, cost, and scale up. Although mobile phone text messaging is attractive in that it is relatively inexpensive, cost of development, implementation and maintenance needs to be considered and weighed against effectiveness. In addition, since RCTs are the gold standard for testing the effect of an intervention, it would be useful to see more RCTs on this subject. It is encouraging that three RCTs are currently underway in Canada, Pakistan and China  [41] [42] [43] ."

To conclude that such an intervention is effective is difficult because there is a paucity of high-quality studies. The current evidence is of low quality implying that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effectiveness of this intervention and is likely to change the magnitude of the estimate of effect. The results of the systematic review also lay an important foundation on which future studies can build upon. Future studies (in particular RCTs) should be of robust methodology, well reported and interventions optimized in order to establish their benefit. We will update this systematic review when new evidence emerges from the three ongoing studies."
