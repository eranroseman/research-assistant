  "title": "A coaching program to improve dietary intake of patients with CKD: ENTICE-CKD",
  "abstract": "Background: The dietary self-management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging. Telehealth interventions may provide an effective delivery method to facilitate sustained dietary change. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated secondary and exploratory outcomes following a dietitian-led telehealth coaching intervention to improve diet quality in people with stage 3-4 CKD. The intervention group received phone calls every 2 weeks for 3 months (with concurrent tailored text messages for 3 months), followed by 3 months of tailored text-messaged without telephone coaching, to encourage a diet consistent with CKD guidelines. The control group received usual care for 3 months followed by non-tailored educational text messages for 3 months. Results: Eighty participants (64% male), aged 62\u00b112 years were randomized to the intervention or control group. Telehealth coaching was safe, with no adverse events or changes to serum biochemistry at any time point. At 3 months, the telehealth intervention, compared with the control, had no detectable effect on overall diet quality on the Alternative Health Eating Index (+3.2 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.3 to +7.7), nor at 6 months +0.5 (95% CI -4.6, +5.5). There was no change in clinic blood pressure at any time point in any group. There were significant improvements in several exploratory diet and clinical outcomes, including core food group consumption, vegetable serves, fiber intake and body weight. Conclusions: Telehealth coaching was safe, but appeared to have no effect on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index or clinic blood pressure. There were clinically significant changes in several exploratory diet and clinical outcomes which require further investigation.",

      "text": "Dietary modification is a key management strategy in CKD to treat electrolyte abnormalities and potentially prevent CKD progression and cardiovascular events.  1, 2 It is also considered to be a top research priority by clinicians, patients and caregivers.  3 However, patients frequently experience dietary management as overwhelming, difficult to follow, and report contradictory messages that thwart implementation.  4 e majority of dietary interventions for pre-dialysis CKD patients are delivered in one-off dietary education sessions, without ongoing follow up.  5  Telephone coaching is a basic form of telehealth shown to be effective at promoting adherence to complex dietary recommendations in chronic disease.  6 Telephone coaching in combination with one-on-one support can reduce dietary sodium intake  7  and increase knowledge of self-management behavior in people with CKD.  8  M-Health, also falls under the definition of telehealth, but extends more broadly to the use of mobile phones for healthcare delivery, is perceived as flexible and cost-effective  9  and has improved diet quality in people with coronary heart disease.  10 While there has been no telehealth intervention demonstrated to effectively support diet quality improvements in CKD, recent patient engagement studies suggest that people with CKD are open to using telephone and m-health methods for their dietary self-management.  11, 12 However, it is uncertain whether telehealth coaching interventions can improve diet quality in people with stage 3-4 CKD.\n\nA pilot randomized controlled trial (ENTICE-CKD study) recently demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a telehealth-delivered intervention to improve dietary self-management.  13 ghty participants were randomized to the intervention and control group, with 4% attrition and 96% of all coaching calls completed to protocol. All participants in the intervention arm (100%) believed the tailored text messages were useful in supporting their dietary selfmanagement. Sixty-nine percent of participants in the control group felt that the non-tailored text messages were useful in supporting diet change. Participants viewed the intervention as an acceptable, personalized alternative to face-face clinic consultations, and were satisfied with the frequency of contact.  13 This current study aims to evaluate the secondary and exploratory outcomes ENTICE-CKD telehealth coaching intervention to improve diet quality in people with stage 3-4 CKD."

Participants randomized to the intervention group completed the telehealth intervention in two phases. The first phase involved individualized, telephone-based coaching from a dietitian (referred to as coaches) every 2 weeks for 3 months (6 calls total), with weekly tailored text messages (detailed in Table  1 ) delivered within a set protocol at a frequency determined by the participant. Phase 2 of the intervention involved no further telephone coaching calls, however participants continued to receive the same tailored text messages as phase 1 at a different frequency (Table  1 )."

The content of the text messages was based on improving dietary quality as per the Australian Dietary Guidelines 17 and the Kidney Health Australia Caring for Australasians with a Renal Impairment guidelines.  18 Although these text messages are not considered 'usual care', they were utilized as a retention mechanism, and to generate hypotheses around the potential benefit of tailored text-messages compared to nontailored text messages to improve dietary intake in CKD."

Categorical outcomes were assessed by the standard chi-square test.\n\nGiven the small amount of missing data across the sample (<10%), all analyses were performed using an available case analysis. As a form of sensitivity analysis, we also performed intention to treat using the last-value carried forward technique. Both this and the available case analyses reported the same overall statistical (and point-estimate) significance (data available on request). There were no further subgroup or additional analyses completed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 22.0. Chicago: SPSS Inc.), with a 2-sided p value (\u2264 0.05) considered statistically significant. The economic evaluation was conducted using the mean costs and the health outcomes of 1) QALYs gained over 3 months, and 2) the proportion of participants achieving a 5-point improvement in diet quality over 3 months. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per QALY gained, and the incremental cost per additional patient achieving a meaningful improvement in diet quality, using the following formula."

      "text": "This paper aimed to evaluate the secondary and exploratory outcomes of the ENTICE-CKD telehealth coaching intervention to improve diet quality in people with stage 3-4 CKD. The intervention was established to be safe, but did not lead to result in a significant improvement in the secondary outcome of diet quality, as measured by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index, or clinic blood pressure at any time point. There were a number of exploratory dietary outcomes which did significantly improve following intensive telehealth coaching, including energy intake from the core food groups and vegetables and dietary fiber intake, compared to controls at 3 months. It is important to not overstate the intervention effects observed as a large number of secondary and exploratory outcomes were examined in this pilot study with a small number showing statistically significant effects (some of which could be by chance), and notably, the majority of these effects were not sustained at the 6-month conclusion of the study. As the examination of dietary outcomes was a secondary aim of the ENTICE-CKD study, it was underpowered to detect meaningful change in these outcomes. However, these observed effects in diet and clinical outcomes highlight the potential to examine this further in larger, adequately powered clinical trials.\n\nAlthough the intervention group improved their overall diet quality compared to their baseline intake, there was no statistically significant difference in comparison to the control group at any time-point. Whilst noting that the study was underpowered, it is interesting that the mean intervention effect at 3 months equated to an improvement in Alternative Healthy Eating Index score of approximately \u00bc standard deviation (SD) in favor of the intervention group, with the 95% confidence intervals encompassing effects in the order of up to half a standard deviation improvement. Whilst not statistically significant effect, the observed within-group changes in intervention participants' Alternative Healthy Eating Index scores are consistent with the minimal clinically important changes suggested to translate to reduced risk of morbidity and mortality.  27 It is also plausible that participants' high diet quality at baseline (in both study groups) resulted in ceiling effects, limiting the magnitude of improvement possible through further dietary intervention. In fact, both study groups at a baseline had a mean Alternative Healthy Eating Index score that would be in the highest quintile in observational studies, which have demonstrated kidney and cardiovascular benefit with diet quality.  19, 28 proving vegetable and fiber intake are important characteristics of diet quality.  29 In our study, medium to large (d >0.5) statistically significant effects were observed for these exploratory outcomes. In an Australian cohort study, consuming more vegetables and fruit was shown to be associated with a 65% lower risk of death over a 4-year follow-up in stage 3-4 CKD.  30  In the only available randomized trial, people with stage 4 CKD randomized to an intervention targeting higher vegetable and fruit intakes, had lower rates of metabolic acidosis, and greater reductions in blood pressure and body weight compared to a standard sodium bicarbonate prescription over a 5-year follow up period.  32 Intervention group participants significantly increased their consumption of dietary fiber by over 6g per day at 3 months to exceed the 30g per day as recommended in current guidelines.  33 Meta-analysis in CKD populations has shown that dietary fiber consumption of approximately 27g/day can significantly reduce serum urea and creatinine levels.  34 Long-term exposure to a diet higher in fiber may also reduce inflammation and mortality risk.  35 ood pressure is a controllable risk factor for CKD progression, but was unchanged throughout the study. Intervention participants did reduce their overall antihypertensive medication pill burden at 3-months, which may reflect a possible benefit of improving blood pressure control in CKD. For example, the efficacy of some antihypertensive medications (notably Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers) are enhanced with effective sodium restriction.  37, 38 As sodium reduction was observed in both study groups, the reduction in antihypertensive medication prescriptions in the intervention group may have attenuated a potential change in blood pressure which we could attribute to the intervention itself. However, antihypertensive medication burden was only an exploratory outcome and therefore this is not conclusive.\n\nExcessive weight gain carries a higher burden of cardiovascular risk and CKD progression.  39 ile weight change was an exploratory outcome and not a focus of the intervention, the magnitude of change (-1.9kg) was similar to that of two recent diet and physical activity randomized trials, in which both studies demonstrated a weight loss of 1.8kg in 4 month and 12 month interventions.  40, 41 Although the intervention effect on weight was statistically significant, this magnitude of weight loss is unlikely to be associated with clinical benefit, with weight losses of at least 5% of body weight associated with improvements in health outcomes.  44 e tailored telehealth program (phone coaching plus text-messages) was both less costly and more effective at 3 months for improving diet quality compared to the control group. We were unable to analyze the 6-month cost-effectiveness of the ENTICE-CKD program, as the tailored telehealth intervention was delivered in 2 phases, both of which had different interventions (in both the intervention and control). While this is a promising finding, a larger study with greater participant numbers is needed to confirm the cost effectiveness of the intervention.\n\nThis study has important limitations to consider. Firstly, the ENTICE-CKD study was primarily designed to test the intervention's feasibility.  25 As such, the dietary outcomes were nominated as secondary outcomes and all clinical outcomes were exploratory to generate hypotheses for future studies. Secondly, reliable comparisons to usual care can only be drawn at 3 months, as our delayed contact control participants received an active intervention from 3 to 6 months. It is therefore unclear whether a longer-term lower intensity intervention, such as the non-tailored education-only text messages, may lead to similar results as observed in the tailored intervention over 6 months which could be more cost-effective. Thirdly, instead of using standard 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, clinic blood pressure was measured as a pragmatic approach to align with routine clinical practice. Finally, the majority of participants reported following a healthy diet at baseline, as reflected in their high baseline diet quality score rating (above the median of 'high adherence' in population studies) and dietary sodium intake (in line with the suggested 100mmol/day), which raises the possibility of healthy volunteer bias and diminished potential for benefit from dietary intervention in a more representative cohort.\n\nIn conclusion, telehealth coaching appeared to have no effect on overall diet quality (as measured by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index) or clinic blood pressure at any time point, compared to usual care. Other exploratory markers of diet quality were improved, including the energy intake from the core food groups, number of servings of vegetables, dietary fiber and reduction of body weight at 3 months. All of these outcomes were exploratory, so there remains uncertainty in the findings which require further investigation. The findings from this study can be used to inform hypotheses for future telehealth coaching interventions to initiate and sustain improvements in dietary intake across the complexity of dietary recommendations for patients with CKD. study.\n\nTable  1 .
