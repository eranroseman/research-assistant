  "title": "Patient Phenotypes Help Explain Variation in Response to a Social Gamification Weight Loss Intervention",
  "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to determine latent classes of study participants using baseline characteristics, explore the patterns within the groups, and determine whether the intervention had differential effects on weight loss across the groups. Design: Secondary analysis of a completed randomized clinical trial. Setting: Participants in a gamification intervention with social incentives who were recruited as pairs and given an intervention for 24 weeks. Participants were randomized to control, gamification, or gamification with primary care physician sharing arms. Participants: All 196 participants in the Lose It trial (recruited as 98 pairs). Measures: Outcome variable-participants' weight change after 24 and 36 weeks. Factors-intervention arm and latent class. Analysis: Latent class analysis on both participants' and teams' characteristics. This was followed by 1-sample t tests of weight at 24 and 36 weeks, stratified by latent class. Results: Three groups of participants were identified: \"Kin teams,\" \"Distant teams,\" and \"Married teams.\" \"Kin teams\" lost more weight after the intervention in the gamification and gamification with PCP sharing arms. The \"Distant teams\" lost similar amounts of weight in all 3 arms but did not keep it off during maintenance. The \"Married teams\" lost the most weight across all 3 arms and kept it off following the intervention. Conclusions: Patient phenotypes can identify variations in response to a gamification weight loss intervention. Future intervention studies may benefit from leveraging this during participant recruitment and allocation.",

      "text": "Obesity is associated with major health complications, including coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and cancer.  1  Fortunately, a large number of studies have been efficacious in helping participants lose weight.  [2] [3] ] [4] [5]  However, the increasing amount of potential interventions, some of which are mutually exclusive, complicates the question of what intervention to deliver to which people-there is likely no single best intervention for all people. As such, different interventions may work best for different people in systematic ways. These systematic differences can be examined through subgroups.\n\nSubgroup analyses in randomized clinical trials determine the optimal treatment for a given patient or set of patients by estimating how that group would have done if given a specific intervention compared to other interventions. Because of the counterfactual nature of these claims, there is no straightforward diagnostic criteria to determine whether patients received the optimal intervention. Methods exist to determine the best subgroups for interventions, particularly when examining a large group of covariates, in what is known as \"precision medicine.\"  6 These include using a composite prognostic score  7  and determining the optimal subgroup one variable at a time.  8 owever, these approaches have issues and do not always identify the best intervention.  9 Specifically, the one-variableat-a-time approach may lead to conclusions that are in opposition, leading to unclear inferences. Composite prognostic scores are prone to overfitting even with large sample sizes (although this can be ameliorated with cross-validation), and they do not accurately identify the optimal treatment.\n\nA different approach that avoids many of these issues is using latent class analysis.  10, 11 In it, a set of characteristics used to group participants into distinct classes or groups. Importantly, the outcome effect is not included in the model fitting, so participants are sorted into groups without consideration of their outcomes. In this way, the main limitations of the other approaches are limited-incorporating all the variables simultaneously removes the possibility for conflicting conclusions, and using a single summary variable as the outcome reduces the possibility of overfitting. Via this method, participants exhibit a phenotype, and patients with these different phenotypes may differentially respond to an intervention. These phenotypes are the set of values across the characteristics of interest, and patients with similar phenotypes, or sets of values, can then be grouped together due to this similarity. In such a way can a suite of variables be used to identify and define subgroups, leading to important behavioral insights about each group and about why each group respond the way they do to the interventions.\n\nIn this study, we therefore demonstrate the approach of phenotyping to determine an optimal intervention in study participants. We use the population from a recent study, which used gamification and data sharing with primary care physician (PCP) to facilitate participant teams, each comprising 2 people, to lose weight. The study found that although all participants on average reduced their weight during the course of the study, there were no significant differences in the average weight loss across arms of the study.  12 However, this trial showed that some participants and their partners lost large amounts of weight indicating that the interventions may have been more effective in some subpopulation(s). Therefore, the data from this trial represent a rich source of information to understand what characteristics of people and their partners predicts increased weight loss from an intervention such as this. The goal of this study was to identify phenotypes based on participants' baseline characteristics, describe these phenotypes, and examine if they led to differential responses to the intervention arms of the trial."

      "text": "The Lose It trial was a behavioral intervention with gamification incentives.  12 Participants were recruited as pairs. Pairs were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) control, (2) gamification, and (3) gamification with PCP sharing. In short, gamification indicates that participants did not receive anything of monetary value instead received points that indicated their status in a purely virtual setting. Participants in both intervention arms were given weekly weight goals declining linearly over the 24-week period of the study. Participants were followed for an additional 12 weeks (36 weeks total) without the intervention to examine whether they retained the weight loss.\n\nIn the gamification arm, participants were given 70 points at the beginning of each week, on Monday. Each day, 1 member of the team was chosen randomly. If that participant reported their weight that day and met their goal, the team lost no points, otherwise they lost 10 points. At the end of the week, if the team had at least 40 points, and both participants met their weight goal at least 1 day that week, the team advanced a level (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum). If they did not, then they dropped a level.\n\nIn the arm with PCP sharing, participants also had their data shared with their PCP. If the participant had a PCP within the University of Pennsylvania Health System, their daily weight was shared with their PCP daily via an app, but the PCP only saw the participant's weight when accessing the app. For those with PCPs outside the health system, letters were sent to the PCP monthly including the participant's lowest weight and average steps. For more information on the study design of the Lose It trial including the rationale for each of the decisions, and the full study protocol, see Kurtzman et al.  12  Ethical approval was obtained through the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania (approval #832816). Because this was a secondary data analysis, participants were not provided informed consent."

Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 to 70 years, had a selfreported body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater, had an iPhone, and had a family member or friend interested in participating with them. Participants were asked to form teams of 2 with a family member or friend.\n\nNot all participants uploaded data throughout the entire study. At 24 weeks, 20 (16.4%) of the 196 participants did not report their weight. To maintain a full sample, the weight of these participants was imputed via multiple imputation using the MICE package in R.  13  Five imputations were conducted using the following predictors of missing data: baseline weight, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, household income, self-reported health, stage of change, and social support score. Results were combined using Rubins standard rules.  13 To ensure that our results were not strongly influenced by the imputation, we replicated the analyses on only the participants with complete data (Online Supplement)."

      "text": "The main outcome of the study was weight change at 24 weeks. Weight was measured via a wireless scale provided to each participant when joining the study. The secondary outcome was weight change at 36 weeks.\n\nIn addition to demographic questions, participants were asked a series of questions relating to their relationship with their teammate. These included the type of relationship (eg, spouse, kin, and friend) and whether they lived together. Participants were also asked how often they saw their teammate, with answers consisting of \"Always,\" \"Frequently,\" \"Sometimes,\" \"Rarely,\" and \"Never,\" which was used as a proxy for the closeness between teammates. Participants were also asked about their intention to lose weight based on the transtheoretical model.  14 Specifically, patients were asked: \"Have you been trying to lose weight?\" and could answer \"Yes, I have been trying for more than 6 months\"; \"Yes, I have been trying, but for less than 6 months\"; \"No, but I intend to in the next 30 days\"; No, but I intend to in the next 6 months\"; or \"No, and I do not intend to in the next 6 months.\"\n\nParticipants were also given the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey.  15 This instrument contained 19 questions across 4 subscales. However, within the tangible and affectionate support subscales, over one-half of participants had the maximum score. As such, there was not enough variation within these 2 subscales, so we used the standard overall support index comprising all 4 subscales. This metric therefore ranged from 0 to 100, and 31 participants had the maximum value of 100."

      "title": "Analysis",
      "text": "We first determined groups using a latent class analysis (LCA) comprising age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, whether and for how long participants had been trying to lose weight, social support score, frequency of seeing their teammate, the participant's relationship with their teammate for each participant, and baseline BMI (N \u00bc 196). Because LCA can only fit categorical variables, and using categorical variables in a latent profile analysis (which allows continuous variables) can have a disproportional effect on the resulting classes,  16  each continuous variable was divided into tertiles.  17 he LCA models require specifying the number of classes fit as an input; deciding the optimal number of classes requires selection. To this end, we fit LCA models with 1 to 5 classes. The best-fitting model was selected based on a combination of the sample-adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the average uncertainty,  18  the entropy,  19  and the size of the smallest class using a holistic approach, as no model was uniformly the best (Table  1 ).  20 The BIC is a general indicator of model fit, which penalizes a model for complexity. The uncertainty for each participant in the model is equal to the second-lowest posterior probability in the model, which gives an estimate of how \"confident\" the model is on its assignments. The entropy is a measure of how much information is added for each additional observation; it is maximized when groups are equally sized and minimized when all observations are in 1 group. The size of the smallest group is an indicator to ensure that each group's characteristics are interpretable and not unduly affected by a few members within the group.\n\nBecause of the possibility of social influence and intrateam dynamics affecting treatment response, characteristics of teams, rather than just individual participants, were of interest.  21, 22 For this, we conducted a LCA using age, sex, race/ ethnicity, education, marital status, stage of change, social support score, frequency of seeing each other, the relationship between teammates, and baseline weight. For continuous variables (ie, age, social support, and baseline weight), the values were summed for each team. For categorical variables, the teammates' responses were assessed for concordance (eg, whether both teammates of the same sex), as this would indicate similarity between teammates, and summing categorical variables would not have intrinsic meaning.  23 ollowing the determination of the latent groups, we characterized each group by characteristics that were either highly over-or underrepresented in each group. To do so, we compared the percentage of each category in a variable for each class relative to the percentage in the whole population. If the ratio was above 1.5 or below 0.67, that category in that class was deemed over-or underrepresented, respectively. The values 1.5 and 0.67 were chosen as a first attempt in designing a systematic way to describe latent classes rather than the arbitrary selection of 1 or 2 variables as has been done previously.  11 hese characterizations were compiled and holistically examined to describe each class.\n\nFinally, we examined whether participants or participant teams lost weight during the 24 weeks of the study, whether they maintained any weight loss after 36 weeks, and whether this varied by latent group and trial arm. To that end, we stratified that participants according to latent group and conducted 1-sample t tests for the weight loss after 24 weeks with a null hypothesis of no weight change. We conducted the same t tests using weight change at 36 weeks as an outcome. Statistical tests between the groups were not conducted due to a lack of power, and significant results would be at increased risk of being false positives.  24 Instead, we qualitatively discuss the trends in weight loss across the groups. All analyses were performed using R version 3.5.2."

      "text": "The demographics of the 196 participants can be seen in Table  2 . Participants were predominantly female, white, and non-Hispanic. Age ranged from 18 to 69. Most participants had a social support score of at least 4. All participants were at least contemplating reducing their weight and 48% had already commenced doing so. Baseline weight ranged from 160 to 369 pounds. Seventeen percent of the participants were married to their teammate; 22% were kin; and the rest were \"Other,\" often friends.\n\nAfter examining the BIC, model uncertainty, and entropy, the 3-class model was selected for the individual participants (Table  2 , right 3 columns). Groups 1, 2, and 3 comprised 46, 116, and 34 participants, respectively. The general trends in each group can be seen in Table  3 . Group 1 was characterized by being younger, nonwhite, having teammates who were not their spouse, and a higher baseline weight.\n\nGroup 2 was characterized by being female, having teammates who were not their spouse, infrequently seeing their teammate, and a lower baseline weight. Group 3 was characterized by a large proportion of males, being married, having a spouse as their teammate, having high social support, seeing their teammate all the time, and being in an advanced state of change. Based on their characteristics, we refer to the 3 groups as \"Kin teams,\" \"Distant teams,\" and \"Married teams,\" respectively.\n\nThe 3 groups had varied weight loss responses to the 3 trial arms after 24 weeks (Figure  1 ). Group 1, or \"Kin teams,\" had no change on average in the control group (0.31 lbs gained, 95% confidence intervals: \u00c05.62 to 6.24) but lost weight in both the gamification and gamification with PCP sharing arms (although not significantly different from 0 in the latter case). Group 2, or \"Distant teams,\" lost similar amounts of weight in all 3 arms (4.30, 4.07, and 3.67 lbs in control, gamification, and gamification with PCP sharing, respectively). Group 3, or \"Married teams,\" lost similar amount of weight in the control and gamification with PCP sharing arms (6.49 and 6.04 lbs, respectively) but a large amount of weight in the gamification arm (15.07 lbs).\n\nThe 3 groups also had different weight change profiles after 36 weeks (Figure  2 ). Following the maintenance period, \"Kin teams\" participants in the gamification arm lost additional weight, participants in the control arm kept their weight similar, and participants in the gamification with PCP sharing gained small amounts of weight, on average. \"Distant teams,\" comprising participants with lower social support who were less close to their teammate and generally in Preparation or Contemplation stages, moved toward their baseline weight in a The third, fifth, and seventh columns also show the descriptive characteristics of the 3 groups following the LCA.

The \"Kin teams\" and \"Married teams\" had the exact same inferences at both 24 and 36 weeks. The \"Distant teams\" had a significant response to the gamification arm at 24 weeks and no significant weight loss in any arm at 36 weeks.\n\nThe analysis of participant teams resulted in a best fit of the 2 groups, which largely divided the teams who were married to one another from those who were not. This division was similar to separating out \"Married teams\" in the analysis of individuals and did not contribute additional information. As such, the results of this analysis are not shown."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this study, 196 participants in 98 team pairs were divided into distinct groups based on their baseline characteristics, and these groups experienced differential weight loss over 24 weeks of intervention and 12 weeks of maintenance across 3 study arms. Individual participants were classified into 3 groups, with distinct characteristics. Participants who were married to their teammate composed one of the groups and were different from the study population based on a number of characteristics. Furthermore, these participants appeared particularly receptive to the gamification arm, with each participant losing an average of 15 lbs (3 times the average lost for the arm as a whole).\n\nThe 3 groups had distinct characteristics. The largest group (\"Distant teams\") was composed of younger women who saw their teammate less often than the population as a whole. This last point is important, as it likely affected how they responded to the intervention. Members of this group lost similar amounts of weight irrespective of their treatment arm. This indicates that the group was motivated to lose weight, but neither gamification nor PCP sharing increased their weight loss over their intrinsic motivation. People alter their behavior and perceptions more strongly based on those with whom they interact more frequently.  25 Although all participants in the gamification arm received the same incentives and penalties, the frequency Abbreviation: BMI, body mass index. a A variable was counted as \"defining\" if the relative frequency of that value was >1.5 times or <0.67 times the frequency in the total participant population. Distinct trends across categories of a variable were also counted as defining (eg, no single BMI category was beyond the bounds for group 2, but there was a lower frequency of those with a BMI of over 38, and a higher frequency of those with a BMI <3). of contact likely influenced their efficacy. Because this group did not frequently see their teammate or their PCP during the study, the salience of these external factors would have been low, leading to no additional effect of the intervention. Additionally, members of the \"Distant teams\" group gained weight on average between 24 and 36 weeks, indicating they gained back some of the weight lost during the intervention period. The lack of salience of not seeing their teammates often during the maintenance period would therefore have removed almost all external motivation to keep the weight off, leading to some weight gain."

      "text": "The \"Kin teams,\" on the other hand, had a very different pattern, losing no weight on average in the control arm but losing weight in the gamification and the gamification with PCP sharing arms. \"Kin teams\" as a group comprised participants who were older, educated, female, and were already engaged in losing weight. Recent work has found that women name accountability as an important facilitator in weight loss, which is exactly what the gamification arm provided in the form of accountability to one's teammate and additionally to one's PCP in the PCP sharing arm.  26 This accountability to one's teammate, rather than PCP, also indicates why this group may have lost additional weight during the maintenance period, as one's partner was still pertinent. Whereas in the gamification with PCP sharing arm, teammates may have balanced the accountability between their partner and the PCP during the study, but the lack of accountability to one's PCP during the maintenance period reduced their external motivation to maintain their lost weight.\n\nThe final group, the \"Married teams,\" was composed mostly of people married to their teammate, which included a large number of men. In many ways, these participants were the opposite of \"Distant teams\" and had high social support and saw their teammate very frequently (unsurprisingly given this was their spouse). Although these participants lost weight on average in all study arms, and the gamification arm was the most effective. It is possible that these participants, who had high social support and had their spouse as their teammate, did not need additional motivation beyond the gamification to lose weight. Furthermore, the PCP sharing could have felt forced and leading to judgment outside their partner, eliminating any benefits from the gamification.  27 In the maintenance period, participants in the gamification and gamification with PCP sharing arms lost additional weight, indicating that they continued to be mindful of the gamification due to the consistent salience of their teammate, allowing them to continue behaving similarly following the study despite not getting the external notifications from the trial.\n\nThe differential effect of the study arms in the \"Married teams\" group could instead be the result of their differential gender composition, with a large number of males. Previous work has found that males engage more with gamification incentives.  28 Furthermore, men also often mention motivation as a facilitator in weight loss.  29 The gamification incentive may have provided sufficient motivation to overcome a lack of motivation. Group 3 may therefore have received more benefit in the gamification arm simply because it had more males. If this were the case, however, then one would expect the gamification with PCP sharing arm to lead to similar benefits. Based on this, the most likely explanation for the results seen in Group 3 is that the gamification was particularly effective in participants married to their teammate but that the PCP sharing actually reduced the effectiveness of the gamification.\n\nThe team-level analysis largely replicated the findings of 2 of the groups in the individual-level analysis. Although there was reason to believe a priori that the team-level dynamics might have separated the participants differently than did the individual-level analysis, this turned out not to be the case. However, these results solidify the importance of the type of relationship and closeness between participants when implementing group-based interventions. Group composition can affect the outcomes of the group,  30  and this is important to remember when designing interventions. However, it is not the case that married couples are automatically the best targets for these interventions, as one married couple was best placed in the \"Distant teams\" group due to other factors and responded less well to the intervention. This highlights one of the strengths of this approach that no single variable can identify group membership; it is the constellation of covariates that help place participants."

      "text": "This study was not without limitations. The main limitation was the small sample size. The relatively small size of the Lose It trial was exacerbated when we divided the participants into subgroups. This precluded us from quantitatively comparing weight loss across groups and trial arms. However, the trends we observed in these data combined with the group characteristics aligned with previous literature, which lends evidence toward external validity of these findings. The study population was relatively homogeneous, comprising mostly white, wealthy, educated women. Some of the groups were driven in part by sex due to the imbalance in recruitment numbers.\n\nSimilar studies on more representative populations may find groups with different response profiles. However, these groups would be in addition to, rather than instead of, the groups we found. Post hoc analyses of trial data include additional limitations, primarily that of overfitting and explaining coincidence rather than true differences.  31 Our decision of using LCA partially mitigates this, as it limits overfitting and does not include any outcome or treatment arm information in the classification. Only after the classes were decided did we examine the outcomes, limiting the possibility for these analyses to home in on coincidental trends.\n\nOverall, this research provides evidence that participants may respond differently to gamification and PCP sharing interventions aimed at weight loss, based on the phenotype of the participants. This has ramifications for both the design of weight loss interventions and implementing successful interventions in populations. In particular, recent work has focused on selecting optimal subgroups for intervention or treatment,  9  and this work provides a framework with which to do so. Future work should take the next step and assign patients to their predicted best interventions and determine the benefit therein."
