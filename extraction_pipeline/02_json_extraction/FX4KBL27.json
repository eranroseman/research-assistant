However, premature fatal and non-fatal CVD is considered to be largely preventable through the control of risk factors  (WHO 2011) .\n\nPrimary prevention of CVD refers to actions taken to reduce the incidence of clinical events due to coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease, among people with risk factors who have not yet developed clinically manifest CVD  (WHO 2007) . Primary prevention of CVD consists of lifestyle modifications (e.g. smoking cessation, increasing physical activity) and drug therapy (Piepoli 2016). Lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drug therapies for primary prevention are cost-effective in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality among high-risk people and are recommended by international guidelines (Piepoli 2016;  WHO 2007) . Recommendations relating to the use of antiplatelet drugs for primary prevention vary. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) states that aspirin cannot be recommended in primary prevention due to its increased risk of major bleeding (Piepoli 2016); however, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends the use of aspirin when the 10-year risk of CVD events reaches such a level that the benefits of aspirin, in terms of CVD events prevented, outweigh the potential harm of increased gastrointestinal haemorrhage (USPSTF 2014). Adherence to long-term medication is not ideal and results in costs in both health and economic terms (Piepoli 2016). Meta-analyses have estimated rates of adherence to cardiovascular medications ranging from 50% to 60% (Chowdhury 2013; Naderi 2012), and there is some evidence that adherence is lower for primary prevention (Naderi 2012).\n\nOne study of health records of over 430,000 people in UK general practices found that 47% of people prescribed statins for primary prevention discontinued treatment (indicated by a greater than 90day gap between prescriptions), among whom, 72% then restarted treatment (Vinogradova 2016). One study of Finnish healthcare registers found that 53% of women prescribed statin therapy for primary prevention were adherent (defined as exceeding 80% of the prescribed regimen) (Lavikainen 2016). It has been estimated that approximately 9% of cases of CVDs in the EU could be attributed to poor adherence to vascular medications (Chowdhury 2013). Improving adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD would help to maximise the clinical benefits for the wider population  (WHO 2003) . Therefore, there is considerable scope for increasing adherence to prescribed medicine, and so, reducing morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs."

      "text": "Mobile phone ownership is almost universal in high-income countries and estimated to have reached over 90% in low-and middleincome countries (ICT 2016). Given the broad reach of mobile phones and the potential for automation of delivery, interventions delivered by mobile phone are a potentially cost-effective strategy to improve medication adherence. A range of media can be delivered through mobile phones including text messages, picture messages, interactive-voice response, telephone calls and, with increasing ownership of smart phones with Internet capabilities (ICT 2016), mobile applications."

      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "A wide range of factors have been shown to be associated with medication non-adherence (DiMatteo 2004; Julius 2009; Kardas 2013; Pound 2005; Vermeire 2001; WHO 2003). Mobile phonebased interventions have the potential to target a number of these factors. For example, lack of adherence resulting from lack of information regarding the benefits of medication, lack of information about how they work and how to take them, misconceptions about medication adverse effects, complex or unclear advice or poor recall of information provided in consultations may be addressed through text messages providing short and simply worded snippets of information (Julius 2009; Kardas 2013; Pound 2005; Vermeire 2001). Experiences of adverse effects can be targeted through mobile phone-delivered interventions by providing information about medication and facilitating a link to a healthcare professional for people experiencing problems with their medication. Lack of social support has also been linked to poor medication adherence and previous qualitative research found that the receipt of text message-based intervention provided social support (Douglas 2013). Mobile phone-delivered interventions can be designed to target psychological factors such as lack of motivation and low self-efficacy (Free 2016). Existing interventions targeting adherence to CVD medication have employed mobile technologies to: deliver medication reminders (Park 2014a); encourage self-monitoring of medication intake (Park 2014a); encourage habit formation relating to medication-taking behaviours (Bobrow 2014); provide information (Bobrow 2014; Park 2014a); and facilitate links to healthcare services where required (Bobrow 2014; Piette 2012). Systematic reviews assessing the effect of mobile health (mhealth) interventions on medication adherence for a range of conditions, including HIV, non-communicable diseases and prevention of transplant rejection have reported significant improvements (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Park 2014b), and an RCT found mobile phone messaging to be effective in improving contraceptive use (Smith 2015). Few adverse effects of mobile phone-based interventions have been reported; potential, but rare, adverse events may include road traffic accidents (Caird 2014)."

However, no systematic review has specifically examined the effect of mobile phone-based interventions on adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD. Mobile phone-based interventions are of particular interest given their low-cost and potential for widespread delivery."

Where we identified trials that included a subset of eligible participants, we contacted the authors to request data for only those participants of interest.

We presented the effect estimates for outcomes reported by multiple studies on forest plots (without pooling); it should be noted that in transferring effect estimates from papers into Review Manager 5 using the generic inverse variance method, some CIs differed from those reported in the original paper by a decimal place. Should more studies become available in future updates of this review which enable meaningful meta-analyses, we plan to use fixedeffect models. In the presence of heterogeneity (an I 2 statistic in excess of 30%), we plan to examine whether this heterogeneity can be explained through our prespecified subgroup analyses. If these analyses account for the heterogeneity, we would only present the subgroup pooled effect estimates. If these subgroup analyses did not explain the heterogeneity, we would present results narratively.\n\nWe intended to use fixed-effect meta-analysis and apply a conservative I 2 threshold to identify heterogeneity in this review to avoid overweighting smaller studies.

Liu 2015 did not report the proportion of participants prescribed medication, but explicitly stated that the intervention targeted adherence to medication among those on treatment. The mean age of participants varied from 54.4 years (Bobrow 2016) to 62.9 years (Logan 2012). The proportion of women in the trial samples ranged from 42% (Liu 2015) to 72% (Bobrow 2016)."

      "text": "The content and delivery of the interventions varied across studies. The intervention evaluated by Bobrow 2016 was specifically designed to primarily focus on medication adherence, with only a few references to other lifestyle modifications such as diet and physical exercise. In two trials, the interventions targeted a combination of behaviours such as lifestyle modifications including healthy diet and physical activity, alongside medication adherence for those prescribed CVD medication (Liu 2015; Parraga-Martinez 2017). The intervention tested by Logan 2012 was primarily a blood pressure monitoring and feedback (via smartphone) intervention, which could be considered to implicitly target adherence to treatment as well as other health behaviours important for the control blood pressure. Bobrow 2016 delivered the intervention solely through mobile phone text messages, and the intervention evaluated by Logan 2012 combined blood pressure monitoring with feedback messages delivered via smartphone. In the other studies, the intervention included additional components alongside the mobile delivery component, such as written information and self-completion cards for participants to record adherence to recommendations (Parraga-Martinez 2017), and a computerised CVD risk evaluation and a face-to-face counselling session (Liu 2015). Three of the studies tested interventions which were delivered only to the participant (Bobrow 2016; Liu 2015; Parraga-Martinez 2017), while Logan 2012 evaluated an intervention which involved home blood pressure monitoring and feedback to participants' smartphones, alongside an automated fax providing detailed information on the participants' status to their physicians on the day before their next scheduled appointment. Two studies involved potential users in developing the interventions (Bobrow 2016; Liu 2015), and none of the interventions were developed based on a specific theory. The interventions employed a minimum of three (Logan 2012) to a maximum of 16 (Bobrow 2016) behaviour change techniques. The behaviour change techniques applied in the greatest number of studies were: 'providing feedback on behaviour' (Liu 2015; Logan 2012; Parraga-Martinez 2017), 'providing information about health consequences' and 'emphasising the salience of consequences' (Bobrow 2016; Liu 2015; Parraga-Martinez 2017). Three studies had a duration of the intervention of one year ( Bobrow 2016; Liu 2015; Logan 2012). One study had a followup at two years, but it was unclear whether the intervention was delivered throughout the entire study period (Parraga-Martinez 2017). Two studies had a control group that received standard care (Liu 2015; Parraga-Martinez 2017). The control group in Logan 2012 received the same home blood pressure monitoring equipment as the intervention group and a booklet containing information on the measurement of blood pressure, treatment of hypertension and goals of therapy. The control in group in Bobrow 2016 received written information about hypertension and healthy living, and only received text messages that were sent to all trial participants, which were primarily related to trial participation."

One study included outcome data on self-report adherence to lipid-lowering therapy, measured using the Morisky-Green Test (Parraga-Martinez 2017). One trial included self-reported adherence to medication measured using a visual analogue scale, in addition to a measure of 'proportion of days of medication covered' (defined as the proportion of participants with 80% or more days covered with blood pressure-lowering medication from prescribing and dispensing data routinely recorded in the clinical record, pharmacy record and Chronic Dispensing Unit record) (Bobrow 2016). This trial also included a measure of quality of life (health status measured with the Eu-roQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire) and reported deaths (including those caused by CVD events) occurring during the trial (Bobrow 2016).

      "text": "See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Mobile phone interventions compared to usual care for improving adherence to medication prescribed for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease We did not pool results in a meta-analysis as the content and delivery mechanisms of the interventions were heterogeneous. The intervention assessed by Bobrow 2016 was designed to focus on medication adherence and delivered solely through SMS. The intervention tested by Logan 2012 was a blood pressure monitoring and feedback (via smartphone) intervention. The Parraga-Martinez 2017 intervention targeted a combination of lifestyle modifications, alongside medication adherence for those prescribed CVD medication and was delivered through text messages, written information pamphlets and self-completion cards for participants. Finally, the intervention evaluated by Liu 2015 targeted healthy lifestyle alongside treatment regimens with a multi-component intervention comprising of text messages, a computerised CVD risk evaluation and face-to-face counselling. Based on these differences, we considered that pooling data from these trials would not have been appropriate. In generating the narrative forest plots, we also checked heterogeneity statistically (I 2 greater than 90% for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP); I 2 = 0% for TC; I 2 = 73% for LDL-C; I 2 = 0% for HDL-C). Based on these findings, we considered pooling results from the two studies which reported on TC and HDL outcomes; however, we still considered the interventions too distinct to warrant meaningful pooling (specifically, one intervention included face-to-face counselling (Liu 2015), whereas the other consisted of written information and text messages (Parraga-Martinez 2017)). We present results narratively, below, and in Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3; Analysis 1.4; Analysis 1.5. Primary outcomes Objective measures of adherence to treatment Cholesterol Two trials reported LDL-C levels (Analysis 1.1), one of which showed a reduction in LDL-C (MD in reduction: 9.20 mg/ dL, 95% CI 0.70 to 17.70, P = 0.034; 304 participants) (Parraga-Martinez 2017), while the other demonstrated no evidence of intervention effect on LDL-C (MD 0.77 mg/dL, 95% CI -4.64 to 6.18; 589 participants) (Liu 2015) (note: we converted mmol/L cholesterol to mg/dL using a multiplier of 38.67 as recommended by Rugge 2011). We judged the evidence relating to the intervention effect on LDL-C to be of low quality due to both trials contributing to this comparison being at unclear risk of bias across multiple domains, and the inconsistency in effect estimates across studies. These two trials also reported TC finding evidence of intervention benefit (Analysis 1.2). Parraga-Martinez 2017 showed an MD in the reduction of TC of 9.7 mg/dL (95% CI 0.30 to 19.10; P = 0.041) for the intervention compared with control group, and Liu 2015 recorded an MD in reduction of TC of 10.05 mg/dL (95% CI -17.01 to -3.09). Neither trial found evidence for an adverse effect on HDL-C ( Analysis 1.3) (MD 1.16 mg/dL, 95% CI -1.55 to 3.87 (Liu 2015); MD 0.10 mg/dL, 95% CI -2.60 to 2.80 (Parraga-Martinez 2017))."

Three trials measured DBP as an outcome and we considered this to constitute low-quality evidence due to all three trials being at unclear risk of bias across multiple domains, and inconsistency between studies in the degree to which the outcome was affected.\n\nBobrow 2016 (1372 participants) reported a greater reduction in mean SBP from baseline to 12-month follow-up in the intervention group receiving information-only text messages compared with the control group (MD -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -4.4 to 0.00; P = 0.046), but no difference between the intervention group receiving interactive text messaging and the control group (MD -1.6 mmHg, 95% CI -3.70 to 0.50, P = 0.16). Bobrow 2016 also presented the proportion of participants achieving SBP and DBP less than 140/90 mmHg.

Logan 2012 showed a greater reduction in SBP and DBP in the intervention group compared with control group at 12 months for: 24-hour blood pressure and daytime ambulatory blood pressure (mean between-group difference in change (standard error (SE)): 24-hour SBP: -6.8 mmHg (SE 2.4); P = 0.005; 24-hour DBP: -3.6 mmHg (SE 1.3); P = 0.006; daytime SBP: -7.10 mmHg (SE 2.3); P = 0.003; daytime DBP: -3.9 mmHg (SE 1.3) P = 0.003)).

Liu 2015 also found evidence of a beneficial intervention effect on blood pressure at 12 months, with an MD between the intervention and control group for SBP of -12.45 mmHg (95% CI -15.02 to -9.88) and for DBP of -12.23 (95% CI -14.03 to -10.43) (589 participants). However, Parraga-Martinez 2017 found no evidence of a benefit of their intervention for reducing blood pressure at two years, with an MD in change of 0.83 mmHg (95% CI -2.67 to 4.33) for SBP, and 1.64 mmHg (95% CI -0.55 to 3.83) for DBP (304 participants)."

In our review, we identified four trials, none of which were at low risk of bias. One trial evaluated an intervention targeting medication adherence via text messaging and one trial assessed a blood pressure monitoring system which delivered feedback to participants via smartphone messaging. The remaining two trials were of interventions targeting healthy lifestyle modifications more generally, including adherence to medication, one of which was delivered through text messages, written information pamphlets and self-completion cards for participants, and the other through a combination of text messages, a computerised CVD risk evaluation and face-to-face counselling. Due to these differences in content and delivery of the interventions, we did not pool results in a meta-analysis.\n\nWe considered the body of evidence relating to the effect of mobile phone-based interventions to be of low quality for outcomes relating to blood pressure and cholesterol due to the trials being at high risk of bias across multiple domains, and inconsistent outcome effects. The trial of the text messaging-based intervention targeting adherence showed a small reduction in SBP for the intervention arm which delivered information-only text messages, but no evidence of a benefit for the second intervention arm that provided interactivity in addition to the information-based text messages. Bobrow 2016 reported that only 50% of participants allocated to the interactive SMS intervention arm responded to messages, which may be indicative of relatively low engagement with this feature. Both arms demonstrated an increase in the proportion of participants achieving the recommended threshold for SBP and DBP, with a modest risk difference between the intervention and control groups of 7% (Bobrow 2016). One of two indirect measures of adherence also showed improvements and there was no difference in CVD-related deaths, health-related quality of life or cognitive outcomes (satisfaction with treatment) (Bobrow 2016).\n\nThe study examining the effect of blood pressure monitoring, and messaging via smartphone, reported a modest intervention benefit on four of their six outcome measures of blood pressure (Logan 2012). There was mixed evidence of benefit in two trials targeting medication adherence alongside other lifestyle advice. Liu 2015 reported benefits in SBP and DBP, but Parraga-Martinez 2017 reported no such effects. Both trials reported a beneficial effect of their intervention on lowering TC (Liu 2015; Parraga-Martinez 2017); however, only Parraga-Martinez 2017 found an effect on LDL-C. Only one trial included an indirect measure of adherence reporting a benefit in self-reported medication adherence (Parraga-Martinez 2017). In both of these trials the contribution of increased adherence to the reductions in cholesterol and blood pressure reported was unclear due to their inclusion of a mix of participants who had and had not been prescribed CVD medica-tion (Liu 2015; Parraga-Martinez 2017). Two trials reported on adverse events and provided low-quality evidence that the interventions did not cause harm (Bobrow 2016; Parraga-Martinez 2017)."

Two studies were conducted in high-income settings and two in upper-to middle-income settings, meaning that the applicability of these results to other settings including low-income settings is unclear. Four of the six ongoing studies identified are being carried out in high-income countries, however, one trial is being conducted in 'low resource settings' in Argentina, and one in a low-to middle-income county (India), which may provide greater information on the applicability of results across settings (Gulayin 2017)."

The quality of the evidence relating to all five outcomes considered were downgraded one level because none of the included studies were at low risk of bias. Three of the four studies were at unclear risk of bias on at least four of the domains, indicating poor quality of reporting of the trial methods in these studies which limited our ability to make clear judgements about the level of risk of bias. Finally, the evidence relating to the cognitive outcome of satisfaction with treatment was also downgraded for indirectness, because this was based on one trial conducted in a single setting. Two trials of interventions targeting broader lifestyle modifications, including medication adherence, included a mixture of participants who had and had not been prescribed CVD prevention medication, and therefore, in both of these trials the contribution of increased adherence to the reductions in cholesterol and blood pressure reported was unclear (Liu 2015; Parraga-Martinez 2017)."

Furthermore, publication bias, whereby trials with positive findings are more likely to be published, may have biased the selection of included studies in this review. However, efforts were made to overcome this through searching clinical trial registries for prospectively registered trials. The decision was taken to only include trials with a minimum of one-year follow-up in order that results were applicable to longer-term sustained behaviour change in adherence, which would therefore be more important in improving health status. This means that we are unable to comment on the effectiveness of mobile phone-based interventions for short-term adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD."

      "text": "Our findings of mixed evidence of the effects of mobile phonedelivered interventions to increase adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD and no reported harms are consistent with those of a Cochrane Review examining the effectiveness of text-messaging interventions to improve adherence to medication prescribed for the secondary prevention of CVD (Adler 2017). These findings are broadly consistent with systematic reviews concerned with mhealth interventions to improve medication adherence across conditions, although these reviews included short-term studies and non-RCT designs, which are subject to bias (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Park 2014b). One systematic review examining RCTs of monitoring and messaging interventions targeting medication adherence for the management of type 2 diabetes found no evidence for an improvement in medication adherence in their pooled meta-analyses of five trials (Farmer 2016). Our finding that one intervention delivered by text messaging alone reported small benefits, some of which achieved statistical significance, is consistent with the findings from trials employing SMS alone targeting adherence to HIV medication which also report small benefits of borderline\n\nclinical and statistical significance (da Costa 2012; Orrell 2015; Pop-Eleches 2011; Sabin 2015). The reported benefits of the monitoring and SMS intervention is consistent with the modest benefits of monitoring interventions in general (Carrasco 2008; Lim 2011; McKinstry 2013; Yoo 2009). The small or modest benefits reported may reflect the challenges involved in improving adherence, and overall inconclusive findings relating to adherence interventions in general, which have previously been noted in a Cochrane Review of all adherence interventions (Nieuwlaat 2014)."

      "text": "Our results are based on four trials, none of which was considered to be at low risk of bias. Therefore, given the low quality of the evidence presented, the implications for practice are limited. From the four studies reporting on change in systolic blood pressure as an outcome, effects ranged from reductions of 12.5 mmHg to increases of 0.83 mmHg, with two studies exceeding a 5 mmHg mean reduction (a 5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure is generally considered to result in clinically important reductions in the relative risk of stroke and coronary heart disease events (Collins 1990)). The delivery of mobile phone-based interventions is inexpensive and previous analyses of such interventions in other fields have demonstrated cost-effectiveness (Guerriero 2013; Lester 2010). If comparable effectiveness results are replicated in other high-quality trials, it would be useful to consider cost-effectiveness of the intervention, as if shown to be cost-effective, the small benefits achieved at low cost might be important if achieved across whole populations. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration estimates that for each 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) there is a consistent 20% relative risk reduction for major vascular events regardless of baseline risk (CTT 2012). The two trials measuring LDL-C as an outcome reported effects ranging from a 9.2 mg/dL reduction to a 0.77 mg/dL increase, meaning that even the larger of these effects would have a small impact on clinical outcomes."

      "text": "The intervention delivered by SMS alone which resulted in small benefits in adherence was developed with input from users. The intervention targeted many of the barriers to adherence, which might conceivably be addressed using SMS, employing a wide range of behavioural change techniques.\n\nNonetheless, the finding of only small benefit is consistent with results of adherence interventions delivered by SMS for secondary prevention of CVD, HIV medication and diabetes (Adler 2017; Anglada-Martinez 2015; Farmer 2016). It is possible that the intervention delivered by SMS has small effects because some behaviour change techniques may not be effective when adapted for delivery by SMS. Adherence is influenced by a wide range of service and social factors, in additional to the individual level factors like knowledge motivation and skills which might be targeted using short written messages (DiMatteo 2004; Julius 2009; Kardas 2013; Nieuwlaat 2014; Pound 2005; Vermeire 2001). Future adherence interventions should consider targeting a broader range of factors influencing adherence. Given the importance of healthcare providers in influencing medication use and altering medication if unacceptable adverse effects occur, interventions may require integration with services to result in clinically important benefits for individuals. Furthermore, future trials should consider targeting people most at risk of poor adherence and excluding those known to be adherent.\n\nFinally, given the heterogeneity that exists between behaviour change interventions, we believe there is a case to be made that individual high-quality adequately powered trials could provide higher quality evidence relating to the effectiveness of such interventions, compared with evidence based on attempts to pool mul-tiple smaller, lower-quality and potentially heterogeneous trials. Several of the ongoing trials identified have large sample sizes, and so if adequately powered and at low risk of bias, these studies may provide high-quality and more precise estimates of the effect of adherence interventions delivered by mobile phone."
