  "title": "Smartphone Distraction: Italian Validation of the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS)",
  "abstract": "This work aimed to validate the use of the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS) in Italy. The SDS was devised to assess distraction related to smartphone use in adult populations. A cross-sectional study was conducted among n = 609 adults (females = 76.4%; mean age = 30.26; SD age = 9.90). An assessment of the factorial structure of the Italian version was carried out using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The four factors identified by Throuvala and colleagues were confirmed (i.e., attention impulsiveness, online vigilance, multitasking and emotion regulation). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.703-0.889). The scale's scores showed significant linear correlations with validated instruments, including the Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale (MPPUS)and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). A multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences in the means among participants belonging to different age groups (born before 1995 vs. born after 1996). In summary, the good psychometric properties observed led us to assume that this instrument can be applied and used in Italian studies to assess the cognitive dimension of distraction related to the use of smartphones.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction 1.Smartphone Use and Overuse",
      "text": "From their entry into the market to the present, smartphones and their use have spread remarkably. Smartphone use is now so widespread that it is regarded as an extension of oneself and one's body, having become an essential tool in individuals' lives. Smartphones have numerous advantages, such as being helpful in managing activities of daily living. In addition to providing speed and fluidity in communication and exchanges between people, they can facilitate working life and productivity, as well as study and learning activities  [1] . The advantages of smartphone use are certainly tied to the infinite content and material that can be accessed. Free access to the Web greatly increases the possibilities for entertainment and social media use, which increases the desire to use and spend as much time as possible with one's smartphone  [2] .\n\nThe creative and appropriate use of a smartphone generates a state of deep concentration, which increases performance levels-an event called flow. When using such devices, the concept of temporality disappears, delimiting contact between only the individual and the smartphone.\n\nOne aspect that contributes to smartphone overuse is the sense of connection/social connection. This can be annulled or altered when one does not have access to the tool that enables it. In particular, the absence or presence of connections tied to social media use can result in the fear-of-missing-out (FoMO) phenomenon. FoMO is defined as a pervasive preoccupation with others having rewarding experiences from which one is absent and is characterised by the desire to always be connected (i.e., to know what other people are doing)  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Given that smartphones allow constant connections online, FoMO and smartphone overuse are closely related problematic phenomena.\n\nSmartphone overuse and related factors are now being questioned urgently in the literature to understand which elements are related to such phenomena and which elements can be identified as precursors. With these data, preventive action can be taken before overuse turns into a true addiction.\n\nNotably, while Bianchi and Phillips  [8, 9]  found that extroversion and low self-esteem appear to be precursors to problematic smartphone use, many factors can contribute. For example,  Busch and  McCarthy's review  [10]  of 239 studies identified macro areas that can be considered antecedents of this phenomenon, such as control (understood as the ability to control impulses and self-regulate the use of the smartphone), health (both physical and mental), factors linked to the family context and the technological characteristics of the object itself.\n\nVarious attempts to find models of the causes and effects of smartphone overuse and problematic smartphone use exist in the literature, one of the most comprehensive being the latest version of Billieux's pathway model from 2015  [11] . According to the author, this behaviour can arise and be driven by three pathways. The pathway of overreassurance is represented by an individual's strong need to maintain relationships and obtain reassurance from others. Self-esteem is low, as is emotional stability, and the level of anxiety, especially social anxiety, is high. The impulsive-antisocial pathway is characterised by uncontrolled and unregulated impulses. Behaviour is uncontrolled and often aggressive. The extroversion pathway focuses on rewards derived from the outside, a strong and constant desire to communicate with others and establish new relationships, and strong sensitivity and dependence  [12] [13] [14] .\n\nAmong the aforementioned works, there is significant agreement regarding the variables that lead to the manifestation of problematic mobile phone use, and among these, the most frequently named is self-control, extending the concept to impulsivity, cognitive failures and dysfunctional emotional regulation. Cognitive failures refer to lapses or errors in cognitive functioning, such as memory lapses, attentional lapses and difficulties in concentration  [15] . Of course, factors related to cognitive failures may vary based on many elements (e.g., frequency and intensity of smartphone use, individual susceptibility and the presence of pre-existing cognitive vulnerabilities). However, the literature shows a worrying finding-an increase in cognitive failures, even among younger people  [16] . For instance, constantly relying on smartphones to retrieve information may help manage cognitive overload, but it may also reduce the brain's ability to encode and store information and thus reduce memorisation capacity  [17] ."

      "title": "1.2.. Smartphone Distraction",
      "text": "In the long term, smartphone overuse and compulsive use reduce concentration abilities, wellbeing and creativity  [18, 19] . The massive use of smartphones could affect cognitive functions and influence performance, especially in learning contexts, such as schools  [20] [21] [22] , and in the professional field  [22, 23] .\n\nFirth and colleagues  [17]  underlined how the constant use of the internet above all (thanks to the smartphone) can affect attentional abilities due to having one's attention constantly divided. Memory processes can also be affected by the amount of information in storage and its retrieval, impacting social cognition. This is because social settings and environments are changed, and the concepts of social life, self-concepts and self-esteem are completely renewed. These findings on changes in cognitive processes and functions have been confirmed by several studies in the literature  [24] .\n\nLiebherr and colleagues  [25]  found that smartphone overuse affects attention, inhibition and working memory if moderated by individual attributes and situational factors. In general, some studies have found a close link between smartphone overuse and distraction. Skowronek and colleagues  [26]  found that the mere presence of the smartphone reduced attentional performance and increased distraction. In defining distraction, it is difficult to find an unambiguous definition of this concept in the literature. The link between attention, concentration, cognitive overload and distraction is certainly evident. In general, the literature defines distraction as shifting from a primary task due to psychological reactions triggered by external stimuli or nonprimary-level activities  [27] .\n\nSelective attention, defined as the ability to counteract distractions and focus attention on certain stimuli, is reduced over time so that less information is processed, suggesting a tendency towards economy or negative cognitive economy to achieve a goal  [28] . Therefore, the smartphone is a multitasking tool that produces rewards and reinforcements at intervals, influencing and stimulating its gradual and/or constant use. Excessive use results in a permanent state of inattention  [29] .\n\nAttention is a cognitive process that allows one to focus on certain stimuli to process them, but only a limited number of stimuli can be processed at any given time  [30] . Therefore, if the demands of the environment require more attention than is available, the cognitive system becomes overloaded and performance suffers  [31] . We live in the age of multitasking, which constantly tests our attentional capacity, and in an environment full of distractions, such as visual stimuli, constant notifications and a constant bombardment of information  [29] . The causes of distraction are endogenous and exogenous in nature. Distraction has also been linked to functional emotion regulation strategies utilised to relieve emotional distress  [32] . The level of distraction is often subjective and variable, but all the relevant literature agrees that the arrival of new technologies has changed individuals' ways of relating to the environment, with a general increase in distraction levels. This is amplified by the fact that people's lives now take place on two planes: the physical and the virtual."

      "title": "1.3.. Smartphone Distraction Scale",
      "text": "Throuvala and colleagues  [32]  presented a model of smartphone distraction and proposed an instrument called the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS) that could measure it. They highlighted four basic factors: attention impulsiveness, online vigilance, multitasking and emotion regulation, all of which include distracting attention from the current task, albeit with different motivations. For example, an item measuring the subscale of emotion regulation reads, \"Using my mobile phone distracts me from negative and unpleasant thoughts\". In this case, the smartphone is used as a dysfunctional coping strategy, as the individual diverts attention from the negative situation without resolving it. The area of online vigilance encompasses distractions due to thoughts about activities that one might carry out online, especially those related to social networks, and it appears to be related to FoMO. Multitasking, as the term suggests, refers to performing several tasks at the same time, whether they are carried out through a smartphone (e.g., \"I use several apps on my phone when I work\") or involve using a smartphone while engaged in other activities, such as walking. Finally, attention impulsiveness refers to the distraction produced by the smartphone itself as an object and thus the attention it attracts, which is linked to the subject's low self-control  [33] .\n\nSDS was validated in two other countries: in China, three factors were identified (i.e., attention impulsiveness, emotion regulation and multitasking) in a sample of undergraduates  [34] , and in Turkey  [35] , the four factors identified in the original work were confirmed (i.e., attention impulsivity, online vigilance, multitasking and emotion regulation).\n\nIn this work, we validated the Italian version of the SDS  [32]  related to smartphone use in the adult population."

      "text": "Based on the literature and previous evaluations and due to the non-existence of a scale that assesses these aspects in the Italian context, this study aimed to validate the Italian version of the SDS  [32] . The SDS is useful for measuring the application of cognitive strategies of distraction related to the use of technologies in adults.\n\nSpecifically, the psychometric features, validity and reliability of the SDS were evaluated by the application of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Furthermore, the convergent and divergent validities were assessed by examining the relationship between the scale and other psychological dimensions (e.g., the problematic use of smartphones and cognitive failures), which were assessed by instruments not yet validated in Italy. Finally, criterion-related validity was considered in evaluating the differences in the average SDS regarding age groups."

Precisely, the sample included 465 females (76.4%), aged between 18 and 65 years old (mean age = 30.26; standard deviation age = 9.90).\n\nOn average, they spend 4.73 (\u00b12.84) hours per day connected online on workdays and 4.33 (\u00b12.67) hours per day on holidays. They largely use chats (mean = 3.68; SD = 1.03) and mainly use their smartphones to connect online (mean = 4.24; SD = 0.87). Table  1  showed in detail the descriptive statistics regarding the variables assessed in this study. We applied a cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sample. The protocol of the research was administered in digital format using the platform SurveyMonkey to reach as many participants as possible.\n\nIt was distributed via email, via groups constituted in social networks. The administration of the questionnaire was carried out from June 2022 to October 2022. The local ethical committee of Cagliari State University approved the protocol of the research; the participants gave their informed consent for their participation and for the treatment of the data for scientific aims."

Initially, three independent scholars translated the SDS from English to Italian; subsequently, they reached an agreement on a joint version. This version of the SDS was then back-translated by a bilingual researcher who has broad expertise in psychological studies. As a final step, the SDS items of the Italian version were evaluated by three experts in the problematic use of smartphones."

The reliability of the Italian version regarding the general factor defined as \"CFQ-Perceived cognitive failure\" was 0.81. Some items, for example, are the following: \"Do you find you forget appointments?\" \"Do you start doing one thing at home and get distracted into doing something else (unintentionally)?\" \"Do you read something and find you haven't been thinking about it and must read it again?\""

To analyse the data, the participants were randomly divided into two sub-samples. The first was used to apply EFA (Stage 1, n = 305), and the second was used to apply CFA (Stage 2, n = 304). For the assessment of psychometric features and construct validity, EFA was applied in Stage 1. CFA was carried out in the second random subsample (Stage 2). In CFA, we applied diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) estimation with the robust method of estimation, which is helpful in the assessment of ordinated categorical variables (e.g., Likert scales)  [40] . To assess the goodness of fit in the CFA, we referred to the classical indices and rules of thumb defined in the literature  [41] [42] [43] . Because chi-squared (Chi2) was affected by the number of participants, the ratio of Chi2 to their degrees of freedom (Chi2/df) was evaluated (considered adequate when smaller than three)  [43] . Concerning the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), this statistic is considered suitable when it is between 0.05 and 0.08  [41] [42] [43] . We also computed the confidence interval at 90%. The comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) were calculated; their values should be greater than 0.90 to be considered acceptable  [41, 42] . Furthermore, the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) was computed, considering a cut-off of <0.08  [42] . The analysis of internal consistency was carried out using Cronbach's alpha coefficient; the criterion and concurrent validities were assessed by Pearson's linear correlation between the SDS and other measurements (number of hours spent online and psychological dimensions measured by the MPPUS and CFQ instruments). Furthermore, criterion-related validity was considered based on the potential differences between participants belonging to different generations (Generation Z versus older individuals) through a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)  [44, 45] ."

The graphical scree plot examination and parallel analysis (testing whether a factor identification might be due to chance) were applied to identify an adequate number of factors to retain in this questionnaire  [46, 47]  (see Figure  S1 ). The analyses indicated that the solution was suitable with the four factors suggested by the authors of the scale  [32]  (attention impulsiveness, emotion regulation, online vigilance and multitasking). The EFA results corresponded to those originally obtained by the authors of the instrument (Table  2 ). Specifically, the factor attention impulsiveness was saturated by items 1, 2, 3 and 4; online vigilance showed high levels of saturation for items 5, 6, 7 and 8; multitasking highlighted high factor loadings regarding items 9, 10, 11 and 12; and emotion regulation was saturated by items 13, 14, 15 and 16 (Table  2 ). All four factors showed good indices of Cronbach's alpha reliability (ranging from 0.703 to 0.889), highlighting high levels of internal consistency for each factor.

      "text": "CFA was applied with the DWLS estimation. The assessment focused on three competing models that were identified based on the work of the authors of the original instrument and on the literature. Model 1 assessed the fit of the one-factor solution, and Model 2 evaluated the first-order solution, which was characterised by four correlated factors. These were devised by the authors of the SDS and identified by the previous EFA in Subsample 1; Model 3 estimated the fit of a second-order factor over the four factors identified by the authors and in the previous EFA (see Tables  S1-S3 ) The appropriate CFA model was chosen based on the evaluation of a variety of features, as suggested by the literature  [48] . Specifically, the following aspects were considered: the number of free parameters to be estimated, the correlations between the factors, the fit indices, the parsimony of the model and the model propensity  [49] . The latter feature, which is defined as model flexibility  [50]  or model complexity, concerns \"the ability of a model to fit a diverse array of data patterns well\"  [49] . This attribute (called overfitting) can compromise the ability of a CFA model to be generalised to new samples extracted from the same population  [49] . Parsimonious models restrict model-compatible data and are not as susceptible to overfitting  [51] . Hence, to ensure high generalisability, it is desirable to find a balance between the goodness-of-fit assessment and propensity by selecting the model that provides the best description of the data in the least complex way  [48] . Regarding these aspects, in the CFA application, the goodness-of-fit indices of RMSEA and TLI, accounting for the number of free parameters, allow for the application of fair-minded model selection choices  [48] . Table  3  illustrates the indices of the goodness of fit of our competing models. Model 1 shows low indices of goodness of fit to the data (regarding the rules of thumb in the literature  [41] ). Models 2 and 3 show, respectively, good and similar indices of goodness of fit; thus, after applying the above-mentioned evaluations, we chose Model 2 for CFA, characterised by a first-order solution with four correlated factors (see Table  3  and Figure  1 ). Model 2 confirmed the factorial structure identified in the previously applied EFA and by the original authors of the instrument, with four items for each factor. In the total sample, to assess the criterion and concurrent validity, we evaluated Pearson's linear correlation between the SDS scores and the other variables assessed in the protocol, specifically, the number of hours spent online daily (workdays and holidays) and the scores regarding the validated instruments administered in the protocol (Table  4 ). We observed significant positive linear correlations between all variables, except for the SDS dimension of online vigilance, which did not show a significant linear correlation with the number of hours spent online daily (holidays and workdays). These data suggest the presence of direct relationships, highlighting that there are strict positive associations between all four factors of the SDS, but also between the SDS factors and the dimensions inquiring about the problematic use of smartphones (assessed by the MPPUS scales, such as withdrawal, social aspects, cravings and escaping from other problems) and between the SDS factors and aspects related to cognitive failures (evaluated by the CFQ) (Table  4 ). These data corroborate the validity of the SDS in the Italian version. In the total sample, to assess the criterion and concurrent validity, we evaluated Pearson's linear correlation between the SDS scores and the other variables assessed in the protocol, specifically, the number of hours spent online daily (workdays and holidays) and the scores regarding the validated instruments administered in the protocol (Table  4 ).

These data corroborate the validity of the SDS in the Italian version. Furthermore, to assess the criterion-related validity, a MANOVA was applied to the total sample using the generation of participants (born before 1995 or born after 1996) as a factor and the scores for the four factors of SDS (attention impulsiveness, emotion regulation, online vigilance and multitasking) as dependent variables.\n\nThe multivariate Wilks' test highlighted a significant effect (Wilks' Lambda = 0.896; df = 4; 581; p < 0.001; partial eta squared = 0.104). The univariate tests confirmed significant differences in the means of the two generations for the four factors of SDS. For all factors, the participants born after 1996 obtained significantly higher mean scores than the older participants (see Tables  5  and  6 )."

      "title": "5.. Discussion",
      "text": "Smartphone use can lead to a series of advantages, but excessive use can bring with it many disadvantages and problems, such as negative effects on cognitive processes. Many studies have confirmed that smartphone overuse is associated with depression and anxiety disorders  [52] , psychological and physical health problems  [53, 54] , ocular diseases  [55] , musculoskeletal problems  [56]  and general dysfunctions in daily life activities  [56, 57] . Other studies have affirmed the presence of specific problems, such as FoMO on social media  [57] , nomophobia (i.e., fear of being away from your smartphone)  [58] , ringxiety (i.e., hearing non-existent smartphone notifications)  [59] , vamping  [24, 60]  (i.e., using a smartphone for long periods of the night), phubbing (i.e., social dissociation by constantly consulting with a smartphone)  [61]  and smartphone addiction (i.e., a disorder with serious effects on physical and psychological health)  [53, 62] . Smartphone overuse influences the perception of time, academic and work achievements and social interactions. People using smartphones exhibit decreased concentration and attention on other activities, tasks or interactions that occur in the real world. Smartphone overuse is strictly tied to distraction, a phenomenon that can negatively impact individuals' lives  [16] .\n\nDistraction is not easy to define; the literature offers various facets of the concept. There is also ambiguous agreement on the causes and effects of distraction that probably depend on complex interactions between factors, such as the attentional demands of the distracting information, the nature of the primary task and the similarity of operations between those required by the primary task and those needed to handle the distracting information  [63] . The literature shows that the increase seen in distraction levels is mainly due to smartphone use and overuse, with smartphones becoming super-stimuli. It is not possible to inhibit the response because immediacy takes over in the response and cannot be deferred to another time. It is also not possible to focus on the task because there is an overload of short-term memory and the attention system.\n\nThe stimulus takes up space, and whatever has the strongest emphasis receives attention. This generates constant distraction from the main task. In general, distraction can affect cognitive performance and, importantly, memory and attention  [63] . For example, many studies have demonstrated the effects of distraction on driving or in work contexts that require a maximum level of attention  [64] [65] [66] . Being distracted involves being absorbed in virtual activities that divert attention from the present moment and the surrounding environment. As seen among the dimensions of the SDS tool, smartphone distraction can be related to a wide variety of factors. There can be frequent interruptions from incoming messages, notifications or alerts from various apps; the constant need to check and respond immediately; the desire for constant control over what is happening online; attempts to multitask, such as texting while walking, checking email during conversations or using social media while studying or working; and the use of a smartphone as a tool for emotional regulation or dysregulation What is also clear from our analysis is the close link between distraction and possible cognitive failure, which is due to many elements, including information overload and a continuous influx of data  [48] . Our data confirm what the recent literature on the subject states, namely, that cognitive decline is especially high among the youngest. Descriptive statistics confirm a mean difference in the SDS dimensions regarding age; however, the participants born in 1996 or later obtained significantly higher mean scores than the older participants involved in the study. The same results were found in previous studies  [16] .\n\nA key element to reflect on from this and previous research is the need to understand the cognitive and social effects of internet and smartphone overuse. It is crucial that future studies understand their effects on a person's cognitive development. Therefore, studies should include longitudinal monitoring and make comparisons between young and older participants."

      "text": "Careful management of smartphone use and the adoption of strategies to ensure its functional use can help minimise distractions and avoid negative impacts on life activities and cognitive functions. In this regard, it would be interesting to longitudinally study the possible effects of excessive smartphone use on the reduction in cognitive reserve, which is especially crucial for successful ageing  [67] . Some studies have even referred to digital dementia among young people, referring mainly to the effects of excessive screen time  [68, 69] .\n\nGenerally, we can state that smartphone distraction can be a danger for young people, not only because of the possibility of cognitive impairment but also regarding the negative impact on school performance and self-regulation during study time, an increased risk of accidents, reduced physical activity and social and emotional implications.\n\nIt is important to emphasise that studies such as ours do not intend to demonise smartphone use but aim to stress that excessive and uncontrolled use carries risks. In light of what has been read and observed, one can consider the need to educate individuals as early as adolescence on the conscious use of smartphones, which has great potential but can also have negative aspects. Studies should therefore include longitudinal monitoring and also make comparisons between young and old individuals. Furthermore, such studies should be extended to various social and life contexts.\n\nIt is crucial to have tools such as the SDS at our disposal to allow the easy and immediate identification of risk factors. The scale in this form could be used in educational and research contexts to measure specific aspects related to distraction in an efficient and meaningful manner."
