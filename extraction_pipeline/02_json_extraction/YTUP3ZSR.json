  "title": "Outcome Measurement Instruments and Evidencebased Recommendations for Measurement of the Pelvic Girdle Pain Core Outcome Set (PGP-COS): A Systematic Review and Consensus Process",
  "abstract": "This study provides evidence-and consensus-based recommendations for the instruments to measure the five Pelvic Girdle Pain Core Outcome Set (PGP-COS): pain frequency, pain intensity/severity, function/disability/activity limitation, health-related quality of life and fear avoidance. Studies evaluating measurement properties of instruments measuring any PGP-COS outcome in women with PGP were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PEDro databases (inception-July 2021). The methodological quality of studies and quality of measurement properties were evaluated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Quality criteria and the synthesized evidence were graded using the modified grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. A consensus meeting with PGP stakeholders was then held to establish recommendations, based on the evidence, for the instruments that should be used to measure the PGP-COS. Ten instruments were identified from 17 studies. No instrument showed high quality evidence for all measurement properties and/or measured all PGP-COS outcomes. Based on current evidence and consensus, the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ), the Short Form-8 (SF-8) and the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) are recommended for measuring the PGP-COS. Future research should establish additional measurement properties of instruments and to substantiate these recommendations.",

      "text": "Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is a common complaint reported by women worldwide. PGP is defined as pain between the posterior iliac crest and the inferior gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joints, that may radiate in the posterior thigh and can occur in conjunction with or separately to the symphysis pubis.  39 It is estimated that PGP affects between 23% to 65% of women during pregnancy, while post-partum rates across studies ranged from 8.5% experiencing symptoms 2 years post-partum and 10% to 19% at 11to 12 years post-partum.  3, 9, 16, 18, 31 umboPelvic Pain (LPP) is a broader term that describes low back pain and/or PGP without differentiating between these sites.  15 Although PGP prevalence is high, the most effective interventions to prevent and treat PGP are still largely unknown.  19 This is in part due to the fact that clinical studies examining the effectiveness of interventions for PGP not only report different outcomes but also use different instruments to measure these outcomes.  43 The heterogeneity in outcome measurement and reporting makes it difficult to synthesise data in meta-analysis to increase the certainty of effect measures.  42 To address this, an international consensusbased Core Outcome Set (COS) for pregnancy-related and postpartum PGP (the PGP-COS) was developed and reported.  30, 42 Consensus was achieved on 5 outcomes: namely, pain frequency, pain intensity/severity, function/disability/activity limitation, health-related quality of life and fear avoidance,  30  and provides an agreed set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials on PGP. Using the PGP-COS in this way will promote the consistency and relevancy in outcome measurement, and reduce research waste.  41 ollowing the development of the PGP-COS, it was deemed necessary to establish how best to measure the PGP-COS outcomes, as the penultimate phase of the overall PGP-COS study. The aim of this phase, which we report here, was 1) to identify measurement properties of instruments that are used to measure the outcomes in the PGP-COS through a systematic review of the literature; and 2) to reach consensus and provide evidencebased recommendations on what measurement instruments should be used to measure the outcomes of the PGP-COS."

The summarized measurement property evidence of each outcome measurement instrument was then compared against the criteria for good measurement properties and rated as either sufficient (+), insufficient (-) or indeterminate (?) based on criteria defined in the COSMIN guidelines.  24, 26 The quality of evidence for each measurement property, including overall content validity, was then rated as high, moderate, low or very low, using the modified version of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach as recommended by the COSMIN guidelines.  24, 26 Finally, feasibility evidence, including number of languages available, cost, length of instrument, time to complete, administration and existence of a dedicated website, of each outcome measurement instrument was synthesized.\n\nPhase 2: Consensus for evidence-based recommendations A virtual meeting to discuss and formulate recommendations for the instruments that should be used to measure the outcomes of the PGP-COS was held on July 10th, 2020. The meeting was chaired by FW and AR. Members of the meeting included the PGP-COS development steering committee and patient representatives. International and stakeholder representation was monitored as part of this process and was adequately achieved (see Results for participant characteristic details). Prior to the meeting, participants were sent the findings of the review and a copy of the outcome measurement instruments, and they were given the opportunity to contact the chairs with any questions. We also contacted patient representatives via email/phone to discuss and explain the documents in detail including the meaning of specific concepts and terminology. During the meeting, participants were again presented with the findings of the systematic review. Each outcome of the PGP-COS and the measurement properties, including feasibility, of the corresponding instruments identified in the systematic review were comprehensively discussed and considered in detail. Draft evidence-based recommendations for how to measure the 5 outcomes of the PGP-COS were developed at this meeting.\n\nFollowing the discussion meeting, panel members voted for final recommendations via an online Delphi survey hosted by Google Forms.  4, 13 In the Google Form, consensus meeting participants were provided with the draft recommendation statement for how to measure each outcome of the PGP-COS and asked to rate their level of agreement using the same 9-point scale used in the Delphi study of the PGP-COS development.  30 Participants were also given a further opportunity to provide any comments in a free-text response. A priori consensus for an instrument recommendation was determined as 100% of all members rating the recommendation as 7+ on the 9-point scale. To achieve consensus, it was agreed a priori that additional rounds of voting would take place with draft recommendations updated based on the feedback from the free-text responses provided by participants in the previous round(s) until consensus would be achieved according to the criteria specified above. The same a priori determined threshold was used for round 2 (100% rating the recommendation as 7 + on the 9-point scale)."

      "text": "Based on the evidence synthesis presented in Tables 1 -4, this systematic review did not identify an instrument with the high-quality evidence for all measurement properties outlined by the COSMIN guidelines or one that measures all outcomes in the PGP-COS. For this reason, it is not presently possible to recommend the use of a single validated measurement instrument that could measure all 5 of the PGP-COS outcomes. As such, we present recommendations for each PGP-COS outcome as follows:\n\n1) Pain frequency: We recommend the use of the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ) to measure this outcome. The PGQ measures only one aspect of pain frequency (pain in the morning and/or evening). If a deeper understanding of pain frequency is required, we recommend using additional measures. Table  3 .     2) Pain intensity/severity: We recommend the use of PGQ to measure this outcome. If a deeper understanding of pain intensity/severity is required, we recommend using additional measures such as the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), although these measures have only been assessed in one study in this population and more investigation is needed. 3) Activity limitations/function/disability: We recommend the use of PGQ to measure this outcome. It is important to note that relevance of items/activities included in the questionnaire might be culturally dependent; hence we recommend conducting further translations and cultural adaptations for different locations. 4) Health-related quality of life: We found only one study that assessed an instrument (SF-8) to measure health-related quality of life in this population. However, the SF-8 is not free for use. There is a need for assessment of other instruments for this outcome. We encourage further validation of instruments that are free for use. 5) Fear avoidance: We found only 1 study that assessed an instrument the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) to measure fear avoidance behavior in this population. We recommend the use of FABQ, but there is a need for further assessment of instruments for this outcome."

      "text": "A recent systematic review of outcomes and outcome measurements used in intervention studies or systematic reviews of interventions for women with PGP identified over 40 instruments used in the current literature to measure the outcomes of the PGP-COS alone.  43 However, the validation of these tools is incomplete since our systematic review identified only 17 studies that evaluated measurement properties of a total of 10 different PROMs that measure at least one of the PGP-COS outcomes.  2, 8, [10] [11] [12] 14, 17, 21, 25, 28, 29, [32] ] [33] [34] [35] [36] 45  These findings highlight not only the heterogeneity in outcome instruments used across intervention studies in women with PGP, but also uncertainty as to whether the outcome tools used are even appropriate for this population. Together, these discrepancies contribute to the difficulty in comparing the findings across studies and limit the ability to ascertain the most effective interventions for women with PGP. This further necessitates evidencebased recommendations for appropriate measurement instruments to measure the outcomes of the PGP-COS.\n\nWe examined the content validity of the 10 identified PROMs using the 3-step COSMIN methodology. In our systematic review, the 17 studies and their results for the measurement properties were reviewed and appraised using the robustly established COSMIN checklist and good measurement property tool.  24, 26 Generally, the methodological quality of included studies varied (Table  3 ). Similar to findings of a systematic review examining measurement properties of pain instruments in adult cancer populations, low ratings were typically due to insufficient sample sizes, vague or lack of inclusion of a priori formulated hypotheses, lack of information regarding the handling of missing items or regarding the constructs being measured by the comparator instruments or their measurement properties, or internal consistency statistics not being calculated for each subscale individually.  1 This indicates that further assessment of these measurement properties is still required. Finally, there was no identified PROM in which all 9 measurement properties established by the COSMIN guidelines have been evaluated for in a PGP population. Future research should aim to fill existing research gaps on these measurement properties. Overall, instruments that measured the pain and the function PGP-COS related outcomes were most frequently evaluated in the literature. This is not surprising considering that the European Guidelines for PGP focuses the aim of PGP treatment on relieving pain, improving functional ability and preventing recurrence and chronicity.  39 Measurement properties of other generic and low back pain condition-specific PROMs were also evaluated, although notably, the content validity of any of the generic or low back pain specific tools used to measure pain or function in PGP populations was not evaluated in these studies.  [5] [6] [7] 7] 43  It cannot be assumed, therefore, that the content validity would hold true in a PGP population without appropriate assessment. Therefore, studies examining the measurement properties of PROMS, in particular the content validity, used to measure the PGP-COS outcomes are still required."

      "title": "PGP-COS Instrument Selection Evidencebased Recommendations",
      "text": "The systematic review did not identify any instrument with the high-quality evidence for all measurement properties outlined by the COSMIN guidelines or one that measures all outcomes in the PGP-COS. For this reason, it is not presently possible to recommend the use of Table  6 . Pooled Feasibility of Each Patient Reported Outcome Measure Instrument a single validated measurement instrument that could measure all 5 of the outcomes of the PGP-COS. Therefore, the evidence-based recommendations, formulated and voted on by the consensus committee include multiple instruments. Notably, all measurement properties of these instruments, including the feasibility of their use, were discussed and taken into consideration during the consensus meeting when formulating the evidencebased recommendations.\n\nAs a result, the consensus committee recommended the PGQ to measure 3 of the 5 PGP-COS outcomes, namely pain frequency, pain intensity/severity, and activity/limitation/function/disability. The systematic review, conducted in Phase 1 of this study, established the PGQ as the only condition-specific instrument for PGP with its measurement properties the most commonly assessed amongst all 10 identified instruments in the current literature. The high-quality synthesized evidence from the review identified the PGQ as having sufficient internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, construct validity, and responsiveness across its various translations, which informed the recommendation for its use. Multiple feasibility considerations of the PGQ also contributed to its recommendation. For example, the availability of the PGQ in multiple translations was considered beneficial for uptake of the international PGP-COS. The PGQ is also well documented to take minimal time to complete which would reduce participant or researcher burden. Additionally, the PGQ can measure 3 outcomes of the PGP-COS, as its 2 subscales incorporate patients' subjective measurement of activity limitations and symptoms.  35 The activity limitations subscale measures the PGP-COS outcome function/disability/activity limitation, whereas the symptom subscale has questions that measure both pain frequency and pain intensity/severity (questions #21 & #22). The consensus committee agreed that these questions can measure both pain-related outcomes, as the PGQ requires patients to rate their subjective pain on a scale (intensity/severity) during both the morning and the evening (frequency). The inclusion of morning and evening assessments incorporates a frequency component to pain symptoms. While 2 timepoints provides less detail than, for example, a long-term pain tracking diary, it is feasible as a measure in all intervention studies and the clinical trials. By minimizing the number of instruments required to measure the outcomes, the PGQ can be easily integrated into future intervention study protocols, would help decrease data collection burden, and may thus positively impact the uptake of the PGP-COS. However, while the PGQ is currently recommended by the consensus committee, future work is still required to establish the non-evaluated measurement properties and to conduct further translations.\n\nSubsequently, the consensus committee predominantly recommended further assessment of instruments to measure health-related Quality of Life and fear avoidance (the remaining two PGP-COS outcomes) in women with PGP, as measurement properties of instruments measuring these outcomes was less established in the literature. The SF-8 was the only instrument that measured health related Quality of Life in this population but is not free of charge.  14 For that reason, the consensus committee included it in their recommendation, especially as the SF-8 has been translated and adapted into 30+ languages,  44  but also highlighted the urgent need for instruments freely available for use to be validated in this population. Finally, the FABQ activity subscale was the only fear avoidance instrument to have at least one measurement property assessed in a PGP population.  14 Similarly, the consensus committee recommended the FABQ to measure fear avoidance, but also highlight that further assessment of this and other instruments measuring fear avoidance is warranted.\n\nIt is important to note that these recommendations are established from current evidence. It is plausible that the recommendations may change as evidence from future studies evaluating the measurement properties of these and other instruments emerge. As such, we suggest that the recommendations on how to measure the PGP-COS, outlined in this paper, should be updated on a regular basis through an update of the systematic review and a subsequent consensus meeting to ensure that emerging future studies evaluating the measurement properties of instruments measuring these PGP-COS outcomes are considered."

      "text": "Although we have identified evaluations of 10 instruments used to measure the 5 PGP-COS outcomes in patients with PGP, the measurement properties and the quality of these instruments are only partially investigated. The PGQ is the most evaluated instrument across the literature. Based on current evidence, the consensus committee recommends the PGQ to measure pain frequency, pain intensity/severity and function/disability/ activity limitation; and the SF-8 and the FABQ to measure the health related Quality of Life and fear avoidance, respectively. Future research is urgently needed to establish additional measurement properties of these instruments and to further consolidate these recommendations. It is possible that these recommendations may change accordingly as further evaluations become available."
