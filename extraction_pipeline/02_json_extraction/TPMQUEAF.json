  "title": "Self-Monitoring via Digital Health in Weight Loss Interventions: A Systematic Review Among Adults with Overweight or Obesity",
  "abstract": "Objective: Self-monitoring is a core component of behavioral obesity treatment, but it is unknown how digital health has been used for selfmonitoring, what engagement rates are achieved in these interventions, and how self-monitoring and weight loss are related. Methods: This systematic review examined digital self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss interventions among adults with overweight or obesity. Six databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) were searched for randomized controlled trials with interventions \u2265 12 weeks, weight outcomes \u2265 6 months, and outcomes on self-monitoring engagement and their relationship to weight loss. Results: Thirty-nine studies from 2009 to 2019 met inclusion criteria. Among the 67 interventions with digital self-monitoring, weight was tracked in 72% of them, diet in 81%, and physical activity in 82%. Websites were the most common self-monitoring modality, followed by mobile applications, wearables, electronic scales, and, finally, text messaging. Few interventions had digital self-monitoring engagement rates \u2265 75% of days. Rates were higher in digital-than in paper-based arms in 21 out of 34 comparisons and lower in just 2. Interventions with counseling had similar rates to standalone interventions. Greater digital self-monitoring was linked to weight loss in 74% of occurrences. Conclusions: Self-monitoring via digital health is consistently associated with weight loss in behavioral obesity treatment.",

      "text": "Self-monitoring is a core component of standard behavioral obesity treatment  (1) . Selfregulation theories  (2, 3)  have suggested that behavior change occurs by self-monitoring a behavior (e.g., eating behavior) or a behavioral outcome (e.g., body weight) and then by comparing progress with a goal or past performance. This process heightens awareness of one's current behaviors and corresponding triggers, while also increasing self-efficacy and accountability  (4, 5) . For example, daily self-monitoring of one's food intake allows for an identification of eating patterns and a reflection on the ways in which dietary"

      "text": "changes correspond to weight loss progress. Self-monitoring tends to positively impact weight loss when combined with other self-regulation techniques, such as goal setting and feedback  (6) (7) (8) .\n\nPaper journals have traditionally been used to record self-monitoring entries but they pose challenges, including time demands, waning novelty, accessibility obstacles, and health literacy constraints  (9, 10) . Digital health approaches can mitigate some of these challenges. First, time-saving measures are built into some mobile applications (apps) and websites used for self-monitoring, including the use of comprehensive nutrition databases that automatically populate nutrition information and suggest commonly eaten foods.\n\nWearable technologies, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches as well as wireless electronic scales (e-scales), allow for more passive self-monitoring, thereby reducing effort and time constraints. Second, individualized feedback and tracking prompts found in some digital tools keep individuals engaged while conserving personnel resources. Third, smartphones and wearables (used by 81% and 34% of United States adults, respectively)  (11, 12)  have high portability, which promotes real-time self-monitoring while reducing retrospective errors. Fourth, digital health modalities that calculate caloric intake lessen numeracy barriers, and health literacy challenges can be reduced by using short messaging services (SMS; text messaging) or interactive voice response (IVR) to track concrete behavioral goals  (13) . Another benefit of self-monitoring via digital health is reduced trial attrition  (14) , likely because of the greater flexibility it affords participants in engaging in treatment.\n\nGiven the widespread prevalence of obesity, with rates of 42% among United States adults  (15)  and 13% worldwide  (16) , treatment options that have high efficacy, acceptability, and reach are needed. Digital health approaches have flourished in the past decade. As found in numerous reviews, interventions using technology-based modalities  (17) (18) (19) , including SMS  (20) , apps  (21, 22) , wearables  (23, 24) , and websites  (25) , often produce weight loss similar to or less than that of in-person interventions but better than that of control arms; however, these reviews did not focus on self-monitoring. The seminal review that examined self-monitoring by Burke et al. included studies published up to 2009 and found that greater engagement in selfmonitoring is associated with greater weight loss  (26) . Interventions in this review used mostly paper-based methods of self-monitoring, and the authors concluded that methodological limitations weakened the quality of evidence, such as by relying on self-reported engagement metrics or nonrandomized designs. A review by Zheng et al. in 2015 found that greater self-weighing was associated with greater weight loss; only two of the seventeen studies had objective selfweighing data, whereas the remainder relied on self-reported information  (27) .\n\nThere has yet to be a comprehensive review of digital self-monitoring in weight loss interventions for adults with overweight or obesity. The present systematic review addresses this gap and contributes to the science of engagement in behavioral interventions, which has been flagged as a needed area of study  (17, 28) . The primary aim of this systematic review was to determine whether digital self-monitoring is positively related to weight loss. The secondary aims were  (1)  to examine how digital health has been used for self-monitoring (i.e., what are the modalities used, items tracked, and frequencies prescribed) and (  2 ) to evaluate self-monitoring engagement rates in these interventions."

Included papers were required to be full-text manuscripts written in English and published between 2009 and 2019 (i.e., studies published after the  Burke et  al. review on selfmonitoring (26)). The Participants, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study design (i.e., PICOS) tool (29) was used to define the following research question: 1. Participants: Eligible trials included adults (aged 18 years or older) with overweight or obesity at baseline (i.e., BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 ). Studies comprising solely specific clinical populations, such as pregnant or postpartum women, patients receiving cancer treatment, and patients receiving psychiatric treatment, were excluded because of the unique treatment needs of those populations. 2. Interventions: Eligible trials included weight loss interventions that lasted a minimum of 12 weeks and involved at least one weightrelated behavior or outcome being self-monitored via digital health.\n\nThis length criterion was selected in order to filter out trials that described only intervention feasibility instead of efficacy. Weight gain prevention and weight maintenance trials were excluded from this review, as were feeding studies and interventions involving bariatric surgery or pharmacological agents. 3. Comparators: No restrictions were placed on the type of comparison arm. 4. Outcomes: Eligible studies were required to report weight loss outcomes (in kilograms, pounds, or as a percentage) at least 6 months post randomization in order to focus on efficacy rather than feasibility trials. They also needed to report self-monitoring engagement rates and the relationship between self-monitoring engagement and weight loss (e.g., correlation between self-monitoring and weight loss, weight outcomes divvied up by engagement level, isolation of the self-monitoring component with weight outcomes for each arm). For instance, studies were excluded if they reported only the number of website log-ins instead of reporting metrics specific to self-monitoring. 5. Study design: Only RCTs were included to emphasize rigorous methodological quality."

In September 2014, the following six electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. The latter was included to consider papers found in the gray literature. The search was updated in February 2016 and again in September 2019, repeating the earlier search strategies with the same six databases. The searches were limited to papers published between January 1, 2009, and September 16, 2019. The tailored search strategy for each database is shown in Supporting Information Table  S1 . Briefly, search terms included keywords involving weight loss, self-monitoring, and technology, which were separated by the Boolean operator \"AND.\" Within the main keyword groups, the Boolean operator \"OR\" was used to separate similar terms, allowing for increased sensitivity of the search. Hand searching of reference lists of included papers and of relevant systematic and narrative reviews was conducted  (17, 19, 21, 25, 30) ."

During this phase, both reviewers completed a brief electronic questionnaire (via Google Forms [Google, Mountain View, California]) to indicate whether an article should be included or excluded in the systematic review and, if excluded, the reason for exclusion. Exclusion criteria were presented hierarchically (as shown in Figure  1 ); the presence of only the first relevant criterion on the list was needed for exclusion. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus during discussion. Papers identified via hand searching underwent the same selection process. All screening and reviews were conducted in a masked fashion."

When applicable, outcomes were stratified by whether counseling was incorporated in the intervention, length of intervention, or type of comparison arm (i.e., no-treatment control vs. active comparator-arms with an intervention that did not include self-monitoring via digital health). An intervention was considered to have counseling if at least one session was offered to participants; otherwise, it was considered a stand-alone intervention. A trial had more than one \"occasion\" of self-monitoring if multiple behaviors were self-monitored and their engagement outcomes were reported separately."

Finally, among the 5 arms that incorporated self-monitoring of behavior change goals, 3 (60%) prescribed daily tracking, and 2 (40%) prescribed weekly tracking.\n\nDigital health modalities. Across all studies, the following seven digital health modalities were used for self-monitoring (Figure  3 ): websites, which were the most common modality (66% of treatment arms), followed by apps (33%), wearable devices (16%), e-scales (12%), SMS (12%), personal digital assistants (3%), and IVR technology (3%).\n\nNo studies used social media platforms for self-monitoring. Twentythree arms (34%) employed two or more digital health modalities for self-monitoring. There was no indication that modality type differed by year (data not shown).\n\nOf the 44 interventions that used websites for self-monitoring, 18 used a commercial website (e.g., CalorieKing, Weight Watchers Online), whereas 26 used a website created specifically for the study. Almost all of the interventions that leveraged a mobile app (19 out of 22) used a commercial app (e.g., LoseIt!, MyFitnessPal). Among the 11 interventions that self-monitored via wearables, a range of devices were used, such as armbands, wrist-worn Fitbit activity monitors, and Bite Counters.\n\nSeveral studies (16 out of 67) gave participants a choice regarding which modality to use for self-monitoring. For example, in Wolin et al. Measurement of self-monitoring engagement. All but two studies (79,80) objectively measured self-monitoring engagement. Most studies (27 out of 39) described the association between self-monitoring frequency and weight change, such as by reporting their correlation. Categorical outcomes were often reported as well. Fourteen studies described weight outcomes by engagement level (33-35,40,43,46,57,59,64,71,75,76,83,84), such as by reporting percent weight loss outcomes separately for low versus high self-monitoring categories. Seven studies compared selfmonitoring outcomes by weight loss threshold (45,49,51,54,56,65,71), such as by showing self-monitoring frequencies between participants with \u2265 5% versus < 5% weight loss. Nine studies isolated the effect of self-monitoring on weight loss in some way, either by varying the behavior being tracked or the modality used for tracking (32,40,42,47,48,62,78,79,81). Specifically, Allen et al. had two arms with intensive counseling, but only one included self-monitoring (32). Jospe et al. randomized participants to different self-monitoring strategies, including tracking diet using a commercial platform and tracking weight via SMS or the Web (48). Patel et al. randomized participants to track diet and weight simultaneously or sequentially (62). The following three studies conducted head-to-head comparisons of digital modalities for self-monitoring: Carter et al. compared app versus the Web (40), Dunn et al. compared a calorie app versus a photo tracking app (42), and Turner-McGrievy et al. compared an app versus a wearable Bite Counter (81). Three studies evaluated the impact of receiving an additional self-monitoring tool, either a wearable activity monitor  (47, 79)  or an e-scale  (78) . See Supporting Information Table  S5  for additional measurement details."

Among the digital health interventions that recommended daily self-monitoring, average self-monitoring rates reached \u2265 50% of intervention days in 33 out of 57 (58%) occasions, whereas rates reached \u2265 75% of days in just 5 out of 57 (9%) occasions. Unsurprisingly, engagement rates were higher when tracking intervals were shorter; for engagement rates reported about the first 3 months of an intervention (n = 15), 14 (93%) tracked items \u2265 50% of days, whereas 3 (20%) tracked items \u2265 75% of days. In comparison, when reporting engagement rates during the first 6 months (n = 33), 15 (45%) and 2 (6%) met the previously stated thresholds, respectively; for reporting engagement outcomes over a 12-month or longer interval (n = 8), 3 (38%) and 0 (0%) met these thresholds.\n\nWhen exploring these engagement rates by the behavior being selfmonitored, similarities were found (Figure  4  depicts a waterfall plot for each behavior). Among interventions with instructions to self-monitor weight daily, 11 out of 17 (65%) met self-monitoring rates of \u2265 50% of intervention days, whereas only 1 (6%) met the \u2265 75% of days threshold. Among the 19 interventions with a daily self-monitoring of diet, 11 (58%) and 2 (11%) met these respective thresholds. Of the 16 interventions with a daily self-monitoring of physical activity, 8 (50%) and 2 (13%) met these thresholds, whereas 3 out of 5 (60%) and 0%, respectively, met them among studies that reported engagement rates for a combination of tracked behaviors rather than reporting them individually.\n\nDays per week. Among the 20 interventions with a daily tracking recommendation that reported the average number of days tracked per week, 10 (50%) had an average self-monitoring engagement rate of \u2265 4 d/wk, and 3 (15%) had this for \u2265 6 d/wk. In the first 3 months, 3 out of 8 (38%) interventions tracked \u2265 4 d/wk, whereas 8 out of 11 (73%) did so among the 6-11 month interventions, and 0 out of 1 did so among the interventions 12 months and greater.\n\nWeeks over the length of the intervention. Finally, among the 18 interventions with a recommendation to track at least weekly and that reported a percentage of weeks tracked, 12 (67%) tracked \u2265 50% of weeks, whereas 7 (39%) tracked \u2265 75% of weeks."

Better performance occurred for 1 out of 3 instances of self-monitoring weight, 2 out of 5 for diet, and 2 out of 3 for physical activity.

Only in limited instances, such as when participants track all behaviors together via one modality, should one combined metric be used. \u25a1 If multiple modalities were used for self-monitoring a behavior (e.g., if participants had a choice between Web and SMS for tracking steps), collect and report rates of use of each modality. \u25a1 If contamination is suspected, such that participants are likely to use a modality they were not instructed to use for self-monitoring, collect and report this information (e.g., 5% of participants used a commercial app instead of the study-designed app for self-monitoring weight). \u25a1 Specify the time interval used for each engagement outcome."

      "title": "Key findings",
      "text": "This systematic review provides extensive evidence across 39 trials that self-monitoring via digital health is associated with superior weight loss. Of 68 associations reported between self-monitoring frequency and weight loss, 50 (74%) were positively related. This pattern was consistently repeated across a range of self-monitored behaviors, digital health modalities, and counseling types. Longer intervention duration tempered this relationship, however, suggesting that self-monitoring may be less effective for weight loss over time either because engagement declines or because rates of weight loss slow despite similar degrees of engagement. This primary finding supports the conclusions from prior reviews that focused predominantly on paper-based selfmonitoring methods  (26, 27)  and is also consistent with large-scale retrospective studies from industry platforms that used self-monitoring (85-89).\n\nSelf-monitoring multiple domains (diet, physical activity, and weight) via technology was highly prevalent, with only 11% of interventions self-monitoring just one domain. \"Daily\" was the most common self-monitoring prescription, though no known published, digital weight loss trials randomized participants to varying frequencies of self-monitoring.\n\nThe digital health modalities used for self-monitoring varied, with the Web being the most common (66% of interventions), followed by apps (33%), wearables (16%), e-scales (12%), and SMS (12%). Evidence suggests that these modalities have similar efficacy, though this has been examined in only a few head-to-head trials  (40, 42, 81) . Almost one in four interventions gave participants a choice for which modality to use for self-monitoring. With the rapid evolution of digital health devices and platforms, offering choices between modalities likely enhances convenience and flexibility and has been shown to promote engagement  (90) . Further, recent years have seen changing preferences toward accessing the Internet via a smartphone rather than a personal computer, particularly among Hispanic and Black adults, individuals residing in rural areas, and lower-income populations (91)-groups who all have heightened obesity risk  (15, 92)  and yet are traditionally underrepresented in obesity treatment  (93) . To address these changing attitudes and broaden the reach of behavioral obesity treatment, interventionists should leverage mobile platforms for self-monitoring. Additionally, offering ways to self-monitor that only require a regular cellphone, such as via text messaging or IVR technology, would promote access to these remote treatments given the 96% ownership of these devices among United States adults  (11) . Populations that may particularly benefit from these approaches include older adults and those in emerging economies, such as India or Brazil. Emerging economies have, on average, only 45% ownership of smartphones but 83% ownership of mobile phones  (94) . In the United States, 91% of adults aged 65 and older have a cellphone, but only 53% have a smartphone  (11) .\n\nThe findings from our review suggest modest engagement in digital self-monitoring, with many interventions meeting an average threshold of 50% of intervention days tracked but few meeting 75% of days tracked. Engagement varied by intervention type, with higher engagement rates found among interventions with shorter durations, unsurprisingly. Engagement was highest when self-monitoring weight, followed by diet, and then physical activity, though there is likely some confounding occurring because of varying frequency prescriptions between these domains and fewer opportunities to self-monitor physical activity duration among individuals who do not engage in moderate to vigorous activities each day. Moreover, engagement rates were higher in individuals who selfmonitored via digital versus paper-based methods (especially with diet). Surprisingly, pairing digital self-monitoring with counseling did not seem to improve engagement, compared with stand-alone interventions, perhaps because counseling was not intended to promote self-monitoring but rather to enhance skill building and problem solving. Given the high costs associated with counseling, it will be important to determine whether there are individuals who are better positioned for a stand-alone intervention rather than for an intervention with counseling.\n\nFurther, passive forms of self-monitoring, including using a wearable device to track physical activity or stepping on an e-scale to track weight, resulted in higher engagement than did active forms of selfmonitoring within an intervention, perhaps owing to the ease of integrating passive self-monitoring methods into one's regular routine. These findings are consistent with a retrospective study of a commercial platform, which found higher engagement when self-monitoring weight automatically (i.e., passively) via an e-scale versus manually (i.e., actively) by entering values collected from a traditional scale into an app; interestingly, however, only manual tracking of weight appeared to be associated with weight loss  (85) . It is possible that manually entering self-monitoring data into a device promotes greater awareness of one's current behavior than does passive selfmonitoring. Turner-McGrievy et al. found similar engagement rates between two diet-tracking arms (a Bite Counter [passive] vs. an app [active]), though the arms were combined when examining engagement's correlation with weight loss (81)."

By restricting eligibility to RCTs that assessed weight loss outcomes at 6 months or longer, we were able to limit our focus to studies that tested longer-term efficacy instead of those that tested only feasibility or acceptability. At the same time, we did not require a certain type of comparison arm, only that one existed, so that we could broaden our exploration of differences in self-monitoring"

      "text": "between a variety of arms. Among the studies included in the review, the risk of bias was predominantly low, with objective measurement of both weight and self-monitoring engagement commonly used.\n\nA challenge of digital health intervention research is the ever-changing nature of technology, as evidenced by the discontinuation or rapid decline of several devices used in these trials, such as PDAs. This variability of commercial consumer products and unsustainability of many investigator-designed products threatens the generalizability of some research. Further, although a strength of some interventions (n = 16) is the ability to give participants a choice as to which modality to use for self-monitoring (e.g., Web vs. app), this choice precluded our ability to directly examine the impact of each specific modality on selfmonitoring engagement rates.\n\nThe current review sheds light on challenges that arise when synthesizing engagement outcomes. One such challenge, as has been identified previously  (95, 96) , is that different operationalizations of engagement are used, precluding direct comparison of engagement across all studies via meta-analysis. Although we were able to gather the general trend in whether and how self-monitoring engagement relates to weight loss for each trial, differences existed in several domains, including the time point during which self-monitoring was measured, the recommendations made for how frequently participants should self-monitor, the reporting of means versus medians, the use of different denominators (or unreported denominators), and the use of different metrics (e.g., number of self-monitoring days per week vs. number of days per intervention, or the use of percentages or of \"entries\" instead of \"days\"). Additionally, some studies used a combined self-monitoring engagement metric rather than separately reporting engagement for each selfmonitored behavior, the latter of which is recommended  (97) . Some studies reported one engagement rate for all arms combined rather than parsing out the differences between arms. In response to these challenges, we provide a checklist of recommendations in Table  3  to enable future comparison of self-monitoring engagement across trials.\n\nThe behavioral obesity-treatment literature has been increasingly leveraging digital health tools for self-monitoring, yet many of these trials were excluded from this review because they failed to report selfmonitoring engagement rates (n = 38) and/or the relationship between self-monitoring and weight change (n = 38). Consequently, publication bias may occur if excluded studies found poor self-monitoring engagement or no significant association with weight loss and therefore did not report these outcomes. Studies are therefore encouraged to report these outcomes regardless of the findings in order to promote a better understanding of self-monitoring.\n\nInterpretations of our findings may be limited because of the potential for selection bias to overestimate the magnitude of our effects. Individuals were not randomized to differing levels of self-monitoring; instead, high self-monitors chose to engage more and therefore may differ from infrequent self-monitors in substantive ways. It is possible that the former group of individuals would have achieved successful weight loss without the use of self-monitoring, though a recent study suggests there is a bidirectional nature between self-monitoring and weight change  (44) .\n\nAdditionally, not all results reported were tested for statistical significance in the study itself (e.g., within-arm comparisons of engagement rates); therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting the findings of those comparisons. Further, our review was limited to adults, so these findings may not generalize to adolescent populations; however, two systematic reviews focusing on trials in pediatric settings (n = 9 and n = 6) found that mHealth and Internet-based interventions with selfmonitoring produced a small but significant effect on weight loss  (98, 99) ."

      "title": "Remaining gaps for future research",
      "text": "In order to improve the science of self-monitoring for weight loss, the field needs a more rigorous understanding of the unique impact of various self-monitoring strategies (e.g., simplified tracking), doses, and digital health platforms on engagement and weight outcomes. As support grows for optimizing treatments through efficient frameworks, such as the multiphase optimization strategy (100), trialists should consider experimentally addressing these questions to enable causal inference through methodologies such as factorial designs and sequential multiple assignment randomized trials.\n\nAnother important question remains surrounding how to stave off the boredom and non-usage attrition of self-monitoring. Empirically testing strategies to promote engagement is needed, such as enhancing novelty, taking breaks in self-monitoring, or adding peer support, personalized feedback, reminders, financial incentives, gamification, or coaching. An additional gap in the field is understanding predictors and moderators of self-monitoring engagement. In line with precision behavioral medicine, some individuals may do better with one self-monitoring approach over another. Examining these factors will help to optimize obesity treatment based on an individual's characteristics and needs."

      "title": "Clinical implications",
      "text": "From a clinical perspective, when engaging in lifestyle interventions as a first-line treatment, adults with overweight or obesity should be encouraged to self-monitor frequently in order to promote weight loss. Through regular self-monitoring, individuals can gain increased awareness about their eating and exercise behaviors, which allows them to track progress over time and compare that progress with prespecified goals. This self-regulatory process of gathering data and receiving feedback enables individuals to identify behaviors to change and, in doing so, can bring them closer to their health goals. This systematic review demonstrates that engaging in self-monitoring via digital channels is feasible and effective. Capitalizing on commercially available platforms, which were used in 86% of app-based interventions, may allow clinical providers to efficiently encourage self-monitoring."

This association held regardless of which domains were self-monitored or which digital modalities used. Engagement rates were higher in digital than in paper-based self-monitoring; no noticeable trend was detected when comparing these rates in counseling-based versus standalone interventions. The current literature solidifies the ability of digital health tools to facilitate self-monitoring for weight loss. Optimizing this process is the next frontier in order to further enhance self-monitoring engagement and thus produce better weight outcomes.O"
