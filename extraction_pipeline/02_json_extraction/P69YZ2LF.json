  "title": "A refined taxonomy of behaviour change techniques to help people change their physical activity and healthy eating",
  "abstract": "Background Current reporting of intervention content in published research articles and protocols is generally poor, with great diversity of terminology, resulting in low replicability. This study aimed to extend the scope and improve the reliability of a 26-item taxonomy of behaviour change techniques developed by  Abraham and Michie (2008)  in order to optimize the reporting and scientific study of behaviour change interventions. \n Methods Three UK study centres collaborated in applying this existing taxonomy to two systematic reviews of interventions to increase physical activity and healthy eating. The taxonomy was refined in iterative steps of (a) coding intervention descriptions, and assessing inter-rater reliability, (b) identifying gaps and problems across study centres, and (c) refining the labels and definitions based on consensus discussions. \n Results Labels and definitions were improved for all techniques, conceptual overlap between categories was resolved, some categories were split and 14 techniques were added, resulting in a 40-item taxonomy. Inter-rater reliability, assessed on 50 published intervention descriptions, was good (kappa = 0.79). \n Conclusions This taxonomy can be used to improve the specification of interventions in published reports, thus improving replication, implementation and evidence syntheses. This will strengthen the scientific study of behaviour change and intervention development.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "In order to improve the effectiveness of interventions to change behaviour, such as physical activity and healthy eating, it is necessary to replicate and accumulate evidence across empirical studies. This is not straightforward, as interventions to change healthrelated behaviours are usually complex, comprising many, often interacting components  (Craig et al., 2008) . Systematic reviews of the effects of physical activity and healthy eating interventions on behaviour or health outcomes often conclude that both the interventions as well as the effect sizes are extremely heterogeneous  (Avenell et al., 2004; Lemmens, Oenema, Klepp, Henriksen, & Brug, 2008; Ogilvie et al., 2007) . While some interventions are indeed highly effective in changing behaviour and relevant health outcomes, others fail to achieve such effects. Replication, accumulation and application of evidence depend on the ability to reliably specify the details of intervention content both for primary research and for secondary evidence syntheses.\n\nCurrent reporting of interventions in published evaluations falls short of the detail required for reliably identifying intervention content  (Dombrowski, Sniehotta, Avenell, & Coyne, 2007; Glasziou, Meats, Heneghan, & Shepperd, 2008; Michie, Fixen, Grimshaw, & Eccles, 2009)  and hence limits the possibility of identifying the effective ingredients within interventions  (Michie, Abraham, Wittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009) . Reporting of intervention content is often brief and imprecise with interventions being broadly characterized as, for example, \"behavioural counselling\", \"Cognitive Behavioural Therapy\" or \"motivational strategies\". In some cases reporting does not mention content but, instead, describes mode of intervention delivery such as \"face to face\" or \"nurse delivered\" or in terms of number of intervention sessions.\n\nWhere detail of intervention content is provided, such as in published intervention protocols, terminology is variable across intervention descriptions; the same label may be applied to different behaviour change techniques (BCTs) or different labels applied to the same technique. An example of the former is 'behavioural counseling' described both as \"educating patients about the benefits of lifestyle change, encouraging them, and suggesting what changes could be made\" (Steptoe,  Kerry, Rink, & Hilton, 2001, p.266)  and \"feedback on self-monitoring record, reinforcement, recommendations for change, answers to questions, and general support\"  (Tate, Jackvony, & Wing, 2003 , p.1834) .\n\nSimilarly, interventions reporting the use of 'goal setting' for dietary and physical activity behaviour change interventions differ substantially from each other  (Shilts, Horowitz, & Townsend, 2004)  and 'barrier identification' has been described as \"motivational messages\" that highlight \"perceived benefits of exercise while addressing perceived barriers and strategies to overcome those barriers\"  (Richardson et al., 2007)  or \"practical strategies\" used to increase \"the uptake of dietary and physical activity recommendations, given that people are concurrently managing family, work and study; may have limited finances;\u2026\"  (Pettman et al., 2008) .\n\nStandardized definitions of techniques are required to put the study of behaviour change onto a more scientific footing for at least four reasons: First, they are required to allow identification of which techniques contribute to intervention effectiveness. Accumulating evidence of what works is a necessary part of developing more effective and parsimonious complex interventions. Standardized definitions are invaluable for evidence synthesis in systematic literature reviews; without them, it is unclear how intervention content should be categorized in meta-analyses across studies  (Gardner, Whittington, McAteer, Eccles, & Michie, 2010) . Second, they allow authors of interventions to accurately describe interventions in a way that faithfully represents the implemented BCTs, thereby allowing accurate appraisal of the scientific evidence produced (e.g. Ara\u00fajo-Soares, McIntyre, MacLennan, & Sniehotta, 2009) . Third, standardization is necessary for reliably linking BCTs to mechanisms of action, and therefore understanding how interventions work  (Michie, 2008) . This allows intervention effectiveness to be optimized by providing knowledge about how techniques may be effectively combined together and how intervention effects are likely to generalize across situations. Moreover, such information is fundamental to theoretical development  (Sniehotta, 2009b)  and requires linking intervention techniques with theoretical constructs (e.g. Ashford, Edmunds, & French, 2010)  and theories of behaviour change (e.g. Michie, Johnston, Francis, Hardeman, & Eccles, 2008)    (Michie, Rothman, & Sheeran, 2007) . To identify specific BCTs contributing to intervention effectiveness, a standardized 26 item taxonomy to classify BCTs in physical activity and healthy eating interventions has been developed  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) . This taxonomy demonstrated reliability in judging the presence or absence of 26 techniques in three systematic reviews mainly of interventions aimed at changing physical activity and dietary behaviours. The taxonomy has had immediate impact on the field.\n\nTo date, the  Abraham and Michie (2008)  taxonomy has been used in systematic reviews  (de Bruin, Viechtbauer, Hospers, Schaalma, & Kok, 2009; Jacobs-van der Bruggen et al., 2009; Michie, Abraham et al., 2009; Renz & Newton, 2009) , reports of intervention development and study protocols  (Biran et al., 2009; Sanchez et al., 2009) , empirical reports;  (Albada, Van Dulmen, Otten, Bensing, & Ausems, 2009; Ara\u00fajo-Soares et al., 2009; Gardner et al., 2010; Hanbury, Wallace, & Clark, 2009)  and several editorials and position papers  (Hagger, 2009; Marks, 2009; Michie, Fixsen et al., 2009) . This work has contributed to the advancement of behavioural science and clarified the evidence base about behaviour change. For example,  Michie, Jochelson, Markham, & Bridle, 2009  reviewed the effectiveness of interventions to reduce smoking or increase physical activity and/or healthy eating practices in low income groups and found that effective interventions tended to use fewer BCTs. Two large-scale systematic reviews using the taxonomy and conducting meta-regression showed that interventions prompting participants to self-monitor their behaviour were more effective in achieving behaviour change. In line with this, both reviews found that interventions using more techniques associated with Control Theory  (Carver & Scheier, 1998)  achieved larger effects  (Dombrowski, Sniehotta, Avenell, MacLennon, & Ara\u00fajo-Soares, in press; Michie, Abraham et al., 2009) . These examples show how the availability of a standardised and reliable taxonomy of behaviour change may help towards the identification of 'active ingredients' through reviews of the literature, and facilitate comparisons between reviews.\n\nDespite this successful uptake, a descriptive taxonomy of BCTs is not written in stone. Additional iterations are needed to optimize reliability, comprehensiveness, theoretical coherence and relevance based on applications to different studies in different research centres  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) . Whilst the  Abraham and Michie (2008)  taxonomy marks a significant step forward in specifying intervention content, researchers have identified opportunities for further improvement. For example, the systematic review of interventions targeting low income groups mentioned above  (Michie, Jochelson et al., 2009)  identified two additional BCTs: prompt use of imagery, and environmental restructuring. The present research was a collaboration of three study centres arising from two independent research projects applying this taxonomy to systematically review interventions to increase physical activity and healthy eating. The collaboration aimed to extend the existing taxonomy to improve its comprehensiveness, ease of use and reliability, by clarifying definitions and labels and identifying and adding additional techniques. Similar issues arose in the two reviews, suggesting that findings generalise beyond the studies included in these reviews."

      "text": "The research teams engaged in an iterative process of taxonomy refinement based on (a) identifying problems (within teams), (b) revising taxonomy (within and across teams), (c) using a revised and extended version and calculating inter-rater reliability (within teams) and repeating the cycle until the taxonomy categories were conceptually clear and unambiguous and reliability was good. There were four iterations of this cycle that included coding one or two papers, calculating kappas and revising the taxonomy following group discussion of the three research teams. These refinements, such as revising existing technique labels and descriptions and adding extra ones that had been identified in the reviews, were agreed using an expert consensus approach, i.e., final definitions were agreed by all lead researchers in all three centres, based on the previous iteration and behaviour change theory.\n\nThe  Abraham and Michie (2008)  taxonomy was used as a starting point to code behaviour change intervention descriptions reported in systematic reviews conducted by two separate UK research groups. The interventions in these reviews targeted, respectively, (1) increasing physical activity and healthy eating in obese adults with additional risk factors for morbidity  (Dombrowski, Sniehotta, Avenell, MacLennon, & Ara\u00fajo-Soares, in press ) and (2) increasing self-efficacy to promote lifestyle and recreational physical activity  (Ashford et al., 2010; Ashford & French, in submission) .\n\nThese reviews comprised a total of 72 studies (n=44, ranging from 1-16 techniques and n=28, ranging from 1-12 techniques respectively) and ranged across a variety of populations, behaviours and settings.\n\nBoth research teams used the  Abraham & Michie (2008)  26 item BCT taxonomy to code the content of the interventions included in the systematic reviews they conducted. For full details of the application of the taxonomy in each of these reviews, see cited references above. The researchers identified and recorded problems with the use of the 26 item taxonomy, including a lack of clarity for certain techniques and their definitions, overlap between categories and missing categories. The method used by the study teams are outlined below. Four criteria were used to identify areas for possible improvement.\n\n1. Each time a discrepancy between coders emerged, the reasons for this were identified and possible solutions outlined. A solution was agreed on only when all teams considered it offered acceptable clarity and was sufficiently unambiguous to allow reliable coding."

In addition, the Aberdeen team used the 26-item taxonomy to describe a complex intervention for physical activity changes in an original report  (Ara\u00fajo-Soares et al., 2009) . Based on these experiences and subsequent team discussions, a list of questions that remained unresolved based on the published taxonomy and coding manual was further discussed with Charles Abraham and Susan Michie.

Following this, a first revised version of the taxonomy was developed with additional BCTs and revised definitions.\n\nFurther iterations of the taxonomy were produced, based on email correspondence between the three study teams, culminating in a 39 item version of the taxonomy.\n\nThe penultimate version of the taxonomy (39 items) was tested for reliability by one of the study teams (Coventry). Two independent raters (SA and Bishop [AB]) underwent four cycles of an iterative process of independent coding, calculation of kappas, and discussion of differences and further refinement of the taxonomy descriptions, using 10 intervention descriptions. Once good agreement was reached, SA and AB coded the intervention and control groups of the remaining 18 studies in the Ashford et al (2010) review, followed by re-coding the 10 studies previously coded.\n\nDespite achieving good inter-rater reliability, this version was slightly revised based on the problems encountered following completion of the coding for the Ashford et al review."

      "text": "A collaboration of three study centres applying a 26-item taxonomy of BCTs  (Abraham & Michie, 2008)  to intervention descriptions in two systematic reviews of interventions to increase physical activity and healthy eating  (Ashford et al., 2010; Dombrowski et al., in press ) has produced a more comprehensive, well specified and more clearly labelled taxonomy of 40 items, with good reliability: the 'Coventry, Aberdeen & London -Refined' (CALO-RE) taxonomy. The 2008 taxonomy was seen as a first step towards establishing a common language for intervention designers, reviewers and practitioners to specify the content of behaviour change interventions across two behavioural domains  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) . Although the 2008 taxonomy was a step forward in defining intervention content, and a necessary tool in advancing the science of behaviour change, the current work shows the importance of further systematic and rigorous development of this work. The CALO-RE taxonomy is more comprehensive, with fewer conceptual problems and less overlap between items, as well as clearer labels and definitions.\n\nWe recommend that primary and secondary researchers and those translating research evidence into practice use the CALO-RE taxonomy to specify behaviour change interventions aimed at increasing physical activity and healthy eating. Where necessary, authors may need to extend this taxonomy for their purposes and provide detailed definition clarifying the changes made. We also recommend that they take a similar approach to its development to that described here if the CALO-RE taxonomy is found wanting, and consider extending it to other behavioural domains. The extent to which CALO-RE will generalise without adaptation to other investigations of physical activity and healthy eating is an empirical question.\n\nDrawing on this work, a similarly specified taxonomy of 43 BCTs has been developed for smoking cessation interventions  (Michie, Hyder, Walia, & West, 2009) , which is informing a national training program of smoking cessation specialists in England ( http://www.ncsct.co.uk ). The BCTs within the smoking taxonomy have been reliably grouped into theoretically based functions of behaviour change, as a step towards linking BCTs with mechanisms of action  (Michie, Churchill, & West, in press ). This taxonomy has also been used in empirical research to analyse the protocols of the English NHS Stop Smoking Services and investigate the association between the inclusion of specific BCTs and 4-week smoking cessation outcomes, using data collected by the Department of Health  (West, Walia, Hyder, Shahab, & Michie, 2010) . Nine of the BCTs were significantly associated with both self-reported and CO-verified 4-week quit rates (e.g. strengthen ex-smoker identity, provide rewards contingent on abstinence, advise on medication, measure CO) and a further five were associated with CO-verified 4-week quit rates but not self-reported quit rates (e.g. facilitate/advise on use of social support, provide reassurance). The development of a taxonomy of BCTs for interventions aimed at reducing excessive alcohol intake is underway, part of a larger program of work to develop a cross-domain architecture of BCTs and a more comprehensive and sophisticated taxonomy. Whilst the majority of BCTs are interchangeable between behaviours, there are some that are domain specific e.g. \"assess withdrawal symptoms\" is appropriate only for addictive behaviours and \"advise on stop-smoking medication\" and \"measure CO\" are smoking-specific. Five BCTs were identified in relation to physical activity and healthy eating which were not used for smoking cessation or brief alcohol interventions. These reflect the fact that interventions for physical activity and healthy eating are primarily about initiating behaviour whereas the others are primarily about stopping behaviour. They were: \"prompt focus on past success\", \"provide information on where and when to perform the behaviour\", \"provide instruction on how to perform the behaviour\", \"teach to use prompts and cues\" and \"shaping\". The examination of BCTs across behavioural domains does allow the possible identification of BCTs found to be effective in one domain to be considered for use in others. For example, \"behavioural substitution\" occurred in brief alcohol interventions but not for the other behaviours, and could be potentially effective in interventions to reduce unhealthy snacking or in smoking cessation interventions.\n\nTaxonomies of BCTs are work in progress in developing useful methodological tools for behavioural science. For example, researchers addressing other issues may identify additional BCTs (e.g. feedback on progress toward achieving a behavioural goal) or subdivisions within current BCTs (e.g. different types of feedback on performance, such as behavioural, normative or comparative). As taxonomies of behaviour change techniques become more comprehensive, there will be a trade-off between precision and statistical power, particularly when using the taxonomy for meta-regression analyses in systematic reviews. Using 40 items in a meta-regression would require considerable power, certainly more than most reviews of behaviour change techniques have had to date. A possible solution for this problem is analyzing clusters of conceptually coherent BCTs or the collapsing of similar techniques according to research question or application (see  Michie, Abraham et al, 2009) .\n\nPart of our future programme of work is to develop and apply a methodology for linking BCTs to mechanisms of action (theory). Whilst we have not attempted this for the current taxonomy, this is essential to facilitate experimental tests of theory and theory development based on intervention research  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) . Establishing such links is not a trivial task. Many theories of behaviour hypothesise causal antecedents of behaviour (social, cognitive and/or environmental), but do not specify BCTs to change these antecedents  (Sniehotta, 2009a) . Some theories such as the Social Cognitive Theory  (Bandura, 1989)  do suggest techniques for changing central theoretical constructs, but evidence shows that BCTs other than those hypothesised to effect change might be more effective  (Ashford et al., 2010; Michie et al., 2008) . A recent expert rating exercise to link BCTs to theoretical construct domains showed that experts agreed in about 75% of the cases whether or not a BCT would be effective to modify a theoretical construct  (Michie et al., 2008) . However, there is considerable uncertainty about how exactly to match BCTs onto theoretical constructs; more research is needed and the developing taxonomies need to reflect this ongoing research.\n\nThe current CALO-RE taxonomy not only provides a reliable and improved means of reporting, evaluating and implementing evidence, but also offers the prospect of further integrating the means and the mechanisms of action. The CALO-RE taxonomy lays the basis for improving the reliable and systematic application of evidence and theory for physical activity and healthy eating interventions and the extension of this approach to other behavioural domains. It allows the possibility of specific links between BCTs and theoretical constructs, a helpful step for refining theory on the basis of intervention evaluations. This is a major undertaking that requires collaborative, systematic work using a comprehensive, parsimonious and reliable taxonomy of BCTs."
