  "title": "Prediction using a randomized evaluation of data collection integrated through connected technologies (PREDICT): Design and rationale of a randomized trial of patients discharged from the hospital to home",
  "abstract": "Background: Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly. A critical limitation is that they use data collected up until the time of discharge but do not leverage information on patient behaviors at home after discharge. Methods: PREDICT is a two-arm, randomized trial comparing ways to use remotely-monitored patient activity levels after hospital discharge to improve hospital readmission prediction models. Patients are randomly assigned to use a wearable device or smartphone application to track physical activity data. The study collects also validated assessments on patient characteristics as well as disparate data on credit scores and medication adherence. Patients are followed for 6 months. We evaluate whether these data sources can improve prediction compared to standard modelling approaches. \n Conclusion: The PREDICT Trial tests a novel method of remotely-monitoring patient behaviors after hospital discharge. Findings from the trial could inform new ways to improve the identification of patients at high-risk for hospital readmission.",

      "text": "Nearly 1 in 5 patients discharged from the hospital are readmitted within 30 days. There has been significant study examining how to design prediction models to identify patients at high-risk of readmission. If these approaches were successful, then effective interventions could be targeted towards those patients. However, most of these models perform poorly  [1] [2] [3] . A common limitation is that these models rely mostly on data from insurance claims and electronic health records up until the point of hospital discharge. They do not take into account other forms of data that measure patients' behaviors at home after they have left the hospital.\n\nOur daily health behaviors contribute significantly to our longer-term health  [4, 5] . The use of mobile technologies such as wearable devices and smartphones is increasing and offers the ability to remotely-monitor activity levels within the everyday lives of patients  [6, 7] . Several pilot studies have demonstrated associations between activity levels and patients' outcomes including hospital readmission  [8] [9] [10] , but more rigorous randomized trials are lacking. Data from other sources could also provide insights into patient behaviors. For example, data on prescription refills could reveal medication adherence rates. Data on credit scores and other forms of financial information could indicate both socioeconomic status and also financial risk-taking behaviors that may influence health behaviors. Validated questionnaires could be used to understand other patient factors such as social support and risk preferences.\n\nThe objective of PREDICT (Prediction using a Randomized Evaluation of Data collection Integrated through Connected Technologies) was to evaluate the effectiveness of hospital readmission prediction models that utilize novel data sources on daily patient behaviors such as activity levels, medication adherence, finances, and risk preferences. We will compare standard risk prediction models that rely on data up until the point of hospital discharge to models that incorporate information from these other data sources. We enrolled patients prior to hospital discharge and randomly assigned them to track activity levels at home using either a wearable device or smartphone and then compare how these methods for data collection differ in enhancing risk prediction models. The trial was conducted using a webbased platform at the University of Pennsylvania, called Way to Health  [11] , which facilitated patient enrollment, survey completion, automated study communications, and remote-monitoring of activity data."

All participants received $50 for enrolling in the trial and $50 for completing the 6-month period. Participants were randomly assigned to have their activity data collected remotely by either a wearable device or a smartphone application. The wearable device was provided free of charge and the smartphone application was available as a free download in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. To improve recruitment rates and provide equal incentives among the arms, participants randomized to the smartphone application arm were still given a wearable device after the 6 month period ended. Our prior work has demonstrated that these types of devices accurately track physical activity  [19] . Other elements of participant data were collected from a variety of sources and then aggregated to develop hospital readmission prediction. This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board."

Patients assigned to the smartphone arm were setup with the Withings Health Mate application which used accelerometers in the smartphone to track activity.

Data from electronic health records are collected up until the time of discharge with a 3 year look back for data not collected during the hospital admission. We will conduct preliminary descriptive analyses to compare univariate associations between the outcome variables (30-day readmission, 90-day readmission, and 6-month rehospitalization) and changes in data collected by the activity trackers (step counts, sleep duration, heart rate).\n\nWe will test the null hypothesis that the standard and enhanced model have similar predication for 30-day hospital readmission. For each arm, a standard model will be developed using electronic health record data up to the time of hospital discharge by fitting a multivariate logistic regression model to each of the binary dependent outcome variables using hospital and time fixed effects (month and year), and including independent variables for patient demographics, comorbidities, and length of stay in the hospital. The primary analysis will compare the standard model to an enhanced model that includes available data from the mobile devices (either wearable device or smartphone application) for predicting 30-day hospital readmission. Data from the activity trackers will be used to generate variables that represent monthly means for the measure (e.g. mean step counts during days 1-30, 31-60, etc) and proportion of missing day (e.g. 0.10 during day 1-30, 0.15 during days 31-60, etc). We will also generate variables to represent the change from each month to the next. We will use crossvalidation by randomly splitting patients within each arm into several cohorts (e.g. 10 cohorts of 25 patients) and compare the cross-validated c-statistic between the standard and enhanced models using the replication method  [24] . We will compare cross-validated c-statistics for the wearable device arm versus the smartphone arm to test if the remote-monitoring data collection methods differ in enhancing the prediction model.\n\nIn secondary analyses, we will fit enhanced models that also include independent variables that represent data from the validated questionnaires, credit scores, and medication adherence rates. We will use the same cross-validation methods to evaluate the c-statistic to evaluate if these data elements significantly improve model prediction.\n\nAll hypothesis tests will be 2-sided and use a significance level of P < .05."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "The PREDICT Trial evaluates novel methods to improve the prediction of hospital readmissions by leveraging data from disparate systems to understand behaviors that occur at home. The trial will directly compare different methods of collecting physical activity data remotely either through a wearable device or smartphone application. This data was collected by using Way to Health  [11] , a research technology platform that facilitates the collection of remote-monitoring data without using more personal intensive approaches. It will also compare other forms of data on finances, medication adherence, and validated assessments of participant characteristics.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, patients were enrolled while hospitalized which proved challenging at times and led to low enrollment rates (7.2%). Second, about one-third of patients approached were not eligible because they did not own a smartphone and findings may not be generalizable to those without this form of technology. Third, physical activity data was collected on step counts and did not include other forms of activity.\n\nDaily behaviors play a significant role in individuals' longer-term health  [4, 5] . However, most readmission prediction models do not include data about these behaviors. Our trial has demonstrated that collecting these types of data is feasible. The use of wearable technology allowed for remote monitoring of patient generated physical activity data which provided reliable data, was easy to use, and scaled. The findings from this study will help to understand the ways in which these data sources can improve the identification of patients at high-risk of hospital readmission."
