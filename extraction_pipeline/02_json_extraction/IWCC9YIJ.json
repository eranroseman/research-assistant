  "title": "Preventive Health Behavior Change Text Message Interventions: A Meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Context: Existing evidence shows that text message interventions can produce short-term health behavior change. However, understanding is limited regarding intervention characteristics moderating this effect or the long-term effectiveness of text message interventions on behavior change after contact stops. Evidence acquisition: MEDLINE, PubMed Central, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched for articles published between April 2008 and December 2014 that evaluated an intervention targeting preventive health behaviors, delivered primarily by text message. Evidence synthesis: Intervention development and design characteristics and research outcomes were evaluated for 51 studies. Thirty-five studies were included in a meta-analysis (conducted in 2015) examining overall effect size and moderators of effect size. The overall pooled effect of interventions was d\u00bc0.24 (95% CI\u00bc0.16, 0.32, po0.001) using outcome data collected most proximal to intervention cessation. Seven studies collected data following a no-intervention maintenance period and showed a small but significant pooled maintenance effect (d\u00bc0.17, 95% CI\u00bc0.03, 0.31, p\u00bc0.017, k\u00bc7). Few variables significantly moderated intervention efficacy. Interventions that did not use a theoretic basis, used supplementary intervention components, and had a duration of 6-12 months were most effective. The specific behavior being targeted was not associated with differences in efficacy nor was tailoring, targeting, or personalization of text message content. Conclusions: Text message interventions are capable of producing positive change in preventive health behaviors. Preliminary evidence indicates that these effects can be maintained after the intervention stops. The moderator analysis findings are at odds with previous research, suggesting a need to examine moderators at the behavior-specific level.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "H ealth interventions delivered via mobile technologies (mHealth) are rapidly expanding. One area of mHealth that has captured the attention of health behavior change specialists is text messaging.  1 he first systematic reviews of text message interventions appeared in 2009.  2, 3 Both acknowledged that text message interventions produced positive short-term behavior change, but few high-quality studies were available.  2, 3 ince then, studies in this area have multiplied exponentially.  4, 5 Despite increased reviewable material, subsequent reviews have highlighted methodologic issues including weak study designs and inadequate sample sizes, interventions lacking theoretic foundation, and failure to isolate the impact of text messages in multistrategy programs.  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  Two recent meta-analyses have quantified text message intervention effects on preventive health behavior change.  10, 11 Free et al.  11  calculated pooled effect size estimates for interventions targeting the same preventive health behavior and found positive effects for smoking cessation, but limited evidence for effects for weight change via physical activity and diet improvements. Owing to strict inclusion criteria, each meta-analysis included between two and five interventions, limiting the reliability and generalizability of results.  16 Head and colleagues  10  reported a small weighted effect size (d\u00bc0.33) from their meta-analysis of 19 studies evaluating health promotion text message interventions. These and four other behavior-specific reviews  [16] [17] [18] [19]  provide support for text message interventions producing shortterm health behavior change.\n\nThe challenge now is to understand how intervention characteristics impact intervention efficacy so future iterations adopt evidence-based best practices. Behavior change interventions are most effective when developed using a theoretic basis  20, 21  and formative work with the target group.  1 Features such as duration, supplementary intervention components, and tailoring and targeting of content can also influence efficacy,  [22] [23] [24]  but understanding is limited regarding the relative importance of these characteristics in text message interventions. Head et al.  10  reported that targeted behavior, message tailoring, personalization, and frequency moderated effect size, although several comparisons were based on few studies. More reliable evidence may inform more effective intervention development. The long-term impact of text message interventions is also unknown, particularly for preventive behaviors where sustained change is necessary to attain health benefits (e.g., smoking cessation, physical activity).\n\nThis review aims to (1) evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of text message interventions for improving preventive health behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity); (2) identify effective characteristics of text messaging programs; and (3) explore the efficacy of text message interventions following a no-intervention maintenance period. This review strengthens evidence from previous reviews by focusing on complex lifestyle behaviors; excluding studies that target short-term prompts to action (e.g., medication adherence); reviewing outcomes that better inform translation into practice (such as end of intervention rather than mid-intervention effects)  10  ; and avoiding exclusion of non-RCTs that often represent translational research."

Interventions with non-text message components were included if text messaging was the primary intervention method (450% of contact via text messages). Interventions that only included children; offered text message reminders (e.g., appointment reminders); or prompts to use intervention resources were excluded as were interventions primarily focused on selfmanagement of existing conditions (e.g., diabetes). Inclusion in the meta-analysis required studies to have an RCT design.\n\nAfter removing duplicates, titles and abstracts (where necessary) were screened for inclusion. Full-text articles were retrieved and reviewed for remaining records. Uncertainty about inclusion was reviewed by three authors (AA, YM, AM) and discussed until consensus was achieved."

Messages were considered targeted if they were intended for a population subgroup with content based on shared group characteristics, tailored if they were unique to an individual based on assessed characteristics,  26  and personalized if they included the participant's name. Messages could be targeted or tailored on behavioral (e.g., smoking status, weight); psychosocial (e.g., beliefs, perceptions); or demographic characteristics (e.g., gender). Interactivity was defined as low if participants were required to send text messages to researchers less than weekly, moderate if weekly or more but less than daily, and high if daily or more frequently."

      "text": "Data for quantitative analysis included means, measure of variance, proportions, and sample size for each group outcome at all follow-up times. The standardized mean difference for the primary outcome(s) was calculated as an effect size indicator. To combine outcomes reported in continuous and categorical formats, ORs were transformed into standardized mean differences. For studies where multiple groups received primarily text message interventions or where more than one control/comparison group existed, those respective groups' data were combined to conservatively estimate the effect of any text message intervention relative to all non-text message conditions. This increased standardization across studies (as control/comparison group treatment ranged from measurement only to various non-text message interventions). For studies not identifying a primary outcome or including more than one, outcome data were averaged into a single composite outcome. (Appendix Table  2  [available online] reports effect sizes for each outcome and the overall composite outcome.) Effect sizes were calculated using the primary outcome(s) data closest to the end of the intervention unless a specific data time point was identified by authors. Effect size magnitude was interpreted according to Cohen's guideline for effect size (d\u00bc0.20-0.49, small effect; d\u00bc0.50-0.79, moderate; and dZ0.80, large).  29 n additional effect size was calculated for studies reporting outcomes following a no-intervention maintenance period to assess maintenance of intervention effects. All outcome data collected following a no-intervention maintenance period were combined to calculate the maintained effect size.\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3.3.070. Standardized effect sizes were weighted by their inverse variance. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled effect estimates for intervention effects and a secondary analysis of maintenance effects. One study at a time was removed to test the impact of each on overall effect size. Effect size heterogeneity was examined using the Q statistic and I 2 . Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots, calculating fail-safe N values and trim-and-fill analysis.  30 ffect sizes for hypothesized categorical moderator variables were calculated using a mixed effects model and compared using the Q B statistic. Moderator variables were selected based on known influence on text message intervention effectiveness (targeted behavior, message tailoring, personalization, and frequency 10 ) or interventions using other mediums (theoretic basis, formative work, intervention duration, supplementary components, and tailoring and targeting of content  [22] [23] [24] , and other features commonly manipulated in text message interventions (variability in message frequency and interactivity)."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This comprehensive review of text message interventions for preventive health behavior change confirms their efficacy for improving behaviors in the short term. It provides preliminary evidence that small, sustained intervention effects are possible, and contributes further evidence about which specific text message intervention development characteristics (i.e., not having a theoretic basis, use of supplementary materials, and length of intervention) can increase their efficacy.\n\nQualitative review of 51 studies found 22 demonstrated no change in primary outcomes, 11 demonstrated positive change, and 13 showed mixed effects. However, most studies (k\u00bc40) were underpowered to detect change or did not report sample size calculations, so the reported lack of effects may not adequately reflect potential impact. More than half of those studies with calculable effect sizes (k\u00bc20) had a positive small to large effect size.\n\nThe meta-analysis generated a small but significant positive overall pooled effect size for text message interventions immediately post-intervention. This main finding is consistent with recent meta-analyses, including that by Head and colleagues,  10  which included a variety of health behaviors (d\u00bc0.33, 95% CI\u00bc0.27, 0.39, k\u00bc19) and another  84  that appeared subsequent to initiating this review (including articles up to December 2012; g\u00bc0.29, 95% CI\u00bc0.22, 0.36, k\u00bc38). The slightly smaller pooled effect size in this review may be accounted for by moreconservative criteria for calculating effect sizes.\n\nThree intervention development characteristics (targeted behavior, reported theoretic basis, and reported formative work) and eight intervention features (message frequency, variability of frequency, intervention duration, interactivity, supplementary materials, tailoring, targeting, and personalization) were investigated as potential moderators of effect size. Interventions without theoretic foundation had larger effects than those guided by at least one theory. Although at odds with common recommendations,  20, 21  another meta-analysis of 190 studies showed that diet and exercise interventions with a theoretic basis were no more effective than those  March 2017 without.  85 Although simply dichotomizing reported use of theory may have misrepresented the importance of theory on effects, improved reporting of theoretic application is required for more detailed exploration of how theory use relates to intervention efficacy.  86 ommonly used theories may not be suited to text message interventions.  83, 87 Text messaging allows continued and immediate interactivity with unique opportunities to modify message content and timing. These characteristics are disconnected from the staged or static assumptions of many health behavior change theories  83  ; new theories that consider the unique characteristics of text messaging and mHealth  87, 88  or the use of computational models of behavior change that take into account the dynamic nature of, and feedback loops achievable with, mHealth should be developed.  89, 90 indings suggest equal efficacy across the different reviewed behaviors, with some necessary qualifications. Variation in the quality and quantity of evidence (and therefore intervention sophistication) was evident between different target behaviors. Smoking cessation and physical activity have longer intervention development histories than other examined behaviors.\n\nOnly two of the investigated intervention characteristics showed differences in effect size: use of supplementary intervention components and intervention duration. Supplementary intervention contact increased the effect size of interventions. Interventions delivered via other modalities commonly use supplementary materials to enhance effectiveness.  91, 92 Programs delivered via text messages should make the most of text messaging's distinctive features (e.g., real-time prompts, instantaneous two-way communication between participant and interventionist), while supplementary components may reinforce strategies offered by text by providing in-depth information, allowing for social comparison and small group interactions. For intervention duration, visual data inspection indicated greatest efficacy of interventions lasting between 6 and 12 months, although CIs overlapped for all categories.\n\nThe pooled effect size following a no-intervention maintenance period was positive but small. This finding is based on relatively few studies and may be affected by publication bias but provides preliminary evidence that text message interventions may have a sustained impact on behaviors. Future text message intervention research should prioritize maintenance evaluation and reporting (regardless of the direction of findings).\n\nCaution is warranted when comparing the findings of this review to those of previous reviews.  10, 11, 84 Though the timing of literature searches were similar (i.e., January 1990 to September 2010  11  ; to October 1, 2011  10  ; to December 2, 2012  84  ), different inclusion criteria make direct comparisons problematic. Free et al.  11  conducted several small behavior-specific analyses, including interventions comparing groups that differed only in receipt of text messages. Head and colleagues 10 included health promotion interventions that incorporated text messaging but were not necessarily primarily delivered by text message, and included interventions for simpler behaviors such as medication reminders. Orr and King 84 also included simple text message interventions such as appointment and medication reminders, and complex chronic disease management interventions.\n\nAll previous reviews have a consistent main finding: Text message interventions have a small to moderate effect on improving health behaviors.  10, 11, 84 There are varying results for the effects of moderators. Review findings are similar in that message interactivity,  10, 84  tailoring or personalization, and frequency  84  did not moderate intervention effects. Moderator analyses differed in that effect size changed across behaviors and with message tailoring and targeting, and personalization, but found no impact of supplementary resources.  10 ariation in moderator findings may be attributable to differences in inclusion criteria that interact with moderators, or in definitions of moderators between reviews. For example, Orr and King 84 combined text message personalization, tailoring, and targeting in one moderator; Head et al.  10  compared tailoring and targeting to each other but kept personalization separate; and the current review looked at each of these independently. This review also used a conservative approach in selecting data to be included in analyses (e.g., when there were multiple follow-up time points, end of intervention data were used as opposed to data from shortest-term followup  10  ). These factors may all impact the comparability of findings across reviews.\n\nInterventions included in the meta-analysis were tailored or targeted on a wide range of characteristics (e.g., behavioral performance, demographics, behavioral barriers). The impact of tailoring/targeting may depend on characteristics used; targeted behavior (e.g., smoking cessation versus condom use); or type of behavior change (e.g., stopping behavior versus taking up a new behavior  10  ). As such, combining effects across behaviors may mask the efficacy of specific characteristics for distinct behaviors. There may be other factors moderating the relationship between message characteristics and efficacy such as participant demographics or type of language used in messages (i.e., \"text speak\" abbreviations). More refined synthesis and investigation of intervention development factors is warranted.\n\nGiven the positive overall finding of this and previous reviews and the mass-reach potential of text messaging, new research should focus on dissemination. There is already some evidence that intervention effects can be successfully scaled up and are cost effective.  93, 94 Of the research reviewed here, three programs have demonstrated similar (or greater) effect sizes in the same outcomes between their pilot research and larger RCTs.  32, 34, 35, 43, 59, 64 Carefully and strategically designed large-scale studies should have the capacity for subtle manipulations of intervention design or implementation characteristics to better elucidate moderators of text message intervention effect."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The data included in this review are limited by the concise explanations offered in publications and in some cases the inability to make contact with authors. Some moderator findings are less robust owing to small numbers of studies in some categories. One should not assume that intervention characteristics that were found to be unrelated to efficacy for behavioral impact are unimportant (e.g., message tailoring), as these characteristics may be important for user acceptability or uptake of a text messaging program, which may be equally important to overall impact.  95"
