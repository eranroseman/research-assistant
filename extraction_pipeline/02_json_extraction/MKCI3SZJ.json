  "title": "Effectiveness, reach, uptake, and feasibility of digital health interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials",
  "abstract": "Background Digital health interventions have shown promising results for the management of type 2 diabetes, but a comparison of the effectiveness and implementation of the different modes is not currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA 1c at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA 1c reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. Findings Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA 1c ) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a -0\u202230 (95% CI -0\u202242 to -0\u202219) percentage point greater reduction in HbA 1c , compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA 1c reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (-0\u202242% [-0\u202263 to -0\u202220]) and via SMS (-0\u202237% [-0\u202257 to -0\u202217]), but not when delivered via websites (-0\u202209% [-0\u202264 to 0\u202246]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. Interpretation Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.",

      "text": "Type 2 diabetes affects an estimated half a billion people worldwide,  1  with a cost in excess of US$1\u20223 trillion per annum.  2  The risk of adverse outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and the cost of managing this condition can be reduced by lowering blood glucose levels, in addition to correcting hypertension and dyslipidaemia.  3 urrent guidelines recommend that adults with type 2 diabetes should reach a glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) of less than 7\u20220% (53 mmol/mol) as part of their glycaemic control.  4 elf-management, education and support have been recommended to enhance individuals' knowledge, skills, and the tools needed for the successful sustainable control of their clinical condition.  5 Digital health interventions present a feasible and effective means of type 2 diabetes self-management.  [6] [7] 7] [8]  Since the introduction of the first smartphone in 1994,  9  mobile phones have rapidly evolved to allow for a plethora of diverse capabilities to facilitate health education and support of self-management.\n\nAs of January, 2023, 6\u202292 billion people in the world (86%) have access to a smartphone, and another 410 million people use a conventional mobile phone, accounting together for 92% of the global population.  10 elehealth can also be more convenient and accessible than traditional face-to-face health-care delivery, because it can be delivered synchronously or asynchronously.  11 ynchronous refers to the delivery of health information in real time (eg, via a telephone call) and asynchronous refers to the store-and-forward technique of health infor mation-ie, the transmission of health information from the health-care provider to a patient (eg, via SMS). Synchronous interventions can use telephone or video-conference calls as well as mobile phone applications that collect clinical data, such as blood glucose or blood pressure, and transmit these in real time allowing for the health-care professional to provide prompt advice about titrating and adjusting medications such as insulin.  12 Synchronously delivered social media interventions can also use online forums in which patients can engage with peers, discuss the challenges they are facing, and interact with health-care professionals in real time, facilitating the identification of barriers and enablers to successful glycaemic control.  12 synchronous interventions use SMS to reinforce appropriate behavioural changes-eg, performing adequate physical activity, eating a sufficient amount of vegetables, or using online tools that provide general condition-specific education.  12 revious reviews have highlighted key determinants of the effectiveness of digital health interventions such as education, feedback, and communication between health-care provider and patient,  13  but these reviews did not compare the effectiveness of different synchronous and asynchronous digital health intervention tools such as SMS, smartphone applications, and website-based tools.  [14] [15] ] [16] [17] [18]  To our knowledge, this systematic literature review and meta-analysis is the first to synthesise and compare the current evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of different modes of digital health interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes. Our research question was how do smartphone applications, SMS, and websitebased interventions compare in terms of their reach, uptake and feasibility, and their effectiveness in reducing HbA 1c in people with type 2 diabetes during the past thirteen years (2009-22)?"

      "text": "The protocol and reporting of this systematic review and meta-analysis were consistent with the 2020 PRISMA guidelines.  19 APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE were searched on May 25, 2022, using broad search terms and MeSH terms. The search strategy was optimised to capture studies in people with type 2 diabetes and hypertension using search terms such as \"type 2 diabetes\", \"t2d\", \"t2dm\", \"diabetic\", \"high blood glucose\", \"hypertension\", \"high blood pressure\", and \"hypertensive\". The complete search strategy is in the appendix (pp 2-7). Due to the volume of data, and to allow an in-depth discussion, the findings in people with hypertension are reported in a separate manuscript.  20 In addition to the database searches, we hand-searched the reference lists of reviews of digital health interventions.\n\nCitations and abstracts of all retrieved studies were imported into Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Duplicates were removed and the remaining studies were assessed for inclusion by two researchers (GS and JJ). The full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is in the appendix (p 8). Briefly, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, pilot RCTs, crossover RCTs, and prospective RCTs of type 2 diabetes management programmes in adults, implementing digital health interventions and published in English from Jan 1, 2009, to May 25, 2022, (the date that the last searches were conducted) were considered for inclusion. Any type of digital health intervention, except for telecounselling or telemonitoring, was eligible for inclusion. Trials were excluded if the control group or groups received substantial intervention using digital tools (appendix p 8). To reflect current practice, only contemporary publications after 2009 were considered, because that was when digital health applications started to become widely adopted.  21 The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO, CRD42021247845."

To increase the precision of the point estimate, when only between-group and not withingroup differences were reported, the latter were requested from the authors. If SE was reported instead of SD, then this was converted to SD using the formula: SD = SE \u00d7 \u221an. If 95% CI was reported instead of SD or SE, then the SD was calculated as described in chapter 7.7.3.2 of Cochrane's handbook.  25 Studies that did not report SD, SE, or 95% CI (and the authors of which did not respond to our request to obtain these values) were excluded from the metaanalysis. The effect sizes and SDs of the studies were pooled using the random-effects model. The randomeffects meta-analysis model was selected, despite resulting in wider CIs around point esti mates, because heterogeneity was expected due to the differences in study populations and procedures.  26 The robustness of the estimate was assessed via a series of sensitivity analyses that included sequentially removing each study and reanalysing the remaining datasets to identify if a single study was responsible for the direction of associations, and by testing whether the fixed-effects model would produce different results, as per the guidelines in chapter 9.7 of Cochrane's handbook.  25 he assumption of homogeneity of true effect sizes was assessed by the Cochran's Q test, and the degree of inconsistency across studies (I\u00b2) was calculated.  27 \u00b2 describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error and ranges between 0% (no inconsistency) and 100% (high heterogeneity) with values of 0-40% suggesting low heterogeneity, 30-60% moderate heterogeneity, 50-90% substantial heterogeneity, and 75-100% considerable heterogeneity.  25, 27 Subgroup analyses per mode of intervention were carried out to assess possible causes of heterogeneity.\n\nPublication bias was assessed by visually inspecting a funnel plot of the mean change in HbA 1c plotted against the corresponding SE, on the assumption that interventions with HbA 1c reductions and with larger samples were more likely to be published.  25"

All 26 studies included in the meta-analysis were given an initial score of +4 for quality of evidence, because observational studies were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed as explained and in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration.  22 Serious risk of bias (eg, absence of appropriate randomisation) resulted in loss of a point. Inconsistency (eg, due to substantial heterogeneity [I\u00b2>50%]), also incurred a negative point.  29 mprecision (eg, when the 95% CI of the pooled effect overlapped the line of no effect) also downgraded the quality of evidence total score by a point.  30 The final GRADE score was the sum of all eight categories of evidence (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, large effect, dose response, and all plausible residual confounding). Quality of evidence was classified as high (\u22654 points overall), moderate (3 points), low (2 points), or very-low quality evidence (\u22641; appendix p 9).  31"

After removing 1060 duplicates, 2182 abstracts were assessed for eligibility (figure  1 ); 1973 abstracts were excluded along with 13 records that did not have full texts. 111 full-text articles were excluded, and reasons for exclusion are listed in the appendix (pp 10-18). After removing 29 additional studies that focused exclusively on people with hypertension (these data will be reported elsewhere  20  ), 56 studies reporting the effectiveness of interventions in people with type 2 diabetes were included in the systematic review,  and 26 studies were included in the meta-analysis.\n\nFrom the 56 studies, 11 486 participants from 24 regions were included (table  1 ). Most studies were conducted in China (n=11) and the USA (n=10; appendix p 48). All six continents were represented in this systematic review, albeit not equally, with Asia contributing 33 studies and the Americas another 13. Five studies took place in Europe, two in Africa, and three in Oceania. 28 studies were conducted in high-income economies, 17 in uppermiddle-income econ omies, and 11 in lower-middleincome economies, according to the World Bank classification.  94 41 studies were conducted from 2016 and after, and 15 between 2009 and 2015. All studies were RCTs, with 45 employing a parallel group design, two being cluster, three pilot, and six prospective (appendix pp 49-50). 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention,  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55]  25 used smartphone applications,  and 11 used websites.  [83] [84] 4] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93]  Interventions varied to align with the purpose of each study (appendix pp 19-47). SMS i erventions delivered educational messages to increase participants' literacy on aspects of their condition and the importance of lifestyle modifications such as physical activity and diet, promote medication adherence, provide reminders for regular self-monitoring of blood glucose levels or blood pressure, and increase medication adherence and adjustment (eg, titration of insulin doses). 44  Behaviour change models (eg, the transtheoretical model) were employed to promote motivation. 45  Studies that included immigrants adjusted SMS to the language of participants. 38  Other studies personalised content to the demographics of participants (eg, education status 39 and ethnicity). 40  SMS frequency ranged from daily to weekly.\n\nSmartphone applications were also used for education, 56 but due to the capabilities of modern smartphones, applications included additional features that enabled telemonitoring and communication between participants and health-care professionals as well as participant group chats. Some studies offered free-of-charge feedback ad libitum via the application.  56 Several application interventions required participants to regularly self-monitor their blood glucose levels or blood pressure, and to log these values, along with their food intake, physical activity, and medication, allowing health-care professionals to provide real-time advice for medication adjustment and tips for lifestyle modifications. To allow this real-time monitoring and advice, most application interventions included one or more telemonitoring devices such as external or inbuilt accelerometers, but also ingestible sensors, and adhesive wearable sensor patches.  62 Bluetooth technology was also used for communication between different wearable sensors and the application.  63 few studies assessed the effect of applications alone, compared with application plus telemonitoring, on relevant clinical parameters.  61 Other applications included sending alerts to physicians, with atypical readings triggering prompt intervention.  76 Teleconsultations were facilitated by inbuilt features such as voice, video, picture, or SMS.  77 Effective interventions that used diet logs incorporated culturally adjusted food databases that 3242 records identified 800 Cochrane Central 1054 Cinahl 851 Embase 510 MEDLINE 14 PsycInfo 13 from hand-searching reference lists 6 for hypertension 7 for type 2 diabetes 2182 titles and abstracts screened 1060 duplicate records removed 209 articles included for full-text screening 196 full texts were screened 82 studies* (85 full texts \u2020) were included in the systematic review 56 studies (58 full texts) in people with type 2 diabetes* \u2021 29 studies (30 full texts) in people with hypertension* 26 studies included in meta-analysis in people with type 2 diabetes 1973 records excluded 505 ineligible participants 389 ineligible intervention 888 ineligible outcomes 191 ineligible study design 13 records excluded because they did not have full texts 111 full texts excluded 31 ineligible population 20 ineligible intervention 50 ineligible outcomes 9 ineligible study design 1 retracted article 30 studies excluded from meta-analysis in people with type 2 diabetes because data was not available in the format required Figure 1: Study selection *Three studies included participants with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. \u2020Three studies' results were reported in two manuscripts. \u2021The included studies in people with hypertension are reported in a separate manuscript. 20 Study design;

 52  however, there were a few studies that offered participants education throughout their duration. A few studies offered very limited access to the digital health intervention for control participants, mostly at baseline.  55 verall, the methodological quality varied markedly with 26 (46%) studies classified as high risk of bias, six (11%) studies as moderate risk of bias, and 24 (43%) studies as low risk of bias (appendix p 51). 12 studies were assessed as high risk of bias for not masking participants and study personnel to intervention assignment or maintaining similar baseline characteristics;  [38] [39] [40] 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] 58, 63, 66, 87  however, such masking or even distribution of characteristics is typically not possible in digital interventions that target behaviour change.

The sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the effect estimate are described in the appendix (p 52). Publication bias was assessed via visual inspection of a funnel plot (appendix p 53). The data displayed a slightly skewed distribution. The asymmetry observed is due to an excess of smartphone application medium-sample-size interventions with positive effects on the outcome (HbA 1c reduction), but it does not indicate a serious publication bias.\n\nOverall, the evidence was considered inconsistent due to the considerable heterogeneity of the study design (figure  2 ) and thus the level of evidence was downgraded (appendix p 9). Therefore, the overall score for the level of evidence was moderate.\n\n43 studies reported an intervention reach based on the assessed population for inclusion into the studies (ie, the authors reported how many people in total they reached when recruiting for the intervention), with a median reach of 33\u20226% (range 3\u20228-93\u20222), whereas 15 studies reported only the randomly assigned populations, with a median of 50\u20226% (50\u20220-69\u20221) randomly assigned to the intervention groups (one study did not report reach). 21 studies reported intervention uptake, with a median uptake of 87\n\n\u20225% (31\u20221-100\u20220%). Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with the other two intervention types (table 2).\n\nThe authors of 13 studies concluded that the interventions were feasible based on measures of meeting recruitment target, high response rate, retention, adherence, acceptance and compliance rates, efficacy, sustainability, fidelity, cost-effectiveness, usefulness, and high accessibility. Authors of 27 studies did not explicitly conclude that the interventions were feasible, but they did report high adherence, satisfaction, usability, convenience and engagement, high likelihood of recommending the intervention to others, high acceptance, and cost-effectiveness (table  2 ). We reported authors' interpretations of study feasibility as the components of feasibility measurement varied between studies."

      "text": "This systematic review synthesised the evidence of 56 studies on the effectiveness, reach, uptake, and feasibility of smartphone applications, SMS, and websitebased interventions in 11 486 adults with type 2 diabetes. The meta-analysis of 26 studies (n=4546 participants) compared the three different modes of delivery and identified that smartphone application and SMS interventions were more effective in terms of glycaemic control than website interventions. Additionally, smartphone application interventions displayed the greatest reach, although website-based interventions had greater uptake.\n\nSeveral reasons could explain the superior effectiveness that smartphone application and SMS interventions exhibited over interventions that were delivered via websites. First, due to technological advancements, modern smartphones include an array of capabilities, such as communication with wearable or ingestible sensors,  62, 63  that permit continuous monitoring and can there fore improve results. Second, the synchronous communication abilities, such as video conferencing, allow health-care practitioners to intervene more rapidly than via asynchronous means.  12 Third, SMS and smartphone applications might be more user-friendly and easier to access due to the convenient and portable nature of mobile phones, as compared to websites that might require access to a laptop or desktop to engage with the services. In fact, studies have previously demonstrated that even between smartphones (eg, iPhones and Androids) usability factors determine the time required to complete health-related tasks.  95 However, other reports indicate that fixed devices are preferred over mobile ones, especially when the objective is to complete large tasks.  96 ur meta-analysis found SMS and smartphone application interventions to be effective compared to usual care, in agreement with previous reports.  [97] [98] 8] [99]  This finding means that either of these two modes of digital health intervention delivery can be used effectively and the decision regarding how to deliver the intervention should be based on the context of the intervention, the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, and the behaviour that the intervention intends to target.\n\nParticipants' education level and higher baseline hyperglycaemia were both associated with larger reductions in glycaemia. This association is plausible, because of homoeostatic regulatory mechanisms, whereby the further a physiological value deviates from the typical range, the greater the homoeostatic pressure is to correct this deviation following intervention. This hypothesis also explains why in the study by Pacaud and colleagues, 89 a significant reduction in HbA 1c was only seen in male participants, because males included in this study had a higher baseline HbA 1c than the included females.  89 Future studies should incorporate effect modification analyses based on the baseline HbA 1c value. Regarding participants' education being a moderator of effectiveness, digital health tools were predominantly used for education, telemonitoring, and communication between participants and health-care professionals; therefore it makes sense that participants with a higher education status experienced the greatest benefit. However, it is known that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is higher in populations of a lower socioeconomic and education status, 100 and future interventions should aim to optimise effectiveness in these populations. Several interventions translated their protocols to the mother tongue of participants to tailor the contents of SMS messages to the educational status and cultural background of their participants; however, this approach was not always successful, suggesting other reasons as being more important for the success of such inter ventions.  [38] [39] ] [40]  Most study authors reported reach and adoption or uptake at the participant's level. Future studies should also report reach and adoption of the intervention at the implementer's level and at the broader community or cohort's level. We found comparing feasibility between the studies challenging, due to the inconsistency of implementation and evaluation metrics reporting. A comprehensive framework that combines several implementation guidelines and provides direction for how to operationalise evaluation and implementation frame work components is needed. The absence of existing guidelines and frameworks' systematisation and agreement on construct naming and definitions did not permit a robust implementation evidence synthesis.\n\nThe included studies exhibited substantial heterogeneity. In addition to employing a different mode of digital health intervention delivery, studies used these tools in different ways. The simplest study designs included reminders to take medication. Education of participants was employed nearly universally. More complex study designs involved sophisticated real-time monitoring of biomarkers. Finally, some studies incorporated motivation and the delivery of compre hensive behavioural change interventions. Therefore, the superior effectiveness of smartphone applications could also be explained in terms of their capabilities to deliver all these approaches, compared with the other two tools that can only deliver some of them. Future programmes should leverage these increased capabilities to deliver holistic interventions.\n\nStrengths of this review include the use of rigorous standard methodology as documented in the PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses; a very large, demographically and culturally diverse population from 24 regions representing lower-middle-income, upper-middleincome, and high-income economy countries from six continents; the direct communication with study authors to derive accurate data for the analyses; the comprehensive series of sensitivity analyses performed to ensure the robustness of the calculated summary effect size; and the inclusion of implementation metrics.\n\nThis study also has limitations. First, searches were restricted to articles published in English. However, reports indicate that the difference is only one out of every 36 meta-analyses when the non-English publications are included.  101 Second, we searched five scientific databases for studies in adults. The adult filter is not consistent between these databases. In MEDLINE, the adult filter is 19 years of age or older, whereas for Embase and PsycInfo it is 18 years of age or older. This difference means that articles listed in MEDLINE with participants aged 18-19 years might have been missed, but the proportion of the population with type 2 diabetes at that age is small. 102 Third, most SMS interventions reported on frequency, but very few smartphone application interventions reported on the frequency of use of the application and time spent using it. Not having this data limits the analysis and conclusions on a dose-response relationship, because the frequency of application use appeared to moderate the effectiveness in one intervention,  61  in which only the participants that used the application more than once a week achieved a significant reduction in their HbA 1c . Future studies should examine this relationship further and ensure clear reporting of the frequency and time spent on engaging with the intervention. Fourth, some studies included more than one digital mode of delivery of the intervention. For example, Capozza and colleagues  39  reported conducting an SMS intervention but also employed a webportal where patients could view their data, and make associations between their behaviours and test results. This mode overlap poses a limitation when a comparison between modes is the objective. We respected the authors' report in terms of mode of delivery when deciding how to classify these studies, but we acknowledge the inherent limitation of this. Fifth, most studies reported on clinical parameters, such as HbA 1c and homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, but very few studies reported on long-term clinical outcomes such as incidence of cardio vascular disease, amputations, and mortality. The duration of RCTs does not permit the examination of most of these outcomes, for which longitudinal studies are better suited. However, future studies should also explore how the different modes of digital health interventions compare in terms of the reduction of the risk of complications in people with diabetes. Sixth, studies in the mobile application group were on average more recent (2020) than those in the SMS (2017) and website (2016) groups, which might limit some of the conclusions-eg, regarding the uptake of the interventions. Seventh, there was great heterogeneity in terms of studies' objectives, ranging from simple participant education to tailored insulin dose titration, presenting another limitation for comparisons when the study design might have been optimised to the different objectives. Eighth, few studies assessed differences in outcomes between genders. Future studies should employ gender-based analysis to facilitate such understanding. Ninth, the evaluation of reach, adoption, and uptake is not able to be fully comprehensive in the context of the studies included in this review, as it is limited by the fact that these were not primary aims of the included studies. A future assessment in the context of a focused systematic review of these measures can help to evaluate the potential for translation to practice.\n\nIn summary, SMS and smartphone application interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with improved glycaemic control, compared with usual care, across diverse samples. At the same time, we recognise that there was considerable heterogeneity of studies. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine-in-ten people worldwide own a feature phone or a smartphone and can receive SMS, and six-in-seven people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being currently available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based SMS and smartphone application interventions for improving their self-management of diabetes. Given the probable effectiveness of digital health interventions and their growing trend, clinicians can potentially leverage the high penetration rates and reach in diverse populations to deliver interventions.  [103] [104] 4] [105] [106] [107] [108]  This approach is of particular importance for rural and remote populations with limited health services and where diabetes prevalence is higher. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of these interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase reach, uptake, and feasibility of treatments, as a number of included studies did not report on these. Finally, as our review included studies conducted in high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income-economies, future studies should also examine the effectiveness of these interventions in low-income economies."

The size of the squares indicates the weight of the evidence from each of the studies; studies with CI (horizontal line) crossing zero (vertical line) are inconclusive; powerful studies (those with more participants) have narrower CIs; the diamonds represent the summary effect sizes in each of the subgroups and in the overall sample, with the width of the diamond indicating the 95% CI. A statistically greater significant reduction in HbA 1c is seen in the digital health intervention group, compared with the control group in the overall sample and with the SMS and smartphone application modes of delivery but not when websites were used as the mode of delivery of the intervention. The data present substantial heterogeneity. HbA 1c =glycated haemoglobin A 1c ."
