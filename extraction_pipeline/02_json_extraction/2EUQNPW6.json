  "title": "Perspectives and Experiences of Self-monitoring of Blood Pressure Among Patients With Hypertension: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Studies",
  "abstract": "Background: Self-monitoring of blood pressure is a key strategy in managing hypertension but may be challenging and burdensome for patients. The aim of the study was to describe the perspectives and experiences of self-monitoring of blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched from database inception to March 2022. We used thematic synthesis to analyze the data. Results: Thirty-five studies involving 872 patients aged 18-95 years were included. Four themes were identified: enabling autonomy and empowerment of own health (allowing access to comprehensive and accurate data, bolstering motivation for lifestyle changes, encouraging diligence in medication taking, gaining interest in self-management, and increasing awareness of health status); providing reassurance and convenience (instilling a sense of security, readiness for troubleshooting, and reducing the frequency of clinical appointments); triggering confusion and stress (anxiety and panic over \"bad\" numbers, constant reminder of illness identity, disregarded by clinicians, lack of confidence in interpreting and responding to results, redundancy of continuous monitoring, and uncertainties around targets and frequency of measures, concerns of unreliability); financial and operational burden of device (vulnerability preventing use, or unsustainable cost). Conclusions: Inadequate knowledge about the benefits of lowering blood pressure, home blood pressure monitoring, blood pressure goals, and interpretation of blood pressure values, limited access to home blood pressure monitoring devices, and psychological burden with home blood pressure monitoring limit home blood pressure monitoring.",

Patients were motivated to take antihypertensive medications diligently upon seeing lower blood pressure readings after taking medications-\"You can see whether the medicine is effective.\"  12 Patients voiced that \"seeing those high numbers\"  14  on home blood pressure monitoring devices prompted them to take medications to avoid serious consequences.\n\nGaining interest in self-management. Monitoring blood pressure at home allowed patients to take responsibility in managing their health-\"It's important for me to be more intentional and more in with my healthcare.\"  32 Patients also used their blood pressure readings to negotiate the management of hypertension with their general practitioners (GPs) and \"take me off (medications).\"  43  Increasing awareness of health status. With home blood pressure monitoring, participants felt they gained awareness about their blood pressure and what numbers meant. Patients reported that checking their blood pressure frequently made them \"aware of the high readings and encourage them to seek medical help.\"  36 atients gave more attention to blood pressure and were prompted to think about their disease more regularly."

Self-monitoring of blood pressure provided patients with a sense of safety and helped them to be prepared for managing their symptoms. On the other hand, some patients reported that self-monitoring of blood pressure triggered stress and confusion due to uncertainty in interpreting results. They were also concerned that the blood pressure monitoring device was unaffordable or too complex. Wh e many of the themes were similar across the studies conducted in different populations and settings, there were apparent differences in perspectives based on age and resource settings. Older patients raised concerns around operating the device and were unfamiliar with and reluctant to engage with technological devices. Some participants in low-resource settings noted that they could not afford the devices due to the financial burden or purchasing the equipment.\n\nPrevious studies have found that patients with hypertension have expressed that self-monitoring of blood pressure provided more accurate readings compared with the clinical assessment of blood pressure, and was easy to use.  47 People with hypertension who self-monitor blood pressure felt more inclined to adopt lifestyle changes  48  and were confident in communicating their readings to clinicians.  49 However, other patients with hypertension felt confused about the utility of home blood pressure monitoring, particularly if they were not aware of how to interpret the results.  47 Previous work has also highlighted challenges including inaccuracy in self-monitoring blood pressure,  50  patients being unaware about targets,  49  or lack of training from clinicians.  51 ur synthesis suggests that patients were more engaged and had a sense of achievement in taking control of their care, and felt reassured in being able to monitor blood pressure at home between clinical appointments. On the other hand, some patients felt that continuous monitoring of blood pressure was a constant reminder their condition, and could potentially lose motivation if they felt that clinicians did not provide feedback or expressed doubt about the patients' ability to self-monitor blood pressure.\n\nIn our systematic review, we conducted a comprehensive search, assessed the transparency of study reporting, and used an explicit framework to assess and synthesize the findings. We used investigator triangulation to ensure that we captured the breadth and depth data across the included studies. However, our study has some potential limitations. We only included studies published in English, and most studies were conducted in high-income countries, which may limit the generalizability of our findings We have also included people with either gestational hypertension/preeclampsia or on dialysis (including both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and these populations may differ from other hypertensive patients, thus the transferability the findings from these studies may need to be considered in the context of the patient population. The home blood pressure monitoring was evaluated using different devices across the studies included, and this may prevent our capability to evaluate possible differences among patient experiences and expectation. This study identified potential areas of relevance to clinical practice. Patients identified that home-based self-monitoring of blood pressure was valuable in identifying white coat or masked hypertension, and helped them in adopting protective behaviors such as higher adherence to drugs, lifestyle changes, and early warning to inform clinicians regarding fluctuations in readings to prevent complications. However, patients identified limitations in their understanding, training, and a need for technical support. We suggest that clinicians provide education about blood pressure targets, frequency, how to read and interpret the results.  52 here may also be a need to reassure the patients and manage the psychological impacts, including anxiety of receiving readings that are outside the recommended range, and discussing impacts on illness identity and depression.  53 Addressing uncertainties about correct procedures, inaccuracy of the readings, and technical issues in operating home blood pressure monitoring may also reduce patient concerns.  54 ncorporating self-monitoring of blood pressure into digital health technologies has the potential to enhance the delivery of health care for the individual. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in the use of telemedicine, where the results may be automatically sent to clinicians for review and inform treatment strategies for managing hypertension.  55 There is also potential for e-health tools (e.g., apps) to promote behavioral change.  56, 57 However, as technology advances, it is important to also ensure that devices are optimized so vulnerable populations are not excluded from their use. For dependent patients, or those with visual impairment, our findings highlighted the need to improve the display of the results.  58 We also advocate for financial assistance for patients in low-resource settings to access blood pressure devices.\n\nHome blood pressure monitoring for hypertension management has been identified as a high-priority research question by patients and health professionals.  59 Further research on interventions to improve self-monitoring of blood pressure should integrate patient perspectives and include outcomes of importance to patients. Based on the INVOLVE  60  and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)  61  initiatives, which provide frameworks and recommendations for involving patients across all stages of research, we recommend that patients should be involved both in developing and evaluating interventions to strengthen uptake. Trials of blood pressure monitoring often assess surrogate outcomes, whilst mortality, cardiovascular events, and patient-reported outcomes (e.g., health-related quality of life)  62  have been inconsistently reported. This limits the ability to evaluate the impact of self-monitoring of blood pressure on longer-term outcomes.  52, 56 conomic modeling studies have shown that home blood pressure monitoring is cost-effective for diagnosing and treating hypertension.  63 ome blood pressure monitoring can increase patient motivation, empowerment, autonomy, and provide reassurance in managing hypertension. However, the challenges of uncertainty in readings, technical complexities, and cost remain. Education and support for patients may help to reduce the practical and psychological burden of blood pressure monitoring and may thereby improve patient outcomes."
