  "title": "Participation Rates With Opt-out Enrollment in a Remote Monitoring Intervention for Patients With Myocardial Infarction",
  "abstract": "Many research studies are limited by low participation rates, threatening the generalizability of findings because participants likely differ greatly from nonparticipants. 1 Low rates of participation could be a function of the opt-in approach to enrollment, in which the default is to not participate. Behavioral economics research has shown that an opt-out approach can increase participation in retirement savings and organ donation while maintaining informed choice.  2, 3 We evaluated whether an opt-out approach to enrollment will increase participation in a remote monitoring intervention among patients with myocardial infarction.",

      "text": "Methods | This prospective cohort study compared enrollment rates in a remote monitoring intervention using an opt-in vs an opt-out approach. The intervention offered remote monitoring of medication adherence for patients recently discharged after myocardial infarction, as in a larger trial with opt-in enrollment. Those in the opt-in cohort were patients in a larger study  4  with fee-for-service Medicare coverage who were discharged from the University of Pennsylvania Health System with a principal diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Participants were recruited from March 23, 2013, to January 4, 2016, in the 60 days after discharge by sending a recruitment letter to introduce the study, followed by up to 5 telephone calls by research staff (N.M. and D.T.) who obtained verbal consent to participate. Patients who consented were sent remote monitoring medication bottles in a system configured with reminders, financial incentives, and social support to promote adherence. Those in the opt-out cohort were similar patients discharged from the University of Pennsylvania Health System with myocardial infarction but with insurance types making them ineligible for the larger study. To create an opt-out frame, these patients received the remote monitoring medication bottles with the initial mailing to simulate participation as the default, but otherwise received the same recruitment processes and the same intervention if they agreed to participate.\n\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of patients mailed recruitment material who agreed to participate in the clinical study. We used a \u03c7 2 test to compare the intervention and control groups, with P < .05 considered statistically significant. We also compared the daily rates of opening the medication bottle for both groups in the 3 months after device setup. Demographics and data on race/ethnicity were obtained from the patients' electronic health record. We received approval from the University of Pennsylvania institutional review board and registered the protocol on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02139202).\n\nResults | We approached 235 patients in the opt-in cohort and 52 in the opt-out cohort (Table ). The opt-in group included only patients with fee-for-service Medicare coverage, with 140 men (59.6%) and 192 patients (81.7%) older than 65 years. The optout group, whose members had a broader mix of insurance types, included 36 men (69.2%) and 12 patients (23.1%) older than 65 years. Thirty-seven patients (15.7%; 95% CI, 11.1%-20.4%) agreed to participate in the opt-in group compared with 20 patients (38.5%; 95% CI, 24.8%-52.1%) in the opt-out group (P < .001). Patient-days of opening the medication bottle were similar between participants in the opt-in and opt-out groups during the 3 months after device set-up (1512 of 1709 [88.5%] vs 1635 of 1820 patient-days [89.8%], respectively; P = .67).\n\nDiscussion | Results of this study suggest that an opt-out approach to enrollment can significantly increase participation in trials of health system interventions. More important, rates of adherence to use of the remote monitoring medication bottle after enrollment in the opt-out group were similar to those in the opt-in group, reflecting comparable engagement among the additional participants. Opt-out procedures may increase participation by shifting the perceived default to participation because the immediate provision of the remote monitoring medication bottles creates an endowment effect (which leads individuals to place more value on an item in their possession), or by implying that the social norm is to enroll in the trial.  5 owever, there was a greater loss of equipment in the opt-out group (21 of 37 participants in the opt-in group [56.8%] who received devices actually used them, vs 20 of 52 participants in\n\nTable.

The article highlighted that less than 50% of patients with atrial fibrillation with CHADS 2 scores exceeding 3 received oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin or a nonvitamin K antagonist anticoagulant, even in the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence Registry. While I agree with the authors that this represents an important undertreatment gap in high-risk patients, I would like to draw attention to another gap that receives far less attention. Examining Figure 2 1 illustrates a phenomenon we found in 42 834 Canadian patients with atrial fibrillation 2 : almost onethird of low-risk individuals with CHADS 2 or CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores of 0 received warfarin or a nonvitamin K antagonist anticoagulant.\n\nAs the risks of full anticoagulation therapy exceed the potential benefits in patients at low risk for stroke, this is another example of overtreatment that deserves increased attention from researchers and policy makers. This issue is not specific to atrial fibrillation nor to cardiology. As pointed out by Newton et al, 3 92% of 521 national clinical performance measures for outpatient care focus on underuse, thereby \"fostering a culture of more is better and inadvertently encouraging overuse.\" Moreover, all current payfor-performance programs provide incentives for meeting treatment targets, and we are not aware of any such programs that currently reward deimplementation of therapy or treating some patients less.  4 Although overtreatment of lowrisk patients with atrial fibrillation has not yet been identified as a priority issue for Choosing Wisely, we should always be cognizant of the fact that focusing solely on undertreatment care gaps fosters a culture of intensification across the entire risk spectrum, which adversely affects overuse, the other side of the quality coin."
