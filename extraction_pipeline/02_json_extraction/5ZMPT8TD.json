  "title": "Do mothers pick up a phone? A crosssectional study on delivery of MCH voice messages in Lagos, Nigeria",
  "abstract": "Background Voice messages have been employed as an effective and efficient approach for increasing health service utilization and health promotion in low-and middle-income countries. However, unlike SMS, voice message services require their users to pick up a phone call at its delivery time. Furthermore, voice messages are difficult for the users to review their contents afterward. While recognizing that voice messages are more friendly to specific groups (eg, illiterate or less literate populations), there should be several challenges in successfully operationalizing its intervention program. \n Objective This study is aimed to estimate the extent to which voice message service users pick up the phone calls of voice messages and complete listening up to or beyond the core part of voice messages. \n Methods A voice message service program composed of 14 episodes on maternal, newborn, and child health was piloted in Lagos, Nigeria, from 2018 to 2019. A voice message call of each of 14 episodes was delivered to the mobile phones of the program participants per day for 14 consecutive days. A total of 513 participants in the voice message service chose one of five locally spoken languages as the language to be used for voice messages. Two multilevel logistic regression models were created to understand participants' adherence to the voice message: (a) Model 1 for testing whether a voice message call is picked up; and (b)",

      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mHealth as the use of mobile and wireless technologies to support health objectives  [1] . Interventions using mHealth include short messaging service (SMS), application, and voice message  [1] . Voice message is recommended as an intervention method in a WHO guideline  [2] .\n\nIn developing countries, voice message has been used for HIV  [3] [4] [5]  and diabetes patients  [6]  to improve and maintain their medication adherence, and for commercial sex workers (CSWs) to get screened for sexually transmitted infections  [7] . In the area of maternal and child health (MCH) care, voice message has been used to encourage less literate  [8]  and less educated  [9]  mothers to increase their use of health services. In addition, voice message has helped low-income pregnant women to take iron tablets  [10]  and parents to improve infant and young child feeding practices  [11] . In a systematic review, voice message was reviewed as the second commonest mHealth intervention in low-income countries, followed by short message service (SMS)  [12] .\n\nIn Nigeria, where this study was conducted, there are several reported cases of mHealth programs. SMS was employed to improve medication adherence in outpatients  [13]  and malaria patients  [14] . In the area of MCH, SMS was used to increase uptake of vaccinations  [15]  and postnatal care services (PNC)  [14] . Free mobile phone call services were used to increase mothers' visits to medical facilities and use of their services  [16] . It was reported that voice message interventions have helped increase screening for fistula  [17]  and promote the use of contraceptives  [18] .\n\nSeveral previous studies confirmed the effects of voice message interventions. For example, a study in Bangladesh found that voice messages increased the knowledge of newborn health among pregnant women  [19] . Another study in India found that voice messages increased tetanus toxoid vaccine uptake and facility-based deliveries among pregnant women  [20] . A randomized controlled trial in India found that voice messages delivered to pregnant women contributed to weight gain among newborns  [21] .\n\nIt has been reported that voice messaging interventions are positively accepted  [3, 5, 8, 9, [22] [23] [24] . However, a voice message intervention requires its participants to pick up the phone at the time of delivery, unlike SMS intervention  [25] . This feature suggests that the voice message intervention may not always be delivered as intended. Thus, in some cases, the participants could not pick up the phone and listen to voice message. For example, a previous study in Afghanistan reported that the participants having opted for voice messages ended up receiving fewer messages than those having opted for SMS  [9] . In an intervention for pregnant women in Ghana, more than 80% of the participants picked up the phone and listened to at least 50% of the length of each message prenatally, while less than 54% of the participants did so postnatally  [26] . The aforementioned study in Bangladesh reported that only a third of the participants (29.9%) picked up six or more phone calls of a total of eight voice messages delivered in a month. The primary reason for not picking up the phone was the commitment to household chores. Additionally, only 35.5% of those having picked up a phone completed listening to voice messages to the end  [19] . In India, most participants (88.1%) picked up the phone and completed listening to a 19-second voice message targeting CSWs. However, only 58.5% of the participants completed listening to a 31-second voice message  [7] . These studies imply that ensuring participants' adherence to voice messages is crucial for successful voice message intervention. Therefore, understanding adherence to the voice message needs to be deepened to achieve the expected effect of this intervention.\n\nIn this study targeting the area in Lagos that includes urban slum communities, 14 consecutive voice messages on MCH were delivered to the participants. In the urban slum communities, mothers were less likely to use MCH services, and the maternal mortality ratio was high (1050 per 100000 live births), compared to that of Lagos State (545 per 100000 live births)  [27] . Having assumed that only half of the women were literate in the area  [27]  and most the women in Lagos State (85.9%) owned mobile phones  [28] , voice message on MCH was employed as an appropriate intervention.\n\nThe participants' adherence to a voice message was divided into two phases: (a) picking up a phone call; and (b) listening at least up to the core message part of a voice message. Then, we attempted to assess the intervention adherence in picking up the phone calls and in completing listening up to the core message part, in accordance with the progress of a series of maternal and child health voice messages."

The study site was Lagos Mainland Local Government Area (LGA), one of the most populous LGAs in Lagos State, Nigeria  [30] . While Yoruba is the largest ethnic group in Lagos State, there are other ethnic groups such as Egun, Hausa and Igbo  [31] . According to the Nigeria Demographic Health Survey 2018, most women (85.9%) in Lagos State owned mobile phones  [28] .\n\nThe study site was one of the targets LGAs of the Project for Strengthening Pro-Poor Community Health Services in Lagos State (the Project), implemented jointly by Lagos State Primary Health Care Board (LSPHCB) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) during the period from January 2017 to March 2019. The Project aimed to strengthen the primary healthcare service delivery system for urban poor populations. To evaluate the project interventions, the Project conducted a baseline survey in February 2017 and its follow-up survey in July 2018."

In the follow-up survey, we randomly selected 1000 from the cohort of 2112 pregnant women who participated in the baseline survey conducted in 2017. The number of pregnant women in the baseline survey (n = 2112) was great enough to represent entire pregnant women in the study site. Of 1000 pregnant women selected from the cohort defined in the baseline survey, 698 mothers having given live births were interviewed in the follow-up survey. The reasons for not participating in the follow-up survey included: relocation (n = 56), refusal (n = 78), absence (n = 48), child and/or maternal death (n = 2) and miscarriage (n = 82) ((c) in  Fig 1) . Of 698 interviewed mothers, 513 indicated the ownership and availability of mobile phones in their households and agreed to receive voice messages as an intervention of this study."

The messages were composed and then reviewed several times jointly by the health education experts of Lagos State Ministry of Health (LSMOH), LSPHCB, and JICA. The messages were initially composed in English and then translated into five local languages: Egun, Hausa, Igbo, Pidgin English, and Yoruba. Participants received voice messages in one of the five local languages they had chosen in advance. Each episode lasted for approximately 170 seconds, starting with an opening music, a topicspecific dialogue between an announcer and a nurse, and then ending with a closing music. Participants received one episode per day for 14 consecutive dayson their mobile phones registered during the baseline survey. We randomly assigned the participants to either of the two groups. One group received voice messages for 14 days from 8 to 21 December 2018 (Group\n\nTable 1. Structure of the voice message program.

During the first period of message delivery (ie, for Group 1), the same message was broadcasted at least once a day through three local radio stations: (a) Radio Lagos for Yoruba and Egun; (b) Eko FM for Hausa, Igbo and Pidgin English; and (c) Traffick FM for Pidgin English. During the second period of the message delivery (ie, for Group 2), no radio broadcast was made. We planned to randomly allocate the voice message delivery time to each participant from the following three options: (a) initial call at 10 AM and reminder call at noon; (b) initial call at noon and reminder at 2 PM; and (c) initial call at 10 AM and reminder call at 2 PM. Only when a participant did not pick up the initial phone call, another call was delivered as the reminder either at noon or 2 PM. However, a certain proportion of voice messages (12.8%) were delivered after 4 PM, most likely due to technical errors of the voice message system."

      "text": "This study was designed as a cross-sectional study using the following two types of datasets. First, to identify the characteristics of the participants, we used the baseline and follow-up survey data collected by the Project. Those surveys collected the socio-demographic and socioeconomic status data using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire on a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) software SurveyCTO (ver 2.20, Dobility Inc., Massachusetts). Second, we used the output data from the voice message system that was operated and managed by a local system development company (eg, participants' phone numbers, languages participants chose, the episode numbers of voice messages, dates and time of voice message delivery, and the number of minutes during which participants listened to each voice message). When a participant picked up a phone call, the voice message system automatically recorded its time and date, and length of listening time. When a participant failed to pick up an initial phone call, she then had one more chance to receive the voice message delivery as aforementioned. When a participant did not pick up the reminder call, the voice message system recorded the message delivery time and response status (ie, busy, ringing but unanswered)."

A dichotomous variable, whether a participant completed listening up to the core message part (ie, \"Completed\" and \"Did not complete\"), was employed as the dependent variable for Model 2.\n\nThe minimum number of seconds for which a voice message needs to be listened to for participants' adequate and meaningful understanding was set as the time threshold for each episode (Table  1 ). When a participant hung up the phone without completing listening up to the time threshold, we assumed that the level of her understanding on the message was partial and inadequate. Thus, \"Completed\" indicates that a participant listened to the message up to or beyond the time threshold. Alternatively, \"Did not complete\" indicates that a participant hung up before the time threshold."

Wealth quintile was created by sorting out all the mothers' households according to the wealth index values. Wealth index was calculated by applying a principal components analysis  [32]  to variables of households' ownerships of key properties and access to key services (water source, sanitation facility, cooking fuel, materials for floor, roof and external walls, radio, television, refrigerator, generator, fan, air conditioner, computer, bicycle, motorbike, car). All the mothers' households were divided into five equalsized groups by wealth index score (ie, poorest, poor, middle, rich, and richest). A series of voice message episodes were numbered from 1 to 14 according to the order of maternal and child health milestones and message deliveries.\n\nMost of the independent variables are shown in Table  2 , but only voice message delivery time is shown in Table  3 . The independent variables are presented separately in these two tables because the total number of cases differs between participant-related variables (n = 513 in Table  2 ) and intervention-result-related variables (n = 7182 in Table  3 )."

The total number of voice messages delivered was 7182. Of them, almost all the messages (7150/7182, 99.6%) were successfully recorded in the voice message system, while the rest (32/7182, 0.4%) were not recorded probably for technical reasons of the system. Of 7150 delivered messages, 751 did not successfully reach participants' phone numbers due to network errors. Therefore, they were excluded from further data analysis.

Table  4  and Fig  2  show the proportions of participants who picked up the phone and listened to voice messages up to or beyond the time thresholds. The greater the episode number became, the lower the proportion of participants completed listening up to core contents. Thus, as the voice message episode number progressed, fewer mothers completed listening up Furthermore, the number of voice message calls having been picked but hung up before the time threshold increased in accordance with the progress of the episode numbers. The proportion of voice message calls having completed being listened up to or beyond the time threshold 28.4% (400/1407) for the initial five episodes (#1-#5 in Table  4 ),  19 .1% (252/1314) for the following five episodes (#6-#10 in Table  4 ), and 19.3% (202/1044) for the last four episodes (#11-#14 in Table  4 ). However, there was no significant difference in mean number of seconds for which participants listened to voice messages between 14 voice messages. Instead, the time threshold of the voice message was likely to become longer as the episode number (order of voice messages) increased. This implies that the higher proportion of participants stopped listening before the time threshold was attributed not to less time spent listening but the greater number of seconds to the time threshold."

As shown in Table  5 , of the 15 independent variables for Model 1 regression, three (language chosen for receiving voice messages, message delivery time, and episode number of voice messages) were significantly associated with responses to a phone call (ie, busy, ringing but unanswered).\n\nVoice message calls in Pidgin English were 0.75 times less likely to be picked up than those in Yoruba (aOR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61-0.94; P = .01). Compared with the voice messages delivered between noon and 2 PM, those delivered between 2 PM and 4 PM were 0.82 times less likely to be picked up (aOR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69-0.97; P = .02). The same trend was confirmed in those delivered after 4 PM (aOR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63-0.99; P = .04).\n\nAs the episode number progressed day by day during 14 consecutive days, the voice message calls became 0.98 times less likely to be picked up (ie, per day) (aOR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97-0.99; P = .01).\n\nModel 2: Whether to complete listening up to core message part. As shown in Table  5 , of the 14 independent variables for Model 2 regression, three (ie, language chosen for receiving voice messages, delivery time, and episode number) were significantly associated with picking up a phone.\n\nVoice message calls in Pidgin English were 1.32 times more likely to complete being listened up to or beyond the time threshold than those in Yorba (aOR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03-1.69; P = .03). Compared with voice messages delivered between noon and 2 PM, those delivered between 10 AM and noon were 0.76 times less likely to complete listening to up to the time threshold (aOR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60-0.97; P = .03). The greater the episode number became, the smaller the likelihood that voice messages were listened to up to the time threshold would be (aOR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.91-0.95; P < .001).\n\nSensitivity analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses using two types of samples. The first type was the samples excluding the first and last episodes (eg, introduction and conclusion), while the second type was the samples excluding mothers not owning mobile phones. Of the 14 voice message episodes, the first and final ones did not address specific topics related to maternal and child health (eg, ANC and PNC) but rather served as introduction and conclusion sessions, respectively. Therefore, these two-episode numbers were excluded from the analysis. It was confirmed that the results did not change with this sub-dataset.\n\nAdditionally, this study included 18.1% (93/513) of cases where the mothers did not own mobile phone(s) even when there was a mobile phone in the household.

      "title": "Picking up a phone of voice messages",
      "text": "Each of the 14 voice message calls (170 seconds on average) was delivered once a day consecutively for 14 days. Only 61.3% (1407/2296) of voice message calls were picked up for the initial part of 14 episodes (eg, Episode #1-#5). Furthermore, Model 1 regression analysis results indicated that participants were likely to stop picking up the phone as the episode number progressed  [25, 26] . Two types of challenges concerning the voice message intervention are herewith raised. One of the possible reasons for not picking up a phone is that a voice message call is, unlike SMS, required to be picked up exclusively at the time of its delivery  [25] . The participants were granted maximum two opportunities per day to receive a voice message. Maximum two opportunities might not have been sufficient for the participants. This is because most of them are urban poor women whose daily movements are generally more frequent than a middleincome group  [33] . More than half of them (329/513, 64.1%) work by engaging themselves in informal economic activities where maternity and parental leave systems do not exist. Even those with infants might neither necessarily stay at home nor be ready to pick up a phone during the daytime. Second, the proportion of voice massage calls having been picked up was reduced over time as the episode number progressed. In a previous study in Ghana, more than 80% of women listened to the voice messages during pregnancy, but only 54% listened after delivery  [26] . The result of this previous study was consistent with that of our study on the point that the probability of picking up/listening to the voice message calls decreased over time. It is assumed that participants lost their interest in the voice messages as the episode number progressed. However, this reason needs to be confirmed through qualitative research such as focus group discussions."

      "text": "In a previous study, the time threshold (the minimum number or proportion of seconds for which a voice message needs to be listened to for meaningful understanding) was uniformly set at 50% of the entire voice message  [26] . This study set an episode-specific time threshold by Whether a phone call was picked Model 2: Whether a voice message was listened to up to or beyond time threshold when being picked up Adjusted OR (95% CI) P value Adjusted OR (95% CI) P value 2 PM-4 PM 0.82 (0.69-0.97) 0.019 1.04 (0.82-1.31) 0.767 4 PM-0.79 (0.63-0.99) 0.042 0.74 (0.54-1.01) 0.060 Ownership of mobile phone Herself Ref.

Thus, having employed a more precisely defined time threshold, this study should be able to present more meaningful results of analyses. Model 2 regression analysis results indicate that even those having picked up a phone became less likely to complete listening up to and beyond the time threshold as the episode number progressed. The proportion of voice message calls having completed being listened to up to or beyond the time threshold was 28.4% (400/1407) for the initial five episodes (Episode #1-#5), 19.1% (252/1314) for the subsequent five episodes (Episode #6 -#10), and 19.3% (202/ 1044) for the final four episodes (Episode #11-#14). Mean length to the time threshold tended to become longer toward Episode #14, ie, 106.2 seconds for the initial five episodes (Episode #1-#5), 120.5 for the subsequent five episodes (Episode #6 -#10), and 114.7 for the final four episodes (Episode #11 -#14), respectively. On the other hand, mean length of time during which participants listened to a voice message did not change significantly across the episodes, ie, 67.8 seconds for the first five episodes (Episode #1-#5), 68.0 seconds for the following five episodes (Episode #6 -#10), and 67.1 seconds for the last four episodes (Episode #11 -#14), respectively. That is why, as a result, the proportion of participants having completed listening up to or beyond the time threshold became smaller as voice message episode progressed. Therefore, we simply cannot conclude that the participants in this study spent less time listening to the voice messages over time.\n\nNevertheless, note that voice messages completed listening to up to or beyond the time thresholds were only a fifth (854/3765, 22.7%) among those picked up. This result suggests that picking up a phone does not necessarily ensure listening to the core message part. A previous study also reported that only a third of participants (35.5%) picked up a phone and completed listening to all the messages  [19] . Therefore, health policymakers and planners should be warned that picking up a phone does not necessarily lead to the completion of listening to a voice message."

      "title": "Length of voice messages",
      "text": "The voice messages in this study took the form of a conversation between an announcer and a nurse to ensure client-friendliness by capturing the mothers' attention. As a result, mean length of each voice message was 170 seconds, ranging from 130 to 190 seconds.\n\nA study on voice messaging intervention targeting pregnant women of urban poor households in India reported that all those having picked up a phone completed listening to the entire voice message that lasted for 40 seconds  [10] . Another study in India similarly reported that 93% of participants completed listening to the entire voice message, which was 19 seconds long  [7] . Our study found that mothers listened to a voice message for 68 seconds on average once they picked up a phone. Hence, compared with the results of other studies, the voice messages in this study were too long to complete listening. Only half of the voice messages (2056/ 3765, 54.6%) were listened to for more than 60 seconds by those having picked up a phone. The appropriate length of the voice message might have been 60 seconds at the longest."

      "title": "Voice message delivery timing",
      "text": "The initial voice message calls were delivered randomly either at 10 AM or noon. Those not having picked up a phone received its reminder call either at noon or 2 PM. Several previous studies reported that participants received the voice messages at the time predesignated by themselves  [9, 10, 26, 34] .\n\nAs indicated in Model 1 regression analysis, participants to whom voice messages were delivered at 2 PM tended to be less likely to pick up a phone than those to whom voice messages were delivered at noon. Voice messages delivered at noon included both the initial and reminder calls, while voice messages delivered at 2 PM were exclusive reminder calls for those not having picked up the initial calls. This implies that those not having picked up the initial calls were also less likely to pick up the reminder calls. They were probably less interested in voice messages.\n\nUnlike an SMS, the contents of a voice message cannot be reviewed later but listened to only when it is delivered  [25] . If they cannot take time for some reason when a voice message is delivered, they will either not pick up the phone or hang up the phone immediately. As shown in Model 2 regression analysis results, the participants having picked up the phone between 10 AM and noon were less likely to complete listening up to or beyond the time threshold (core message part) than those having picked up the phone between noon and 2 PM. This may imply that some participants were too busy with economic activities or household chores  [9, 19]  to pick up a phone in the morning. In fact, most participants (369/513, 71.9%) were either employed or self-employed. Thus, digital health planners may have to pay more careful attention to message delivery timing when designing a voice message intervention. However, as indicated in the results of sensitivity analyses, the difference in the proportion of those having picked up the phones by delivery timing was insignificant when excluding the mothers who did not own mobile phones. Therefore, our findings from this study on delivery time may be inconclusive, and further research is needed."

      "title": "Languages chosen for receiving voice messages",
      "text": "The participants were requested to choose a language to be used for voice messages from four: Yoruba, Pidgin English, and other languages (Egun, Hausa and Igbo were combined into one group for analyses). Most participants (434/513, 84.6%) chose either Yoruba or Pidgin English. This language preference distribution among the participants was consistent with the previous study on linguistics in Nigeria  [31] . Furthermore, another previous study using IVR found no association between ethnicity and the rate of IVR completion, although it is the ethnicity, not the language  [34] .\n\nModel 1 regression analysis results show that participants having chosen Pidgin English were less likely to pick up the phone than those having chosen Yoruba. Alternatively, Model 2 regression analysis results indicate that those having chosen Pidgin English were more likely to complete listening up to or beyond the time threshold than those having chosen Yorba.\n\nProbably, this is not because the time threshold for Pidgin English voice messages tends to be longer than that for Yoruba. Rather, overall mean length of time up to the time threshold for 14 episodes was nearly equal (122.3 seconds in Pidgin English and 120.4 seconds in Yoruba). The proportion of voice message calls that were picked up and further listened to up to or beyond the time threshold was 23.8% (315/1322) for Pidgin English and 20.9% (391/1871) for Yoruba. This implies that participants having chosen Pidgin English were more likely to complete listening up to the core message part than those having chosen Yoruba once they picked up the phone, despite the same level of the time threshold between Pidgin English and Yoruba. Nevertheless, the participants having chosen Pidgin English were less likely to pick up the phone than those having chosen Yoruba."

This radio program was not implemented when Group 2 participants received 14 messages in January 2019. As Model 1 and Model 2 regression analyses show, there was no statistically significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 in the proportion of participants picking up a phone and further listening up to or beyond the time threshold.\n\nThere might be a possibility that part of those having listened to the contents of a voice message on the radio no longer listened to the same contents on their mobile phone again. However, the results suggest that the radio broadcasting (the same message in parallel) had at least no negative impact on picking up the phone and listening to voice messages. Unfortunately, the extent to which the participants listened to the radio message is unknown. Therefore, further study is needed to develop an evidence-based strategy for the synergetic implementation of voice messaging on the phone and social messaging through media."

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure participants' adherence to voice messages to achieve the expected effects of this intervention. The results of this study imply that the following adjustments need to be made to improve the adherence to voice message intervention: (a) limiting the total number of episodes and shortening the voice message program duration to let participants be focused (ie, reduce from14 episodes in this study); (b) shortening the length of each voice message to enable participants to complete listening (ie, reduce from 170 seconds on average in this study); and (c) deliver more than two reminder calls (ie, two reminder calls in this study) for those unable to pick up the phone at the time of delivery."

      "text": "We implemented this voice messaging intervention in an area that includes urban slum communities in Nigeria, where mobile phone ownership and acceptance of mHealth had been assumed to be high enough. However, 10.3% (72/698) of intervention target individuals did not desire to participate in the intervention (Fig  1 ). This attrition may affect the generalizability of the study results.\n\nA certain proportion of voice messages (821/6399, 12.8%) were not delivered in time as initially scheduled (eg, after 4 PM). This type of delivery error could be attributed to technical problems of the voice message system such as: (a) delivery delay of voice messages initially scheduled at 2 PM; and (b) the third delivery of voice messages to those not having picked up the initial and reminder calls. Such unscheduled message delivery was reported in a previous study as well  [26] . The results of this study may not fully capture the association between delivery timing of voice messages and whether participants pick up the phones and complete listening to voice messages."

Furthermore, picking up a phone did not necessarily ensure listening up to the core message part. Thus, health policymakers and planners should not take it for granted that local individuals continue to pick up the phone throughout the program and listen to the messages once they are delivered. To enable target populations to pick up the phone and complete listening up to or beyond the core message part of voice message, each voice message should be concise, and the total number of episodes should also be smaller. Moreover, multiple reminder calls should be necessary. To deepen the understanding on the reasons for participants to stop picking up the phone, qualitative studies need to be conducted."
