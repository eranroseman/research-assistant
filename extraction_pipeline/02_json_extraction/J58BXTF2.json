      "text": "A lthough mortality for cardiovascular disease (CVD) has declined for several decades, heart disease and stroke continue to be the leading causes of death, disability, and high healthcare costs. Unhealthy behaviors related to CVD risk (eg, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthful eating habits) remain highly prevalent. The high rates of overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); the persistent presence of uncontrolled hypertension; lipid levels not at target; and the \u224818% of adults who continue to smoke cigarettes pose formidable challenges for achieving improved cardiovascular health.  1, 2 It is apparent that the performance of healthful behaviors related to the management of CVD risk factors has become an increasingly important facet of the prevention and management of CVD.  3  In 2010, the American Heart Association (AHA) made a transformative shift in its strategic plan and added the concept of cardiovascular health.  2  To operationalize this concept, the AHA targeted 4 health behaviors in the 2020 Strategic Impact Goals: reduction in smoking and weight, healthful eating, and promotion of regular physical activity. Three health indicators also were included: glucose, blood pressure (BP), and cholesterol. On the basis of the AHA Life's Simple 7 metrics for improved cardiovascular health, <1% of adults in the United States follow a healthful eating plan, only 32% have a normal body mass index, and > 30% have not reached the target levels for lipids or BP. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data revealed that people who met \u22656 of the cardiovascular health metrics had a significantly better risk profile (hazard ratio for all-cause mortality, 0.49) compared with individuals who had achieved only 1 metric or none.  2  The studies reviewed in this statement targeted these behaviors (ie, smoking, physical activity, healthful eating, and maintaining a healthful weight) and cardiovascular health indicators (ie, blood glucose, lipids, BP, body mass index) as the primary outcomes in the clinical trials testing mobile health (mHealth) interventions.\n\neHealth, or digital health, is the use of emerging communication and information technologies, especially the Internet, to improve health and health care  4  (Table  1 ). mHealth, a subsegment of eHealth, is the use of mobile computing and communication technologies (eg, mobile phones, wearable sensors) for health services and information.  4, 5 mHealth technology uses techniques and advanced concepts from an array of disciplines, for example, computer science, electrical and biomedical engineering, and medicine and health-related sciences.  16 Mobile devices that permit collection of data in real time are increasingly ubiquitous, enabling researchers to assess multiple behaviors in various contexts and thus inform the development of interventions to prompt behavior change. Technology-supported behavioral health interventions are designed to engage individuals in health behaviors that prevent or manage illness, and they have led to fundamental changes in health practices.  17 In addition to permitting more frequent and convenient community-based assessment of health parameters, these technology-mediated tools support the exchange of health information among consumers and between consumers and health providers, enable health decision making, and encourage positive health behaviors, including self-management and health promotion.  18, 19 Consequently, mHealth technologies are becoming more prevalent, and their use will continue to grow,  20  consistent with the Institute of Medicine's call to increase the design and testing of health technologies.  21 he ubiquity of mobile devices presents the opportunity to improve health outcomes through the delivery of state-of-theart medical and health services with information and communication technologies.  22 Because of their diverse capabilities and advanced computing features, smartphones are often considered pocket computers.  16 In addition to these devices that can inform and communicate, there are wearable sensors that can be worn for short or extended periods and monitor activity or physiological changes (eg, exercise, heart rate, sleep). These sensors can provide data in real time or save the data to a device for later uploading and review.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has a public health responsibility to oversee the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. However, this applies only to applications (apps) that are accessory to regulated medical devices (eg, apps that diagnose a condition). Many mobile apps are not medical devices, meaning that they do not meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate them. Some mobile apps may meet the definition of a medical device, but because they pose a lower risk to the public, the US Food and Drug Administration intends to exercise enforcement discretion over these devices. Most of the mHealth apps on the market at this time fit into these 2 categories.  23, 24 umerous innovations in health information technology are empowering individuals to assume a more active role in monitoring and managing their chronic conditions and therapeutic regimens, as well as their health and wellness.  25 These advances are increasingly accepted by the public.  26 Unlike the initial digital divide that placed computer use and Internet access beyond the reach of many older, disabled, and lowincome individuals, mobile devices have been widely adopted across demographic and ethnic groups, especially those most in need of health behavior interventions.  27, 28 This trend is confirmed in the 2014 statistics from the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project, which showed that 81% of households with an income above $75 000/y owned a smartphone, and nearly half (47%) of those with an annual household income below $30 000 owned a smartphone.  29"

It uses standardized communications protocols to allow mobile phone devices to exchange short text messages. The terms text messaging and texting are used interchangeably to refer to both the medium and messages, and the term text message refers to the individual message sent. 6  MMS MMS is the next evolutionary step from SMS. MMS allows mobile phone users to exchange pictures with sound clips on their handsets or digital cameras. 7  App App is short for application, which is the same thing as a software program. Although an app may refer to a program for any hardware platform, it is most often used to describe programs for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 8  Wireless Being wireless means not using wires to send and receive electronic signals (ie, sending and receiving electronic signals by using radio waves). 9  Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows computers and other devices to communicate over a wireless signal.  10   etooth This wireless technology enables communication between Bluetooth-compatible devices. It is used for short-range connections between desktop and laptop computers, a mouse, digital cameras, scanners, cellular phones, and printers. 11  Operating system An operating system, or OS, is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. Common mobile OSs include Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. 12  iOS iOS is a mobile OS developed by Apple. It was originally called the iPhone OS, but was renamed to the iOS in June 2009. The iOS currently runs on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. 13  Android OS Android OS is a Linux-based open-source platform for mobile cellular handsets developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance.

      "text": "In computer networks, bandwidth is used as a synonym for data transfer rate, the amount of data that can be transmitted from one point to another in a given time period (usually a second). Network bandwidth is usually expressed in bits per second (bps); modern networks typically have speeds measured in the millions of bits per second (megabits per second or Mbps) or billions of bits per second (gigabits per second or Gbps).  15 S indicates multimedia messaging service; OS, operating system; and SMS, short messaging service.\n\nThe highest smartphone ownership was among Hispanic and blacks, at 61% and 59%, respectively. Of those with phones who use the Internet, 34% mostly use their phones, rather than a desktop or laptop, to access online programs.  30 obile devices offer great promise for improving the health of the populace. Most smartphones include basic functionalities, for example, video streaming, e-mail, Internet access, and high-quality imaging. These developments in wireless technology and the shift to mobile devices are demanding a re-examination of technology as it currently exists within the healthcare infrastructure.  16 However, the pace of science in evaluating these apps is incongruent with the business and industry sectors and the consumer demands. There are concerns that the health-promoting smartphone apps being developed fail to incorporate evidence-based content and that rigorous testing to provide efficacy data is trailing behind their adoption.  [31] [32] ] [33] [34]  However, a systematic review of the literature suggests a positive impact of consumer health informatics tools on select health conditions. For example, there were intermediate outcomes such as knowledge, adherence, self-management, and change in behaviors related to healthful eating, exercise, and physical activity but not obesity.  35 Another review suggests that smartphone apps are useful tools at the point of care and in mobile clinical communication, as well as in remote patient monitoring and self-management of disease.  36 ecent articles have reviewed the latest technological advances in digital social networks related to health  37  and wireless devices for cardiac monitoring.  38 What is missing in the scientific literature is a report on the health-related mobile technologies focused specifically on CVD prevention. In particular, it is important to investigate the degree to which these CVD-focused technologies include best content and have been evaluated for their effectiveness. In the absence of such data, clinicians may be hesitant to recommend or endorse any program to their patients and thereby potentially miss an opportunity to improve their engagement in healthful behaviors.\n\nThe aims of this scientific statement are to review the literature on mHealth tools available to the consumer in the prevention of CVD (eg, dietary self-monitoring apps, physical activity monitors, and BP monitors); to provide the current evidence on the use of the vast array of mobile devices such as use of mobile phones for communication and feedback, smartphone apps, wearable sensors, or physiological monitors that are readily available and promoted to the public for monitoring their health; and to provide recommendations for future research directions. The goal is to provide the clinician and researcher a review of the current evidence on using mHealth tools and devices when targeting behavior change, cardiovascular risk reduction, and improved cardiovascular health. This statement is divided into sections by the behaviors or health indicators included in the AHA's Life's Simple 7 program: achieving a healthful weight, improving physical activity, quitting smoking, achieving blood glucose control, and managing BP and lipids to achieve target levels. Within each section, the recent evidence for studies using mHealth approaches is reviewed, gaps are identified, and directions for future research are provided.\n\nAlthough the majority of studies reported the use of mobile devices, for example, basic mobile phones that support the use of text messaging (short message service [SMS]) or smartphones that provide Internet access, several reported interventions delivered via the Internet such as studies reporting on increased physical activity or BP management. The writing group made the decision to include these studies because there is an increasingly greater proportion of people accessing the Internet via mobile devices. As noted in a Pew report in February 2014, 68% of adults access the Internet with mobile devices.  39 This figure has likely increased in the past year. Moreover, in some of the designated areas of cardiovascular risk, there were few studies reporting on the use of mHealth supported interventions."

[40] [41] ] [42]  More than 35% of US adults >20 years are obese,  43  and >1 in 4 Americans have multimorbidity,  45  which is associated with high healthcare use and costs, functional impairment, poor quality of life, psychological distress, and premature death.  46- 50 Sustained weight loss of 3% to 5% can delay or possibly prevent T2DM  51, 52  and significantly improve CVD risk factors (eg, abnormal glucose, elevated BP).  [53] [54] 4] [55] [56]  However, effective treatments for obesity that are accessible to consumers, affordable for diverse socioeconomic groups, and scalable at a population level are lacking.\n\nThe 2013 obesity treatment guideline by the AHA, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and The Obesity Society recommended that clinicians advise overweight and obese individuals who would benefit from weight loss to participate for \u22656 months in a comprehensive lifestyle program characterized by a combination of a reduced calorie intake, increased physical activity, and behavioral strategies.  57 The guideline panelists found evidence of moderate strength supporting the efficacy of electronically delivered, comprehensive lifestyle programs that include personalized feedback from a trained interventionist, defined as programs delivered to participants by the Internet, e-mail, mobile texting, or similar electronic means. Therefore, it was recommended that electronically delivered interventions are an acceptable alternative to in-person interventions, although it was recognized that the former may result in smaller weight loss than the latter."

[58] [59] 9] [60] [61] [62] [63]  Overall, weight management interventions have used a range of mobile technologies,  60, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68]  including texting (SMS), smartphone applications, handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs), and interactive voice response (IVR) systems.  66, 69, 70 Numerous network-connected devices have also been used,  60, 64  including e-scales and wireless physical activity monitoring devices.  71 The use of mobile devices and their functionality (eg, SMS and multimedia messaging service, mobile Internet, and software apps) in weight loss interventions have improved exponentially in recent years. In this section, we focus on the latest evidence on mobile technology interventions for weight loss.\n\nWith few exceptions,  72  most interventions have used a single, predetermined technology and did not give participants the option of choosing between a single or multiple forms of technology simultaneously (which has become commonplace for commercial applications). Most technologies have been created in research settings, although at least 1 published study used a commercially available app.  71  The majority of these trials were focused primarily on efficacy testing, and it was unclear whether these interventions used strategies designed to promote user engagement (eg, using established design principles, conducting usability testing, or undergoing iterative development and testing). Additionally, a key translational challenge is that many commercial apps have not been tested empirically, and many apps with empirical data are not commercially available."

      "title": "Review of Evidence for the Efficacy of mHealth-Based Weight Loss Interventions",
      "text": "We conducted an electronic literature search using Medline (PubMed), CINAHL, and PsychInfo in June 2014 and extended to 2004. Search terms for this topic included the following: overweight, obese, obesity, body mass, adiposity, adipose, weight loss, and weight gain. Only original studies with human subjects with a primary outcome of weight loss and published in English were included. Of 184 references identified, 169 were excluded on the basis of a review of the title (n=19), abstract (n=121), and full text (n=29). Fourteen references were eligible for this review, including 10 studies conducted among US adults and 2 among adults outside the United States.\n\nTable  2  includes the studies reviewed and provides details on study design, intervention, sample characteristics, and primary outcomes. Five of the 8 US randomized, controlled trials (RCTs)  [74] [75] [76] 83, 84  reported significantly more weight loss in the intervention group than in the control or comparison group. The t sting and use of mobile technologies varied a great deal, and combinations of mHealth components and tools were often very specific to a particular study. Five investigators used text messaging, also referred to as SMS,  73, 74, 79, 82, 83  in studies that ranged from 8 weeks to 1 year in duration. Patrick et al  74  permitted the participant to set the frequency of the SMS (2-5 times a day) and found a significant difference in weight loss between the 2 groups at 4 months, whereas Napolitano et al  83  observed better weight loss in the Facebook plus SMS than the Facebook alone group at 8 weeks. Only 1 study,  79  which used SMS and multimedia messaging service 4 times a day in addition to a monthly e-newsletter in a 12-month study, did not observe a significant difference in weight loss compared with a monthly e-newsletter control group. Two of the SMS studies were conducted outside the United States. Carter et al  82  observed greater weight loss at 6 months in the group receiving SMS compared with the Web site plus Internet forum or paper diary plus Internet forum groups, whereas Haapala et al  73  demonstrated similar results in a study that compared SMS with a wait-list control group at 12 months. Although none of the US studies using SMS reported positive findings beyond 9 months, the Finnish study  73  showed that an SMS intervention could result in significantly greater weight loss than no intervention for up to 12 months.\n\nShuger et al  76  reported a study that tested the Bodymedia armband for monitoring daily physical activity with a wristwatch display with or without a behavioral intervention and compared it with 2 groups not using the armband. Only the armband plus intervention group achieved significantly greater weight loss than the self-directed control group at 9 months. Two investigators  77, 84  used PDAs for self-monitoring. Burke et al  77  compared 3 standard behavioral weight loss interventions that differed in the method of self-monitoring by using a paper diary or a PDA with or without daily tailored feedback messages via the PDA and found no difference in weight loss at 2 years. Spring et al  84  compared a biweekly group weight loss intervention with the same intervention plus PDA-based self-monitoring and personalized coach feedback by phone. They observed significantly different weight loss at 6 months, but the effect was not sustained at 12 months.\n\nTurner-McGrievy et al  75  reported that a theory-based podcast delivered via MP3 players or computers led to significantly greater weight loss than a non-theory-based weight loss podcast at 12 weeks. Building on this study, the investigators  80, 81  conducted a follow-up study to compare the incremental effect of adding mobile apps for self-monitoring and communication with a health coach and group members to the theory-based podcast. However, the addition did not result in significantly greater weight loss than the podcast alone at 6 months.  80, 81 able 2.

The 6-month UK study 82 compared a self-directed smartphone app for goal setting and self-monitoring plus automated tailored feedback via text messaging with a Web site control and a paper diary control. Compared with the 2 other groups, the smartphone group achieved significantly greater mean weight loss at 6 months. The 1-year Finnish study  73  was the only mobile technology intervention reviewed in the 2013 AHA/ACC/TOS obesity treatment guideline. It tested a weight loss intervention via text messaging for instructions, self-monitoring, and automated personalized feedback versus a no-intervention control group among overweight or obese adults. Although none of the US adult studies reported positive findings beyond 9 months, the Finnish study showed that a text messaging intervention could result in significantly greater weight loss than no intervention up to 12 months (ie, intermediate term).\n\nAlso included in Table  2  is the only meta-analysis  66  to date that has focused on text messaging interventions for weight loss that showed that the pooled mean weight change was significantly better in intervention participants than in the control conditions. However, both the intervention and control subgroups were heterogeneous, and the funnel plot suggested a possible publication bias.\n\nKhaylis and colleagues 69 identified 5 key components to efficacious technology-based weight loss interventions: use of a structured program, self-monitoring, feedback and communication, social support, and individual tailoring. These components found in the mobile technology interventions were shown to produce greater weight loss than in a randomized control group, although the extent and nature of the implementation of each component varied across studies. Additionally, all of the effective mobile interventions focused on caloriereduced healthy eating, increased physical activity, and behavior change, which is consistent with the 2013 AHA/ACC/TOS guideline recommendation for comprehensive behavioral weight loss interventions.  57 Evidence from the reviewed RCTs suggests that these technologies may be effective when used alone or in conjunction with traditional weight loss intervention delivery modalities (eg, telephonic coach feedback, inperson group sessions, Web sites) to achieve modest weight loss of clinical significance in the short term."

      "text": "During the past decade, the mHealth field has made great strides developing efficacious mobile weight loss approaches. Indeed, mobile interventions can produce weight loss in motivated populations, albeit at a lower magnitude relative to traditional treatment approaches. The characteristics of successful mobile interventions are quite comparable to those of their offline counterparts: The largest weight losses are produced by comprehensive, multicomponent interventions that are personally tailored, promote regular self-monitoring, and involve a qualified interventionist.  69 The accumulated evidence, although limited, supports intervention delivery through a range of technology channels (including the Web, SMS, e-mail, telephone, and IVR), with limited variability in the magnitude of weight loss outcomes.\n\nStandard behavioral weight loss treatment is delivered by a trained healthcare professional to promote calorie-controlled healthy eating, increased physical activity, and behavior change in in-person group or individual sessions of a prescribed frequency and duration. It is encouraging that sufficient evidence derived mainly from studies of Internet-, e-mail-, and telephone-based interventions has accrued to buttress the 2013 AHA/ACC/TOS obesity treatment guideline recommending electronically delivered comprehensive weight loss programs encompassing personalized coach feedback as an acceptable, albeit possibly less effective, alternative to standard in-person treatment.\n\nOur review finds that self-monitoring and automated personalized feedback are common features in the contemporary mobile weight loss interventions.

One RCT in the United Kingdom showed the effectiveness of a self-directed smartphone app as a standalone intervention in overweight and obese adults,  82  although the translatability of the results to US adults is unclear as a result of a lack of research.\n\nUntil more evidence emerges, health practitioners looking to implement or recommend mHealth interventions to their overweight and obese patients should ensure that the programs and tools they recommend include established evidence-based content and components of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention (ie, calorie-controlled healthy eating and increased physical activity with specified goals and behavioral strategies) and facilitate adoption of evidence-based weight loss behaviors (eg, self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and social support from coaches or peers). In the context of these programs, mobile technologies, particularly SMS/multimedia messaging service messaging and smartphone apps, may be the primary intervention modality when supported by other methods (Web sites or telephone calls). At present, no recommendations can be made for US consumers on the effectiveness of text messaging as a stand-alone intervention for weight loss or the effectiveness of any particular smartphone app."

      "text": "There is great need for studies that explore mobile interventions in diverse contexts, particularly general consumer samples, and in clinical practice settings. Although great strides have been made, we do not have an answer to the question that consumers are most likely to ask: Are commercial mobile weight loss apps efficacious? We know little about the efficacy of the >1000 apps that purport to help consumers lose weight. Moreover, few, if any, research-tested apps have been widely disseminated or commercialized. Academic-industry partnerships are needed from the intervention development stage to formative evaluation to confirmatory research and then to dissemination and implementation.\n\nThe research literature investigating mobile weight loss interventions remains in its infancy, with many important questions yet to be answered. Indeed, we know little about how to best integrate mobile interventions into the primary care setting, where they might serve as adjuncts to weight loss counseling delivered by primary care or other providers such as dietitians or nurses. There are potentially significant opportunities to explore the integration of mobile technologies, given health system changes associated with the Affordable Care Act and the 2011 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services decision to reimburse qualified providers for delivering intensive behavioral treatment for obesity. We need to also expand the range of populations that have been studied. Thus far, we know the least about those populations with the highest obesity rates and those who bear the greatest burden of obesity-associated disease: racial/ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.  85 This fails to deliver on the promise of digital health approaches, which have potential for extending the reach of intervention approaches. Despite their higher levels of mobile phone ownership and use,  28, 86  early evidence suggests that high-risk populations experience suboptimal weight losses,  85  as is often observed with traditional treatment approaches.\n\nMore work is necessary to assess and improve the magnitude of weight loss outcomes produced by mobile interventions and long-term maintenance of weight loss. A particular priority is identifying strategies to promote sustained user engagement. Indeed, across a large number of studies, weight loss outcomes have been shown to be dependent largely on the level of participant engagement.  63, 72 Unfortunately, declining engagement and attrition (often as high as 40%-50%) are characteristic of digital health interventions.  87 Mobile interventions developed in research settings might benefit from leveraging the iterative design and testing conventions that are commonly used in the commercial market to promote user engagement. Furthermore, the most successful trials have combined interventionist support with a mobile intervention. We know much less about the efficacy of stand-alone mobile interventions, those that have the greatest potential for broad dissemination.\n\nAt present, there is considerable variability in the technologies, intervention components, design, and delivery schedules of mobile interventions. We know little about which technologies or intervention components, or combinations thereof, are best equipped to produce clinically meaningful weight loss. There does not appear to be substantial variability in the magnitude of weight loss outcomes in the mHealth approaches we reviewed. We have identified the following gaps and directions for future research:\n\n\u2022 The applications of mobile technology for weight loss have been limited in conceptualization and narrow in implementation. Future mobile technology weight loss interventions should build on the best evidence of the efficacious core components of comprehensive lifestyle programs.\n\n\u2022 Text messaging has been the primary delivery format researched to date; however, it is only one of a growing number of mobile delivery formats (eg, smartphone apps, wearable sensors that synchronize data with smartphones). We need to address the many pitfalls in the current mHealth approaches, for example, the absence of a theoretical basis, limited application of the best practices in technology design, low use of empirically supported behavioral strategies, and limited scientific rigor, by engaging in transdisciplinary collaboration and inclusion of the end users, the clinicians and patients, in all phases from the intervention development to implementation.\n\n\u2022 Mixed methods research should be used to elucidate the frequency, timing and duration of various mobile delivery formats that can enhance the usability and acceptability of technology.\n\n\u2022 Future work needs to focus on comparative effectiveness research using alternative designs, for example, equivalence and noninferiority trials. In addition, we need to use more flexible study designs that are able to provide September 22, 2015 answers within a shorter time frame than the conventional 5-year clinical trial when testing a delivery mode that will become obsolete before the end of the trial.  88 Finally, we need to capitalize on the currently available technologies that permit collection and transmission of data in real time to better learn about the behaviors and moods of individuals in their natural setting, referred to as ecological momentary assessment, which can inform the development of interventions that can be delivered in real time and thus provide support when individuals are in need of it.  89, 90"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the AHA recommend that adults participate in \u226530 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week.  91 According to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,  92  adults should avoid inactivity or extended periods of sedentary activity, do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly, and do muscle-strengthening activities on at least 2 d/wk.  93 Sustained physical activity has many health benefits such as decreasing the risk for premature death, T2DM, stroke, some forms of cancer, osteoporosis, and depression.  94 There is sufficient evidence that physical activity can help reduce CVD risk factors such as high BP.  94 hysical activity in the United States has significantly declined over the past 2 decades. Since the late 1980s, the proportion of adult women who report no leisure-time activity has increased from 19.1% to 51.7%, and the proportion of adult men reporting no leisure-time activity rose from 11.4% to 43.5%.  95 The participation in leisure-time activity is lowest in blacks, with >55% not meeting the guidelines, followed by those identifying as Hispanic or Latino, with >54% not meeting guidelines.  96 More than 66% of those who have not completed high school do not meet the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.  96"

      "text": "We searched PubMed using the terms physical activity, physically active, walk, aerobic, sport, lifestyle, and sedentary. The literature search yielded 1490 studies. Of these, 1415 were excluded after review of title (n=797), abstract (n=528), or full text (n=122). Of the 122 that did not qualify on the basis of full text review, articles were excluded for the following reasons: 44 were focused on diabetes mellitus, 39 were focused on weight loss, and 41 did not meet RCT criteria. Therefore, 41 articles were eligible for the present review: 12 were literature reviews of physical activity for CVD prevention, 15 were studies validating technology, and 14 were RCTs that are detailed in Table  3 . The literature search yielded studies reporting numerous types of technology that can be used for increasing physical activity: texting or SMS messaging on mobile phone (n=3), pedometer (n=1), e-mail (n=1), and Internet (n=9). Several studies included a combination of technologies.\n\nNine of the 14 studies reported significant increases in physical activity in the intervention group compared with the control condition.  98, 97, [100] [101] [102] [103] 106, 06, 107, 109  Overall, the technology that was used most often to increase physical activity was the Internet through Web sites, online tutorials, or networking opportunities. Many of the programs that used the Internet also used other forms of technology, including pedometers and feedback messages via e-mail. Of the 9 studies that used the Internet as the main intervention component, 5 reported significant differences between groups in increasing physical activity.  98, 100, 102, 106, 107 he outcomes differed in each study and included increases in step counts, increases in moderately vigorous physical activity, increases in moderate physical activity, and increases in minutes per week of physical activity. Two of the 14 studies examined the use of SMS,  103, 109  and both reported significant differences between the intervention and control or comparative conditions.  103.109 .109 Two additional studies reported testing the use of messages, either through a PDA or e-mail, and found significantly greater increases in physical activity in the intervention group compared with the control or nonintervention group.  97, 101  systematic review of 26 studies published in 2014 by Bort-Roig et al 111 examined the use of smartphones to influence physical activity. Only 5 studies in the review assessed interventions for physical activity, and 4 reported an increase in steps per day. However, the studies were limited by small samples, with only 1 study having a sample size >50. A systematic review of 11 studies by  Buchholz et al 112  in 2013 reported that <10 RCTs using SMS to target physical activity had been conducted across 7 countries and found that a small number of studies had examined the use of SMS for promotion of physical activity. The median effect size for differences in change scores between intervention and control groups for the studies was 0.50 but ranged from 0.20 to >1.00. The review noted that there was no evidence to suggest why there were such vast differences in the effect size.  112 ne area that is growing in acceptance among consumers is active video gaming or exergaming. The studies using this technology had some methodological limitations and thus were not included in this review. However, a systematic review by  Peng et al 113  reported that laboratory studies have demonstrated that this technology is capable of providing light to moderate physical activity. However, only 3 studies in that review supported gaming as an effective tool to significantly increase physical activity or exercise attendance.\n\nMost mobile technology interventions that have been reported in the published literature allow users to self-monitor physical activity by manually entering exercise bouts or total accumulated activity. However, more technologically sophisticated approaches for physical activity monitoring are rapidly becoming widely available. Physical activity tracking devices, also referred to as wearables, have become highly prevalent among consumers for self-monitoring daily activity. Most of these devices include accelerometers that capture users' duration and intensity of physical activity. 114 Some devices also include global positioning service (GPS) functionality that can capture the location of exercise sessions. Originally designed to be worn on the hip, wearables can now be placed comfortably in a range of locations (wrist, ankle, arm, shoe). The majority of current smartphones also include accelerometers and gyroscopes, allowing them to provide functionality similar to wearable devices. A host of third-party software\n\nTable 3.

The realm where there seems to have been a prolific explosion of wearable devices and trackers is physical activity; however, compared with some of the other health-related areas, the research conducted to date is limited. The following list outlines the gaps and recommendations for future research in the area of mHealth interventions for promoting physical activity:\n\n\u2022 Little is known about the use of wearable consumer devices, although many adults are using this technology. Therefore, large-scale, randomized trials of diverse populations need to be conducted to test the efficacy of this technology in increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behavior.\n\n\u2022 Health-related apps are among the most popular downloads, yet they are not being rigorously tested. Therefore, commercially available apps that are downloaded by the public need to be validated and examined for efficacy and acceptability and for sustainability of engagement. Only then can we provide the consumer with evidence for their use.\n\n\u2022 Similarly, additional testing is recommended for the use of exergaming to increase physical activity levels in both children and adults.\n\n\u2022 The Internet was the platform tested most often for the delivery of technology targeting increased physical activity. Thus, other platforms need to be tested for promoting physical activity, for example, SMS or more recently developed approaches that can be delivered on a smartphone or tablet."

      "text": "Tobacco use remains the most significant preventable risk factor for CVD. The AHA Task Force on Risk Reduction noted that approximately a third of CVD deaths are attributable to smoking and that a substantial and rapid decrease in risk results from smoking cessation.  117 Although there are a number of effective pharmacological and behavioral interventions for smoking cessation, the delivery of these interventions has been inconsistent. Practice guidelines for smoking cessation incorporate the 5 As: ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange.  118 lthough most healthcare providers report asking about smoking and advising their patients to quit, they are much less likely to assess willingness to quit, assist with cessation, or arrange follow-up.  119 Given the limitations of smoking cessation delivered by health professionals, technologies have been leveraged to facilitate the delivery of smoking cessation interventions. Early approaches used the Internet to deliver these interventions,  120  and current and reputable Internet interventions such as smokefree.gov are available.  121 The advent of mobile technologies provides potential delivery advantages over Internet interventions via desktop or laptop computers.\n\nSmoking urges occur frequently throughout the day in response to various triggers, and indoor smoking bans have moved smoking behavior outside, away from computers used at work and home. Mobile devices are therefore more likely to be available when smokers experience the urge to smoke and can deliver interventions at these times. These mobile devices also offer the promise of \"just-in-time adaptive interventions\" that adapt interventions on the basis of context and potentially preempt smoking behavior by anticipating when urges are likely to occur.  122 urrent commercially available mobile apps for smoking cessation have generally failed to deliver empirically supported interventions or to make optimal use of the capabilities of mobile phones. A series of studies by Abroms and colleagues  123, 124  have shown that most commercially available smoking cessation apps do not adhere to practice guidelines for smoking cessation. Some of these practice guidelines, developed for delivery by healthcare professionals, may not be appropriate criteria for mobile interventions. For instance, should a smoking cessation mobile app ask about smoking, or is it reasonable to assume that, if a user has downloaded an app for quitting smoking, he or she is a smoker? Additionally, some empirically supported approaches that are amenable to a computerized intervention such as scheduled gradual reduction of smoking 125 may not have been included in the practice guidelines because of the difficulty of delivery by healthcare professionals. Even with these caveats, commercially available mobile apps for smoking cessation are generally incomplete and lack empirical basis. Abroms and colleagues  123, 124  have documented that, although some smoking cessation apps are downloaded more than a million times per month, smartphone apps adhere, on average, to only about a third of the practice guidelines for smoking cessation interventions.\n\nAlthough most commercially available smoking cessation apps are incomplete or lack empirical support, there has been considerable research on the efficacy of mobile interventions for smoking cessation that we review below. Until quite recently, these empirically tested interventions developed by smoking cessation researchers were not commercially available. Much of the initial research on SMS for smoking cessation occurred outside of the United States, and the programs, if available at all, are available only in those countries. Additionally, researchers developing these mobile smoking cessation programs often did not partner with commercial entities capable of marketing the program once evaluated; however, there are recent examples of commercially available programs developed by researchers.  126, 127"

      "text": "We searched PubMed for the years 2004 to 2014 using the terms quit smoke; stop smoke; stopped smoke; ceased smoke; smoking cessation; cigarette smoke; smokeless tobacco; smoker; tobacco cessation; tobacco use; nicotine replacement; nicotine gum; nicotine lozenge; nicotine nasal; nicotine patch; and nicotine inhalant. These terms were cross-referenced with the mobile technology terms described previously. This search resulted in 286 identified articles. Of these, most (211) were not relevant to mobile technologies for smoking cessation. These were predominately Internet-based interventions or studies that used mobile technologies for recruitment or measurement purposes but not for intervention. Of the remaining 85 publications, 14 were RCTs of mobile technologies for smoking cessation, and these trials are described in Table  4 . The remaining reports of mobile technologies for smoking cessation were a range of studies including descriptions of design and development; reports of feasibility, acceptability, and usability data; uncontrolled trials; and various systematic reviews. For completeness, 2 Cochrane meta-analyses of this area  140, 141  are included in the table."

      "title": "SMS for Smoking Cessation",
      "text": "Most of the research on mobile smoking cessation interventions has focused on text messaging as the delivery medium. Why was SMS the focus when there are so many other delivery mediums on today's smartphones? First, many of the early studies using mobile phones for smoking cessation  128, 142  predate the advent of the smartphone; hence, SMS was one of the few functions available on feature phones for the delivery of interventions. Second, SMS is a relatively inexpensive development environment that will run on any cell phone, whereas a smartphone app needs to be developed for each operating system (eg, Android, iOS) and updated with each operating system update. Third, although smartphone use is increasing dramatically and is now at >50% in the United States,  29  smartphone use was reported as lowest by adults in lower socioeconomic groups.  143 Smoking rates are disproportionately higher in lower socioeconomic groups 144 that remain predominately feature phone users. Recent Pew statistics show, however, that Hispanics and blacks have higher rates of smartphone use than whites, indicating the demographic shift in mobile phone use that could make smartphone apps a viable medium for cessation interventions targeting minorities.  30"

      "text": "Controlled studies of mobile phone programs for smoking cessation have been summarized in a Cochrane meta-analysis 140 and update.  141 The details of studies reviewed in these 2 meta-analyses are listed in Table  4 . For both reviews, the primary outcome was smoking abstinence of \u22656 months and included both sustained and point prevalence abstinence and both self-reported and biochemically validated smoking status. However, the number of studies reviewed was 4 and 5, respectively, in the 2 meta-analyses, and there was considerable heterogeneity of effect across studies.\n\nThe initial Cochrane review 140 identified 9 articles relevant to smoking cessation via mobile phones in which the mobile intervention was a core component, not just an adjunct to an Internet or in-person program. Of these, 4 were small, nonrandomized feasibility trials, and 2 had insufficient follow-up for inclusion. Of the 4 studies included in the meta-analysis, 2 assessed the same text messaging program delivered in 2 different countries,  128, 131  and the remaining 2 trials 129,130 evaluated a combined Internet and mobile phone intervention. The 4 studies lacked long-term follow-up or biochemical validation in more than a small subsample of participants, but all 4 studies showed significantly greater abstinence at 6 months compared with control subjects (Table  4  provides details).\n\nIn the 2012 update of the Cochrane review, 141 5 trials were included: a video messaging mobile phone intervention, 133 a Web-based quit coach and text messaging intervention, 136 and 3 evaluations of an SMS or text messaging intervention.  128, 131, 132 Pooled across these 5 studies, the relative risk for long-term quit rates was 1.71. Among the studies reviewed in the Cochrane update, the large, well-controlled UK study by Free and colleagues 132 accounted for more than half (50.45%) of the subjects in the meta-analysis. In this single-blind trial, 5800 smokers willing to quit were randomly assigned either to a mobile phone text program (txt2stop) that included behavior change support and motivational messages or to a control group that received SMSs unrelated to quitting smoking. On the basis of biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months, quit rates were significantly greater in the txt2stop (10.7%) than in the control group (4.9%), and the abstinence rates were similar when those lost to follow-up were treated as smokers. Since the Cochrane update in 2012, there have been a number of RCTs of smoking cessation programs delivered via mobile phone technologies, and they are listed in Table  4 ."

      "text": "There are limited intervention options for pregnant smokers. In a preliminary trial comparing smoking cessation programs in pregnant smokers, 134 there were no significant differences in self-reported smoking abstinence between groups who received educational materials and those who received tailored SMSs. Further research is needed to identify minimal risk interventions that are effective for pregnant smokers.\n\nLikewise, young adults with low education are a particularly vulnerable population for smoking that warrants additional research on both prevention and cessation interventions. Two recent studies 138,139 compared the effectiveness of technology-based smoking cessation interventions with educational pamphlets in adolescent vocational students. Neither study reported significant differences in self-reported abstinence after intervention between the groups receiving text messaging interventions and those receiving paper-based educational materials; however, the sample sizes in these 2 studies may have been inadequate to detect differences."

In contrast to many previous programs that primarily push out texts, the Text2Quit program is interactive and prompts users to track smoking and report cravings. Using keyword texts, users have the ability to reset quit dates, request help with a craving, obtain program and data summaries, and indicate if they have slipped and smoked. Mailed saliva cotinine-verified point prevalence abstinence at 6 months showed an 11% abstinence rate for intervention compared with 5% for control subjects. In contrast to the studies and programs in the earlier Cochrane reviews, this study was conducted in the United States and evaluated a program that is commercially available to smokers in the United States.\n\nTable 4.

Therefore, although these text messaging programs have sufficient empirical support to be recommended to patients interested in quitting smoking, the selection of text messaging intervention may matter. \u2022 Unfortunately, many of these empirically supported text messaging programs were developed and evaluated outside the United States and are not available, commercially or otherwise, to US smokers. This lack of access in the United States to proven text messaging programs is beginning to change. Abroms and colleagues 127 recently published evidence for their Text2Quit program, which is commercially available.\n\n\u2022 Although hundreds of smartphone applications for smoking cessation are commercially available, there is considerable evidence that these applications have a limited empirical basis,  123, 124  and we could find no published study testing the efficacy of any of these commercially available smartphone apps. In the 1 study that compared smartphone apps with text messaging, 137 text messaging produced better quit rates. Although it is clearly premature to recommend any smartphone application for smoking cessation at this time, smartphone applications hold potential future promise as smoking cessation interventions. Smartphones provide a range of potential features and functions not available via text messaging modalities that have not been adequately leveraged to date for smoking cessation. For example, movement and location sensors in smartphones could be used to learn the contexts in which users smoke and deliver interventions preemptively before the urge to smoke occurs.  122 ensors connected to smartphones such as carbon monoxide monitors 146 provide objective measures of smoking status.\n\n\u2022 Another promising approach that builds on the use of smartphones is ecological momentary interventions, an approach to the delivery of interventions to people during their everyday lives (ie, in real time) and in natural settings (ie, the real world).  147 This approach is gaining increasing attention as a potential approach across multiple behavioral domains and was tested in an earlier study for smoking cessation with significantly higher quit rates in the intervention group than in the control group at 6 and 12 weeks, but this rate was not sustained at 26 weeks.  128, 147 Ongoing studies are testing this approach with the currently available smartphone technology.\n\n\u2022 One critical but inadequately researched area is how to engage smokers to initiate the use of these mobile phone SMS programs. The well-controlled, populationbased, multiarm trial of Borland and colleagues 136 had fewer than half of the intervention participants engage with the intervention on even a minimal basis. In the follow-up study by Riley and colleagues, 148 participants were assisted with program initialization as a result of the findings of an earlier trial in which 37% of the participants completed baseline measures but failed to initialize the SMS program on their own.  142 Bock and colleagues 148a conducted focus groups on preferences for a SMS-based smoking cessation program for potential users. Participants recommended including social networking components, greater control of program output via online profile, and more interactive text messaging features. In parallel with research on the efficacy of these mobile phone programs for those who engage with them, research on how to engage smokers and keep them engaged in these programs is also needed."

      "text": "Smoking cessation via mobile phone intervention is a relatively young area of research with only 10 years of published literature. Within this short period, however, a number of large, well-controlled studies have shown that SMS programs produce approximately double the abstinence rates of minimal intervention control conditions. Despite this success, the failure rate from these programs is still unacceptably high (\u224890% fail to quit at 6 months), and the heterogeneity of effect across studies suggests that certain varieties of SMS interventions may work better than others and in certain populations differentially from others. Until more is known on optimal intervention components of SMS for smoking cessation and on which smokers are more likely to benefit from these approaches, the current literature is able to support only that SMS interventions should be considered along with other efficacious smoking cessation interventions for smokers trying to quit."

      "title": "Use of mHealth for Self-Management of Diabetes Mellitus",
      "text": "Diabetes mellitus occurs in 9.3% of the US population (29.1 million individuals). Of increasing concern is the number of US adults with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (8.1 million) or prediabetes (86 million). 149 CVD and stroke are serious complications of diabetes mellitus. The majority of US adults \u226518 years of age with diabetes mellitus have CVD risk factors, including high BP (71%), high cholesterol (65%),  159  and obesity (70%).  150 Although death rates for heart attack and stroke have decreased, adults with diabetes mellitus are twice as likely to be hospitalized for and to die of these diseases as people who do not have diabetes mellitus. Because people with diabetes mellitus are living longer, the prevalence of obesity is not abating, and the rate of diagnosed new cases is increasing (7.8-12.0 per 1000 in 2012, depending on age), scientists expect that the number of people with diabetes mellitus and CVD will continue to rise. However, because the rates of survival after heart attack and stroke continue to improve, more people with diabetes mellitus will continue to live into older age with comorbidities of CVD and diabetes mellitus.\n\nAccording to the joint statement of the AHA and American Diabetes Association, glycemic control in diabetes mellitus management for both type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM is important in risk reduction for CVD events. Hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) is the clinical measure of glycemic control, and the self-monitoring of blood glucose is done by the consumer (patient). A general population target of HbA 1c <7% is recommended for clinician consideration and health plan targets, but an individualized approach to glycemic control at the patient level is suggested. It is important to note that the consumer (patient) role in glycemic control requires problem solving and daily decision making about multiple behaviors (eating, activity, monitoring, and medication taking), and the healthcare provider role is collaborating with the patient to prescribe the appropriate diabetes mellitus medication(s) and monitoring the impact. 151"

      "text": "There are thousands of mobile applications for supporting diabetes mellitus self-management, serving primarily as tracking and reference apps. Few have been evaluated, and even fewer have demonstrated outcomes.  137 In fact, <1% of mobile applications have been evaluated through research. It can be hoped that increased federal and private foundation investments in mHealth and behavioral, clinical, and health system interventions combined with new regulatory requirements will provide consumers and providers with evidence of effectiveness or what works.\n\nA number of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions for diabetes mellitus management have been confirmed by multiple RCTs; however, only 48.7% of patients meet the HbA 1c , BP, and lipid goals for diabetes mellitus care, and only 14.3% meet these 3 measures and the goals for tobacco use.  137 The National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education/Support, jointly published by the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Diabetes Educators, incorporate the American Association of Diabetes Educators 7 self-care behaviors (physical activity, healthy eating, taking medication, monitoring, selfmanagement problem solving, reducing risks, and healthy coping) as essential behaviors for improving diabetes mellitus self-management.  152, 153 obile technologies for diabetes mellitis self-management can be categorized in the following way: SMS apps via mobile phone, diabetes mellitus medical devices (eg, blood glucose meters, insulin pumps) with connectivity to smartphone apps, and bidirectional data sharing between patients and providers through smartphones. This classification did not exist when most of the reviewed articles were published. Interventions delivered via mobile technologies and directed at consumers may be supported by behavior change theories or principles, for example, the self-efficacy theory. However, most studies have limited theoretical foundations or lack an empirical basis. Moreover, healthcare providers lack knowledge about what apps are available or how to evaluate them and thus are hesitant to recommend them.  23 lthough large, primary care RCTs of mobile diabetes mellitus management are limited, smaller studies addressing the feasibility, usability, and acceptability have generally identified the following components as essential to successful diabetes mellitus management: personalized engagement, provision of actionable feedback for consumers, and connection with providers or healthcare systems. Additional contributors to usability include mobile technologies to support community health workers and peer-supported self-care behaviors. 155"

      "text": "We searched PubMed for the years 2004 to 2014 using the terms type 2 diabetes; NIDDM; maturity onset diabetes; adult onset diabetes; non-insulin dependent; noninsulin dependent; slow onset diabetes; stable diabetes; hyperinsulinemia; hyperinsulinism; insulin resistance; hyperglycemia; glucose intolerance; metabolic syndrome; metabolic X syndrome; dysmetabolic syndrome; and metabolic cardiovascular syndrome. These terms were cross-referenced with the mobile technology terms described previously. This search resulted in 242 identified articles. Of these, 83 were not relevant to the use of mobile technology with diabetes mellitus, and 159 were reviewed further. Of these 159 references identified, 142 were excluded after review of the title, abstract, and full text. Similar to other sections of this review, mobile technologies may target multiple behaviors singly or in combination to improve numerous clinical and behavioral outcomes. Therefore, for this review, we focused on studies with change in the clinical metric of HbA 1c as the primary outcome, considered the gold standard in diabetes mellitus improvement. Seventeen articles were eligible for this review, and 10 of these 17 were international studies.\n\nThe types of mobile technologies used for diabetes mellitus self-management research interventions include mobile platforms with diabetes mellitus-specific software apps or SMS. Table  5  provides details of the RCTs using these mobile tools that we reviewed.\n\nWhen evaluating interventions, we considered an HbA 1c reduction of at least 0.3% as a clinically meaningful treatment effect 175 and a 1% decrease in HbA 1c as a clinically meaningful indicator of reduced risk of diabetes mellitus complications on the basis of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) clinical trials.  176, 177 One US study 170 reported a significantly greater HbA 1c decrease in the intervention group than in the control group. Quinn et al 170 evaluated a mobile phone software application with a patient and provider Web portal. The average HbA 1c decline over the 1-year intervention was 1.9% for the intervention group versus 0.7% for the control group, a difference of 1.2% (P<0.001). Among 4 studies  156, 158, 159, 165  using SMS alone and SMS with Web tracking, 3 studies reported significant changes in HbA 1c .  156, 159, 165 Six studies used a mixture of technologies for the intervention, including mobile phones, Internet, Web portals, SMS, and glucose meters that provided messaging.  164, 166, 168, 171, 178 e also include in Table  5  a systematic review by Liang et al  173  and a Cochrane review.  174 The systematic review included 22 trials. The meta-analysis of 1657 participants showed that mobile phone interventions for diabetes mellitus self-management reduced HbA 1c values by a mean of 0.5% over a median of 6 months of follow-up. A subgroup analysis of 11 studies of patients with T2DM reported a significantly greater reduction in HbA 1c compared with studies of those with type 1 diabetes mellitus (0.8% [9 mmol/mol] versus 0.3% [3 mmol/mol]; P=0.02). The authors reported that the effect of the mobile phone intervention did not differ significantly by other participant characteristics or intervention strategies. The Cochrane review reported computer-based diabetes mellitus self-management interventions for adults with T2DM in 4 studies. The interventions addressed in this review included those using computer-based software applications that were based on user input (touch screen or other clinic support), desktop computer-based and mobile phone-based interventions. The Cochrane review also included other outcomes besides HbA 1c , for example, health-related quality of life, death resulting from any cause, depression, adverse\n\nTable 5.

However, for 8 of the reviewed studies, they reported that the significant mean difference in the HbA 1c change for mHealth interventions compared with control condition ranged from 0.01 to -0.8 (95% confidence interval, -1.45 to 0.15).\n\nAn early review of evidence on barriers and drivers of the use of interactive consumer health information technology by the elderly, people with chronic conditions or disabilities, and the underserved concluded that questions remain as to the optimal frequency of use of systems by patients and providers and whether the success of interventions depends on repeated modification of the patient's treatment regimen or ongoing assistance with applying a static treatment plan.  179 A recent review focused on the effect of mobile phone interventions for HbA 1c (%), M (SD):  Int1: 9.4 (1.7)  Int2: 9.3 (1.6)  Int3: 9.2 (1.4)  Int4: 9.2 (1 .6) Retention: 70% Intervention adherence: Attendance (4/6 sessions): Int1: 75.6% Int3: 72.7% No. of entries/y: Int2: 342 Int3: 359 Interventionist: Int1: NR Int2: NR Int3: NR Int4: NR Systematic reviews and meta-analyses Liang et al, 173 2011 Design: Meta-analysis of 22 clinical trials Outcome: \u2206 in HbA 1c (%) N=1657 Mean age (SD): 44 (18) y Women: 45% White: NR Studies on impact of mobile phone intervention on diabetes self-management SMS to deliver blood glucose test results and self-management information Duration: median, 6 mo (range, 3-12 mo) Median 6 mo pooled \u2206 in HbA 1c (%), M (95% CI): -0.5 (-0.3 to -0.7), indicating that the reduction of HbA 1c value was 0.5% lower in mobile Int groups compared with other Int groups Subgroup analysis showed greater \u2206 in HbA 1c in type 2 than type 1 diabetes mellitus (-0.8% vs -0.3%) P=0.02 Pal et al, 174 2013 Design: meta-analysis of data from 11 Trials Outcome: HbA 1c (%) N=3578 Mean age: 46-67 y Time since diagnosis: 6-13 y Assess the effects on health status and healthrelated quality of life of computer-based diabetes self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus Computer-based interventions Duration: range, 1-12 mo Based on 2637 Ps; 11 trials: Pooled effect on HbA 1c : 0.2% (95% CI, -0.4 to -0.1) P=0.009\n\nBased on 280 Ps; 3 trials.

Among the studies that we reviewed (Table  5 ), duration of interventions in the studies varied from 3 to 18 months. However, it should be noted that most clinical trials we reviewed examined change in HbA 1c during a 3-month intervention, and very little was reported about the engagement and persistence of use with the technology. Participants randomized to the intervention arms of the trials received enhanced clinical attention and may have received diabetes mellitus management supplies. Therefore, it may be inaccurate to assume that a significant change in HbA 1c in an intervention group at 3 months is attributable to technology instead of other nonspecific benefits of participation, especially considering a report from a 2011 survey that showed that 26% of downloaded health apps are used only once and 74% are abandoned by the 10th use.  180 he use of heterogeneous interventions (mobile phones, SMS, or Internet based) makes it more difficult to determine the effect of any single technology component on HbA 1c . As suggested in other reviews  174, 181  of studies with different technology-based approaches (eg, automatic SMS messages versus personalized feedback), a single component of technology may affect different behaviors in ways not clearly distinguishable when intervention components are combined. Authors of 2 systematic reviews concluded that interventions were more likely to be successful if they selected and combined theorybased behavior change strategies,  174, 182  including interactive components that involve tracking, personalized feedback, and peer support."

      "text": "Few studies focus on high-risk, underserved, or minority populations. Most studies do not report changes in antihyperglycemic medications during the intervention, which may affect the change in HbA 1c . Without that information, it is difficult to determine whether changes in lifestyle behavior or changes in medications contributed to the effectiveness of the mobile intervention. It is possible that reports of the follow-up secondary analyses of such studies have not been published or that our search missed them. The reviewed studies did not report intervention dose or receipt, that is, the number of SMS messages or push notifications sent and opened by participants. Only 1 study 170 reported differences in HbA 1c change as a function of different baseline HbA 1c levels, which may be important for understanding who will most benefit when specific populations, including older adults, are targeted. Similar to other sections in this statement, we recommend here that future studies address the need to identify specific behaviors that may impact glucose management singly or in combination.\n\nWe recommend the following:\n\n\u2022 Technology development or intervention development should be considered to meet the needs of specific population groups: older adults with age-related changes such as vision or touch, minorities needing culturally sensitive intervention content or materials and approaches, and low-income adults who may have inconsistent access to mobile technologies and supplies to support diabetes mellitus management.\n\n\u2022 Studies should evaluate technology-supported glucose management for periods >3 months to determine the sustainability of engagement and the long-term effects of mHealth interventions in maintaining behavior changes.\n\n\u2022 Studies are needed that include clinical, technical, and behavioral factors that may influence the initial engagement and ongoing use of mHealth and its associated impact on outcomes.\n\n\u2022 Future studies should examine other outcomes related to improved diabetes mellitus management such as quality of life and acceptability of mHealth devices.\n\n\u2022 Finally, we recommend that future studies examine the relationships among use of mHealth interventions, HbA 1c change, and healthcare use and costs, including consumer and provider costs. As more public and private insurers reimburse for the cost of mHealth interventions, evaluation of claims data from these populations may add to our understanding of cost-effectiveness."

      "title": "Using mHealth to Improve Hypertension Care",
      "text": "Hypertension is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition that is a major risk factor in CVD. The risk for CVD events such as stroke or myocardial infarction doubles for every 20-mm Hg increase in systolic BP (SBP) and 10-mm Hg increase in diastolic BP.  183  Best practices for treatment of hypertension include a combination of pharmacotherapy and preventive lifestyle counseling for exercise, healthful eating, and smoke-free living.  183 Despite widespread initiatives to treat hypertension and the availability of antihypertensive medications, <50% of people in the United States have controlled BP.  150  This is thought to be due largely to suboptimal adherence to self-care.  184 trategies to improve self-care and adherence have been explored. Face-to-face counseling has been shown to be associated with reductions of 3 to 8 mm Hg in SBP among patients with hypertension.  184 Team-based hypertension care, with partnership between a primary care physician and other professionals such as nurses, pharmacists, or community health workers, has been shown to increase the percentage of patients with controlled BP by 12%.  185 Still, costs of such care models prevent dissemination and sustainability.\n\nThe rapid growth of the Internet and mobile telecommunication offers unprecedented opportunity to improve patient access to and engagement with hypertension care.  186, 187 In general, they follow the premise that patients might spend only a few hours a year with a physician or nurse, but they spend 5000 waking hours each year engaged in choices that affect their health.  188 These eHealth programs can be delivered by the Internet, e-mail, SMS, or similar electronic means to engage patients in remote BP, medication, and behavior monitoring and to provide patients relevant education, counseling and motivational support.\n\nOne example of an mHealth intervention that has become accepted as beneficial to the management of hypertension is self-measured BP (SMBP) monitoring. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends SMBP monitoring as an adjunct method in the management of hypertension.  183 The AHA recommends SMBP for the evaluation of most patients with known or suspected hypertension to assess response to treatment and possibly to improve adherence.  189 Still, much remains unknown about what other mHealth interventions are effective in improving hypertension care."

      "title": "Review of Evidence for the Efficacy of Mobile Technology-Based Interventions to Promote BP Control",
      "text": "Our review focuses on mHealth intervention effects on SBP specifically, given its association with cardiovascular outcomes. We searched PubMed for the years 2004 to 2014 using the following terms: hypertension; hypertensive; antihypertensive; anti-hypertensive; pre-hypertensive; high blood pressure; elevated blood pressure; increased blood pressure; systolic blood pressure; and diastolic blood pressure. These terms were cross-referenced with the mobile technology terms described previously. This search resulted in 316 identified articles; 191 were excluded because they were not relevant to mobile technologies. The remaining 125 were articles reporting descriptions of technology, pilot data, and surveys on physician or patient opinions; were editorials; or did not focus on BP. Of the 39 remaining, only 13 RCTs were of sufficient quality to be included in this review. These studies were published between 2008 and 2014 and permitted patients some form of electronic platform to assist with self-monitoring or support for hypertension (Table  6 ). We focused on interventions that offered some additional feature beyond simply SMBP monitoring, and we included Internet-based studies because an increasing number of people access the Internet on mobile devices.  26 We divided the review to describe first individual studies organized by the primary form of mHealth used to deliver the intervention and then existing systematic reviews. Here, we provide details on the salient studies and what was learned from the review.\n\nThree RCTs used text messaging as the primary intervention modality.  [192] [193] 3] [194]  The details of these studies are provided in Table  6 . The 3 studies had methodological limitations including poor retention. Two of the studies  193, 194  reported significant differences in BP reduction between the treatment conditions; however, all studies reported results using the completers' analysis approach rather than intention to treat. E-mail was the primary intervention modality for 3 RCTs.  191, 195, 202   hese studies ranged from 4 to 6 months, and all had high retention. The frequency of the e-mail contact was not specified in the Nolan et al  195  study and was frequent in the other studies. Madsen et al 191  augmented the e-mail information exchange with messages sent via a PDA. Cicolini et al  202  and  Nolan et al, 195  using a completers' analysis, reported a significant difference between groups in BP changes, whereas  Madsen et al, 191  using intention-to-treat analysis, did not find a difference in BP between groups but observed that a significantly higher proportion of the intervention group achieved the target BP.\n\nA single study was found that used IVR as the primary intervention modality and was conducted in  Honduras and Mexico. 196  Participants received weekly information on medication adherence and salt intake tailored to their BP through the IVR. There was only a trend for a significant difference in BP reduction from the control group, which may be attributable to only 67% completion of the IVR calls.\n\nTwo RCTs used a Web site as the primary intervention modality.  197, 201 Thiboutot et al 201 enrolled 500 adults from primary care practice offices in central Pennsylvania. The Web-based intervention provided feedback on reported BP and advice; however, only 35% of intervention participants used the Web site at least once monthly.  201 Watson et al enrolled 404 adults with high BP from 6 worksites for a 6-month study that included a Web site that displayed SMBP readings and provided education and custom messages based on BP reports.  197 Adherence to SMBP was low overall, with only 17% of intervention participants reporting SMBP in month 1 and 7% at month 6. Neither of these studies demonstrated significant reductions in BP, and no differences were seen between intervention and control conditions. It was not stated but it is possible that the adherence was so low because participants might not have had the capability to access the Web site via a mobile device.\n\nThree RCTs used a mixture of mHealth modalities to deliver the intervention. Green et al 190 used Web access, including secure e-mail, medical records, a health library, and links to resources, versus a Web plus pharmacist or a control (usual care) condition. Only the Web plus pharmacist group reduced their SBPs significantly better than the other conditions at 12 months. That modality also resulted in increases in secure messaging between patient and provider/pharmacist and more antihypertensive medication classes being added. McKinstry et al 199 compared 6 months of SMBP with access to a Web site with graphical displays of SMBP data and optional automated SMS or e-mails with feedback on their BP control against a control condition. Adherence to uploading BP data was high, but the number of participants opting for SMS or e-mails was not reported. The mean reduction in SBP in the intervention group was significantly higher than in the control group. In addition, there were more outpatient care visits and antihypertensive medications prescribed in the intervention group. Magid et al 198  recruited patients from primary care clinics and randomized them to a control condition or an intervention using the Heart360 Web site ( https://www.heart360.  org/ ) to upload their SMBP, IVR reminders if patients did not enter BP data, and phone calls and e-mails from a pharmacist recommending antihypertensive pharmacotherapy changes. Although Magid et al used some components of mHealth in this intervention, it does not appear that the phone component was based on mobile devices. Adherence to uploading BP data was high, and there were higher rates of e-mails and phone calls with pharmacists in the intervention group. Results revealed a significant mean reduction in SBP in the intervention group at the end of the 6-month study. All 3 of these studies provided some combination of patient educational resources, timely delivery of BP data to providers, and personalized messages to patients. The positive results of the 3 trials may suggest that a combination of such strategies or modes of intervention delivery may be needed to engage patients.\n\nWhether these multimodal technology-based approaches can provide the same or better results than team-based in-person care for a lower cost remains unclear; the data at this time suggest that further investigations are warranted. What is clear from this review of studies targeting improved BP control and other sections that addressed interventions targeting behavior is that mHealth or digital health has no defined taxonomy or classification of interventions delivered by the existing technology.

The current state of science suggests that all options all have an important place in targeting improved cardiovascular health.\n\nIn summary, 8 of the 12 studies detailed in Table  6  were conducted outside the United States, and 2 of those were conducted in Canada, so results may not be generalizable to all healthcare systems. Most but not all studies used self-monitoring of BP and used those data for reporting and receiving feedback. Eight of the studies reported a significant difference between the treatment conditions, but only 3 of the 12 studies used an intentionto-treat approach in analyzing the results. Instead, most studies reported results only in experimental subjects who were compliant with the mHealth technology used. This approach not only inflates the results and compromises randomization but also raises questions about the generalizability to a broad hypertensive population, particularly elderly or disabled patients such as those with stroke who may have difficulty using the technology.\n\nWe identified 2 systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining studies testing mHealth interventions for BP control.  203, 204 Using the same quality assessment tool for systematic reviews and meta-analyses as in the AHA/ACC guideline, both systematic review studies were rated good quality (indicating a study with the least level of bias and results deemed valid). Both reviews focused on a slightly different topic but shared common features. Uhlig et al  203   Uhlig et al 203 reviewed 25 studies that compared SMBP plus support with usual care. Among the 5 quality A studies that compared SMBP plus support with usual care, there was a net reduction in SBP of -2.1 to -8.3 mm Hg. The type of support offered varied greatly across studies, and only 1 study used an mHealth support intervention.  190 Uhlig et al also examined 13 trials comparing SMBP with SMBP plus support and found no evidence to support the benefit of SMBP plus support over SMBP alone. Liu et al 204 examined 13 studies that compared Internet-based counseling interventions on BP control in prehypertensive and hypertensive patients, 11 of which were RCTs. They found that e-counseling interventions significantly reduced daytime SBP by 3.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -5.63 to -2.06). They also found that longer interventions (6-12 months) were associated with greater effects on SBP. Additionally, Liu et al also found trends of greater effects when interventions used multiple behavioral techniques and were proactive with patients (as opposed to reactive or passive). Nolan et al 195  conducted the 1 study to specifically explicate a theoretical framework.\n\nA significant limitation of the current evidence for the use of mHealth for BP control is that the majority of studies (8 of\n\nLiu et al, 204 2013 Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Outcome: SBP \u0394 Setting: no setting restrictions Country: no language restrictions (56% in United States) Prospective comparison studies testing preventive e-counseling or advice using Web sites or e-mails to modify exercise or diet as a means of improving blood pressure control of at least 8-wk duration. 13 studies: N=2221 Mean age: 55 (range, 18-89) y Mean SBP (SD) mm Hg: 136 (6.4) Women: 44% White: NR Retention: 53%-94% E-counseling or advice using Web sites or e-mails to modify exercise or diet as a means of improving BP control Internet, e-mail The Internet-based interventions were primarily self-guided, access was through desktop and mobile devices Mean intervention duration (SD): 5.6 (3.6) mo 8 of the 13 studies were short term (<6 mo), 5 were long term (6-12 mo) Intervention adherence: NR Pooled: Mean SBP \u0394, mm Hg: Int: -3.8 (95% CI, -5.63 to -2.06) Pooled effect size: -0.27 (95% CI, -0.4 to -0.1) Longer interventions vs shorter interventions, effect size on SBP: -0.44 (95% CI, -0.58 to -0.31) vs -0.23 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.10) \u22655 vs <5 behavioral change techniques effect size on SBP: -0.46 (95% CI, -0.60 to -0.33) vs -0.19 (95% CI, -0.33 to -0.06)\n\nAutomated indicates without a clinician who generates, tailors, or modifies the output; baseline, 0; BP, blood pressure; BPM, blood pressure monitoring; CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease; \u0394, change or difference; EMR, electronic medical record; Int, intervention group; ITT, intention to treat; IVR, interactive voice response; LMM, linear mixed model; M, mean; n, subgroups; N, total sample; NA, not applicable; NR, not reported; NS, not significant; P, participant; PCP, primary care physician; PDA, personal digital assistant; RCT, randomized, controlled trial; SBP, systolic blood pressure; SD, standard deviation; SMS, short message service; and VA, Veterans Affairs.   204 suggest that multiple techniques are likely to be more effective than fewer techniques. Other unknowns include whether mHealth intervention components should be proactive or reactive, expert driven (protocol driven, prescriptive messaging) or user driven (collaborative protocol with supportive messaging), and whether some specific behavioral theories are more useful than others to guide intervention components.\n\nThe modalities used to deliver mHealth interventions for BP control included Web-based, e-mail, SMS, and IVR interventions. The best modality may never be known, given the rapid pace of change in information and communication technologies. In addition, the best delivery modality may vary between individuals and within individuals, given their locations and settings. Individual consumer factors such as age, access to the Internet, and learning preferences may determine the successful use of specific tools in a specific individual. Therefore, consumer preference may ultimately determine the most effective method of delivery in an individual patient.\n\nPatient engagement with mHealth for BP control remains limited by the fact that the majority of studies (8 of 12) were conducted for \u22646 months, with no studies extending beyond 12 months. Given that hypertension is a chronic condition that requires long-term medical care, a sustained benefit of mHealth interventions beyond a few months will likely be needed to show meaningful health benefits. In addition, estimates of patient engagement with mHealth interventions over these short periods were not possible because of the heterogeneity of studies reviewed and because the components useful to maintain engagement specifically were not studied.\n\nAside from these current scientific limitations and unknowns of how best to use mHealth interventions to improve BP control, the commercial availability of evidence-based mHealth interventions for patients and providers is scarce. For example, the only commercially available intervention of which we are aware is the Heart360 Web site ( https://www.heart360.org/ ). However, the current use rates of such programs remain unknown, and consumer adherence outside monitored RCTs may be difficult to predict. Adoption of mHealth interventions for BP control in health systems may additionally be hindered by security and patient privacy policies concerning the transmission of identifiable patient data, nonexistent current reimbursement for eHealth interventions, and information technology interface difficulties."

      "text": "Dyslipidemia affects nearly 1 in 5 to 10 Americans.  206 Despite ready access of healthcare providers to evidence-based cholesterol management goals and potent, well-tolerated medical therapy, management of hyperlipidemia remains suboptimal.  207 A large body of evidence accumulated over the last 2 decades supports the link between dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis  [208] [209] [210]  and the clinical benefits of statin therapy in the treatment of lipoprotein abnormalities. This evidence provides the basis for a number of consensus-based guidelines  19, [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] [216] [217]  for optimizing lipid levels in adult and pediatric populations. However, despite the wide dissemination of these guidelines, hyperlipidemia remains prevalent and suboptimally treated in the United States.  218 here are several reported potential barriers to the implementation of these evidence-based treatment guidelines in clinical practice, including provider and patient knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; provider-patient communication issues; and system-based issues such as costs and the lack of organized systems of care around the recognition and treatment of hyperlipidemia.  219, 220 Thus, a multimodal approach affecting providers, patients, provider-patient communication, and care delivery systems is likely needed to translate these guidelines into clinical practice and to maximize the use of mHealth technology."

The new app would be part of a broader education effort in support of the Million Hearts initiative, 221 a public-private effort of the US Department of Health and Human Services that targets the prevention of a million heart attacks and strokes through clinical and community prevention programs.  222 In response to this challenge, the Marshfield Clinic developed the HeartHealth Mobile app, which allows users to obtain a health risk assessment based on several individual health factors such as blood cholesterol and BP values.\n\nCurrently, the majority of tools available for information delivery, education, motivation, and self-monitoring in dyslipidemia are contained within more comprehensive materials targeting overall CVD risk reduction.  202, [222] [223] 3] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] [231]  Some of these materials provide the basis for the development of CVD risk scores and Web-based score calculators that are available for patients and providers. For example, the Framingham Risk Score was developed from predictive equations based on >5000 men and women who were 30 to 74 years old at baseline and were followed up for cardiovascular events for 12 years.  232 his score is sex specific and incorporates information on age, BP, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and smoking as predictors of CHD.  233 ecently a task force of the ACC and the AHA published a set of guidelines aimed at reducing CVD risk.  234 The purpose of the guidelines was to define provider practices that meet the needs of patients; however, these guidelines were not meant as a replacement for clinical judgment. Although the guidelines had a relatively limited scope and focused on selected critical questions, they were based on the highest-quality evidence available. The guidelines were derived from evidence accumulated from RCTs, meta-analyses, and observational studies that were evaluated for quality and were derived from pooled cohort equations. CVD was defined as coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal or nonfatal stroke. A CVD 10-year and lifetime risk calculator was devised that is sex specific and incorporates information on age, race, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, SBP, treatment for high BP, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. The risk estimates are based on data from multiple community-based populations and are applicable to black and non-Hispanic white men and women 40 to 79 years of age. In addition, estimates of lifetime risk for CVD are provided for adults 20 to 59 years of age and are expressed as the lifetime risk for CVD for a 50-year-old individual without CVD who has the risk factor values entered into the spreadsheet. A downloadable spreadsheet and Web-based risk calculator are available on the AHA Web site ( http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/  HeartAttack/HeartAttackToolsResources/Heart-Attack-Risk- Assessment_UCM_303944_Article.jsp ).  235 Because the primary use of these lifetime risk estimates is to facilitate the discussion of risk reduction through lifestyle changes, it is felt that the imprecision introduced is small enough to justify proceeding with lifestyle change counseling informed by these results. The guidelines were derived from evidence accumulated from RCTs, meta-analyses, and observational studies that were evaluated for quality. 235"

We reviewed 24 articles in detail reporting on the use of mobile technology to manage dyslipidemia as one of the goals. The majority of studies evaluated usability, feasibility, efficacy, and adherence to cholesterol improvement programs using technology-based tools or strategies such as e-mail, text messaging, and Web sites. Of note, several studies aimed at reducing diabetes mellitus or hypertension complications also included lipids as a secondary outcome.  164, 202, 228, [236] [237] 7] [238] [239]  Of these, only 3 studies were of sufficient quality to include here. Because of the limited number of studies using mHealth as part of the intervention to target improved lipids, we included studies reporting lipid as a secondary outcome in Table  7 . The study by Yoo et al  164  is also reported in the sections on diabetes mellitus. Some of the existing publications were focused on design, rationale, and testing accuracy of tools with no lipid outcomes available at this time.  223, [240] [241] 1] [242]  Others were focused on small studies with inconclusive results  226, 236, 243  or were pilot feasibility studies that did not provide adequate results.  228, 230 Only 1 peerreviewed publication 244 addressed the topic of consumer use of technology as stand-alone tools specifically for lipid disorders (Table  7 ). The vast majority of publications did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the tables because of the absence of a control group or because they did not include lipids as a primary outcome. However, there were a number of promising studies in this group of articles. In a quasi-experimental study,  Park and Kim 231  showed that the use of a Web site and SMS improved total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. Oncescu et al 242 described a device that works with a smartphone camera to measure cholesterol. This device, if accurate and easy to use, might hold promise as a technology to allow self-monitoring of serum cholesterol; this should be evaluated in future research. Studies reported in design articles by Chow et al 240 and Redfern et al  245  show promise in the future management of dyslipidemia. RCTs testing interventions that specifically target lipid reduction are needed because there are no existing studies in this area. One study that used electronically monitored medication blisters and a reminder system reported that total cholesterol improved, but the study ended early.  237 Supplying patients with smartphones with Bluetooth-enabled BP monitors, glucometers, and a Web site for tracking resulted in decreases in total cholesterol; however, these studies did not include a control group.  228, 230 esearch has shown that education of consumers and self-management interventions can be beneficial for patients. Advances in information technology and consumer health-related mHealth are emerging as promising tools for September 22, 2015 facilitating the management of dyslipidemia, for example, home lipid testing with a smartphone, educational smartphone apps, and Web portals for patients and providers. Although there is evidence suggesting some benefit to their use, the amount of evidence-based literature in this area remains surprisingly low."

The majority were RCTs. For completeness, we also included systematic reviews and meta-analyses in each topic\n\nYoo et al, 164 2009 Design: 2-group RCT Outcome: HbA 1c (%) Setting: Community Country: South Korea N=123 Int1: n=62 Int2: n=61 Mean age (SD): Int1: 57.0 (9.1) y Int2: 59.4 (8.4) y Women: 47.2% Mean BMI (SD): 25.6 kg/m 2 Mean total cholesterol (SD): 4.6 mmol/L Retention: Int1: 91% Int2: 89% Int1: UCDC system using mobile phones and Web-based interaction.

The geographic distribution was quite variable; weight loss studies were conducted in the United States, whereas studies focused on dyslipidemia were conducted outside the United States. Several studies focused on smoking cessation were conducted in Europe. Seven of the 15 RCTs in diabetes mellitus were done in South Korea, and 2 were conducted in Europe. Thus, our evidence base also has limitations related to general representation, resulting in limited knowledge on the effectiveness of augmenting traditional patient care with the use of mHealth-supported strategies in male, minority, or underserved populations and for specific risk behaviors (smoking) or conditions (diabetes mellitus) among US populations. Other limitations identified across the studies are the continued reliance on Internet-based or SMS interventions and the somewhat limited use of advances in mHealth strategies; however, this may be attributable to delays in publication. From a methodological perspective, several studies did not use intention to treat in their primary analysis and thus biased the results of their studies. Use of completer's analyses was most evident in the studies focused on physical activity, BP, and dyslipidemia. Finally, several studies in the areas outside weight loss used relatively brief interventions.\n\nWe conducted a search of the Google (Android) and iTunes (Apple) App Stores for the terms used in this article: weight loss, physical activity/exercise, smoking, diabetes, hypertension/BP, and cholesterol (Table  8 ). Because medication may be a component of the treatment, we also searched for medication adherence. There was a wide range in the number of apps available. Weight loss led the groups with nearly 4000 apps for the iOS and 250 for the Android operating systems. A search for physical activity yielded 72 apps, whereas exercise yielded 6312 apps for the iOS operating system and only 120 for both terms for the Android operating system. Cholesterol yielded the lowest numbers of apps for both operating systems. This wide array of apps included information delivery, education, motivation, self-monitoring, lifestyle, drug therapies, reminders or alerts, and alternative therapies. However, although the number of apps continues to grow at an exponential rate, none have been critically evaluated, and their development was not evidence based, often not building on the theoretical frameworks that address behavior change.  31, 32, 124, [246] [247] 7] [248]  Besides lacking efficacy data, there is almost an absence of data on sustainability of engagement by the individual and thus sustainability of the treatment effect, an issue that is extremely important in managing chronic conditions such as hypertension. The absence of an empirical base for these apps is a major deficit in this potential area of prevention of CVD. Two recent articles addressed these issues and called for more informed use of the health-related apps and more rigorous approaches to developing and evaluating those that affect medical management (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).  249, 250 hese limitations beg for some innovative changes in intervention studies using mHealth. First, a more rigorous approach to the analytic methods used is needed. Second, more diverse samples from an ethnic, socioeconomic, and sex perspective should be included. Third, longer-term studies are needed that inform about the sustainability of effects of using mHealth approaches and the numerous apps to augment intervention and to assess the long-term engagement by the user. Finally, we need to use more adaptive and diverse methods in the testing of the rapidly changing mHealth devices and strategies and use approaches that can optimize the intervention designs and provision of efficacy data in a period shorter than the conventional 5-year RCT.  [251] [252] 2] [253]  Identifying the most effective features in a shorter time frame also will reduce costs and ensure the incorporation of the most effective components early in the development phase."

Compared with pharmacological treatments for acute events and with secondary prevention, reductions in the prevalence of CVD risk factors have resulted in greater reductions in CVD-related mortality.  254 However, the amount of information that must be conveyed and the support that is necessary to counsel and motivate individuals to engage in behaviors to prevent CVD are far beyond what can be accomplished in the context of face-to-face clinical consultations or through traditional channels such as patient education leaflets. 255 mHealth or mobile technologies have the potential to overcome these limitations and to transform the delivery of health-related messages and ongoing interventions targeting behavior change. Moreover, the use of monitoring devices (eg, Bluetooth-enabled BP monitors and blood glucose monitors) permits the sharing of important patient self-management parameters with healthcare providers in real time and the delivery of feedback and guidance to patients when they need it. Furthermore, using mHealth tools for monitoring provides the clinician data that far exceed what can be measured in the brief clinical encounter and reflect the status of physiological or behavioral measures in the person's natural setting.\n\nTable 8.

      "text": "The development of drug and device therapies typically follows a standard path: Molecules that show promise in preclinical laboratory and animal testing are then evaluated in phase 1 human studies that provide an initial assessment of the safety of the agent. Those that survive phase 1 evaluation go on to larger phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in which the impact of the therapy is evaluated in progressively larger populations.\n\nOnly those that are found to be clearly efficacious and safe in these rigorous evaluations are then eligible for regulatory approval and release to the general population. Even once on market, drugs and devices often undergo further monitoring to ensure that the findings seen in controlled trials are consistent with those seen in broader, more diverse patient populations and community settings.\n\nIn contrast, mHealth applications are often developed in the course of weeks to months as opposed to years for drugs. Once developed, mHealth applications have traditionally not been regulated by governmental agencies. Thus, these health apps may be offered to the public with limited to no information on the accuracy of their content; on whether they are based on proven learning theory or behavioral interventional strategies; or on whether they have undergone formal effectiveness and safety evaluation. While one may suggest that mHealth technologies do not require such careful scrutiny, there are arguments for such investigation. First, just like drugs or medical devices, these mobile technologies and applications have the potential to improve health, to be ineffective, or even to cause unanticipated harm. Second, without rigorous evidence to support them, it becomes difficult or impossible for care guidelines to recommend them or for clinicians to promote them. Third, the market is rapidly being flooded with these applications. Without evidence supporting the comparative usefulness of these apps, it is nearly impossible for the consumer (or clinician) to decide which to use. Finally, if a consumer who is motivated to modify his or her lifestyle selects an unhelpful product because of a lack of information, there is a true lost opportunity and a missed chance to improve health.\n\nSpecific sections above reviewed current mobile applications and technologies for treating obesity; encouraging regular physical activity, smoking cessation, control of hypertension, and dyslipidemia; and treating diabetes mellitus. Our literature searches uncovered a wide variety of products that have been developed. However, the reviews also identified the paucity of published empirical evaluation of their effectiveness. To date, many devices have no published evaluation, and those that have undergone evaluation are often limited to measuring customer satisfaction and user sustained engagement. Although such intermediate measures are important, they fall far short of actually determining whether the users of these products had clinically meaningful changes in biological parameters.\n\nSeveral common themes were noted among each reviewed area. There were consistent concerns voiced about the designs of evaluative studies of mobile technologies. Studies often used a pre-post design without concurrent control groups or, better yet, randomized comparison groups. Without such controls, product effectiveness is likely to be overestimated.\n\nSimilarly, many studies relied on self-report, which again leads to overestimation of effectiveness in unblinded evaluations. Additionally, many trials elected not to use an intentionto-treat perspective, which again may inflate the benefits of the intervention among those who used and stuck with the product.\n\nTo date, mobile technologies have generally been evaluated in motivated individuals and selected settings. These idealized conditions also will lead to exaggerations of the typical effectiveness that might be seen had the product been evaluated in general community practice or among diverse or underserved populations. Most studies were also of short duration, resulting in lingering questions about the sustainability or \"stickiness\" of the products. In particular, the fields of obesity and physical activity interventions are littered with interventions that work over the short term but fail to support durable lifestyle change. Perhaps most challenging, studies to date have almost uniformly evaluated a single technology compared with standard care, and there have been almost no head-to-head studies comparing various technologies with each another.\n\nBeyond consistent questions about product safety and effectiveness, our review of the field found almost no studies that analyzed how products worked or user input in its development. Specifically, formative work had not defined which components in an intervention are pivotal to success or whether the impact of the product varies depending on the mode of use or delivery. Without these data, it is difficult to anticipate whether a similar but slightly different mobile technology would also be likely to be effective. Finally, these reviews pointed out the need for more implementation studies evaluating how to best incorporate these technologies (once proven) into a broader collaborative model of care.\n\nUntil such information is available, mobile app developers will continue to face questions and doubts from the public, providers, and payers. As with any other product that claims to improve health, groups will want answers to certain questions: Does the product work best when used in certain settings or among specific patient groups? Does the app duplicate or potentiate impact when it is combined with other traditional interventions (such as in-person counseling)? If a specific mobile technology is found to be effective, in what cases can these findings be generalized among similar technologies in the class? Are the effects seen durable, or does the impact of the intervention wane over time? Finally, are there any unintended consequences associated with the device and program in which it is used?\n\nProducing this evidence must be a shared responsibility. In the future, manufacturers will likely come under increasing pressure from regulatory agencies to produce evidence of effectiveness before marketing. Insurers are also likely to demand proof of durable effectiveness before they are willing to cover these services. However, the responsibility for generating evidence should not fall solely on the product developers. The research and clinical communities also must help to generate these needed data. Our review of the evidence to date, even with its flaws and limitations, clearly demonstrates the great potential that mobile technologies can have to aid in lifestyle modification. Thus, clinicians should not conclude Disclosures that mobile technologies are generally unproven and thus can be ignored. The current absence of evidence should not be used as evidence of an absence of effectiveness. Instead, we need to embrace the challenge of producing this needed evidence on how effective these new technologies are and how we can best adopt them in our practice to promote better patient health."

Female subjects made up the majority of many samples; however, 1 study conducted in a Veterans Affairs setting had 93% male representation. The smoking cessation studies enrolled younger individuals, usually 18 to 45 years of age, compared with most other studies, which included participants up to 70 to 75 years of age."
