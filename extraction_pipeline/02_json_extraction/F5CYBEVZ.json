  "title": "Acceptability and Feasibility of Text Message Interface to Assess Parents' Real-time PICU Experiences",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Parents of children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) experience substantial stress; a parent's perception of their child's illness severity, more than objective measures, predicts psychological outcomes. No tools exist to assess parents' real-time experiences. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a text-based tool to measure parental experience. Methods: Inclusion criteria included PICU stay >48 h, physician approval, smartphone access, and English-speaking caregiver. Eligible parents received a text-based baseline survey and surveys every other day while hospitalized regarding their mood/experiences and optional open-ended questions regarding stressors. They received post-discharge follow-up surveys at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months. Follow-up surveys assessed mood and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Interviews and surveys about the interface were conducted 1 week and 3 months following discharge. Feasibility was assessed by descriptive statistics (eg, response rates), and acceptability was assessed by descriptive statistics (survey results) and thematic analyses of interviews. Results: Of 20 enrolled participants, the first 5 were excluded due to technical issues. Of the 15 included, results demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. Most participants (86%) completed all surveys during the PICU stay and continued to complete surveys at a high rate: 79%-94% 3 months post-discharge. All participants agreed that the system was easy to use and were satisfied with the system at discharge, and 91% remained satisfied 3 months post-discharge. Additionally, 76% reported comfort, and 69% reported benefit. From the interviews, participants lauded the system's convenience and applicability of content. Some proposed changes to improve ergonomics. Many suggested this interface could help teams better support families. Conclusions: A text-based interface for measuring experience in the PICU is feasible and acceptable to parents. Further research can explore how this could identify parents most at risk of adverse psychological sequelae and lead to earlier supportive interventions.",

      "text": "Children and families treated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) are exposed to stressful experiences.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4]  For many parents, these experiences endure past their child's hospitalization and result in substantial psychological morbidity. Multiple studies suggest that a parent's perception of their child's illness, more than illness severity, impacts psychological outcomes.  [5] [6] ] [7] [8]  Currently, there are no tools to assess parents' subjective experiences and perceptions in, or near, real time. Such a tool could improve our ability to identify and respond to distress, better supporting parents through the challenges of having a critically ill child. This pilot study explores whether a text messaging platform is a feasible and acceptable way to understand the development of distress and psychological morbidity among parents of PICU patients.\n\nThe distress impacting parents of PICU patients is substantial and enduring. In a review by Nelson and Gold, up to 21% of parents with critically ill children met diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 84% reported symptoms of PTSD after discharge.  9 However, not every parent who undergoes acute stress during their child's hospitalization has lasting psychological sequelae.  10 Multiple studies suggest that one's post-traumatic trajectory is highly influenced by an individual's subjective appraisal of real-time events.  6, 10, 11 he PICU environment makes it difficult to assess a parent's experience and their likelihood of long-term sequelae. Mental health resources are finite, and providers often rely on severity of illness to allocate these resources.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  However, illness severity is less predictive than a parent's experiences: fear that one's child might die is more predictive of PTSD than the child's severity of illness.  6, 7, 10, 11, 15 Moreover, individuals manifest distress differently. Less conspicuous distress may be masked by the high medical and psychosocial acuity in the PICU. Further, parents are heavily taxed while attending to their critically ill child and may not have the bandwidth to participate in interviews or other research procedures. Perhaps for this reason, few studies exist which ask parents to complete surveys during their child's PICU stay, and we did not encounter any studies which asked parents to complete surveys on a repeated measures basis while their child was in the PICU. Even in the acute care setting, recruiting parents for research while one's child is hospitalized presents a challenge for researchers.  16 In a study of parents' post-traumatic stress symptom trajectories performed in Australia, out of 311 eligible families who were approached, parents from 122 families completed at least 3 of the 4 surveys (39.2%), and only 1 of these time points was during the child's inpatient stay.  17 Surveys were presented in paper-either in person or by mail-and participants included parents of patients in acute care and in the PICU. It stands to reason that recruitment and retention of participants could be more challenging in a higher acuity setting such as the PICU and especially difficult when multiple surveys are performed at multiple time points across a PICU stay.\n\nText messaging is becoming a convenient and accepted way to communicate with patients and families during and after healthcare encounters.  [18] [19] 9] [20] [21] [22]  It is convenient and may bypass some limitations of retrospective methods, such as recall bias. Research from other settings supports its potential convenience to parents  [23] [24] [25]  and its potential to help parents feel more supported by their child's medical teams.  26 However, parents' experiences in the PICU differ meaningfully from those of parents in the community. Parents of PICU patients consistently report substantial psychosocial stressors while their child is hospitalized.  7, 8, [27] [28] 8] [29] [30]  And while research can present opportunities, parents also report that it can present burdens by asking potential participants for their time amid this already busy and chaotic experience.  31 Moreover, the burdens are likely not equally distributed across a population. Families from minoritized populations and/or of low incomes are disproportionately burdened and therefore often consent for research at lower rates.  32 For these reasons, it is important to determine the feasibility and acceptability of this data collection method specifically within the PICU environment.\n\nAt present, there are no tools to assess parents' subjective experiences and perceptions in, or near, real time. As stated, such a tool would allow providers to identify parents with high levels of distress and respond earlier in its course. This pilot study seeks to ascertain the feasibility (defined by response rates) and acceptability (by parental survey responses and interviews) of a text message-based interface to measure the realtime experiences of PICU patients' parents. If feasible and acceptable, this may allow for earlier identification of parental stress and perhaps of those most at risk of further psychological sequelae. This could, in turn, allow for earlier allocation of resources to those most in need to reduce psychological morbidity in those most at risk."

They received the initial enrollment survey on a personal device, which they completed with the study team present to answer questions. Text messages were sent via the Qualtrics 33 interface and included links to surveys and mental health resources, as well as a statement that responses were not reviewed during study. Surveys were administered during and post-hospitalization according to the contents and timeline described under \"Survey Contents\" below.\n\nParticipants received a text message 1 week post-discharge with a link to a survey to complete and were called to schedule a virtual interview regarding the acceptability of study procedures. An additional survey and interview were performed at 3 months to glean participants' perspectives with an emphasis on the post-discharge portions.\n\nParticipants received $25 after the completion of the 1-week interview and survey and an additional $50 after survey and interview completion at 3 months post-discharge."

Feasibility was assessed by assessing survey completion rates among participants, with feasibility defined as a response rate of >70%, which was deemed to be a high goal based on other comparable pilot studies.  19, 34 ther feasibility measures included the completion percentage of surveys once started and times to complete surveys.\n\nAcceptability. Acceptability of the interface was assessed via a mixed methods approach, with all participants invited to complete an acceptability survey and a semi-structured interview at 1 week and 3 months post-discharge. Acceptability was defined as >70% of respondents endorsing their support of the tool by survey questions and <30% of respondents endorsing the negative items, for example, that the survey was overly intrusive or burdensome. Qualitative themes were analyzed in order to support or refute the acceptability of the tool.\n\nThe Likert scale items were adapted from the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ), developed by Parmanto and colleagues to assess reliability, validity, acceptability, and practicality of their SMS interface.  35 This interface has previously been used for a telehealth intervention evaluating mood-related symptoms after traumatic brain injury by Dr Juengst and colleagues.  36 For the present study, the general domains of usefulness, ease of use, interface quality, interaction quality, reliability, and satisfaction from the TUQ were utilized; however, the specific questions were modified to the particulars of this specific interface and the specific challenges of the PICU environment. Acceptability survey questions are provided in Table  1 . Semi-structured interviews followed an interview guide devised by experts in psychology, critical care, complex care, and online assessment technologies (see Table  2 ). Participants completed the survey via Qualtrics, 33 then were interviewed to follow up on survey answers and provide more information about their experiences. Interviews were performed via Microsoft Teams, 37 then professionally transcribed with identifiers removed."

These surveys were intended to lay the groundwork for subsequent study of this texting interface; they were not, however, intended to be analyzed in this pilot based on a small sample size.\n\nSurveys were selected by the study team, consisting of multiple critical care physicians and psychologists with expertise in both clinical care and research. The surveys were selected to include measures that have known associations with depression, anxiety, and PTSD after PICU stay (mental health, physical health, emotional support, and resilience) 7,37,38 and a novel measure to assess participants' real-time emotional experiences. The latter is based on the established association between parents' subjective experiences and their risk of experiencing PTSD after medical events.  7, 10, 11 seline Survey. The baseline survey was administered to participants at the time of consent. This survey consisted of the following tools: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Mental Health-2,  38  PROMIS Global Physical Health-2,  38  PROMIS Emotional Support 4a, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2-item version (CD-RISC2).  39 To assure participant confidentiality, neither demographic nor illness-related data were collected on participants nor children. These datapoints were nonessential to the goals of determining feasibility and acceptability of the tool. LOS data was determined from the time of enrollment and collected via participants' self-report via every-other-day surveys.\n\nDaily Diary Assessments. This survey was issued every other day while hospitalized and for 1 week post-discharge and consisted of mood assessments, an assessment of the child's status, and the opportunity to provide additional information on their experiences and stressors via free text. Mood assessments asked participants to identify with 20 adjectives (10 positive and 10 negative) on a 0-10 scale. With respect to the assessment of a child's status, participants reported their child's disposition (hospital vs discharged). In our sample, discharged patients only went home (vs transfer to another healthcare facility, such as acute rehab or skilled nursing facilities). This allowed participants to be moved into the \"post-discharge\" cohort without collecting identifying information or accessing medical records.\n\nOutcome Surveys. These surveys, administered at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge, consisted of the following tools: mood assessments, CD-RISC2, PROMIS Depression Short Form 4a, PROMIS Anxiety Short Form 4a, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM5 (PCL-5).  40 These outcomes were chosen as they are mental health outcomes which are known to be associated with one's loved one's serious or critical illness."

As this pilot study was designed with a small sample explicitly to assess feasibility and acceptability, we only analyzed data relevant to the feasibility/acceptability of the interface. Therefore, the content of the mood assessments and outcome surveys was not analyzed.\n\nResponses to the optional open-ended qualitative question were analyzed using modified Delphi coding  41  by constructing themes in a structured, iterative manner. A total of 5 study team members independently reviewed all responses to each question and generated preliminary themes. Themes were discussed and finalized. Each response was then independently coded for the presence or absence of each theme using Microsoft Excel.  42 odes were compiled and compared across study team members. Items without satisfactory agreement (ie, 80%) were collectively discussed to consensus.\n\nTo analyze responses to the qualitative interview questions, transcripts were coded using reflexive thematic analysis.  43 An inductive approach was used given the exploratory nature of the study; 3 investigators reviewed all transcripts to independently generate initial codes until the final codebook was 14.

Next, codes were collated and reviewed by 2 investigators to independently identify latent themes (ie, underlying ideas, assumptions, and conceptualizations). Themes were discussed with the third investigator present to resolve disagreements. The first round of interviews was coded using this approach, and then, the codebook from the first round was applied to the second round of interviews. Evaluation of data saturation to determine sample size and quantification of themes are inconsistent with reflexive thematic analysis and therefore were not utilized for this portion of the data."

      "text": "Likert Scale Survey. Table  1  presents data from Likert scales both during hospitalization and post-discharge. Most participants agreed that the text system was easy to use (100%), the instructions were clear and easy to follow (100%), they were satisfied with the texting system (96%), and it is a useful way to assess experiences during and after hospitalization (75%). Most participants disagreed that they experienced technical problems (92%), it interfered with their daily life (96%), they received text messages too often or at an inconvenient time of day (83%), or it took too much time to complete each survey (75%). Most participants disagreed (54%), or neither agreed nor disagreed (38%) that it was distressing to use the texting system, while 2 participants did find the system distressing. Many participants found the system comforting (77%) and beneficial (69%) during hospitalization, as compared to 45% for each post-discharge. See Table  1  for full data.\n\nQualitative Interviews. In total, 80% of eligible participants (n = 12) completed the first qualitative interview 1 week after discharge; 60% of eligible participants (n = 8) completed the second qualitative interview 3 months post-discharge. Given that themes were largely consistent across the 2 interviews and almost all (88%) of the participants who completed interview 2 also completed interview 1, results from interview 1 are presented below.\n\nPositives of Texting System. Many participants highlighted positive aspects of the texting system regarding convenience, applicable questions, reminders, and other positives.\n\nAll participants described that the texting system was convenient: easy to use and simple, quick to complete, and flexible such that it could be completed at any time, and they enjoyed the texting modality. About half of the participants noted that they felt the questions were applicable and relevant to their experiences: \"the questions were straightforward and applicable\u2026and I did have many emotions at 1 time. So yeah. It was spot on\" and \"I think [the questions] captured [my experience] well.\" A couple of participants noted that they appreciated the reminders provided. Several participants provided other relevant answers regarding positives of the system that were coded as other positives, such as the survey prompted reflection and/or was therapeutic.\n\nAreas for Improvement. Participants also responded to questions regarding areas for improvement in the texting system with the following themes emerging: no improvement, improving features, adding features, and improving content.\n\nAlmost all participants reported that they would not change anything (no improvement). Few respondents had suggestions to improve features: separating the links spatially, improving the slider, improving reminders, and changing the schedule of messages. A few participants suggested improving content to reduce redundancy and improve the relevance of questions to family circumstances. A few participants described adding features, such as providing support services based on responses.\n\nWhile 2 participants did endorse finding the system distressing in the post-discharge survey, no additional information was provided during the interview to clarify these responses.\n\nOther Factors to Assess. Participants suggested other factors for investigators to assess to understand their experiences, divided into medical and non-medical factors. Medical factors suggested included child medical factors (eg, severity of illness and medical history) and experiences with the medical team (eg, communication): \"what the kid is in the hospital for and the background history of what they've gone through\" and \"if they felt heard by the care team.\" Some participants suggested that the survey assess non-medical factors such as the logistical experience of being in the hospital (eg, transportation and finances): \"maybe the accommodations and how that is going\u2026are you able to groom yourself? Are you able to stay at the McDonald's house?\" Barriers to Completion. Most participants described that there were no barriers to completing surveys. Some participants stated responsibilities for their child or work occasionally interfered with participation: \"Life continued to happen. Between work, school, and taking care of that or like my special needs kids or my other kids.\"\n\nConsiderations Regarding Sharing Information with Providers. While they were informed that responses during the pilot were not reviewed or shared with their child's care team, participants described potential benefits and concerns if information from the texting system was shared with providers in future iterations.\n\nBenefits. Some participants felt information sharing would offer providers with emotional context regarding how parents are feeling emotionally in order to tailor their care for this family based on that information.\n\nConcerns. Most participants described having no concerns about sharing information with providers. Some participants worried that sharing this information with providers would change care they received including changes in interactions and care for the child and family and/or the provider's response would be inappropriate for the parent's needs.\n\nFeasibility and Acceptability of Open-Ended Qualitative Question. Completion Rate. Overall, participants (n = 14) provided responses to 20% of optional open-ended question prompts. A total of 6 participants (43%) used this option at least once. Of those who used it at least once, most (83%) used this option more than once.\n\nInterview Qualitative Data. Participants described positives of the open-ended question including that it was therapeutic and allowed for elaboration about their experience, and they appreciated that it was optional: \"Easy and reflective. It helps to reflect.\"\n\nOthers noted that they did not respond to the survey due to lack of time, preferring other question types and feeling they had nothing to report."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study demonstrated that use of a text messaging interface to assess parent's experiences throughout their PICU stay and following discharge was feasible and acceptable to participants.\n\nRegarding feasibility, once early technical problems were resolved, most participants completed all requested surveys during PICU stay and continued to do so for 3 months following discharge. Virtually, all surveys were completed once started, and completion time was modest, with a mean of 92 s for the every-other-day surveys, once extreme outliers were removed. These outliers were believed to be participants who left their phone unattended during survey completion. Participants voluntarily provided answers to optional openended questions, with 43% of participants electing to use this option in at least 1 instance. Taken together, these data support the feasibility of using a text-based interface to engage families in near-real time, even amid the often chaotic and overwhelming circumstances of a PICU stay. Such a tool therefore could shed light on parents' lived experiences with their critically ill child and potentially lead to more rapid, responsive interventions. Moreover, these data suggest that families are willing to provide additional contextual information beyond simply answering closed-ended questions.\n\nThe use of a near-real-time text-based tool is further supported by acceptability data via surveys and interviews. All participants agreed or strongly agreed that the system was easy to use both during and after PICU stay and that they were satisfied with the system at discharge, with the majority remaining satisfied at month 3 (91%). While the goal of the interface was not to provide a therapeutic intervention, many participants reported benefit: 76% reported the interface to be comforting while their child was hospitalized and 69% that they benefitted from using the system. Both percentages dropped to 45% of participants for the post-discharge texting interface. No participants reported that surveys were too long or that they interfered with their lives during the PICU stay; only 1 participant reported receiving messages at an inconvenient time of day.\n\nAcceptability was further supported by qualitative interviews. Participants appreciated the convenience of the system, the applicability of the questions, and the reminder texts to be helpful. Most participants had no suggestions for the improvement of the system; however, some participants provided constructive feedback. This feedback suggested improvements to both the features/appearance of the system and content. Participants also recommended assessment of other contextual factors, both medical (a child's illness, communication) and non-medical (transportation, financial stress). Logistically, most participants described no barriers to completion but acknowledged that life circumstances occasionally delayed their completion of surveys.\n\nParticipants suggested ideas for supporting families. Multiple participants suggested providing support to families based on their responses. Some participants felt that relaying information to medical providers could help providers tailor care to a family based on their experiences. Some noted that such an interface could augment medical communication by providing a venue to ask non-emergent questions. Most participants would feel comfortable sharing their information with medical providers; however, some worried that sharing information might change their child's care in unfavorable ways.\n\nWhile feedback was overwhelmingly positive, there are important limitations to both the text-based interface and this pilot study. With respect to the interface, the technical issues at initial roll-out warrant consideration for subsequent iterations. In this case, it was fixed by partnering with the local network operators and the survey company. However, this is an important reminder that the technical aspects of such an interface should be thoroughly tested prior to initiation of a study or clinical program such as this, as each hospital will have its own particulars with respect to cellular and wireless internet access. Additionally, 2 participants reported their experiences with the surveys at least somewhat distressing. The follow-up interview was unable to elicit additional details. While this was a minority opinion, further investigation is warranted to understand and mitigate this distress. As this was a feasibility and acceptability study, it had a deliberately small sample size. It should be noted that the acceptability data collected-both via survey questions and interviews-addressed 2 separate but interrelated elements: the acceptability of the interface itself and the acceptability of querying PICU parental experience on a frequent basis more generally. In the case of this study, participants found both elements to be acceptable. However, it is possible that 1 or both elements might not generalize to other settings or different interfaces. Further study in other settings, and with other interfaces, will help to further delineate the most optimal means of data collection regarding parental PICU experiences.\n\nThough qualitative and quantitative data support the notion that this interface was feasible and acceptable, the sample is far too small to make conclusions with respect to participants' experiences and adverse psychological outcomes. Furthermore, this sample is all drawn from a single PICU, with its own distinct characteristics and demographics. While the interface was feasible and acceptable among this group, that may not generalize to participants from other PICUs. Moreover, we did not collect demographic or clinical information for the purpose of this pilot. Based on this, and our small sample size, we cannot ascertain if there are specific groups for whom this interface and approach are more or less feasible and acceptable-only that, on the whole, it was both feasible and acceptable for this sample. Further, participants in this pilot were all English speakers with their own devices. In the future, efforts should include a diverse group, including non-English speakers and those without cellphones, as these populations likely have unique perspectives and stressors. Subsequent study should capture specific demographic and clinical information to allow for more robust analysis. Given the small sample size, only descriptive statistics were performed. A larger sample would allow for further analysis, including regression modeling, which could elucidate variables which are positively or negatively associated with feasibility, and eventually, to determine associations with parental mental health outcomes. Lastly, as this study was voluntary, it does not capture the experiences of parents who declined to participate. It is possible parents with the highest levels of distress could be over-or under-represented in the study group, which could impact the ability to identify families most at risk."

      "text": "A text-based interface could be a valuable tool in the armamentarium of researchers and clinicians alike to learn about parents' experiences with their child's illness while in the PICU and beyond. With feasibility and acceptability established, further research can explore how such an interface may be used for early identification of parents most at risk of adverse psychological sequelae and ultimately for the provision of earlier supportive interventions. Likewise, an interface such as this could be used to assess changes in variables of interest before and after interventions or other PICU events to understand experiences in a more dynamic fashion."
