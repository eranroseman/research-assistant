      "text": "We included 14 trials with 25,633 randomised participants. Participants were recruited from community-based primary and tertiary care or outpatient clinics. The interventions varied widely from those delivered solely through short messaging service (SMS) to those involving a combination of modes of delivery, such as SMS in addition to healthcare worker training, face-to-face counselling, electronic pillboxes, written materials, and home blood pressure monitors. Some interventions only targeted medication adherence, while others additionally targeted lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Due to heterogeneity in the nature and delivery of the interventions and study populations, we reported most results narratively, with the exception of two trials which were similar enough to meaningfully pool in metaanalyses.\n\nThe body of evidence for the effect of mobile phone-based interventions on objective outcomes of adherence (BP and cholesterol) was of low certainty, due to most trials being at high risk of bias, and inconsistency in outcome effects. Two trials were at low risk of bias.\n\nAmong five trials (total study enrolment: 5441 participants) recording low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), two studies found evidence for a small beneficial intervention effect on reducing LDL-C (-5.30 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.30 to -2.30; and -9.20 mg/dL, 95% CI -17.70 to -0.70). The other three studies found results varying from a small reduction (-7.7 mg/dL) to a small increase in LDL-C (0.77 mg/dL). All of which had wide confidence intervals that included no effect.\n\nAcross 13 studies (25,166 participants) measuring systolic blood pressure, effect estimates ranged from a large reduction (MD -12.45 mmHg, 95% CI -15.02 to -9.88) to a small increase (MD 2.80 mmHg, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.30). We found a similar range of effect estimates for diastolic BP, ranging from -12.23 mmHg (95% CI -14.03 to -10.43) to 1.64 mmHg (95% CI -0.55 to 3.83)  (11 trials, 19,716 participants) . Four trials showed intervention benefits for systolic and diastolic BP with confidence intervals excluding no effect, and among these were all three of the trials evaluating self-monitoring of blood pressure with mobile phone-based telemedicine. The fourth trial included SMS and provider support (with additional varied features). Seven studies  (19,185 participants)  reported 'controlled' BP as an outcome, and intervention effect estimates varied from negligible effects (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34) to large improvements in BP control (OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.57 to 3.68). The three trials of clinician training or decision support combined with SMS (with additional varied features) had confidence intervals encompassing benefits and harms, with point estimates close to zero. Pooled analyses of the two trials of interventions solely delivered through SMS were indicative of little or no beneficial intervention effect on systolic BP (MD -1.55 mmHg, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.25; I 2 = 0%) and small increases in controlled BP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; I 2 = 0%).\n\nBased on four studies (12,439 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision and once for risk of bias) relating to the intervention effect on combined (fatal and non-fatal) CVD events.\n\nTwo studies (2535 participants) provided low-certainty evidence for the effect of the intervention on cognitive outcomes, with little or no difference between trial arms for perceived quality of care and satisfaction with treatment.\n\nThere was moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) that the interventions did not cause harm, based on six studies (8285 participants). Three studies reported no adverse events attributable to the intervention. One study reported no difference between groups in experience of adverse effects of statins, and that no participants reported intervention-related adverse events. One study stated that potential side effects were similar between groups. One study reported a similar number of deaths in each arm, but did not provide further information relating to potential adverse events."

Trials of BP self-monitoring with mobile-phone telemedicine support reported modest benefits. One trial at low risk of bias reported modest reductions in LDL cholesterol but no benefits for BP. There is moderate-certainty evidence that these interventions do not result in harm. Further trials of these interventions are warranted."

Medications can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, but many people who have been given these medications do not take them as o en or as consistently as recommended.

Interventions delivered through mobile phones, for example, prompting by text messaging, may be a low-cost way to help people to take their medication as recommended.\n\nMeta-analysis of 2 trials evaluating an intervention targeting adherence to blood pressure medication delivered solely by SMS messaging provided a pooled MD of -1.55 mmHg, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.25."

      "text": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of disability and mortality throughout the world (Roth 2018; WHO 2011; WHO 2016), with an estimated 17.8 million people dying from CVDs in 2017, accounting for almost a third of all global deaths (Roth 2018). However, premature fatal and non-fatal CVD is considered to be largely preventable through the control of risk factors  (WHO 2011) .\n\nPrimary prevention of CVD refers to actions taken to reduce the incidence of clinical events due to coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease, among people with risk factors who have not yet developed clinicallymanifest CVD  (WHO 2007) . Primary prevention of CVD consists of lifestyle modifications (e.g. smoking cessation, increasing physical activity) and drug therapy (Piepoli 2016).\n\nLipid-lowering and antihypertensive drug therapies for primary prevention are cost-effective in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality among high-risk people and are recommended by international guidelines (Piepoli 2016; WHO 2007). Recommendations relating to the use of antiplatelet drugs for primary prevention vary. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) states that aspirin cannot be recommended in primary prevention due to its increased risk of major bleeding (Piepoli 2016); however, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends the use of aspirin when the 10-year risk of CVD events reaches such a level that the benefits of aspirin, in terms of CVD events prevented, outweigh the potential harm of increased gastrointestinal haemorrhage (USPSTF 2014).\n\nAdherence to long-term medication is not ideal and results in costs in both health and economic terms (Piepoli 2016). Meta-analyses have estimated rates of adherence to cardiovascular medications ranging from 50% to 60% (Chowdhury 2013; Naderi 2012), and there is some evidence that adherence is lower for primary prevention (Naderi 2012).\n\nOne study of health records of over 430,000 people in UK general practices found that 47% of people prescribed statins for primary prevention discontinued treatment (indicated by a greater than 90-day gap between prescriptions). Among these people, 72% then restarted treatment (Vinogradova 2016). One study of Finnish healthcare registers found that 53% of women prescribed statin therapy for primary prevention were adherent (defined as exceeding 80% of the prescribed regimen) (Lavikainen 2016). It has been estimated that approximately 9% of cases of CVDs in the EU could be attributed to poor adherence to vascular medications (Chowdhury 2013). Improving adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD would help to maximise the clinical benefits for the wider population  (WHO 2003) . There is therefore considerable scope for increasing adherence to prescribed medicine, and thereby reducing morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs."

      "text": "Mobile phone ownership is almost universal in high-income countries and estimated to have reached over 90% in low-and middle-income countries (ICT 2016). Given the broad reach of mobile phones and the potential for automation of delivery, interventions delivered by mobile phone are a potentially cost-effective strategy to improve medication adherence. A range of media can be delivered through mobile phones, including text messages, picture messages, interactive-voice response, telephone calls and, with increasing ownership of smart phones with Internet capabilities (ICT 2016), mobile applications. For example, lack of adherence resulting from lack of information about the benefits of medication, lack of information about how they work and how to take them, misconceptions about medication adverse effects, complex or unclear advice or poor recall of information provided in consultations may be addressed through text messages providing short and simply-worded snippets of information (Julius 2009; Kardas 2013; Pound 2005; Vermeire 2001). Experiences of adverse effects can be targeted through mobile phone-delivered interventions by providing information about medication and facilitating a link to a healthcare professional for people experiencing problems with their medication. Lack of social support has also been linked to poor medication adherence; previous qualitative research found that the receipt of text message-based intervention provided social support (Douglas 2013). Mobile phone-delivered interventions can be designed to target psychological factors such as lack of motivation and low selfefficacy (Free 2016). Systematic reviews assessing the effect of mobile health (mhealth) interventions on medication adherence for a range of conditions, including HIV, non-communicable diseases and prevention of transplant rejection have reported significant improvements (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Park 2014b). An RCT has found mobile phone messaging to be effective in improving contraceptive use  (Smith 2015) . Few adverse effects of mobile phone-based interventions have been reported; potential, but rare, adverse events may include road traffic accidents (Caird 2014)."

However, no systematic review has specifically examined the effect of mobile phone-based interventions on adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD. Mobile phone-based interventions are of particular interest, given their low cost and potential for widespread delivery."

We assessed the blinding of outcome assessment domains separately for objectively-measured outcomes, and self-reported subjective outcomes. Given the nature of the interventions included in this review, it is likely that blinding of participants and personnel would be impossible, as would blinding of self-reported outcome assessment, so we expected trials to be categorised at high risk of bias for both of these domains. For the overall study assessment, we categorised a trial as being at low risk of bias if it was rated as low risk in all the domains listed above (with the exception of blinding of participants and personnel/self-reported outcome assessment). Trials that were at high or unclear risk of bias for any of the domains (except blinding of participants and personnel/selfreported outcome assessment) were categorised as being at high risk of bias."

We did not undertake meta-analyses for the rest of the included studies, as they were too heterogeneous in their content and delivery of their interventions. We present the effect estimates for outcomes reported by multiple studies in illustrative forest plots (without pooling); it should be noted that in transferring effect estimates from papers into Review Manager 5 using the generic inverse variance method, some CIs differed from those reported in the original paper by a decimal place, and where clustering has been accounted for using an external ICC (as described above), the CIs differ from those in the original report.\n\nFor the two studies pooled in meta-analyses, we used a fixedeffect model. In the presence of heterogeneity (an I 2 statistic in excess of 30%), we planned to examine whether this heterogeneity could be explained through our prespecified subgroup analyses. If these analyses accounted for the heterogeneity, we would only present the subgroup pooled effect estimates. If these subgroup analyses did not explain the heterogeneity, we would present results narratively. We intended to use fixed-effect meta-analysis and apply a conservative I 2 threshold to identify heterogeneity in this review to avoid overweighting smaller studies. This is because we consider that the heterogeneity observed in these behaviourchange trials will primarily be a result of differences in the content of the interventions and differences in risk of bias."

We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence as it related to the studies that contributed data for each outcome. We used methods and recommendations described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sch\u00fcnemann 2020) using GRADEpro so ware (GRADEpro GTD 2015). We justified decisions to downgrade the quality of studies using footnotes and made comments to aid readers' understanding of the review where necessary."

      "text": "The sample sizes of included studies ranged from 59 (Morillo-Verdugo 2018) to 9642 (Peiris 2019), with a total of 25,633 randomised participants across all 14 included studies.\n\nLiu 2015 specified that participants must have had \"no known cardiovascular disease\" as an inclusion criterion, and therefore included 100% of participants meeting the criteria for primary\n\nprevention. Morillo-Verdugo 2018 was among participants living with HIV over 35 years of age, and \"receiving active ART with at least 1 drug prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, angina pectoris, cardiovascular prophylaxis, or type 2 diabetes\"; 100% of participants met the criteria for primary prevention (personal communication with author).The other included studies had a mix of participants: in five studies, at least 90% of participants met the criteria of primary prevention (Choudhry 2018; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; McManus 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Prabhakaran 2019); four studies included at least 78% primary-prevention participants (Bobrow 2016; He 2017; Logan 2012; Peiris 2019); and in one study approximately 65% of participants met the criteria for primary prevention, but results\n\nwere reported separately for participants according to whether or not they had previously had a CVD event (Gulayin 2019). Saleh 2018 did not report the proportion of participants meeting the criteria for primary prevention, but stated that participants had to be registered at the primary healthcare centres \"as diabetics or hypertensive and aged 40 years or more\". We sought clarification from study authors on the proportion who had not had prior CVD events, but had not received this information at the time of submission. Tobe 2019 did not report the proportion of primary prevention participants (personal communication stated that this was not recorded), but inclusion criteria included age 18 years or more, uncontrolled hypertension (\u2265 140/90 mmHg or \u2265 130/80 mmHg for diabetics), and stable on current dose of antihypertensive (if treated) for at least eight weeks.\n\nThere was heterogeneity between trials in the proportion of participants who were taking medication for the primary prevention of CVD. For four studies, having been prescribed medication for CVD prevention (anti-hypertensives or lipidlowering medication) was an inclusion criterion, and therefore 100% of participants\n\nwere receiving anti-hypertensive medication at baseline (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; McManus 2018). Logan 2012 included at least 89.1% of participants prescribed medication (hypertensive drugs or lipid-lowering drugs or aspirin, or a combination of these); almost 85% of participants in He 2017 were using antihypertensive medications at baseline; and P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017 stated that 68.1% of their sample had been prescribed lipid-lowering medication (but did not mention other types of CVD prevention drugs). Based on communication with trial authors, at least 58% of participants in Prabhakaran 2019 were taking hypertensive or lipid-lowering medication. Almost half of participants in Peiris 2019 were taking at least one anti-hypertensive, lipid-lowering or anti-platelet medication. In Morillo-Verdugo 2018, 28% of participants were prescribed lipidlowering medication, with additional prescriptions for other types of CVD drugs (data provided by drug class, so proportion of participants taking at least one CVD-related drug not available); and Tobe 2019 had 28% of participants on anti-hypertensive medications at baseline (personal communication). In Gulayin 2019, no participants were on CVD medication at baseline, with current statin use being an exclusion criterion, but the intervention sought to get participants on medication for hyperlipidaemia where indicated, and improve adherence to this medication. Liu 2015 did not report the proportion of participants prescribed medication, but explicitly stated that the intervention targeted adherence to medication among those on treatment. Similarly, Saleh 2018 did not report this proportion, but stated that the intervention targeted medication compliance. The mean age of participants varied from approximately 49 years (Saleh 2018) to 67 years (McManus 2018). The proportion of women in the trial samples ranged from 9.4% (Morillo-Verdugo 2018) to 72% (Bobrow 2016). Settings All studies recruited from healthcare settings, whether from outpatients attending clinics or outreach/home visits co-ordinated by local health providers. Three studies were conducted in Spain: one recruited through four primary care centres in Huelva (Southern Spain) (M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019); one recruited participants living with HIV who had moderate or high cardiovascular risk from five tertiary hospitals (Morillo-Verdugo 2018); and one recruited participants from primary care clinics in three health districts of three Spanish autonomous communities (P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017). Two trials were carried out in India: one recruited through community health centres in Haryana (North India) and Karnataka (South India) (Prabhakaran 2019), and one from primary health centres in Andhra Pradesh (South India) (Peiris 2019). Two trials recruited through primary healthcare centres in Argentina (Gulayin 2019; He 2017). Two studies were based in Canada: Logan 2012 recruited from the offices or clinics of physicians practising in metropolitan Toronto; and Tobe 2019 recruited through community healthcare provision from Canada's First Nations communities living on six reserves in Northern Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. Bobrow 2016 recruited from an outpatient chronic disease service in a single, large, public sector clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Liu 2015 recruited from a health management centre in a hospital in Guangzhou, China. Choudhry 2018 recruited from primary care practice sites of a large multi-specialty group practice in Massachusetts, USA. McManus 2018 recruited from general practices in the UK. Finally, Saleh 2018 recruited from primary healthcare centres located in rural areas and Palestinian refugee camps across Lebanon. Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews prescribed CVD medication (Gulayin 2019; He 2017; Liu 2015; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Prabhakaran 2019; Peiris 2019; Saleh 2018). The interventions evaluated by Bobrow 2016 and Choudhry 2018 were specifically designed to focus primarily on medication adherence, with only a few references to other lifestyle modifications such as diet and physical exercise. Similarly, Tobe 2019 focused on the importance of blood pressure control and the rationale for medical therapy to encourage adherence. Two trials examined interventions which primarily consisted of blood pressure telemonitoring; one included feedback (via their smartphone) and could review their readings (Logan 2012), and the other did not provide such feedback but relied on participants to send their readings via SMS (McManus 2018). These mobile telemonitoring interventions were considered to implicitly target adherence to treatment as well as other health behaviours important for the control of blood pressure. Two studies delivered the intervention solely through educational and motivational mobile-phone text messages about hypertension and its medical therapy (Bobrow 2016; Tobe 2019), and one through a mobile application only, which allowed participants to record personal data, recommended BP levels as objectives, record the doctor's advice about the prescribed treatment, set reminder alarms, set a calendar of appointments or events, and record the results of the BP measurement (M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019). Three studies evaluated interventions involving text messages to participants, alongside additional components involving healthcare workers, such as a face-to-face counselling session (Liu 2015); pharmacotherapeutic follow-up and an individual motivational interview (led by pharmacists) to work towards the achievement of pharmacotherapeutic objectives (Morillo-Verdugo 2018), and additional training for healthcare providers focusing on clinical guidelines and provider-patient communication strategies (Saleh 2018). Two studies examined interventions involving training for healthcare providers in clinical guidelines, a mobile/ tablet-based decision support system for clinical staff, and educational and motivational text messages directly to patients (Gulayin 2019; Prabhakaran 2019), and one study combined a tablet-based decision support system for clinical staff with interactive voice response messaging delivered to participants (Peiris 2019). Choudhry 2018 evaluated an intervention involving text message (as reminders and motivational support for adherence), pillboxes, mailed personalised progress reports, and an individually-tailored telephone consultation conducted by a staff clinical pharmacist. The intervention examined by He 2017 involved regular home visits from community health workers to providing education and counselling on lifestyle modification, home BP monitoring, and medication adherence skills; provision of an automatic home blood-pressure monitor and seven-day pill organiser; and individualised text messages to promote lifestyle changes and reinforce medication adherence. P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017 involved a combination of text messages, written information, and self-completion cards for participants to record adherence to recommendations. Logan 2012 evaluated an intervention which involved the provision of a home blood-pressure monitoring device and feedback to participants' smartphones, alongside an automated fax providing detailed information on the participants' status to their physicians on the day before their next scheduled appointment. In McManus 2018, intervention participants were provided with a home blood-pressure monitoring device, and trained to send readings via a simple free SMS text-based telemonitoring service, which alerted participants to contact their healthcare providers in response to very high or very low readings or if their average blood pressure was above target, reminded them if insufficient readings were transmitted, and presented readings to clinicians via a web interface. Most studies had a control group that received usual care (Choudhry 2018; He 2017; Liu 2015; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Peiris 2019; Saleh 2018). The control group in Logan 2012 received the same home blood-pressure monitoring equipment as the intervention group and a booklet containing information on the measurement of blood pressure, treatment of hypertension and goals of therapy. The control group in Bobrow 2016 received written information about hypertension and healthy living, and only received text messages that were sent to all trial participants, which primarily related to trial participation. The control group in Tobe 2019 received 'passive' text messages including healthy lifestyle and diet advice, with none of the content relating to blood pressure control. McManus 2018 had three arms: the telemonitoring arm (as described above), one arm which received usual care, and another group which was instructed to self-monitor blood pressure and at the end of each week record their readings on paper and send them to their healthcare provider. For the purposes of this review, we extracted data from the usual-care arm and excluded the self-monitoring arm. In Prabhakaran 2019, participants in the control group received 'enhanced' usual care, whereby training on clinical guidelines was provided to healthcare providers; charts on the management of conditions were displayed prominently at the outpatient clinics; and nurses provided a lifestyle advice pamphlet to each participant. Gulayin 2019 reported that the control group received usual care, but clinics were also provided with educational flyers and written material for display. Outcomes All studies reported at least one objective measure related to medication adherence. Thirteen studies measured blood pressure (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018; He 2017; Liu 2015; Logan 2012; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; McManus 2018; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Prabhakaran 2019; Peiris 2019; Saleh 2018; Tobe 2019), and six studies measured cholesterol levels (at least one of the following: LDL-C, HDL-C, TC) (Choudhry 2018; Gulayin 2019; Liu 2015; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Prabhakaran 2019). Three studies provided outcome data relating to CVD events (McManus 2018; Peiris 2019; Tobe 2019) and one study reported on CVD-related deaths (Bobrow 2016). Six studies explicitly reported adverse events, including adverse medication effects of statins, intervention-related adverse events and deaths (Bobrow 2016; He 2017; McManus 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Prabhakaran 2019; Tobe 2019). Nine studies reported indirect measures of adherence to treatment (our secondary outcomes). Three studies included outcome data on self-reported adherence measured using the Morisky-Green scale (for lipid-lowering medication (Gulayin 2019; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017) and for anti-hypertensive medication (He 2017)). Bobrow 2016 included self-reported adherence to medication measured using a visual analogue scale, in addition to a measure of 'proportion of days of medication covered' (defined as the proportion of participants with 80% or more days covered with blood pressure-lowering medication from prescribing and dispensing data routinely recorded in the clinical record, Mobile phone-based interventions for improving adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews pharmacy record and Chronic Dispensing Unit record). Choudhry 2018 reported medication adherence for hyperlipidaemia and hypertension, assessed using prescription claims data and measured as the mean proportion of days covered (PDC) over the 12 months a er randomisation. M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019 reported the percentage of participants who took antihypertensive drugs correctly on 80% to 100% of days, measured using a Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Prabhakaran 2019 recorded the proportion of participants who reported adherence to their anti-hypertensive drugs in the last seven days before the endline assessment. Morillo-Verdugo 2018 recorded the proportion of participants adherent to 'concomitant medication' measured with \"the Morisky-Green questionnaire and pharmacy dispensing records\". McManus 2018 recorded self-reported adherence using the 'Medication Adherence Rating Scale', but the study report lacks detail on how this was scored. Three trials also included a measure of quality of life (measured with the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire) (Bobrow 2016; McManus 2018; Peiris 2019). Two trials reported on cognitive outcomes: Bobrow 2016 compared satisfaction with treatment between the trial arms, and Prabhakaran 2019 asked participants about their perceived quality of care. Four trials reported data relating to our process measures, including satisfaction with the intervention (P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017), adherence to the intervention home blood-pressure monitoring schedule (Logan 2012), proportion responding to messages (Bobrow 2016), and proportion opting to receive intervention text messages (Choudhry 2018).\n\nTwo trials reported on the costs associated with the intervention (He 2017; Prabhakaran 2019)"

Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Allocation Twelve studies reported adequate random sequence generation and were at low risk of bias for this domain (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018; Gulayin 2019; He 2017; Liu 2015; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; McManus 2018; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Peiris 2019; Prabhakaran 2019; Tobe 2019). Two studies did not provide sufficient information and were therefore at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation (Logan 2012; Saleh 2018). Eight studies described their allocation concealment adequately and were at low risk of bias in this domain (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018; Gulayin 2019; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; Peiris 2019; Prabhakaran 2019; Saleh 2018; Tobe 2019). The other six studies did not provide sufficient information on their allocation procedures and were therefore at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment (He 2017; Liu 2015; Logan 2012; McManus 2018; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017). Blinding In all but one of the included studies, the nature of the interventions precluded blinding of participants, the exception being Tobe 2019 which compared 'active' messages with 'passive messages' including general health information, meaning it would not be obvious to participants whether they were in the intervention or control group. This study also blinded personnel, so was at low risk of bias in this domain. In 10 studies, personnel were not blinded to group assignment (Choudhry 2018; Gulayin 2019; He 2017; Liu 2015; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; McManus 2018; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; Peiris 2019; Prabhakaran 2019; Saleh 2018) and were at high risk of bias this domain. The remaining three studies were at unclear risk of bias: two of them stated that personnel were blinded (Bobrow 2016; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017), and one study was not clear whether personnel were blinded (Logan 2012). For the blinding of objective outcome assessment domain, five studies provided sufficient detail relating to the blinding of outcome assessors and were at low risk of bias for this domain (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018; Peiris 2019; Prabhakaran 2019; Tobe 2019). Nine studies did not provide adequate detail relating to whether or not outcome assessors were blinded, the nature of data collection, or the nature of data entry, or both, and so were judged as being at unclear risk of bias in this domain (Gulayin 2019; He 2017; Liu 2015; Logan 2012; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; McManus 2018; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Saleh 2018). Eight of the included studies reported self-reported subjective outcomes for extraction. All were judged to be at high risk of bias for this domain, as the participants could not be blinded to their allocation, and therefore this may have resulted in biased self-reported outcomes (Bobrow 2016; Gulayin 2019; He 2017; McManus 2018; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Peiris 2019; Prabhakaran 2019). This domain did not apply to the six other studies, as they did not report subjective outcomes. We assessed these as low risk of bias to provide a complete risk of bias assessment (Choudhry 2018; Liu 2015; Logan 2012; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; Saleh 2018; Tobe 2019). Incomplete outcome data Most of the included studies had high rates of follow-up (85% or greater) with no evidence of differential loss to follow-up, and reported sensitivity analyses finding consistent results or used appropriate methods to impute missing data; we therefore judged them to be at low risk of bias for the incomplete outcome data domain (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018; Gulayin 2019; He 2017; Logan 2012; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; McManus 2018; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Peiris 2019; Prabhakaran 2019).\n\nOne study reported that 27.5% of participants did not attend for follow-up, and that they differed from those who did attend for follow-up based on several characteristics. The study also reported that these missing values were likely to have little impact on the primary outcome, based on sensitivity analyses. However, it is unclear whether this may have affected other outcomes, and so we rated this study at unclear risk of bias for this domain (Liu 2015). We judged a second study to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain, as 14% loss to follow-up was reported, but no further information nor analyses relating to these participants were provided (Tobe 2019).\n\nFinally, Saleh 2018 was considered to be at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data, as 28% of participants in the intervention group had no outcome data compared to only 1% in the control group, and this discrepancy was not explained."

      "title": "Selective reporting",
      "text": "Five studies were at low risk of bias for selective reporting on the basis that they reported all (or at least main) outcomes as specified in their published protocols, and the trials were registered prior to start of recruitment (Choudhry 2018; He 2017; McManus 2018; Peiris 2019; Tobe 2019). Gulayin 2019 was considered to be at high risk of bias for this domain as the \"proportion of patients with moderate and high CVD risk who have reduced their LDL-c by 30% and 50% respectively\" was specified as an outcome in the protocol, but no results for this are reported.\n\nThe rest of the studies were at unclear risk of bias for selective reporting. Bobrow 2016 reported outcomes as planned in their protocol, with the exception of one outcome that was flagged in protocol, but not in the trial report ('hypertension knowledge'). This trial began recruiting in June 2012, but details of the protocol were not registered until December 2013, and so we cannot be certain as to what was planned before the trial began. Three trials also appeared to have been registered a er recruitment had begun, with no published protocol identified (Liu 2015; Logan 2012; Saleh 2018). We could find no protocol for M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019, and while the report stated the trial had been registered it was unclear whether this was prior to recruitment. We found no protocol nor trial registry entry for Morillo-Verdugo 2018. P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017 reported all outcomes as planned in the protocol, with the exception of cardiovascular events occurring during the study period. This was considered an important outcome, but it was not clear whether this outcome was not reported because no events occurred. In Prabhakaran 2019 not all of the secondary outcomes (health-related quality of life and costs) were reported, but authors stated that the cost-effectiveness analysis would be conducted if the intervention showed a substantial effect, which it did not. The supplementary materials for this trial listed the adverse events to be recorded, but no mention of adverse events is made in the trial report, although it is not clear whether this is because none occurred."

The exceptions to this were the Bobrow 2016 and Tobe 2019 trials, both of which delivered the intervention solely through text messages about hypertension and it's medical therapy to target adherence, and recorded blood pressure outcomes (systolic blood pressure, and 'controlled' blood pressure). In generating the illustrative forest plots, we also checked heterogeneity statistically (I 2 greater than 85% for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and for diastolic blood pressure (DBP); I 2 = 55% for controlled blood pressure; I 2 = 39% for total cholesterol; I 2 = 24% for LDL-C; I 2 = 0% for HDL-C). Based on these findings, we gave further consideration to pooling results from the three studies which reported HDL-C (Liu 2015; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017) and from the five studies which reported LDL-C (Choudhry 2018; Gulayin 2019; Liu 2015; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017). However, we still considered the interventions too diverse to warrant meaningful pooling: specifically, one intervention included face-toface counselling alongside text-messaging (Liu 2015); one consisted of written information and text messages (P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017); one involved pharmacotherapeutic follow-up and an individual motivational interview (led by pharmacists), in addition to text messages (Morillo-Verdugo 2018); another involved training for healthcare providers in clinical guidelines, a mobile/tablet-based decision support system for clinical staff, and educational and motivational text messages directly to patients (Gulayin 2019); and Choudhry 2018 evaluated an intervention involving text messages (as reminders and motivational support for adherence), pillboxes, mailed personalised progress reports, and an individually-tailored telephone consultation conducted by a staff clinical pharmacist.\n\nWe present results narratively below, and in Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3; Analysis 1.4; Analysis 1.6; Analysis 1.7."

In our review, we identified 14 trials, of which two were at low risk of bias (Choudhry 2018; Peiris 2019). The trials varied widely in the behaviours targeted, content and delivery mechanisms of the interventions, and the populations targeted. Due to these differences, we mostly summarised results narratively. The evidence for the intervention effect on LDL cholesterol was of low certainty. Two of the five studies reporting LDL cholesterol as an outcome recorded evidence of intervention benefit, albeit of a modest size (Choudhry 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017). The body of evidence relating to the effect of mobile phone-based interventions on blood pressure was also of low certainty. Four of the 13 studies recording systolic blood pressure showed evidence of intervention benefit, with confidence intervals excluding no effect (He 2017; Liu 2015; Logan 2012; McManus 2018). The same four trials also demonstrated a reduction in diastolic Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews blood pressure associated with the intervention (He 2017; Liu 2015; Logan 2012; McManus 2018). The direction of the point estimates was more consistently positive for the outcome of 'controlled' blood pressure, although the confidence intervals excluded no effect in only one trial (He 2017). Pooled analysis of two trials showed there was little or no benefit for systolic blood pressure for interventions delivered solely through educational and motivational text messages about hypertension and its medical therapy, although there was a modest increase in the proportion of participants with 'controlled' blood pressure (Bobrow 2016; Tobe 2019). Nine studies reported indirect measures of medication adherence, of which seven reported evidence of intervention benefit (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018; He 2017; M\u00e1rquez Contreras 2019; Morillo-Verdugo 2018; P\u00e1rraga-Mart\u00ednez 2017; Prabhakaran 2019), ranging from a relatively small increase in adherence in the intervention arm based on prescription data (Bobrow 2016; Choudhry 2018) to the largest effect estimates (a 23.1% and a 27.9% absolute increase in adherence) recorded through self-reported data (Morillo-Verdugo 2018; Prabhakaran 2019). Based on four studies, there was very low-certainty evidence relating to the intervention effect on combined (fatal and non-fatal) CVD events (Bobrow 2016; McManus 2018; Peiris 2019; Tobe 2019)."

Few studies reported on fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events, meaning we were unable to establish whether the modest benefits observed in individual trials for cholesterol and blood pressure translated into such patient-relevant outcomes. In the trials involving clinical decision support systems, whereby prescriptions and dosages may have been altered during the study period, we cannot be sure of the contribution of increased medication adherence to the reductions in cholesterol and blood pressure reported. The relative contribution of improved medication adherence is also uncertain in the trials which included a mix of participants who had and had not been prescribed CVD medication, and those which targeted lifestyle modifications alongside medication-taking behaviour. Furthermore, in many of these trials, adherence to medication was a secondary rather than a primary outcome, meaning that these studies were not designed around the focus of this review."

The evidence was of low certainty across all outcomes, with the exception of adverse events, for which we rated the evidence as of moderate certainty. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for objective outcomes of medication adherence by one level as a result of inconsistency in effect estimates which spanned both clinically-meaningful improvements and null effects. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all five outcomes considered by one level because most of the included studies were at high risk of bias. Eleven of the studies were at unclear risk of bias for at least two of the domains, indicating inadequate reporting of the trial methods in these studies, which limited our ability to make clear judgements about the level of risk of bias. Finally, the evidence relating to the cognitive outcomes of satisfaction with treatment and perceived quality of care was also downgraded for indirectness, because this was based on two trials measuring different outcomes. Half of the trials in this review randomised by clusters rather than individuals, and not all measured indicators of adherence at baseline, so there was uncertainty about the extent of imbalanced relevant baseline characteristics in these trials."

However, we tried to overcome this through searching clinical trial registries for prospectivelyregistered trials. We decided to only include trials with a minimum of one-year follow-up in order that results were applicable to longer-term sustained behaviour change in adherence, which would therefore be more important in improving health status.

These findings are broadly consistent with systematic reviews of mhealth interventions to improve medication adherence across conditions, although these reviews included short-term studies and non-RCT designs, which are subject to bias (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Park 2014b; Ng 2020). One systematic review examining RCTs of monitoring and messaging interventions targeting medication adherence for the management of type 2 diabetes found no evidence for an improvement in medication adherence in their pooled meta-analyses of five trials (Farmer 2016). Our finding that pooled analyses of interventions delivered by text messaging alone indicated small benefits, some of which achieved statistical significance, is consistent with the findings from trials using SMS alone targeting adherence to HIV medication, which also report small benefits of borderline clinical and statistical significance (Da Costa 2012; Orrell 2015; Pop-Eleches 2011; Sabin 2015). The three (out of four) studies reporting evidence of intervention benefit for lowering blood pressure with confidence intervals excluding no effect were the only studies which included the provision of home blood-pressure monitoring systems in combination with mobile phones in the intervention.\n\nThese positive intervention effects are consistent with the modest benefits of monitoring interventions in general Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Carrasco 2008; Lim 2011; McKinstry 2013; Yoo 2009). The small or modest benefits reported may reflect the challenges involved in improving adherence, and overall inconclusive findings relating to adherence interventions in general, which have previously been noted in a Cochrane Review of all adherence interventions (Nieuwlaat 2014)."

So this equates to a 2.7 % relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events. The other four trials measuring LDL-C as an outcome reported intervention effects ranging from a 9.2 mg/dL reduction to a 0.77 mg/dL increase, meaning that even the larger of these effects would have a small or modest impact on clinical outcomes.\n\nNo trials at low risk of bias reported reductions in blood pressure (BP). All three of the trials of interventions involving a home bloodpressure monitoring system alongside telemedicine support via mobile phone reported reductions in systolic BP of -6.6, -7.1,and 4.7 mmHg respectively, and of diastolic BP of -5.4, -3.9 and -1.\n\n3 respectively (He 2017; Logan 2012; McManus 2018).

A 10 mg drop in systolic BP or a 5 mg drop in diastolic BP gives 22% fewer coronary events at one year and 41% fewer strokes, so these effects are clinically important (Collins 1990; Law 2009). Those considering implementing similar interventions should take into account the risks of bias in these trials and whether additional costs are incurred. Liu 2015 also reported clinically important reductions in systolic and diastolic BP of -12 mmHg associated with an intervention including SMS with a computerised CVD risk evaluation and face-to-face counselling. The trials of interventions delivered by SMS alone or interventions delivering SMS to patients plus clinician training / decision support, reported little or no benefit on mean BP. The delivery of mobile phone-based interventions is inexpensive once systems are set up and previous analyses of such interventions in other fields have demonstrated cost effectiveness (Guerriero 2013; Lester 2010). If interventions were shown to be cost-effective the modest benefits achieved at low cost would be important if achieved across whole populations.\n\nWhile many of the trials included components of the intervention delivered to healthcare providers as well as patients or delivered by other more resource-intensive means to patients, such as faceto-face counselling sessions with healthcare workers in addition to text messaging, only two out of seven of these reported clinically and statistically significant intervention benefits."

      "text": "One trial at low risk of bias reported benefits on LDL cholesterol. It remains unclear why this intervention reported benefits whilst others with some apparently similar components did not. Given the heterogeneity of the interventions, future research should evaluate the effect of this intervention in other settings to provide greater certainty about the effects.\n\nTrials involving self-monitoring and telemedicine support reported benefits but were at risk of bias. Further trials addressing methodological or reporting limitations are therefore needed. Trial results suggested that different means of providing the telemedicine support component may have different effects, which could usefully be evaluate by future trials. The two interventions delivered by SMS alone were developed with input from users (Bobrow 2016; Tobe 2019). The intervention by Bobrow 2016 by targeted many of the barriers to adherence, which might be addressed using SMS. Nonetheless, the modest or absent benefit on mean BP and BP control is consistent with results of adherence interventions delivered by SMS for secondary prevention of CVD, HIV medication and diabetes (Adler 2017; Anglada-Martinez 2015; Farmer 2016). Adherence is influenced by a wide range of service and social factors, in addition to the individual-level factors like knowledge, motivation and skills (DiMatteo 2004; Julius 2009; Kardas 2013; Nieuwlaat 2014; Pound 2005; Vermeire 2001). Future adherence interventions should build on existing knowledge by considering the content of adherence intervention shown to be effective previously and by considering the broad range of factors influencing adherence that may be amenable to change. Future trials should target people most at risk of poor adherence and should exclude those known to be adherent.\n\nFor the indirect measures of adherence, the largest effect estimates related to those outcome measures reliant on participants' selfreport. Where possible, future trials should prioritise including measures of adherence which are less subject to bias resulting from unblinded participants.\n\nFinally, given the heterogeneity that exists between behaviourchange interventions, we believe that further high-quality adequately-powered trials of particular interventions would provide higher-quality evidence relating to the effectiveness, compared with evidence based on attempts to pool multiple smaller, lower-quality and potentially heterogeneous interventions and trials."

The Patient Activation Measure questionnaire was used to assess knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage one's health and health care. Strategies were tailored to participants' activation level and identified adherence barriers and included: structured consultation reports sent to participants' primary care physicians with recommendations for modifying treatment regimens and co-ordinating care, strategies to promote adherence including text messages (as reminders and motivational support) and pillboxes, and follow-up consultations. Mailed progress reports were sent at 6 and 9 months after randomisation, providing personalised information about disease control and medication adherence Comparison: Usual care: clinical pharmacists were available for consultation upon request by a participant's primary care provider, but outreach was not done routinely. Usual-care clinical pharmacists were not trained in the motivational interviewing method used as part of the intervention, did not have access to detailed adherence information for each participant or activation levels, nor did they have the ability to offer text messages or progress reports\n\nHow intervention was developed: Structure of telephone consultations developed by the study team using brief negotiated interviewing Personalised intervention: Strategies were personalised based on activation level and identified adherence barriers, e.g. content and frequency of text messages and whether participants received pillboxes Frequency and duration of intervention receipt: 12-month duration Choudhry 2018 Mobile phone-based interventions for improving adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The minimum distance between clinics was 10 km (different catchment area) and they did not share health professionals (to minimise intervention bias) Patients were eligible if they were aged 40 -74 years, were receiving care at participating PCCs, and met at least 1 of the following criteria: medical history of arteriosclerotic CVD (defined as acute coronary syndrome, history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary revascularisation, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack presumed to be of atherosclerotic in origin or revascularisation); high CVD risk according to the WHO charts adapted by the National Ministry of Health (estimated 10year CVD risk \u2265 20%); LDL-c level \u2265 190 mg/dL; or Type 2 diabetes Exclusion criteria: Patients were excluded if at least 1 of the following conditions were present: statin treatment, pregnancy, bed-bound, inability to give informed consent, history of end-stage chronic kidney disease treated with dialysis, HIV/AIDS, alcohol or drug abuse, or active tuberculosis Interventions Intervention: the intervention included 3 main components: (1) an intensive 2-day training workshop followed by certification at the outset; followed by (2) 3 quarterly educational outreach visits (EOVs); and (3) a mobile health (mHealth) application installed on the physician's smartphones to facilitate evidence-based and guideline-driven decision aids to improve patient management The 2-day workshop was held at the Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy and conducted by a cardiologist and an internal medicine specialist. The topics included in the training sessions were global CV risk assessment and management; diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients with dyslipidaemia; the chronic care model components; and management of adherence issues in patients with chronic diseases. The EOVs were also performed by cardiologists and internal medicine specialists and consisted of onsite face-to-face encounters with local physicians.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ble needs of practitioners at the clinics, and identified barriers that prevented appropriate prescription (e.g. side effects of statins, barriers for chronic treatment adherence). All physicians had the mHealth application installed on their phones during the study, which were used during the EOVs. It included evidence-based statin use recommendations shown on screen after completing information for CVD risk estimation In addition, the following support tools were used in the intervention group: (1) a web-based platform designed to send weekly SMS messages to promote healthy lifestyles, regular visits to the clinic, and to improve medication adherence for study participants; and (2) onsite training to pharmacist assistants given at the first EOV in each intervention clinic, focused on participant counselling on medication adherence. Additionally, educational flyers were distributed to be displayed in the pharmacy room Comparison: Usual care at clinics consists of mostly unscheduled appointments with a primary care physician on participant's demand. All clinics in the network provide ambulatory drugs free-of-charge at the point of care and most of the physicians, irrespective of the assignment, have received previous training in global cardiovascular risk management by trainers of the Ministry of Health.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Interventions Intervention: CHW-led home-based intervention, physician education and BP feedback and weekly text-messaging CHWs visited participants' homes monthly for the first 6 months and every other month thereafter. They started with a 90-minute visit when all family members were available to discuss general knowledge about hypertension prevention and treatment. During subsequent 60-minute visits they provided tailored counselling to participants and their families on lifestyle modification, home BP monitoring, and medication adherence skills. They reviewed specific strategies for lifestyle modification and encouraged participants to adopt strategies most suitable for their individual needs. They focused on goal setting, problem-solving, social support, and maintaining motivation during challenging situations. Participants with hypertension were given an automatic home BP monitor and 7-day pill organizer. CHWs helped participants schedule appointments with primary care physicians and delivered antihypertensive medication to their homes if they did not have access to transportation Primary care physicians were trained in standard treatment algorithms for stepped-care BP management based on clinical guidelines. Feedback was given to physicians, based on home BP monitoring data, to encourage medication adjustment when needed Individualised text-messages to promote lifestyle changes and reinforce medication adherence were sent out weekly to participants' mobile phones by an eHealth platform. Messages were based on hypertension status and perceived barriers to behavioural change identified during CHW home visits and consisted of motivational statements and behaviour-change techniques to reinforce in-person education interventions. CHWs also collected information on participants' receipt of text messages Comparison: Neither physicians nor CHWs were trained to conduct study interventions. Participants did not receive CHW home visits, home BP monitors, or text messages. Participants were encouraged to follow the clinical visit schedule of the Remediar+ Redes Program: monthly among participants after pharmacological treatment initiation and every 3 -6 months among participants who had controlled BP How intervention was developed: Intervention addressed system, provider and participant barriers to hypertension prevention and control by integrating individual strategies previously proven effective Personalised intervention: Yes; text messages and CHW strategies were tailored to perceived barriers to behavioural change identified during CHW home visits Frequency and duration of intervention receipt: weekly text messaging. 1 -2 monthly home visits. 18 months duration Outcomes Primary outcomes: Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline to end follow-up in participants with hypertension. Proportion of participants with controlled hypertension (BP < 140/90 mmHg) Secondary outcomes: self-reported antihypertensive medication adherence using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; cost per additional percentage of hypertension controlled Process outcomes: Percentage of planned CHW home-based interventions completed. Percentage of anticipated home BP measurements completed. Percentage of schedule text-messages sent. Percentage of participants reporting receipt of weekly messages Adverse events: Hypotension, syncope and injurious falls were queried at study nurse visits Other outcomes (not for extraction): Intensification of antihypertensive medication; weight change over the 18-month intervention; change in systolic and diastolic BP among normotensive participants Notes Funding source: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, award number U01HL114197 and partially by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, award number P20GM109036 Conflicts of interest: No conflicts of interest reported Risk of bias Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Cluster randomisation was stratified by geographic region and conducted at the data co-ordinating centre at Tulane University.

BP readings were automatically transmitted by the smartphone to application servers, which processed the information for trends and applied decisions rules. The reporting and alerting component of the system sent a self-care message to the screen of the participant's smartphone immediately after each reading. Messages related to the control of hypertension were based on care paths defined by running means of transmitted readings. On the day before the clinic visit to their physician, participants called a dedicated telephone number to initiate the automated process to fax a 1-page participant summary report to their physician. Self-care support participants were taught how to use the telemonitoring system, review past readings on their smartphone and the study-specific website (these activities were optional), and generate a 1-page participant summary report. They were instructed to take their smartphone to all doctor visits Comparison: participants in both groups were taught how to measure their BP correctly, instructed to measure their BP 2 days per week twice in the morning and twice in the evening, provided with a validated home BP-monitoring device with appropriate-sized upper arm cuff, and given a booklet with detailed information on the self-measurement of BP, treatment of hypertension and goals of therapy. Their primary care physician was given an outline of the study's objectives and BP treatment goal, asked to provide relevant medical information and given a copy of the 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring report. In both groups, treatment decisions, including medication adjustments and changes in lifestyle, were made by the participant's primary care physician.

Taught to use a validated automated electronic sphygmomanometer (Omron M10-IT). They were asked to monitor their own blood pressure in their non-dominant arm, twice each morning and evening, for the first week of every month using standard recommendations and their GPs were asked to use the self-monitored measurements for titration of antihypertensive medication. Participants were trained to send readings via a simple free SMS text-based telemonitoring service with web-based data entry back-up. The telemonitoring system incorporated an algorithm that alerted participants to contact their surgery in the light of very high or very low readings, reminded them if insufficient readings were transmitted, prompted them to make contact with their practice if their average blood pressure was above target, and presented readings to attending clinicians via a web interface. This secure web page automatically calculated mean blood pressure for each monitoring week, highlighted very high or very low readings, and presented a graphical display of blood pressure measurements.

The app allowed ASHAs to collect essential health-related information, inform the participant of their risk status, provide lifestyle advice relating to physical activity, diet and tobacco and alcohol and refer high-risk patients to the PHC doctor ASHAs conducted household-based assessments using the tablet. They measured BP and random capillary glucose samples. Data were uploaded to a shared electronic medical record (OpenMRS) in which 3 modules supported ASHAs to group patients who still required screening, prioritise workload, and alert them to high-risk individuals who required follow-up visits. Doctors accessed the data uploaded via OpenMRS and were provided with decision support recommendations for BP and other CVD risk factors management and medication prescription Participants received reminders on medication adherence and follow-up visits with the doctor via an interactive voice response system. This is an automated pre-recorded telephony service that notifies patients via a 1-way voice message of a particular action that was recommended to be taken.\n\nComparison: During the control periods, participants in these PHCs/villages continued to receive their usual service provided by either a PHC doctor or a private doctor of their choosing.

The NCD nurses used a tablet computer installed with the mWellcare system to collect data on patient history, blood pressure, blood glucose, depression, tobacco and alcohol use, and current medications. From this patient-specific clinical information, the mWellcare system generated a decision support recommendation (DSR) for the physician. Next, the physician referred the participant to the NCD nurse, who provided lifestyle advice using the prompts of the DSR, in addition to pamphlets (in the local language) to each participant. Additionally, through the mWellcare system, participants received short message service reminders for scheduled follow-up visits and medication adherence Comparison: Participants in control group received enhanced usual care. As in the intervention arm, the study provided training to physicians and NCD nurses on the clinical management guidelines for hypertension and diabetes mellitus; charts on the management of these conditions were displayed prominently at the outpatient clinics; and NCD nurses provided and explained the lifestyle advice pamphlet to each participant. In the control group, follow-up was at the discretion of the treating physicians How intervention was developed : developed by adapting existing clinical management guidelines to the local context, development, and validation of clinical algorithms and pilot-testing of the mWellcare system, which is an Android application designed to generate electronic decision support recommendations for the management of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, comorbid depression, and alcohol and tobacco use, tailored to the participant's profile and risk level. It stored the health records electronically, enabling long-term monitoring and follow-up.

The community-based component included community screening for HTN and diabetes among individuals falling within the age group at higher risk of developing NCDs -40 years or older-in the catchment areas of the 8 intervention centres. Individuals already diagnosed with or suspected of being diabetic, hypertensive, or both were referred to the nearest intervention PHCC for NCD-specific clinical care and were targeted by SMS messages. SMS content included health information on lifestyle, dietary habits, body weight, smoking, medications, importance of compliance, as well as symptoms and self-management of HTN and diabetes. Community individuals who were diagnosed and were receiving necessary care prior to the intervention were sent the weekly information SMS, as well as customised SMS reminders to follow up on their scheduled medical appointments. The PHC centre-based component of the intervention also included training of healthcare providers working in the intervention PHCCs, using (1) Online modules focusing on clinical guidelines for treating diabetes and HTN and others on provider-patient communication strategies (i.e. increasing compliance) and (  2 ) Online forums and frequently-asked questions mainly dedicated to peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing of treatment and communication techniques Comparison: Individuals in the control group (i.e. living in catchment areas of control PHCCs) did not receive SMS messages and were thus receiving the usual care How intervention was developed : The SMSs were developed by a family physician based on the MOPH guidelines for prevention and management of HTN and diabetes Personalised intervention: The messages were initially formulated in English and then translated to Arabic and sent using simplified Arabic terms to match the different levels of health literacy of the target lay population.

In the event that we are unable to access these data, we will apply a cut-off whereby only trials in which at least 75% of participants meet the criteria for primary prevention will be included.\"\n\nHowever, we did not specify how we would deal with trials that included a mix of participants who were prescribed CVD prevention medication and participants who were not prescribed CVD medication. Given that we stated we would include trials of interventions that target medication adherence alongside other lifestyle modifications, some of our trials identified for inclusion in this review included participants who had and participants who had not been prescribed CVD prevention medication. We extracted primary outcome data of objective measures of medication adherence (e.g. blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, etc.) for these mixed populations.\n\nWe stated that we would extract low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as an objective indicator of adherence to lipid-lowering medication.\n\nIn addition, we have also extracted total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\nWe stated we would report dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios. However we report them as odds ratios in order to allow for extraction of appropriately-adjusted results and comparability across effect estimates.\n\nIn the update of this review we made the following changes. We assessed risks of bias separately for objective outcomes, e.g. blood pressure, and self-reported subjective outcomes, e.g. self-reported adherence. This meant that for the overall study assessment, we categorised a trial as being at low risk of bias if it was rated as low risk in all domains, with the exception of blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of self-reported outcome assessment.\n\nWe did not assess the behaviour-change techniques in interventions, as we did not have the resources, and this was not considered to add materially to the value of the prior version of the review. Subgroup analyses would not therefore have been carried out on this basis had we conducted them. We did not request that authors provide us with disaggregated data only for those who met criteria for primary prevention or who were on CVD medication, or both. This was because in the previous version of the review this did not result in any datasharing. Instead we contacted authors to clarify the proportion of participants meeting primary-prevention criteria, and the proportion prescribed CVD medication, when this had not been stated in the study report."
