  "title": "Effectiveness of mHealth on Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Patients Living With HIV: Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials",
  "abstract": "Background: The World Health Organization recommends that all adults with HIV adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Good adherence to ART is beneficial to patients and the public. Furthermore, mHealth has shown promise in improving HIV medication adherence globally. \n Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis is to analyze the effectiveness of mHealth on adherence to antiretroviral therapy in patients living with HIV. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the association between mHealth and adherence to ART published until December 2021 were searched in electronic databases. Odds ratios (ORs), weighted mean differences, and 95% CIs were calculated. This meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method or the inverse variance test. We evaluated heterogeneity with the I 2 statistic. If I 2 was \u226450%, heterogeneity was absent, and a fixed effect model was used. If I 2 was >50%, heterogeneity was present, and a random effects model was used. Results: A total of 2163 participants in 8 studies were included in this meta-analysis. All included studies were RCTs. The random effects model was used for a meta-analysis of the effects of various intervention measures compared to routine nursing; the outcome was not statistically significant (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.99-2.38; P=.05). In the subgroups, only short messaging service (SMS)-based interventions significantly increased adherence to ART (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-2.89; P=.03). Further analysis showed that only interactive or bidirectional SMS could significantly increase ART adherence (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.34; P=.001). After combining the difference in CD4 cell count before and after the interventions, we concluded that there was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (I 2 =0%; tau 2 =0.37; P=.95). \n Conclusions: Interactive or bidirectional SMS can enhance intervention effects. However, whether mHealth can improve adherence to ART in patients with HIV needs further study. Owing to a lack of the required significant staff time, training, and ongoing supervision, there is still much more to do to apply mHealth to the clinical use of ART for patients living with HIV.",

      "text": "HIV is a public health issue that every country needs to address. There were an estimated 37.7 million people living with HIV at the end of 2020  [1] . The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all adults with HIV should adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART)  [2] . ART does not cure HIV infection but strongly suppresses viral replication within a person's body and modifies HIV from a terminal illness to a manageable chronic disease  [3] . One of the most significant factors in the effectiveness of ART is adherence  [4] . Good adherence to ART is beneficial to patients and public health  [5, 6] . In contrast, lack of adherence increases the risk of progression to AIDS and the creation of drug-resistant strains of HIV  [7] . Therefore, it is important to promote ART adherence through special techniques  [8, 9] . However, traditional ART adherence interventions are limited in their ability to maintain behavior modification  [10] . Mobile health (mHealth) technology, which refers to the use of mobile and wireless technologies to improve health, has shown promise in improving HIV medication adherence, both globally and domestically  [6, 11, 12] . Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of mHealth for improving adherence to ART in patients living with HIV."

This was measured directly (eg, by pill count) or indirectly (eg, by self-reporting). If the article reported the use of a variety of measurement methods, priority was given to measurement results obtained with the self-report method. The secondary outcome was CD4 cell count.\n\nThe exclusion criteria included the following: (1) the study was a duplicate, (2) the study was a systematic review or meta-analysis, (3) the study was missing outcome measures, (4) the experimental group used a variety of interventions, and (5) the control group did not receive routine nursing."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "A total of 2163 participants in 8 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The main result of the meta-analysis was that the pooled OR was 1.54. However, the outcome was not statistically significant, and there was considerable heterogeneity among the studies (I 2 =74%). Within-study heterogeneity reduces study robustness and relevance  [20] . Our current results are different from those of a 2015 study  [21] . That study found that mHealth interventions did seem to have been beneficial. We speculate that one of the possible reasons for this difference is that the number of articles included in our study was limited. Also, the different studies used a variety of methods to measure results. However, compared with the 2015 study, this meta-analysis combined the outcomes (separately for primary and secondary outcomes) to increase the reliability of the results.\n\nA subgroup analysis showed that SMS interventions improved adherence to ART. Further analysis suggested that interactive or bidirectional SMS interventions could enhance intervention effects. This result matches that of a 2014 study  [22] . Interactive or bidirectional SMS could increase medication adherence by enhancing engagement and the patient-provider relationship. Follow-up research could further study the content, time, and frequency of text messages. In this study, due to limitations arising from incomplete reporting of the relevant content, these aspects of the intervention were not analyzed.\n\nCD4 cell count and viral load are good indicators of treatment success  [23] . Several previous reviews did not obtain the same results as this study for CD4 cell count. One study  [22]  showed that compared to a control group, a group receiving text message-based support was more likely to maintain an adherence threshold at follow-up and meet the clinical goal of a higher CD4 cell count. However, another study  [24] , like ours, did not obtain this result. Our meta-analysis of the 4 studies that reported CD4 cell count showed considerable heterogeneity and no significant pooled mean difference. This may be attributable to the heterogeneity of the studies. We did not perform a meta-analysis of studies that measured viral load, as there was an insufficient number of these studies.\n\nThe WHO recommends mHealth strategies for improving ART adherence  [25] . At the same time, against the background of the coronavirus epidemic, telemedicine has gradually continued to develop  [26] . Currently, 95% of people use mobile phones and 77% of people use smartphones in different parts of the world  [27] ; mHealth has shown promise in increasing the accessibility of self-management interventions  [28]  and improving HIV health outcomes  [6] . At the same time, research has indicated that patients living with HIV are interested in mobile apps to support HIV self-management  [29] . However, most current mHealth interventions lack functionality, offering only medication reminders  [28]  or voice calls. Therefore, more comprehensive mHealth interventions that address multiple self-management needs of patients living with HIV are needed  [30] . At the same time, the implementation of ART interventions in real-world clinical settings has been severely limited by a lack of the resources required to initiate and maintain the interventions  [31] , such as staff time, training, and ongoing supervision. Future research should focus on how to apply personalized mHealth interventions to the management of patients living with HIV."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "There are several limitations of the current review. The interventions used in the included studies differed in form and frequency. At the same time, these studies used diverse methods for measuring their primary outcomes. This may have produced bias. The robustness and relevance of results increase with the number of distinct outcome measures that show the same result  [20] . However, few of the included studies reported CD4 cell count or viral load, and our analysis of these outcomes is thus insufficient."
