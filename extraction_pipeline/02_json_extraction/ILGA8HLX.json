  "title": "Machine learning for prediction of asthma exacerbations among asthmatic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background Asthma exacerbations reduce the patient's quality of life and are also responsible for significant disease burdens and economic costs. Machine learning (ML)-based prediction models have been increasingly developed to predict asthma exacerbations in recent years. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify the prediction performance of ML-based prediction models for asthma exacerbations and address the uncertainty of whether modern ML methods could become an alternative option to predict asthma exacerbations. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for studies published up to December 15, 2022. Studies that applied ML methods to develop prediction models for asthma exacerbations among asthmatic patients older than five years and were published in English were eligible. The prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) was utilized to estimate the risk of bias and the applicability of included studies. Stata software (version 15.0) was used for the random effects meta-analysis of performance measures. Subgroup analyses stratified by ML methods, sample size, age groups, and outcome definitions were conducted. \n Results Eleven studies, including 23 prediction models, were identified. Most of the studies were published in recent three years. Logistic regression, boosting, and random forest were the most used ML methods. The most common important predictors were systemic steroid use, short-acting beta2-agonists, emergency department visit, age, and exacerbation history. The overall pooled area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 11 studies (23 prediction models) was 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83). Subgroup analysis based on different ML models showed that boosting method achieved the best performance, with an overall pooled AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.81-0.87). \n Conclusion This study identified that ML was the potential tool to achieve great performance in predicting asthma exacerbations. However, the methodology within these models was heterogeneous. Future studies should focus on improving the generalization ability and practicability, thus driving the application of these models in clinical practice.",

      "text": "Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous disease affecting approximately 241 million people worldwide  [1] . Despite many effective medicines available, a proportion of asthmatic patients have uncontrolled asthma and asthma exacerbations  [2, 3] . Asthma exacerbations are characterized by progressive deterioration of asthma-related symptoms and lung function, resulting in a poor quality of life  [4, 5] . Severe asthma exacerbations are also responsible for decreased lung function, hospitalization, and even death, thus leading to disease and economic burdens  [6, 7] . Early recognition and timely intervention are the best strategies to prevent severe asthma exacerbations. Therefore, identifying patients at high risk of asthma exacerbations is crucial.\n\nAccording to a systematic review including ten prediction models for asthma exacerbations, the best prediction performance was achieved by logistic regression (LR) with a c-statistic of 0.80  [8] . However, this systematic review did not include models based on modern machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as random forest (RF), neural network (NN), boosting algorithms, and support vector machine (SVM). ML has become a popular method for developing prediction models in the medical field due to its ability to process complex, massive health data  [9] . Many studies developing prediction models for asthma exacerbations based on ML methods have been published, especially in recent years  [10, 11] . However, few systematic reviews were conducted to evaluate these existing ML models. Therefore, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prediction performance of ML-based prediction models for asthma exacerbations and identify whether modern ML methods could become an alternative option to prediction."

We defined asthma exacerbations in accordance with an Official American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Statement  [12] . Briefly, severe asthma exacerbation should include (1) at least three days of systemic corticosteroid treatment or (2) a hospitalization/ emergency department visit for asthma requiring systemic corticosteroids. Moderate asthma exacerbation should include (1) at least two days of symptoms and lung function deterioration, requiring increasing bronchodilator use, or (2) visits for asthma not requiring systemic corticosteroids intervention. Using available statistics in the manuscripts, we manually calculated parameters not reported (e.g., the number of positive cases). We also emailed the corresponding author(s) for missing data."

[13]  developed the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST), which could assess the risk of bias (ROB) and the applicability of prediction model studies. For ROB assessment, PROBAST includes four domains: participants, predictors, outcomes, and analysis. Each domain contains 2 to 9 signaling questions that facilitate this domain's ROB assessment (low, high, or unclear). The overall ROB assessment for a study is \"low, \" \"high, \" or \"unclear, \" based on each domain's ROB classification. The first three domains with review questions are also used for applicability judgment (low, high, or unclear concern). This paper used the PROBAST to assess the ROB and applicability of included studies. Two authors (SQ, X and CH, L) independently assessed eligible studies, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion."

I 2 was used to describe the percentage of the variability in effect estimates due to heterogeneity.\n\nA small sample size causes the risk of overfitting, which may lead to poor generalization of prediction models. Subgroup analysis was stratified by sample size (< 10000 participants/ > 10000 participants). In addition, we performed a subgroup analysis of ML methods (LR, boosting, and RF), age groups (children only, children and adults, and adults only), and different outcome definitions. Univariate and multivariate random-effects metaregression for sample size, ML methods, age groups, outcome definitions, and publication year was performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. For clarity, we referred to factors used for model development as \"predictors\" and the factors used for meta-regression at study level as \"variables\". Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the result by excluding each study. Deeks' funnel plot was applied to test publication bias. We conducted all our analyses using Stata software (version 15.0). We used the MADIS module for pooling performance measures and the \"metareg\" macro for conducting the meta-regression analysis.

The overall bias of all studies was rated as high risk. For participants, eight studies were at high ROB mainly due to retrospective design and asthma definition that was based on asthmarelated medicine use and doctors' diagnosis. The bias of predictors mainly results from subjective predictors (such as self-report symptoms), auxiliary examinations from different medical institutions, and comorbidities. These factors were difficult to be defined consistently. The definition of asthma exacerbations given by the ATS/ ERS statement is widely accepted  [12] . Studies in which the outcome was not in accordance with ATS/ERS statement were rated as high risk of bias. All studies had a high risk of bias in the \"analysis\" domain.\n\nFor applicability assessment, one study was judged as low concerns, and the remains were rated as high concerns.

Six studies were assessed as having high concerns in the \"predictors\" domain. The applicability would reduce when predictors were challenging to be defined similarly. As for the outcome, studies (10/11) would receive a rating of high concern if they did not focus on moderate to severe asthma exacerbations defined by the ATS/ERS statement."

AUROC was reported in 21 models, the best prediction performance of asthma exacerbations ranged from Fig.  5  The overall pooled AUROC of machine learning prediction models stratified by logistic regression (a), boosting (b), and random forest (c) methods 0.59 to 0.90. The specificity and sensitivity based on different cut-off points were reported in all included studies, with the range of 0.54-0.93 and 0.25-0.88, respectively. Negative predictive value (n = 4), positive predictive value (n = 4), and accuracy (n = 4) of prediction models in several studies were also reported (Table  1 ). We included 11 studies (23 models) with sufficient data and pooled performance measures of these studies in a random effects meta-analysis (see Additional file 7). The pooled AUROC for predicting asthma exacerbations was 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.83), indicating a good discrimination ability (Fig.  3 ). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.61 (95% CI 0.53-0.69, I 2 = 98.71, P < 0.01) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.77-0.86, I 2 = 99.95, P < 0.01), respectively (Fig.  4 ). Other values were as follows: PLR 3.33 (95% CI 2.73-4.07, I 2 = 99.58, P < 0.01), NLR 0.47 (95% CI 0.39-0.57, I 2 = 98.89, P < 0.01), and DOR 7.02 (95% CI 5.20-9.47, I 2 = 100.00, P < 0.01) (see Additional file 8).\n\nWe also performed subgroup analysis stratified by ML methods, sample size, age group, and outcome definitions. As shown in Table  2 , the overall pooled AUROC of boosting-based prediction models (0.84) was the highest, followed by studies using LR (0.77) and RF (0.75) (Table  2 , Fig.  5 ). DOR, another measure of overall diagnostic ability, was also highest in studies applying boosting method (11.86). In studies with a large sample size (> 10000), the pooled AUROC and DOR were relatively high, with the number of 0.82 and 8.62, respectively (Table  2 , Fig.  6 ). We classified outcome events as either emergency department visit/hospitalization (ED/HP) or in accordance with ATS/ERS statement (AE) definitions and performed subgroup analysis. The pooled AUROC in the two groups were similar, and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 7.58 for the ED/HP group and 6.01 for the AE group (Table  2 , Fig.  7 ). Studies involving participants with children and adults had the highest pooled AUROC (0.88) and DOR (9.49) (Table  2 , Fig.  8 ). Forest plots were shown in Additional file 9.\n\nWe perform the meta-regression analysis of the logit transformation of DOR due to the high level of heterogeneity. Univariate meta-regression analysis indicated that sample size and publication year contributed to the prediction power. However, only the coefficient of outcome definitions reached statistical significance in the multivariate model (Table  3 ). We included the outcome variable in the meta-regression analysis. The adjusted R-squared improved from 18.72% to 39.61%, and the Tau2 decreased from 0.4198 to 0.3118, indicating that the outcome variable could explain 25.7% heterogeneity."

      "text": "This study systematically reviewed the ML-based prediction models for asthma exacerbations, which have not been discussed before. Eleven studies generated 23 ML prediction models, which were various in study design, data source, participants, outcome definitions, and ML algorithms. 6/11 studies were published in the recent three years, indicating a popular trend in applying ML algorithms in asthma. The overall pooled AUROC (0.8, 95% CI 0.76-0.83) and DOR (7.02, 95% CI 5.20-9.47) indicated that ML-based prediction models for asthma exacerbation could achieve good discrimination. ML prediction models could forecast patients at high risk of exacerbation from several days to years, helping identify patients needing closer management.\n\nLR, boosting, and RF are the top three popular algorithms for asthma exacerbation prediction. According to the subgroup analysis, boosting-based prediction models had the highest pooled AUROC with a pooled AUROC of 0.84(95% CI 0.81-0.87), and the confidence interval of pooled AUROC was non-overlap with LR (0.77, 95% CI 0.73-0.81) and RF (0.75, 95% CI 0.71-0.78). Bridge et al.  [8]  conducted a systemic review and found that LR had a higher pooled c-statistic than optimal action points and CART in predicting asthma exacerbations. However, the authors did not include other ML methods. In this article, we found that boosting could also achieve good performance. It was potentially an alternative method in asthma exacerbation prediction, and more candidate models developed by ML should be tested.\n\nThe sample size is crucial for model performance. Compared with robust techniques like LR and CART, modern ML methods need higher times of events per variable to achieve stable performance  [25] . Our subgroup analysis also showed that compared with prediction models with a smaller sample size (< 10000 participants), models developed in a big sample size (> 10000 participants) showed relatively high pooled AUROC (0.82, 95% CI 0.78-0.85 vs. 0.68, 95% CI  0.64-0.72) in the test dataset. This suggests that ML methods would be preferable for prediction models only if a large dataset is available  [25] .\n\nAs for predictors, the most important features were systemic steroids, short-acting beta2-agonists, age, ED visit, asthma diagnosis number, exacerbation history, race, BMI, duration, blood eosinophils, and smoking. Most of these factors were consistent with the risk factor identified in GINA ( https:// ginas thma. org/ wp-conte nt/  uploa ds/ 2021/ 04/ GINA-2021-Main-Report_ FINAL_ 21_  04_ 28-WMS. pdf  ) and previous studies  [26, 27] . Other biomarkers, such as volatile organic compounds and single nucleotide polymorphisms were also used as input features to predict asthma exacerbations  [19, 20] . However, these studies were performed with a small sample size of participants resulting in a high risk of overfitting. In addition, these factors require advanced equipment, limiting application in practice. Socioeconomic factors were included in only three studies but were identified as insignificant. Environmental factors, such as air pollutants, are also crucial for asthma exacerbation  [28] . However, none of these studies focus on environmental factors."

Firstly, we described included studies in detail and used logical methodology, which could provide a clear understanding of ML models in asthma exacerbation prediction. Additionally, the number of models allows us to conduct a meta-analysis of performance measures and compare different ML algorithms.\n\nDespite the excellent prediction power of ML-based models confirmed in this study, several limitations are also identified. The main limitation was heterogeneity within studies. The difference in sample sizes, participants, feature selection, and prediction windows might affect the prediction ability of each model. Thus, the results analyzed in this study should be applied prudently. In addition, we did not include papers published in non-English, and we might not include all ML-based prediction models in the field of asthma exacerbations."

Although many models were developed, few of them were applied in practice. Therefore, improving the generalizability of prediction models in large separate datasets is crucial. Practicability is another critical factor. Simple models with a few predictors and using predictors that are easy to access could improve prediction models' practicability. Moreover, bundling ML algorithms to software or system would benefit in translating research into practice applications. Besides, randomized control studies are warranted to evaluate whether these models could benefit asthmatic patients by preventing asthma exacerbations."
