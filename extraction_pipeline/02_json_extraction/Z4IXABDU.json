  "title": "Conversational Agents in Health Care: Scoping Review of Their Behavior Change Techniques and Underpinning Theory",
  "abstract": "Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used in health care to deliver behavior change interventions. Their evaluation often includes categorizing the behavior change techniques (BCTs) using a classification system of which the BCT Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) is one of the most common. Previous studies have presented descriptive summaries of behavior change interventions delivered by CAs, but no in-depth study reporting the use of BCTs in these interventions has been published to date. Objective: This review aims to describe behavior change interventions delivered by CAs and to identify the BCTs and theories guiding their design. \n Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the first 10 pages of Google and Google Scholar in April 2021. We included primary, experimental studies evaluating a behavior change intervention delivered by a CA. BCTs coding followed the BCTTv1. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data. Descriptive analysis and frequent itemset mining to identify BCT clusters were performed. \n Results: We included 47 studies reporting on mental health (n=19, 40%), chronic disorders (n=14, 30%), and lifestyle change (n=14, 30%) interventions. There were 20/47 embodied CAs (43%) and 27/47 CAs (57%) represented a female character. Most CAs were rule based (34/47, 72%). Experimental interventions included 63 BCTs, (mean 9 BCTs; range 2-21 BCTs), while comparisons included 32 BCTs (mean 2 BCTs; range 2-17 BCTs). Most interventions included BCTs 4.1 \"Instruction on how to perform a behavior\" (34/47, 72%), 3.3 \"Social support\" (emotional; 27/47, 57%), and 1.2 \"Problem solving\" (24/47, 51%). A",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Conversational agents (CAs), or chatbots, are computer programs that simulate conversations with humans  [1] . Although the first CAs were developed in the mid-1960s, it was not until the early 2000s that their availability and popularity markedly increased  [2] . CAs can be used to automate a variety of tasks, such as the provision of news or weather forecasts and the facilitation of web-based shopping  [3] . CAs may be deployed as stand-alone apps or websites, integrated into multifunctional apps, or included in messaging apps such as Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and Slack  [2] . They may use text or voice-assisted interfaces or may include an embodied agent using virtual characters to simulate both verbal and nonverbal aspects of human communication  [4] . CAs can be further classified as simple rule-based agents or smart, artificial intelligence (AI)-based agents using natural language processing or machine learning to generate the responses  [2] .\n\nFollowing the trends in other industries, health care has seen increasing adoption of CAs in recent years  [1] . Health care CAs are versatile tools able to cater to several health needs, such as providing timely information  [5] , supporting mental health disorder management  [6, 7] , assisting with triage in clinical settings  [8, 9] , supporting chronic disease self-management, or delivering lifestyle change interventions, such as physical activity  [10]  and dietary changes, that increasingly incorporate elements of behavior change in the intervention design. In general, health care CAs appear to be effective in improving individuals' outcomes  [11, 12]  and are acceptable to users, who often describe them as friendly and trustworthy.\n\nIncreasingly, health care CAs are used to deliver behavior change interventions, defined as complex interventions, comprising an interplay of 1 or several heterogeneous behavior change techniques (BCTs)  [13] . BCTs are \"observable and replicable components designed to change behavior\"  [13] . BCTs are considered the smallest active ingredient in an intervention, and can be used alone or in combination with other BCTs  [13] . Adequate categorization of the BCTs included in an intervention allows for more efficient coding, leading to easier replication when designing similar interventions  [13] . Several methods to classify BCTs have been developed, of which the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1)  [14]  is the most established and commonly used.\n\nSeveral reviews have synthesized the evidence about behavior change interventions delivered by digital health tools and CAs, such as a systematic review reporting on the use of BCTs in effective digital diabetes prevention interventions  [15] , a mapping review offering a description of the current uses of CAs for behavior change  [16] , and a scoping review describing the use of embodied CAs to support healthy lifestyle  [17] . These reviews presented descriptive data, without an in-depth analysis of the type of BCTs used in the interventions, the use of behavior change theories to guide the interventions, the frequency with which each BCT was used, and potential associations between BCTs and intervention effectiveness."

Eligible study designs were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-randomized trials, controlled before-and-after studies, uncontrolled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series, and pilot and feasibility studies. We excluded nonexperimental study designs, such as observational studies, qualitative studies, opinion pieces, editorials, conference abstracts, and secondary studies.\n\nWe included studies on text-based, voice-based, and embodied CAs, defined as conversational interfaces featuring a human-like avatar able to mimic the verbal and nonverbal components of a face-to-face conversation  [24] . The eligible studies reported any health care intervention focused on behavior change to improve or promote a healthy lifestyle, or to support the management of physical or mental health conditions. Lastly, behavior change was an essential aspect of the eligible studies, with or without reference to an associated behavior change theory, in line with previous research in this area  [25] . The BCTs were coded according to the BCTTv1  [14] . The taxonomy consists of 93 BCTs grouped into 16 distinct categories, aimed at providing a cross-domain template to facilitate research and intervention replication."

Studies included in the first round of screening were uploaded to EndNote X9 (Clarivate), and the full-text papers were retrieved and screened for eligibility by 3 researchers working independently (AIJ, NYWL, and WWTG). Discrepancies in any screening stage were resolved through discussions between the reviewers, or by engaging a fourth reviewer (LM).

Reviewers worked in pairs (AIJ worked with LM and NYWL worked with WWTG) to extract data from 10 papers (20%) and individually for the remaining 42 papers (80%). Data extracted by all reviewers were subsequently reexamined by 2 researchers (LM and AIJ). Reviewers met regularly during this process to ensure a common understanding of the data extraction process and the concordance of the extracted data. The data extracted by each pair of reviewers were compared, and any disagreements were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer, acting as an arbiter.\n\nThe data extraction form contained the following items: first author, year of publication, title of the article, study design, target disorder, description of the behavior change intervention, CA name, delivery channel, dialog technique, input and output modalities, end goal of the intervention, use of behavior change theories or frameworks, and BCTs mapped according to the BCTTv1  [14] ."

FIM aims to find patterns or associations in a group of items (itemset) by sorting the items that frequently appear together in the data set. The analysis starts by calculating support (how frequently an item appears in the data set) and confidence (number of times individual items \"x\" and \"y\" appear together in the data set) thresholds and discarding any itemset with support or confidence values below the predetermined minimum threshold.\n\nFor this analysis, we assessed the 10 most frequently appearing patterns, for the overall data set and for each clinical domain. For the overall data set, the minimum threshold for algorithm support and confidence was set at 0.10 and 0.90, respectively, or itemset appearing in at least 10% of the data set (\u22654 studies) and appearing together at least 90% of the time. For each clinical domain, the minimum thresholds were 0.20 for support and 0.90 for confidence to account for the fewer number of studies in each sub data set  [31] ."

In 7/13 studies (54%) comparison interventions consisted of face-to-face versions of the intervention  [74] [75] [76] , abridged interventions that excluded the CA  [11, 64, 65, 70] , or a similar version of the intervention with differing reward systems  [77, 79] . Other comparisons included information-only interventions (3/13, 23%), treatment as usual (1/13, 8%), or waitlists (2/13, 15%).

Four CAs (Carmen  [74] [75] [76] , Tanya  [52, 53, 68] , Tess  [37, 62] , and Todaki  [41, 43] ) were reported in 2 papers each, and 2 CAs (Gabby  [70] [71] [72] [73]  and MYLO  [34, 38, 39] ) were reported in 3 manuscripts. Three CAs were adapted for different target disorders. Embodied CA Tanya was used as an educational tool for patients with atrial fibrillation  [52, 53]  and to offer breastfeeding support  [68] , CA Tess was used for mental health  [37]  and diabetes care  [62] , and Todaki was used to deliver CBT for panic disorder  [41]  and to manage adults with attention deficit disorder  [43] . Finally, MYLO was used in student and older adult  [38]  populations by 2 distinct research groups.\n\nThe majority of CAs featured 1 or more anthropomorphic characteristics, such as the assignation of gender, name, or a human-like display. Most CAs (41/47, 87%) responded to a name, 27/47 CAs (57%) were presented as female agents, and 20/47 (43%) were embodied CAs. Most CAs used rule-based algorithms to design the flow of conversations, either by themselves (35/47, 75%) or complemented with AI (2/47, 4%). CAs were more often available through a smartphone app (14/47, 30%) or web page (13/47, 28%). In all but 3 CAs (44/47, 94%), the primary method for users' inputs was text; 7/47 of these CAs (15%) also accepted verbal or visual inputs, whereas 3/47 CAs (6%) received only verbal inputs. Almost 80% of all CAs (36/47, 77%) displayed a \"coach-like\" personality, characterized by an encouraging, motivating, and nurturing conversational style. [34, 38, 39] , communication  [57, 58] , learning  [59] , or psychological domains  [33]  (Table  3 ).\n\nThe use of theories aimed to guide the design of the intervention or to monitor participants' stages of change as they progressed through the intervention, as exemplified by 3 studies  [71] [72] [73] 78]  using the Transtheoretical Model and 1 study using the Health Action Process Approach  [54] . It was not clear how the use of theories influenced the intervention design or the choice of BCTs. For example, 4 studies using the Transtheoretical Model included a wide variety of BCTs, ranging from 3  [78]  to 10 [72,73]. Similarly, 4 studies [51,65,74-76] using the Transtheoretical Model and the Social Cognitive Theory incorporated between 6 [51] and 19 [75,76] BCTs."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "This scoping review included 47 studies reporting behavior change interventions delivered by CAs, targeting chronic disorders, lifestyle change, and mental health. The interventions included a total of 63 BCTs, but only 24 were consistently found in 5 or more interventions. The BCTs represented aspects of health education (BCT 4.1), self-management (BCTs 1.1, 1.2, and 2.3), and social support (BCT 3.3). Several behavior change theories informed the intervention design in 12/47 (26%) studies of the included studies. However, studies informed by the same theory employed different sets of BCTs. Our findings align with previous systematic reviews reporting that similar BCTs were frequently incorporated into effective lifestyle change interventions  [82] , or into digitally delivered interventions  [15] .\n\nWe did not find a relationship between the use of theories, the type of theory used, and the number and type of BCTs included in the interventions. Furthermore, a small number of studies  [11, 61]  guided the intervention design, using modified BCT taxonomies that addressed smoking cessation  [11]  and diet modification  [61] . These data suggest that the choice of BCTs may be primarily determined by the target behavior rather than the use of a behavior change theory. The impact of using a behavior change theory is nevertheless unclear. A 2010 systematic review  [83]  reported that the use of a behavior change theory was associated with increased effectiveness of the interventions, although just over 20% of studies included a theory. Conversely, a systematic review by Van Rhoon et al  [15]  reported the use of theories in 16/21 (76%) studies but did not assess intervention effectiveness. In addition, a recent overview of systematic reviews  [84]  reported the use of theories in the intervention design of 19%-52% of the included studies, although there was no clear association with the intervention effectiveness.\n\nThe categorization of studies in 3 distinct clinical domains suggested different prioritizations in mental health, lifestyle change, and chronic disorders, although the delivery of health education, evidenced by the frequent occurrence of BCTs 4.1 \"Instruction on how to perform a behavior,\" 8.1 \"Behavioral practice/rehearsal,\" and 8.3 \"Habit formation,\" was consistent across all clinical domains. Mental health interventions frequently included BCTs 3.3 \"Social support (emotional)\" and 11.2 \"Reduce negative emotions.\" Specifically, BCT 3.3 may be associated with the use of psychotherapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy or motivational interviewing, while the inclusion of BCT 11.2 suggests the use of relaxation techniques and mindfulness to support stress management and emotional regulation. Therefore, behavior change in mental health settings appeared to be closely interlinked with the therapeutic strategies. Concurrently, the inclusion of other BCTs, such as instructions to perform a behavior (BCT 4.1), goal setting (BCT 1.1) and reviews (BCT 1.5), problem solving (BCT 1.2), and feedback (BCT 2.2), may be aligned with general principles of patient participation in decision making  [85] , as well as highlight the importance of health education  [86, 87] , particularly relevant in self-initiated digital interventions.\n\nLifestyle change interventions frequently included problem-solving (BCT 1.2) techniques to help users better understand their barriers to behavior change, and goal setting (BCT 1.1) and self-monitoring (BCT 2.3) to work toward the target behavior. These BCTs were often included together and this may suggest a synergistic relationship. At the same time, the importance of ensuring adequate health literacy to improve population outcomes was emphasized by the frequent inclusion of BCT 4.1 \"Instruction on how to perform a behavior.\" Chronic disorder management interventions favored not only the inclusion of instructional BCTs, such as guidance to perform a target behavior (BCT 4.1) but also reminders (BCT 7.1 \"Prompts/cues\") to facilitate the acquisition of new routines (BCT 8.3 \"Behavioral practice/rehearsal\"). Self-management of chronic illnesses is essential to ensure improved patient outcomes and adequate quality of life but requires that individuals engage in a steep learning curve as they adapt to living with a long-term condition and develop new habits.\n\nIn general, the relationship between the number and type of BCTs and the effectiveness of the interventions was inconsistent and appeared to be determined by the clinical domain.\n\nEffective lifestyle change interventions tended to include a higher number of BCTs, a finding that was not replicated in the other clinical domains. At the same time, lifestyle change interventions were comparatively more effective than those in other clinical domains, particularly chronic disorders. Effective interventions in the lifestyle change and mental health domains frequently included BCTs related to goal setting and planning, timely provision of feedback, health education, and rewards on completed tasks. Previous studies reported varied results. A 2017 systematic review of 48 studies [82] evaluating the management of overweight and obesity in adults found small pooled effect sizes for short-and long-term diet and physical activity interventions. Effective interventions included a larger number of BCTs, particularly BCTs encouraging goal setting and self-monitoring of behavior. Similarly, a systematic review on the BCTs and technical features of digital interventions for the prevention of type 2 diabetes [15] found that effective interventions included a larger number of BCTs or BCTs related to social support, goal setting, and feedback. There was an unexpected relationship between the CA types and the clinical domain, manifested by a predominance of embodied CAs in lifestyle change interventions, and the use of nonhuman or nonavatar CAs in mental health interventions. The reasons for these findings are unclear and beyond the scope of this review; however, further research may help clarify the role of avatars, or virtual humans, if any, in delivering behavior change interventions. Other reviews have reported the use of embodied CAs to support mental health interventions, particularly autism  [20, 24] , but methodological differences limit the comparisons with our findings. Provoost et al's scoping review  [4]  used a broader definition of embodied CA, while a systematic review by Laranjo et al  [87]  included only AI-based CAs."

      "text": "This scoping review has several strengths. First, we used a comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed and gray literature that prioritized the sensitivity of the search terms to capture a broad range of publications reporting the use of CAs in health care. However, relevant studies may have been omitted. Second, we included studies reporting on a wide variety of physical and mental health conditions, and categorized the studies into 3 distinct clinical domains, revealing differences in the type of BCTs selected in each domain.\n\nThere are also some limitations. First, many studies did not provide exact BCT codes when describing the interventions, therefore categorization of BCTs was inferred from the paper's description by the research team, based on thorough analysis, rigorous team discussion, and reviews to establish consensus. Second, given the descriptive nature of scoping reviews, we were unable to explore in more depth the relationship between the choice of BCTs and the effectiveness of the intervention, or the type of CA used to deliver the intervention."

      "text": "This review has highlighted several areas that warrant further research. First, reporting guidelines to ensure accurate reporting of the BCTs included in behavior change interventions according to standardized taxonomies, such as the BCTTv1  [14] , should be implemented. Such guidelines would facilitate reproducibility of research, assessment of active intervention components, and evidence synthesis. Second, further research is needed to increase our understanding of the impact of behavior change theories in the design of interventions, the choice of BCTs, and the effectiveness of the intervention. Third, the impact of CAs to deliver behavior change interventions should be further explored, particularly the influence of a conversational interface on engagement, adherence, and effectiveness of the intervention when compared with less interactive digital technologies. Furthermore, comparisons between rule-based CAs and those incorporating machine learning or natural language processing should be further investigated. Fourth, the possible role of the type of CA in delivering behavior change interventions, as suggested in our findings, should be further explored. Fifth, the relationship between the ideal combination of BCTs required to design effective interventions may be evaluated using data mining techniques such as FIM or multiple correspondent analysis. Lastly, the relationship between behavior change interventions and mental health requires further evaluation."
