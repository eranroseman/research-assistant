  "title": "Systematic review exploring human, AI, and hybrid health coaching in digital health interventions: trends, engagement, and lifestyle outcomes",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) have been identified as a solution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG3) for health promotion and prevention. However, DHIs face criticism for shallow and transactional engagement and retention challenges. Integrating DHIs with health coaching represents a promising solution that might address these issues by combining the scalable and accessible nature of DHIs with the meaningful and engaging nature of health coaching. This systematic review aims to synthesise existing peer-reviewed research on coach-facilitated DHIs to understand how digital health coaching is being used in DHIs and the impact it has on engagement and lifestyle outcomes. Methods: Studies examining DHIs with a coaching component addressing lifestyle outcomes were included. A search of APA PsychINFO, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed from inception to February 2025. Three authors conducted the study selection, quality appraisal using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and data extraction. Data extraction captured study characteristics, coaching features, participant engagement, and lifestyle outcomes. Results: Thirty-five studies were identified and synthesised using a narrative synthesis approach. This review highlights three coaching modalities in DHIs: digital human coaching, Artificial Intelligence (AI) coaching, and hybrid (human-AI) coaching. All coaching modalities demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. Discussion: While both human and AI coaching have shown a positive impact on both engagement and lifestyle outcomes, hybrid approaches need further refinement to harness AI's scalability and the depth of human coaching. However, the variability of engagement metrics and coaching protocols limited study comparability. Standardising how engagement and coaching delivery are measured and contextualised is crucial for advancing evidencebased digital health coaching.",

      "text": "The United Nations (UN) has developed a universal agenda for sustainable development, with the overarching vision for all human beings to thrive and to reach their full potential in dignity and equality in a healthy environment (1). The third goal (SDG3) of this agenda is to \"ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages\" (1). Under this goal, the UN emphasised reducing noncommunicable disease (NCD)-related mortality rates by onethird through prevention and treatment and promoting mental health and wellbeing (1). Digital health has been identified as a feasible, accessible and affordable solution to the UN goals of preventing NCDs and promoting health and wellbeing  (2) . Digital health is a complex and multifaceted field of both knowledge and practice, focused on the development and use of various technologies (i.e., smart watches, digital tracking tools, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning) for improving health  (2) (3) (4) . There has been substantial growth in the field of digital health research, especially in terms of evidencebased digital health interventions (DHIs)  (5) .\n\nDHIs create new opportunities for medical doctors, health professionals and other caregivers to scale and tailor health and lifestyle interventions at a lower cost  (5) . DHIs are particularly effective for promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours like healthy eating, physical activity, stress reduction and psychological wellbeing  (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . These behaviours, in turn, can promote healthier living and aid in the prevention and management of lifestylerelated NCDs such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain cancers and chronic respiratory diseases  (4, 5, (11) (12) (13) . However, challenges exist in DHI implementation, particularly with selfguided or automated interventions. Despite their low cost and scalability, these interventions are often perceived as shallow, impersonal, and transactional, with participants preferring human support for more meaningful engagement  (4, (14) (15) (16) (17) . Retention and engagement also pose significant issues, with a pooled estimated dropout rate of 43% across DHIs  (18) (19) (20) .\n\nIntegrating health coaching with DHIs may offer a solution to the limitation of passive or automated interventions by providing live and engaging support to participants. Health coaching is a non-clinical, evidence-based health promotion intervention that promotes sustainable health behaviours and improves lifestyle outcomes through personalised, solution-focused, person-centred support. By tailoring interventions to individual needs and fostering a collaborative relationship, health coaching empowers clients to make informed decisions about their health and facilitates behaviour change  (21) (22) (23) . Health coaching is already recognised as a valuable asset to healthcare systems. Specifically, for the health promotion and prevention of NCDs  (24, 25) . As such, health coach-facilitated DHIs could create meaningful yet scalable and accessible digital health solutions for health promotion and NCD prevention  (26) (27) (28) .\n\nThis integration paves the way for a new field of research relating to digital health coaching. There has already been a substantial surge of professional coaches transitioning to digital spaces, with 93.3% of coaches globally transitioning to online coaching  (29) . In the digital space, health coaching is mediated through technology, where coaches interact with coachees via digital platforms to guide behaviour change  (30) . This allows coaches and clients to interact regardless of geographical location and through different modalities (i.e., through text, video call or phone call)  (31) . While the conversation between coaches and clients remains central to digital health coaching, it can be supported by a variety of technologies, including digital tracking tools (i.e., smart watches, glucose monitors), self-guided educational modules, habit tracking and automated reminders. Additionally, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have spurred research into conversational agent coaching or chatbot coaches as flexible, accessible and cost-efficient alternatives to human-facilitated digital health coaching  (32, 33) . Chatbots are AI-driven programmes designed to interact with individuals using natural language that mimics human dialogue through algorithm-generated responses  (34) . However, the active engagement between the coach (AI or human) and coachee through personalised and real-time interaction is central to digital health coaching.\n\nWhile there has been increasing interest in the integration of coaching within DHIs, a clear gap remains in understanding the impact of different coaching modalities (e.g., human, AI, and hybrid) on participant engagement and health outcomes. Although some studies have investigated coach-facilitated DHIs, comprehensive analyses and synthesis regarding the effectiveness of these modalities, particularly their role in enhancing lifestyle behaviours and preventing NCDs, are limited. This systematic review aims to synthesise existing research on coach-facilitated DHIs to understand how digital health coaching is being used in DHIs and the impact it has on lifestyle outcomes and engagement. Ultimately, this review seeks to provide evidence to inform the development of future digital health interventions and research."

      "title": "2.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria",
      "text": "The PICO framework guided the definition of eligibility for this review (Table  1 ). However, in this review, the traditional \"Comparator\" element in PICO was replaced with \"Context\", as this review focuses on the integration of coaching within DHIs without the need for a direct comparator. This review seeks to gather evidence of coach-facilitated DHIs implemented to increase the health and wellbeing of populations. While this largely falls into preventative interventions to help reduce the risk of NCDs, substantial studies are using coachfacilitated DHIs to help increase the health and wellbeing of cohorts living with NCDs (predominantly cancers and diabetes). It would be remiss to exclude these cohorts because of their disease status, despite the intervention aligning with inclusion criteria. As a result, we included adults living with NCDs once the primary outcomes were focused on lifestyle outcomes and not clinical or medical outcomes or markers (i.e., HbA1c, Cholesterol, BMI, weight reduction or waist circumference). This review concentrated on the adult population (18 years and older). As such, studies involving adolescents or children were excluded.\n\nPeer-reviewed studies were considered if they explored digital coaching in DHIs and addressed at least one of the lifestyle medicine pillars: sleep, physical activity, psychological wellbeing and stress management, substance use, or healthy eating. Studies were excluded if they focused on medical interventions or used coaching as a part of medical or mental health treatments (i.e., coaching for patient education, trust building for treatments, pain management, medication adherence) that were not directly aimed at increasing lifestyle or wellbeing outcomes. Similarly, studies with clinical primary outcomes or biological markers as the primary outcome were excluded.\n\nStudies that incorporated human, AI or hybrid (AI and human) coaching components alongside DHIs were included. For the inclusion criteria, digital health coaching was defined as a coachcoachee partnership facilitated online with the purpose of providing tailored support to enhance the DHI and promote behaviour change and health outcomes among participants. The coaching component of the DHI must align with this definition, meaning that coaching through ad hoc non-interactive messages or notifications was excluded. Studies that explored in-person or faceto-face interventions only, as well as career, executive or athletic coaching, were excluded. Finally, all peer-reviewed studies from any country were included, and no publication date limit was applied, given the limited literature on coaching, especially digital coaching. Studies that were not available in English were excluded."

Studies included in this review were first grouped by coaching modality (i.e., human, AI, or hybrid coaching) and then further categorised by targeted lifestyle outcomes (physical activity, psychological wellbeing, stress management, healthy eating, sleep, and substance use) and engagement outcomes. We evaluated the consistency of the findings across studies to assess the certainty of evidence. Missing or inconsistent data that was not a criterion for inclusion (i.e., engagement statistics, coaching theories, and length of intervention) was noted during synthesis and presented in the results. Studies were not excluded based on these missing data, but it was considered as a limitation during synthesis. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to significant variations in sample populations, outcome measures, and study designs across the included studies."

Eighteen of the included studies (51%) employed human coaching as a part of their interventions  (27, 39-43, 45-47, 50, 53, 54, 57, 58, 61, 62, 64, 68) . Coaching was often enhanced with digital tracking tools (e.g., smart scales, watches, accelerometers, and breath sensors)  (41-43, 46, 53, 57, 58, 62, 64)  and educational resources or modules  (27, 39-41, 47, 50, 54, 58, 61, 62, 68) . One study used a telepresence robot controlled remotely by practitioners to facilitate communication with participants  (45) . A consistent finding emerged from these studies: the human coach played a crucial role in engaging participants and enhancing motivation, adherence, behaviour change, and personalisation  (39, 46, 58, 61, 62) . However, the intensity of human coaching delivered varied. In most cases (67%), the coach was central to the intervention, interacting regularly with participants. In contrast, six studies assigned coaches a more supportive role, primarily supplementing educational modules, training, and activity monitors  (27, 39, 40, 46, 54, 58) . In these instances, participants primarily engaged with the digital components and the coaches provided additional support to reinforce engagement and adherence, focusing only on issues related to the main intervention  (27, 39, 40, 46, 54, 58) ."

The development of conversational agents and chatbots in these studies was primarily based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models  (17, 49, 51, 56)  or rule-based approaches, including decision-tree algorithms  (38, 51) . Most AI coaching interventions were delivered remotely through a digital platform, available 24/7  (38, 45, 48, 49, 51, 52, 55, 56, 60, 65, 66, 69) . However, one study used on-site AI coaching in a controlled environment  (17) . Eleven studies mimicked human coaching sessions through quick text-based sessions with the AI chatbot. One chatbot, however, was primarily voice-based, with text-based options for certain activities. This chatbot could interpret speech and synthesise voices to respond to participants  (17) . Three studies provided unlimited access to the AI chatbots, enabling ad hoc questions, as well as guidance, monitoring and feedback outside of structured coaching sessions  (56, 65, 66) . Unlike human coaches, AI coaches were central to all DHIs. Given the artificial nature of the coaching design, no coaching qualifications or accreditations were reported in AI coaching studies."

Three studies investigated the impact of combining human coaching (delivered via video or text) with automated personalisation, support, advice, and motivation delivered by in-app messages, nudges or knowledge pills (short tips or pieces of advice)  (37, 44, 59) . The AI in these studies typically performed administrative tasks such as (a) sending personalised interventions and educational content  (44, 59, 63) , (b) monitoring activities, progress, engagement and adherence  (37, 63) , (c) sending motivational messages or nudges  (37, 63) , and (d) administering questionnaires  (59) . While two studies used AI and human coaching in parallel, the third study employed a \"human-in-theloop\" approach for delivering hybrid coaching, where the human coach monitored, modified, and validated the AI coach's recommendations  (59) . The fourth study combined human coaching with a digital coach (similar to AI-powered coaching). The digital coach was an avatar that participants could interact with in-app through text-based prompts  (63) . This resulted in the AI-powered coach taking on more interactive and meaningful tasks like goal-setting with participants (63)."

Stress management was examined in nine studies and was closely associated with psychological wellbeing, with many studies addressing both constructs together.

Studies examining human coaching reported mixed findings regarding its impact on physical activity. Several studies found improvements in physical activity measured through changes in METs  (41, 47)  and moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) minutes  (42, 43) . However, other studies showed no meaningful changes or a decline in physical activity  (45, 46, 64) . Some studies also found that human-coachfacilitated DHIs promoted shifts in participants' awareness, motivation, and readiness to change, leading to active change in physical activity  (46, 47) , along with an increase in purposeful movement, like taking the stairs or walking instead of driving  (54) .\n\nAI coaching generally showed consistent positive effects on physical activity. Studies reported improvements in physical activity measures, including METs  (48) , step count  (66) , active minutes  (56, 66) , MVPA minutes, and reduced sitting time  (51) . AI coaching was also associated with improved adherence and increased motivation  (56) . All four hybrid studies investigated the impact of this approach on physical activity, reporting variable results. Two studies found significant to moderate improvements in physical activity through active minutes  (44, 63) . However, a third study found decreased active minutes and steps among both intervention and control groups  (37) . The fourth study did not assess changes in physical activity from baseline but did report high rates of adherence and goal completion (i.e., achieving step targets and weekly active minute goals) (59)."

Other aspects of psychological wellbeing, such as worry, emotional control, mindfulness, personal growth, and life satisfaction, were also assessed to a lesser extent  (17, 27, 47, 52, 55) . Human coaching interventions were associated with reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms  (27, 40, 45, 62) , along with reduced worry  (40)  and increased emotional selfefficacy and emotional control  (47, 62) . However, this was not reflected in one study among coached and non-coached groups  (50)  and another which aimed to improve health and wellbeing but did not use scales to assess wellbeing changes  (53) . AI coaching generally reported positive improvements in psychological wellbeing, including reductions in depressive symptoms  (49, 60, 67)  and anxiety  (49, 52, 60) , as well as improvement in general psychological wellbeing  (69) . AI coaching interventions also improved other wellbeing constructs like mindfulness  (52) , personal growth  (17, 55) , and life satisfaction  (55) . However, two AI-coaching interventions failed to report differences in psychological wellbeing  (65, 67) . Only one hybrid coaching study assessed psychological wellbeing  (63] .

They also described a sense of investment and warmth from their coach  (61) , even in text-based coaching   (64) . This allowed participants to feel comfortable, motivated, and honest about their progress  (61) . Participants perceived AI coaches as engaging and lifelike, often viewing their interactions as relational  (55, 60, 69) .

We identified three primary coaching models: human, AI, and hybrid (a combination of both human and AI coaches). Our findings suggest that both human-and AI-delivered coaching are generally perceived as acceptable and satisfactory components of DHIs, with trends indicating positive effects on health and wellbeing. Engagement and retention were generally high across all coaching models, with higher engagement linked to improvements in lifestyle outcomes. However, engagement and satisfaction were typically higher with human-delivered coaching. While working alliance was strong across all coaching models, participants reported a stronger sense of connection with human-delivered coaching, including within hybrid interventions.\n\nDespite advancements in digital health coaching, studies were predominantly exploratory, early-intervention studies, focusing on feasibility and acceptability of coach-facilitated DHIs. While individual studies reported significant findings, the lack of consistency in study designs and outcome measures prevented clear inferences about broader trends in lifestyle and engagement. Likewise, there was an imbalanced representation of human (n = 18), AI (n = 13), and hybrid (n = 4) coaching interventions. This disparity, along with inconsistencies in outcome measures, intervention designs and coaching characteristics, limited direct comparisons and the generalisability of our findings; therefore, caution is warranted when interpreting the results in this review."

      "title": "4.1. The role of coaching: delivery, standards, and trends",
      "text": "This review examined the integration of health coaching with DHIs, focusing on delivery methods, coaching roles, and standards for protocols and coach engagement (Table  5 ). Findings revealed a lack of consistency in reporting delivery methods, which contributed to ambiguity in the coaching protocols used. Only six studies provided comprehensive descriptions of all the extracted coaching characteristics that represent delivery  (17, 42, 52, 53, 58, 69) . The lack of transparency in coaching delivery methods made it difficult to determine the optimal frequency and intensity of coach-participant engagement for best outcomes. The total number of coaching sessions varied widely, ranging from 2 to 24, with a mean of 8.85 sessions per intervention (Table  5 ). Additionally, coaching sessions were most commonly conducted weekly  (17, 50, 53, 61)  and biweekly  (44, 52) , but no clear pattern emerged linking coaching frequency to delivery mode. Among long-term studies (ranging from 3 to 12 months), coaching was typically staggered, starting with weekly coaching sessions before transitioning to bi-weekly and monthly as the intervention progressed  (42, 54, 57) . Very few studies reported the qualifications of the coaches, making it difficult to determine who was delivering the coaching. Nonetheless, some trends emerged from the studies that did provide details on coaching delivery methods. Most studies indicated that both AI and human coaches played a central role in DHIs, though eight studies employed coaches in a supportive capacity  (27, 37, 39, 40, 44, 46, 54, 58) . In these cases, the role of the coach typically focused on supporting participants' technology use and enhancing usability through education around app features  (27, 37, 46) , reviewing and monitoring participant data  (46) , providing feedback to participants  (39, 40, 44) , adding accountability and promoting the implementation of skills gathered from the main intervention (i.e., educational modules and training)  (27, 44, 54, 58) .\n\nIn several studies, the role of the coach extended beyond the traditional role of facilitating health behaviour change and providing lifestyle support  (27, 37, 46) . Coaches were often tasked with providing technological and lifestyle support. The burden of supporting participants in navigating DHI technology has been recognised  (27, 37) . However, only one study provided a separate technology support channel for participants  (46) . In this instance, technology support was carried out by coaches via telephone calls but conducted outside of the coaching sessions. Moreover, communication predominantly occurred synchronously, with human coaches or conversational agents speaking in real time with participants. However, some studies supplemented this mode of interaction with asynchronous communication between coaching sessions (i.e., check-ins and ad hoc questions and feedback)  (27, 59, 63) ."

      "title": "4.1.2. Coaching standards",
      "text": "Professional and accredited coaches should play a central role in the development of digital health coaching interventions, whether by directly providing coaching or by informing the creation of coaching chatbots. This ensures that the high standards of practice paved by professional bodies like the International Coaching Federation (ICF), the European Mentoring and Coaching Council (EMCC) and the Association for Coaching (AC) are upheld in DHI research. In this review, we identified two key components for maintaining standards: (1) the qualifications and training of the coaches involved and (2) the evidence-based theories and models that inform coaching practices in DHIs. Only ten studies reported the qualifications or training of the human coaches involved in the interventions  (39-42, 45, 53, 54, 58, 62, 64) . These coaches were typically dietitians  (39, 41) , nutritional coaches  (54) , psychologists  (40, 64) , nurse practitioners  (45, 58) , and trained health coaches  (53) . Other studies mentioned that coaches received training from qualified professionals to deliver the intervention  (42, 62) . None of the hybrid coaching studies reported the qualifications or accreditation of the coaches working alongside AI.\n\nLikewise, coaching theories played a crucial role in underpinning DHIs across all coaching models. Cognitive behavioural therapy, behaviour change theories, and positive psychology were the most commonly used (Table  5 ). All AI coaching interventions presented theories that underpinned the development of their conversational agents. Although six studies using human coaches failed to report theories used, two of which were hybrid coaching interventions  (43, 47, 53, 54, 59, 63) . This suggests that coaching theories were not only vital for active coaching but also influenced the design of DHIs and AI chatbots. The use of validated, evidence-based theories in the development of chatbots demonstrates that studies are moving towards validated, evidence-based approaches for chatbot creation. However, it also underscores the need for standardised quality and ethical guidelines for AI coaching.\n\nThe Designing AI Coach (DAIC) framework developed by Terblanche (70) provides a structured approach for assessing AI standards in coaching. The framework emphasises adapting humanefficacy elements and theoretical models for specific and narrow coaching tasks (i.e., goal setting), in line with ethical codes of conduct from accrediting coaching bodies (i.e., ICF, EMCC, AC). In this review, we found that all AI coaching studies, either intentionally or unintentionally, followed the first two principles of the DAIC framework: adapting human-efficacy and incorporating theoretical models in chatbot development (Table  5 ). However, the third principle, ethical conduct (covering privacy, autonomy, liability, and bias), was only addressed in three studies  (49, 55, 65) . The fourth principle, using AI chatbots for narrow, specialised tasks, was met in all but two studies. Notably, Maher et al.  (56)  used AI for both nutritional and physical activity interventions. Likewise, Dhinagaran et al. (51) and Ollier et al. (60) extended their chatbot's role to cover a wide range of lifestyle areas. Dhinagaran et al. (51) included diet, exercise, sleep, and stress support, while Ollier et al. (60) focused on psychological well-being, healthy eating, physical activity, and sleep. The DAIC framework is a valuable framework for guiding the development of AI coaching chatbots. Further research and standardisation are essential to ensure that AI coaching aligns with ethical and professional standards. This is critical for ensuring highquality and safe AI interventions in digital health."

      "text": "Engagement and retention rates have traditionally been considered low for DHIs  (71) , suggesting that this is a common issue in digital health research. However, a recent review by Boucher and Raiker (72) argued that engagement rates are not inherently low but rather vary widely across studies. They also highlighted a high degree of variability in how engagement is defined and measured  (72) . Our findings align with those of Boucher and Raiker  (72) , revealing that engagement was inconsistently reported, causing limitations for comparisons across studies. Retention and completion rates were the most consistently reported metrics. These metrics inferred higher retention and completion rates for human coaching interventions compared to AI and hybrid interventions. While AI retention rates were similar to those for human coaching, hybrid interventions showed a comparable difference. Engagement metrics offered valuable insight into adherence and retention but did not clarify the nature of meaningful interactions that may influence adherence. Boucher & Raiker (72) recommended moving away from the one-size-fits-all approach to assessing engagement and instead encourage researchers to focus on patterns of engagement.\n\nEngagement as behaviour (i.e., quantitative engagement measures like app logins, text messages sent, and coaching sessions attended) provides valuable insight into the dynamics of DHIs and engagement trends  (73) . However, this construct was also inconsistently reported across studies, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions (Table  6 ). Engagement as behaviour suggested that engagement with both human and AI coaches yielded positive outcomes. Among studies that reported engagement as behaviour, trends indicated early engagement and increased engagement with both human and AI coaches led to better outcomes, increased retention, adherence and goal attainment  (37, 38, 40, 44, 49, 56, 58, 61, 63, 65, 66) . Satisfaction rates offered further insight into participants' experiences with different coaching modalities. Overall, satisfaction was highest in interventions using human-facilitated coaching interventions  (27, 40, 53, 62) . AI coaching showed more variable satisfaction rates  (17, 38, 51, 66, 69) . While hybrid approaches demonstrated higher rates of satisfaction over AI-only, they still lagged behind human-only interventions  (44, 59, 63) .\n\nParticipants' experiences were further uncovered through the exploration of working alliances developed between coaches and participants. Prior research has consistently linked strong working alliances with positive coaching outcomes  (74) . A positive working alliance was formed between participants and AI and human coaches during DHI studies  (17, 55, 60, 61, 63, 64, 67, 69) . However, AI chatbots reported limitations to the alliances formed, with some participants reporting a sense of disconnection, repetitiveness and lack of warmth with chatbots  (17, 55, 69) . This trend in working alliance, favouring humanfacilitated coaching interventions, was reflected by one hybrid coaching intervention  (63) . This study reported that participants valued human support along with AI to increase motivation and confidence and support technology navigation  (63) . Overall, while engagement, satisfaction, and working alliance remained consistent across both human and AI coaching interventions, human-facilitated coaching interventions foster stronger connections and higher satisfaction. Although hybrid and AI models could promote engagement and offer positive participant experiences, they could not replicate the interpersonal elements of human-delivered interventions that enhanced the overall individual experience. While engagement remains a key indicator of adherence, Boucher and Raiker  (72)  suggested that the true measure of success in DHIs should focus on the ability to foster meaningful lifestyle changes rather than being based on the frequency or duration of engagement."

      "text": "The review findings suggest that human and AI-facilitated coaching could produce positive effects on lifestyle to varying degrees. While AI-powered coaching demonstrated more consistent positive trends on physical activity levels  (48, 51, 56, 66) , human-facilitated coaching yielded more consistent positive outcomes for psychological wellbeing and stress management  (27, 40, 45, 47, 62, 68) . Likewise, both human and AI coaching reported overall improvements in healthy eating  (39, 41, 42, 48, 50, 51, 56, 58, 61, 62) . Human coaching reported improvements in sleep, whereas AI did not  (27, 51, 53, 59) . Finally, substance use was only assessed with human coaches, precluding direct comparisons  (57, 58) . However, the varying effects of lifestyle outcomes between human and AI delivery systems were minimal, indicating that both AI and human coaching are acceptable and feasible interventions for supporting lifestyle changes. This finding aligns with existing literature suggesting that AI can be equally effective in providing support, particularly when deployed for narrow, specific tasks  (32) . Such findings suggest that AI could be a promising avenue for delivering scalable and effective lifestyle interventions  (75, 76) . However, studies using hybrid coaching approaches failed to produce consistent, robust findings compared to AI-and human-only interventions. Although some hybrid studies showed promising effects in physical activity, psychological wellbeing, and sleep, one study indicated that these benefits did not persist after human support ended  (63) . This suggests that further refinement of the integration between human and AI elements is needed to optimise long-term behaviour change."

      "title": "4.4. Exploring the hybrid AI-human coaching model: benefits, limitations, and future potential",
      "text": "The lack of significant engagement and lifestyle outcomes in hybrid studies was unexpected. AI pioneers have established the value and complementary nature of combining AI and humans  (77) , with a growing body of literature on AI-human symbiosis indicating the shifting division of work between humans and machines  (77) (78) (79) . This comes from longstanding research asserting that computers plus humans do better than either alone  (77, 79, 80) . AI and humans hold different values and capabilities. While AI has superior computational and analytical skills, humans can better deal with uncertainty and have greater aptitude for intuition, creativity, and holistic work  (77, 79) . By harnessing human-AI symbioses, it becomes possible to pull the best traits of AI and humans and compensate for the limitations of both  (77, 80) .\n\nIn digital health coaching, hybrid models have been proposed as a promising way to combine the scalability of AI with the relational depth of human coaching  (31, 81) . This hybrid approach draws on the strengths of AI and human coaches to create high-quality, meaningful, accessible, and scalable coaching conversations  (31, 81) . Despite this theoretical promise, hybrid coaching studies included in this review did not reflect this. Several factors may explain this, including methodical constraints, the limited role of human coaches, and inconsistencies in AI implementation. Firstly, only four studies in this review examined hybrid coaching, making it difficult to assess its full impact. Secondly, human coaching was commonly offered as a supportive or optional component of hybrid DHIs  (37, 82) . Three studies highlighted this as a limitation, acknowledging greater outcomes when coaching was the central component of DHIs  (37) . Participants also expressed a preference for periodic human interaction alongside AI-driven support, reinforcing the importance of sustained human involvement  (44, 63) . Furthermore, these studies indicated that consistent human support was important for maintaining improvements in lifestyle and sustaining engagement  (37, 44, 63) . This aligns with existing literature, which suggests that AI should extend rather than replace human coaching capabilities  (83) .\n\nThe AI components used in hybrid coaching varied across studies. Two studies employed basic automation for delivering tailored messages and advice  (37, 44) , while another used a decision-support system to provide personalised recommendations  (59) . The fourth study integrated a digital coach similar to a chatbot but with limited interactive capabilities  (63) . The study that most closely aligned with AI coaching models showed significant improvements in physical activity; however, these benefits diminished once human support was removed (Table  3 ). This reflects broader findings that AI is effective for structured tasks like goal-setting but lacks the relational depth and working alliance needed for long-term behavioural change  (83) . This suggests that hybrid coaching is still an emerging area with limited empirical evaluation. While these studies confirmed the feasibility, more research is needed to refine hybrid coaching models and optimise their effectiveness. Additionally, trends suggest that hybrid models should prioritise human connection as the foundation of coaching while leveraging AI to enhance efficiency and scalability. Future hybrid interventions should, therefore, prioritise AI as an enhancement to human coaching rather than a substitute."

      "text": "This systematic review provided a comprehensive exploration of coach-facilitated digital DHIs, a novel and growing field. By synthesising existing evidence, this review highlighted the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of human, AI and hybrid coaching modalities on engagement and lifestyle outcomes. Adherence to PRISMA guidelines and the use of the MMAT ensured a rigorous and transparent methodological approach. There are well-established, foundational reviews that have significantly advanced digital health research in the context of health promotion and disease prevention  (6, 84, 85) . This review builds on this existing foundation to synthesise the existing body of knowledge on the integration of different health coaching modalities within DHIs. The insights gained from this review can inform the development and optimisation of future coach-led DHIs.\n\nHowever, several limitations of this review should be noted. First, while full-text screening, data-extraction and quality appraisal was done in duplicate, the title and abstract screening was conducted by one reviewer only, increasing the risk of reviewer bias. Additionally, due to the use of broad search terms with multiple definitions, it is difficult to confirm that all relevant articles have been included. Furthermore, Significant heterogeneity in reporting coaching protocol, engagement metrics, and lifestyle outcomes across studies affects the ability to compare findings directly. This heterogeneity hindered the synthesis of results, making it difficult to draw consistent conclusions. Many of the included studies primarily focused on assessing the acceptability and feasibility of coachfacilitated DHIs rather than investigating the impact of specific components of the DHIs (e.g., active coaching, educational modules, tracking tools) and their interactions in influencing lifestyle outcomes. As a result, this review cannot definitively establish the full impact of coaching within DHIs, and its findings should be interpreted with caution. The review's generalisability is also constrained by the heterogeneity of participant demographics. Finally, the inclusion of only peer-reviewed studies may have introduced publication bias, potentially skewing the findings. Despite these limitations, this review offers valuable insights into the current state and potential future directions of digital health coaching in DHIs, providing a foundation for advancing scalable, high-quality, and evidence-based interventions."

      "text": "The studies included in this review contribute to our understanding of how digital health coaching can be effectively integrated into DHIs, highlighting the trends, opportunities, and challenges related to its impact on lifestyle outcomes and engagement. Despite inconsistencies in reporting coaching delivery methods, engagement metrics, satisfaction, and lifestyle outcomes, this review emphasises the potential positive impact of coach-facilitated DHIs on participant engagement and lifestyle outcomes. We confirm the acceptability and feasibility of integrating AI and human coaching into DHIs and identify a gap in the research on hybrid coaching approaches. Digital health coaching in DHIs is complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to isolate components of the intervention to understand their effect (i.e., coaching, wearables, environment). Further research is necessary to better understand these complexities to advance the development of quality, evidence-based, coach-led DHIs that promote participant engagement and positive lifestyle changes. Additionally, it is crucial for future research to explore how the benefits of both AI and human coaching, as reported in this review, can be leveraged through hybrid approaches. Such strategies could help overcome the barriers of meaningful engagement in AI coaching and the scalability and accessibility of human coaching to create a scalable coach-led DHI without decreasing the quality of health coaching. their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.
