  "title": "Fidelity to Program Specification of the National Health Service Digital Diabetes Prevention Program Behavior Change Technique Content and Underpinning Theory: Document Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: The National Health Service (NHS) Diabetes Prevention Program is a behavior change intervention for adults in England who are identified as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The face-to-face service was launched in 2016, followed by a digital service (NHS Digital Diabetes Prevention Program [NHS-DDPP]) in 2019. A total of 4 service providers were commissioned to deliver the NHS-DDPP and were required to deliver the digital service in line with a program specification detailing the key intervention content. The fidelity of the behavior change content in the digital service (ie, the extent to which the program is delivered as intended) is currently unknown. Digital interventions may allow higher fidelity as staff do not have to be trained to deliver all intervention content. Assessing fidelity of the intervention design is particularly important to establish the planned behavior change content in the NHS-DDPP and the extent to which this adheres to the program specification. This is the first known independent assessment of design fidelity in a large-scale digital behavior change intervention. Objective: This study aims to assess the fidelity of the behavior change content in each of the 4 NHS-DDPP providers' intervention designs to the full program specification. \n Methods: We conducted a document review of each provider's NHS-DDPP intervention design, along with interviews with program developers employed by the 4 digital providers (n=6). Providers' intervention design documents and interview transcripts were coded for behavior change techniques (BCTs; ie, the active ingredients of the intervention) using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 and underpinning theory using the Theory Coding Scheme framework. The BCTs identified in each digital provider's intervention design were compared with the 19 BCTs included in the program specification. Results: Of the 19 BCTs specified in the program specification, the 4 providers planned to deliver 16 (84%), 17 (89%), 16 (84%), and 16 (84%) BCTs, respectively. An additional 41 unspecified BCTs were included in at least one of the 4 digital providers' intervention designs. By contrast, inconsistent use of the underpinning theory was apparent across providers, and none of the providers had produced a logic model to explain how their programs were expected to work. All providers linked some of their planned BCTs to theoretical constructs; however, justification for the inclusion of other BCTs was not described. \n Conclusions: The fidelity of BCT content in the NHS-DDPP was higher than that previously documented for the face-to-face service. Thus, if service users engage with the NHS-DDPP, this should increase the effectiveness of the program. However, given that a clear theoretical underpinning supports the translation of BCTs in intervention designs to intervention delivery, the absence of a logic model describing the constructs to be targeted by specific BCTs is potentially problematic.",

      "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an international public health concern, with >4.9 million people having diabetes and 13.6 million people now at an increased risk of T2DM in the United Kingdom  [1] . T2DM is preventable by lifestyle modifications in diet, physical activity, and weight loss, although family history, ethnicity, and age are risk factors. Treatment for T2DM and its associated complications currently costs the National Health Service (NHS) \u00a310 billion (US $13 billion) each year; thus, its prevention is a public health priority  [2] .\n\nIn response to this, the NHS Diabetes Prevention Program (NHS-DPP) was launched in 2016, a behavior change intervention for adults in England who have been identified as having elevated blood glucose levels and are thus at a higher risk of developing T2DM. The main aims of the program are to improve diet, increase physical activity, and achieve weight loss, contributing to a reduction in T2DM risk  [3] . Early evaluations suggest that the program is successful in preventing the progression to T2DM  [4] . However, there is a weakness in reach and retention in the face-to-face program (eg, younger adults and those from more deprived communities)  [5] , which a digital program may overcome. Digital interventions have the potential to address logistical challenges such as scheduling, travel, work, and childcare  [6] , and they have the capacity to offer wide-reaching and tailored support at a lower cost, both of which are important for large-scale behavior change  [7] . For example, technology can offer more choice and convenience to patients who may not be able to engage face to face with health professionals, and interventions can be designed to address the specific needs of disadvantaged groups by tailoring those interventions to the target group [8], especially when these groups are included in the design of digital interventions  [9] .\n\nIn 2017, NHS England launched a pilot program of the NHS Digital DPP (NHS-DDPP)  [10] . Following this pilot, a digital pathway was introduced to the program in 2019  [11] , with 4 independent service providers commissioned to deliver the digital service. NHS England produced a service specification detailing the key features that should be present in the NHS-DPP  [11] , based on the currently available evidence  [12, 13] . This specification indicated the key behavior change techniques (BCTs) that should be present in the intervention  [11] . BCTs are defined as the active ingredients of an intervention that promotes behavioral change (eg, setting goals, monitoring behavior, and social support)  [14] . The use of BCTs to self-regulate behaviors (eg, goal setting and self-monitoring) was particularly emphasized in the specification, as the wider literature suggests that these are key to behavioral change  [13] .\n\nIntervention fidelity is used to describe whether an intervention is delivered as intended  [15, 16] . Without an assessment of fidelity, it cannot be ascertained whether intervention effectiveness, or a lack thereof, is because of the intervention content or other factors added or omitted in the intervention delivery. A recent evaluation of the face-to-face delivery of the NHS-DPP produced a thorough fidelity assessment of the behavior change content in the program, including the assessment of intervention design  [17] , staff training  [18] , intervention delivery  [19] [20] [21] , and service user receipt  [22] . The results of the face-to-face evaluation revealed an underdelivery of BCTs to self-regulate behaviors (eg, problem solving and goal setting)  [19, 21] . This suggests a gap between what the evidence base indicated as the most effective in changing health behaviors and actual program delivery, which is largely because of failures to translate the BCTs specified in the evidence base into providers' program designs  [19] .\n\nAn assessment of the fidelity of the design of interventions is an important first stage in fidelity evaluation to establish what key intervention features are planned and whether these are in line with the evidence base from the outset. If a program is not designed with fidelity to the evidence base, it will have a downstream influence on its delivery and receipt. The findings from the assessment of fidelity of design for the face-to-face service indicated 19 BCTs in the NHS-DPP full program specification that should be included in the program; face-to-face providers described 74% of those BCTs in their intervention designs  [17] . However, we are yet to establish the fidelity of the behavior change content in the digital offering of the NHS-DPP; that is, the extent to which the digital providers include the 19 specified BCTs in their intervention designs.\n\nThe underpinning theory of an intervention refers to the theories that inform the intervention, such as identifying theoretical constructs to be targeted  [23] . Having identified these constructs allows for appropriate BCTs to be selected. Despite recommendations for clear descriptions of the underpinning theory of behavior change interventions  [24] , there is still a lack of literature that reports how interventions work (ie, the theoretical basis of the intervention and the rationale for selecting the BCTs designed for the intervention). To facilitate the description of different aspects of theory use, the Theory Coding Scheme (TCS) was developed  [25] , which is a 19-item framework providing a fine-grained assessment of the use of theory, including the extent to which all mentioned BCTs are linked to relevant constructs.\n\nA concise way of visually presenting the theoretical basis for interventions that are informed by multiple theories could be via a logic model that uses simple diagrams to demonstrate the causal pathways between the intervention components and desired outcomes  [26] . Without an explicit underpinning theory, it is not clear how the program is expected to produce the desired behavioral changes; thus, the rationale for the design of the intervention is not clear, and there is a lack of justification for why particular BCTs have been chosen for the intervention  [25] . The evaluation of the face-to-face NHS-DPP found variation in the underpinning theory across face-to-face providers, with a lack of justification for the inclusion of BCTs in providers' intervention designs  [27] .\n\nDigital interventions may allow higher fidelity as staff do not have to be trained to deliver all the intervention content  [7] . To date, research has primarily focused on patient engagement with digital health interventions (eg, via methods such as system usage data, qualitative measures, and self-report questionnaires)  [28]  and adherence to digital interventions (ie, the extent to which patients keep using the digital intervention in the desired way)  [29] . Some studies have summarized the development process of digital interventions (eg, describing the theory and existing evidence to inform the development of a digital self-management intervention for people with T2DM)  [30]  and compared web-based intervention content against the intervention description  [31] . However, there is a lack of literature examining the extent to which the planned intervention content of digital health interventions adheres to the evidence base for what works in changing health behaviors."

This analysis aims to provide the first known independent evaluation of fidelity of design of a nationally implemented digital intervention and thus builds on previous methods set out to measure fidelity  [16]  by applying them in a novel way to digital intervention designs using the NHS-DDPP as an exemplar. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to (1) describe the planned BCT content and theoretical foundations of the NHS-DDPP, (2) examine variations in planned BCT content and theoretical foundations between the digital providers, and (3) evaluate the fidelity of the planned BCT content in each provider's NHS-DDPP intervention design to the full program specification."

The 4 digital providers were private service organizations, each of whom secured contracts to deliver the NHS-DDPP from 2019 to 2021. Of the 4 digital providers, 3 (75%; Oviva, Second Nature, and Liva) were in partnership with one of the face-to-face providers of the NHS-DPP to deliver the digital pathway of the program. One of the providers (WW) delivered both face-to-face and digital pathways of the NHS-DPP. In this report, providers are labeled A to D to preserve their anonymity.\n\nTo supplement the digital providers' intervention design documentation, interviews were conducted between September 2020 and December 2020 with program developers employed by each of the 4 digital providers. Program developers were involved in the design and development of the NHS-DDPP. Participants had job titles including Head of NHS Partnerships, Head of Clinical Services, and Head of Coaching. Participants were involved in either adapting their current digital programs to be in line with the NHS Service Specification  [11]  or were a key contact at the digital provider best placed to describe how the behavior change content was developed for the program.\n\nThe authors contacted the management staff of each of the 4 digital providers to help identify the appropriate staff members to be interviewed. The management staff contacted the relevant individuals directly, and those individuals proactively contacted the research team, where they expressed an interest in participating in an interview. We aimed to interview professionals from different backgrounds who had different roles in program development (eg, specialists with backgrounds in behavioral science, nutrition, or physical activity, and provider leads overseeing program development) to gather a range of views and provide a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved in the design and development of each NHS-DDPP intervention. Before scheduling the interviews, the participants were sent an information sheet containing details about the research. Participants were given the opportunity to ask any questions about the research, and fully recorded verbal consent was obtained from each participant before commencing the interview. Interviews were conducted via a video call platform-Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) videoconferencing-with one of the two researchers (REH and LMM) who had previous training in qualitative data collection.\n\nInterviews with 2 professionals took place with digital providers A and C, and interviews with 1 professional took place with digital providers B and D (n=6 interviews in total). The interviews covered the following topics:"

The TCS  [25]  is a 19-item framework that captures how theory is directly used in the intervention (eg, links between theoretical constructs and BCTs). Both frameworks have been widely used for reporting interventions; the BCTTv1 has demonstrated good interrater reliability (IRR), test-retest reliability, and good validity  [33] , and the authors of the TCS have reported satisfactory IRR for each item of the TCS  [25] .\n\nThe semistructured interviews were analyzed using deductive content analysis.

BCTs present in the program specification documentation  [11, 13]  were coded for a previous fidelity assessment of the face-to-face offering of the NHS-DPP conducted by the same research team  [17] . The study by Hawkes et al  [17] , as well as Multimedia Appendix 2, provides further details on the developed BCT coding rules. To code the underpinning theory, a data extraction sheet was developed using the TCS  [25] . Multimedia Appendix 2 provides further details on how the data on the underpinning theory were extracted.\n\nThe framework response bids from the digital providers' intervention design documentation were double coded for BCTs and the underpinning theory by a second researcher (LMM). IRR was calculated using the Cohen \u03ba coefficient  [35]  to determine consistency between coders. Identified coding discrepancies were discussed among REH, LMM, and DPF until consensus was reached.

However, providers appeared to have inconsistent use of theory to inform their intervention designs, and none had developed a logic model or provided an explicit description of how their digital programs were expected to achieve the desired health outcomes.

      "text": "Overall, digital providers planned to deliver an average of 85% of the BCT content specified in the NHS-DPP program specification. Thus, the fidelity of design in the digital offering of the NHS-DPP is, in principle, higher than that previously reported for the face-to-face offering, where the fidelity of design was 74%  [17] . The planned self-regulatory BCT content is particularly encouraging, given that these BCTs are backed by evidence to suggest that such techniques are most effective in changing health behaviors such as diet and physical activity  [13] . However, the inconsistent use of theory in digital programs is similar to the evaluation of face-to-face NHS-DPP, which also highlighted a lack of mapping of BCTs to theoretical constructs and a lack of a logic model produced by any of the providers  [27] . Both findings could be explained by the fact that providers' digital programs were adapted from pre-existing digital interventions already implemented before the commissioning of the NHS-DDPP service. This may be a particular problem for digital interventions."

      "text": "This study provides a detailed analysis of the planned behavior change content of each of the 4 digital providers commissioned to deliver the NHS-DDPP using standardized coding frameworks  [14, 25] , which demonstrated high \u03ba agreement between coders. All framework response documentation obtained from each digital provider was submitted to the commissioners during service procurement; thus, they should represent an accurate description of digital providers' intervention designs. In addition, the research team requested any other relevant documentation from each digital provider that contained information about the planned behavior change content of the NHS-DDPP. Providers were given multiple opportunities to share all relevant documentation with the research team to support the current analysis.\n\nHowever, one of the providers was reluctant to share all documentation detailing the theoretical underpinning because of the commercial sensitivity of these documents. Researchers attempted to obtain as much information as possible about the theoretical foundations of providers' programs via interviews, especially when documentation could not be shared with the research team. The interviews were able to supplement the document review and were used to fill any gaps in the information that was not present in the documentation. Despite some reluctance to share documentation with the research team from one of the digital providers, analyses from this provider were similar to those of the other 3 providers, who shared all documentation. Furthermore, all digital providers confirmed that they had not developed a logic model to explicitly map how their digital programs would achieve the desired program outcomes, nor was there an alternative presentation of how their interventions were expected to work (eg, via free text).\n\nIt should also be noted that participants who were interviewed for this study were not always necessarily directly involved in the development of the BCT content and the theoretical underpinning of the programs. Some people involved in the early stages of design and development had since moved on to other roles. Nonetheless, the research team tried to identify \u22651 relevant individual from each digital provider and aimed to interview professionals from different backgrounds to gather a range of views and provide a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved in the design and development of each NHS-DDPP intervention."

      "title": "Future Directions",
      "text": "Digital interventions have the potential to be delivered with higher fidelity than face-to-face interventions  [7]  as they do not rely solely on facilitator-centered delivery; instead, the BCT content can be standardized in its delivery via the functions of an app or website. Therefore, the current fidelity of design results is encouraging, as drift in delivery fidelity is less likely, thus increasing the chances of the program being effective if the BCT content is proven to be engaged with effectively.\n\nDespite the encouraging results with regard to the planned BCTs in digital providers' program designs, there is inconsistent use of theory from providers to justify why specific BCTs have been included and how they will produce the desired behavior changes (ie, the theoretical constructs they are targeting). Given that a clear underpinning theory supports the translation of BCTs in intervention designs to intervention delivery  [24] [25] [26] , the absence of a clear logic model or an explicit explanation of underpinning theory describing the constructs to be targeted by specific BCTs is potentially problematic.\n\nOne of the ways in which providers could usefully describe the underpinning theory is via a logic model, which provides a concise and clear way of visually presenting interventions informed by multiple theories. However, there is no clear guidance on whether it should be the role of the providers to produce a logic model or whether it would be more appropriate for commissioners of large-scale programs to produce an initial logic model to guide providers from the outset  [27] . However, the requirement of a logic model during the commissioning process of large-scale programs could ensure a clear rationale for the BCTs included in intervention designs, which may result in fewer issues in delivery and receipt fidelity in program implementation  [27] . It should be noted that the inclusion of a logic model is a recommendation that has emerged since the evaluation of the NHS-DPP commenced and following the previous round of service procurement. Commissioners of the program are now increasingly focusing on the important role of logic models in the upcoming round of service procurement for the NHS-DPP.\n\nIn addition, a further 68% of the planned BCT content in the digital service was not specified in the program specification, a finding similar to the face-to-face offering of the NHS-DPP  [17] . It is possible that interventions containing more techniques to help people change their diet and physical activity behaviors may be more effective  [53, 54] . However, without a logic model or explicit description of the underpinning theory justifying the inclusion of additional BCT content, programs cannot be tested and evaluated effectively to establish the techniques that work in digital behavior change interventions and why. This research provides an example of a design fidelity assessment of a large-scale digital intervention. Using the present findings as a baseline, future research will assess fidelity of the delivery of the digital service and service user engagement with the program. The current analysis found that some digital providers still plan to rely on health coaches to deliver aspects of the program to service users (eg, support via telephone); thus, the nature of this delivery will depend on the skills of the health coach in a similar way as that delivered by facilitators of face-to-face sessions. This may help to increase program engagement  [55]  but may also pose a risk to delivery fidelity because of variations in the background or training of health coaches. This study will be critical to assess whether the plans digital providers state they will put in place (with high fidelity) translate into program content that is actually delivered and understood as intended. Ongoing qualitative work examines how the behavior change content of the program is understood by service users, an underresearched aspect of fidelity  [56] .\n\nFurther analysis of the interview data with program developers from this study is also planned, with the aim of qualitatively capturing the nuances of intervention development and how each of the digital providers' programs has evolved over time."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "When designing their programs, the digital providers of the NHS-DDPP demonstrated good fidelity to the BCT content of the program specification. Thus, if the NHS-DDPP is delivered with high fidelity and engaged with by service users, it should increase the effectiveness of the program in achieving a reduction in the incidence of T2DM. However, the lack of theory described in digital providers' intervention designs is potentially problematic if providers are not explicit in how their programs will work to achieve behavior change, given that a clear underpinning theory supports the translation of BCT content in intervention design to intervention delivery."
