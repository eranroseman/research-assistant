  "title": "Digital therapeutics for essential hypertension using a smartphone application: A randomized, open-label, multicenter pilot study",
  "abstract": "Hypertension is the most considerable but treatable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although physicians prescribe multiple antihypertensive drugs and promote lifestyle modifications, the real-world blood pressure (BP) control rate remains poor. To improve BP target achievement, we developed a novel digital therapeutic-the HERB software system -to manage hypertension. Here, we performed a randomized pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of the HERB system for hypertension. We recruited 146 patients with essential hypertension from March 2018 to March 2019. We allocated eligible patients to the intervention group (HERB system + standard lifestyle modification) or control group (standard lifestyle modification alone). The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 24 weeks in 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The baseline characteristics in each group were well balanced; the mean age was approx. 57 years, and 67% were male. In the primary end point at 24 weeks, HERB intervention did not lower the mean change of 24-hour SBP by ABPM compared with the controls (adjusted difference: -0.66 mmHg; p = .78). In an exploratory analysis focusing on antihypertensive drug-na\u00efve patients aged <65, the effects of the HERB intervention were significantly greater than the control for reducing 24-hour SBP by ABPM at 16 weeks (adjusted difference: -7.6 mmHg; p = .013; and morning home SBP at 24 weeks (adjusted difference -6.0 mmHg; p = .012). Thus, the HERB intervention did not achieve a primary efficacy end point. However, we observed that antihypertensive drug-na\u00efve adult hypertensive patients aged <65 years could be a potential HERB system-effective target for further investigations of the efficacy of the system.",

      "text": "Hypertension is the most considerable but treatable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and it is thus an enormous economic and social burden.  1, 2 Although physicians prescribe multiple antihypertensive drugs and promote lifestyle modifications, the real-world blood pressure (BP) control rate remains poor. The percentage of reported populations meeting the BP of 140/90 mmHg as the desired control rate remains at only 15%-70%.  3, 4 A new American hypertension guideline setting the BP management target as BP < 130/80 mmHg has been released, and thus, the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension has markedly increased.  5 To achieve the latest BP target, real-world innovations for hypertensive management are needed.  2, 5 gital therapeutics (DTx) including mobile health (mHealth) interventions are emerging and promising tools for the management, improvement, and treatment of diseases such as nicotine dependence,  6, 7  substance abuse,  8  and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  9 DTx is a novel therapeutic method leveraging software programs such as smartphone applications (apps) and device algorithms.  10 In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying hypertension, Lu et al reported that traditional mHealth interventions such as telephone calls, patient Web services, and short text message services improved the participants' home or office BP.  11 Regarding smartphone apps for hypertension, there are hundreds of mobile apps in the Apple Store or Google Play describing \"hypertension management.\"  12  However, few of these smartphone apps were developed with the involvement of health care professionals or medical organizations, and there has been no scientific assessment of the clinical efficacy of any smartphone app for hypertension management.  12  thus developed a novel DTx-the \"HERB\" software systemto lower an individual's BP based on behavioral science,  13  and we created a unique algorithm that helps users make lifestyle modifications and use medically validated non-pharmacological interventions. The HERB software system was developed under expert guidance from Jichi Medical University (Tochigi, Japan). The system includes an investigational smartphone app for hypertensive individuals, a cloud data server, and a Web application for health care providers (Figure  1 ). The investigational smartphone app can assess each user's personality, behavioral characteristics, and hypertension determinants to provide adequate support on an individual level.\n\nHere, we performed a randomized pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HERB software system in addition to guideline-based lifestyle modifications."

The standard lifestyle modification consisted of six components: (1) reducing salt intake, (2)   consuming more vegetables and less lipids in the diet, (3) lowering body weight, (4) regular exercise \u226530 minutes per day, (5) reducing alcohol intake, and (6) quitting smoking.  1  In the intervention group, we prescribed the investigational smartphone app and provided a home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) device to connect the app via Bluetooth. In the control group, we provided the HBPM device to measure daily BP, and the participants' primary physicians checked the written data at their planned visit. Both groups received instructions about lifestyle modifications as a guideline-based standard regimen for essential hypertension.  1 The target BP was set according to the guideline 1 as <140/90 mmHg for patients aged <75 years and <150/90 mmHg for patients aged \u226575.  1"

Of note, the HERB intervention was associated with a greater reduction in morning home SBP at 16 weeks in the participants with uncontrolled morning hypertension (morning home SBP > 135 mmHg at baseline). Therefore, the app may perform more extensively and significantly to reduce morning home SBP in individuals who have uncontrolled morning hypertension or sustained hypertension with higher 24-hour BP.\n\nThere were no device-related AEs during the study. Unlike the existing antihypertensive drugs, this could be one of the valuable benefits of the HERB app, that is, the investigational app did not lower the users' BP so far that it caused adverse events such as dizziness or syncope.\n\nThe investigational app usage rate was favorable throughout the study, as the median app usage rate was 100% at 16 weeks; however, this rate at 24 weeks was decreased to 57%. In particular, the usage rate of the app by the elderly (age \u2265 65) hypertensives was almost 50% that of the non-elderly adult hypertensives (36% vs. 71%). In our exploratory analyses, we observed that the participants with essential hypertension who were <65 years old and antihypertensive drug-na\u00efve might be a potentially effective subgroup for the HERB app intervention. We observed that the participants aged <65 years might engage with the app at a high level. In contrast, the participants who were being treated with an antihypertensive drug exhibited a paradoxical effect of the app, that is, increasing BP. We therefore set an exploratory app-effective target group as the participants aged <65 years and antihypertensive drug-na\u00efve.\n\nWhen we focused on this target, the effects of the HERB app for lowering users' BPs were robust in the 24-hour SBP at 16 weeks (-7.6 mmHg, p = .013) and the morning home SBP at 24 weeks (-6.0 mmHg, p = .012). In addition, the rationale of this subgroup is compatible to the hypothesis that the impact of HERB-induced lifestyle modifications seems to be more effective at the early stage of neurohumoral factor-activated hypertension in younger adults than in the late stage of structural hypertension in elderly hypertensive patients with increased vascular disease.  21 This target group (aged <65 and antihypertensive drug-na\u00efve) may thus be a potential HERB app-effective subgroup that we should focus on in an upcoming pivotal trial to evaluate the efficacy of the app on BP.  20  Telemedicine has emerged worldwide as an indispensable resource to improve the management of chronic disease. It is especially effective in disaster situations and in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic era.  17, [22] [23] 3] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  Once the efficacy of HERB is validated, introducing the effective DTx into the telemedicine sphere will markedly improve the management of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors in clinical practice. The continuous and frequent use of an app is essential to preserve the effectiveness of DTx. In the present study, the app usage throughout the study period was worse in the elderly participants compared with the younger ones.\n\nFurther improvements of the app program are thus needed to maintain a high level of long-term app use for participants, even among the elderly, so that the app's usage will lead to successful lifestyle\n\nTA B L E 7 Effect of lowering blood pressure by the HERB intervention in antihypertensive drug-na\u00efve participants under 65 years (n = 65) Mean changes at 16 weeks Mean changes at 24 weeks Intervention Controls Adjusted difference [95% CI] p-Value a Intervention Controls Adjusted difference [95% CI] p-Value a SBP ABPM 24 hours -6.1 1.4 -7.6 [-13 to -1.8] .013 -2.7 0.54 -3.2 [-9.3 to 2.9] .30 ABPM daytime -4.0 3.3 -7.4 [-13 to -1.4] .019 0.85 2.1 -1.2 [-7.5 to 5.0] .71 ABPM nighttime -7.9 -2.7 -5.2 [-13 to 2.8] .21 -7.0 -0.39 -6.7 [-15 to 1.1] .098 Office -5.8 -4.9 -0.92 [-6.5 to 4.7] .75 -8.6 -8.6 -0.23 [-7.1 to 6.6] .95 Home -3.2 0.66 -3.8 [-8.8 to 1.2] .14 -6.8 -1.8 -6.0 [-11 to -1.5] .012 DBP ABPM 24 hours -3.5 0.86 -4.4 [-7.7 to -1.0] .013 -1.6 0.32 -1.9 [-5.4 to 1.5] .28 ABPM daytime -1.9 1.7 -3.5 [-7.3 to 0.20] .069 0.81 0.54 0.31 [-3.5 to 4.1] .87 ABPM nighttime -4.7 -0.38 -4.3 [-9.0 to 0.27] .071 -4.6 -0.86 -5.5 [-10 to -0.70] .029 Office -2.5 -1.5 -1.1 [-4.8 to 2.6] .57 -3.7 -3.3 -0.36 [-5.6 to 4.8] .89 Home -3.3 -0.48 -2.9 [-6.5 to 0.72] .12 -4.5 -1.9 -2.6 [-6.3 to 1.1] .17 Abbreviations: ABPM, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure. a Calculated by an ANCOVA adjusted by the use of antihypertensive medications and the mean outside temperature on the day of ABPM measurement."

These analyses indicated that the HERB system exhibited consistent morning home SBP reductions regardless of the participants' baseline characteristics with the exception of the BP control status based on the baseline morning home SBP.
