  "abstract": "Introduction Patients with advanced cancers often face significant symptoms from their cancer and adverse effects from cancer-associated therapy. Patient-generated health data (PGHD) are routinely collected information about symptoms and activity levels that patients either directly report or passively record using devices such as wearable accelerometers. The objective of this study was to test the impact of an intervention integrating remote collection of PGHD with clinician and patient nudges to inform communication between patients with advanced cancer and their oncology team regarding symptom burden and functional status. Methods and analysis This single-centre prospective randomised controlled trial randomises patients with metastatic gastrointestinal or lung cancers into one of three arms: (A) usual care, (B) an intervention that integrates PGHD (including weekly text-based symptom surveys and passively recorded step counts) into a dashboard delivered to oncology clinicians at each visit and (C) the same intervention as arm B but with an additional text-based active choice intervention to patients to encourage discussing their symptoms with their oncology team. The study will enrol approximately 125 participants. The coprimary outcomes are patient perceptions of their oncology team's understanding of their symptoms and their functional status. Secondary outcomes are intervention utility and adherence. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pennsylvania. Study results will be disseminated using methods that describe the results in ways that key stakeholders can best understand and implement.",

      "text": "\u21d2 PROStep is one of the first randomised trials to assess the impact of clinician and patient nudges based on patient-generated health data (PGHD) on symptom and functional status understanding among patients with advanced cancer. \u21d2 Our randomised study design assesses the utility of clinician-directed PGHD information display, with or without a patient-directed active choice question, on communication about symptom burden and functional decline. \u21d2 Our design allows novel longitudinal evaluation of the association between objective step counts and downstream use and outcomes.\n\nOpen access cases where patient-reported and clinician-reported symptoms are not concordant, clinicians underestimate symptom severity.  11 17-19 atient-generated health data (PGHD) are routinely collected information about symptoms and activity levels that patients either report directly or passively record using devices such as wearable accelerometers.  [20] [21] 1] [22] [23]  PGHD assessment may allow clinicians to identify patients with high symptom burden or poor functional status who would benefit from timely supportive care interventions.  24 25 atient-reported outcomes (PROs), health outcomes that are directly reported by a patient, are one example of PGHD.  [24] [25] 5] [26] [27]  Routine PRO assessment in medical oncology can reliably improve symptom management, resulting in improvements in healthcare use, quality of life and even patient survival. As a result, PROs have been increasingly incorporated into routine oncology practice. PROs may be collected in the clinic on paper or via applications that link to the electronic medical record, with early trials suggesting high levels of adherence at 74.9% and 79.1% for weekly and monthly PRO questionnaires among oncology patients.  28 29 However, limiting PRO collection to in-clinic visits in oncology may be too infrequent to comprehensively account for patients' symptom burden. Technologies that enable remote PRO collection using questionnaires delivered via mobile phone applications may provide more granular and relevant information about symptom burden to clinicians.  26 This is particularly timely during the COVID-19 pandemic, as remote symptom monitoring has grown, given the need to decrease face-to-face visits and subsequent exposure risk for patients with active cancer.  [30] [31] ] [32]  In addition to quality of life and symptom burden, functional status is a critical element in determining a patient's treatment and prognosis. Accurate measurement of functional status is challenging, as assessment via questionnaires usually differs between clinicians and patients.  33 34 assive activity monitoring via accelerometer-measured step counts may provide objective measures of functional status that can be trended over time to inform discussions about treatment and prognosis. Activity monitoring among patients with advanced cancer is feasible and associated with high levels of adherence in prior trials.  [35] [36] ] [37] [38]  While PGHD provides important clinical and prognostic data, a critical evidence gap is how to optimally integrate these data in clinical care to improve symptom management. Behavioural economic principles can inform optimal use of PGHD to improve symptom management.  39 Clinician-targeted automated default email and text alerts about prognostic risk or evidencebased practice may improve guideline-based practice in oncology.  [40] [41] 1] [42]  Additionally, patient-targeted nudges using active choice-a behavioural economic method used to address delays in decision making by prompting an immediate decision between alternative choices-may lead to greater completion of high-value decisions such as cancer screening.  [43] [44] [45]  No prospective trial has compared clinician and patient nudges informed by PGHD collection to better improve symptom management.  [40] [41] 1] [42]  The objective of this study was to test the impact of an intervention integrating remote collection of PGHD with clinician and patient nudges to inform symptom and functional status and communication understanding for patients with advanced cancer and their oncology team."

Patients must receive their oncology care at PCAM, be currently treated with intravenous chemotherapy (or planned receipt within 2 weeks) and have a capable smartphone (table  1 ). These criteria were selected with input from oncology clinicians who treat patients with GI and lung cancer to identify a population with incurable cancer who are undergoing intravenous Open access chemotherapy and are the most likely to have uncontrolled symptoms or a poor prognosis.\n\nThe study cohort includes patients currently undergoing chemotherapy at PCAM. Patients seeking second opinions or undergoing their treatment at other sites are excluded as the text-based intervention cannot be delivered to other sites. Due to the intervention's components (ie, PRO surveys, active choice text messages, utility surveys, Fitbit app, etc), we exclude non-English-speaking patients. We also exclude patients undergoing singleagent oral targeted therapy (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists) or single-agent checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in order to enrich the study population for patients with high treatment-associated symptom burden. We exclude patients on active interventional trials-including an ongoing palliative care clinical trial among patients with thoracic malignancies-because such trials often already have a PRO collection mechanism that may confound the impact of the intervention. Finally, we exclude patients who are bedbound or wheelchair users because step data collected as a key feature of the intervention would not be expected to improve care for these patients."

These will be assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (1=not at all, 2=slightly, 3=moderately, 4=considerably, 5=completely). Of note, the prespecified comparison was between arm A and arm B and arm C, but the protocol was amended prior to any data review to combine the intervention arms due to slow enrolment and higher than expected dropout.\n\nThe secondary outcomes will compare these same two questions measured at 3 months between arm A and arms B+C. Another secondary outcome will be cumulative adherence between patients in the intervention arms at both 3 and 6 months. Patients are considered adherent for each week that they complete their PRO survey and sync their Fitbit step data for four or more days. Cumulative adherence is calculated when these weeks are divided by the total number of weeks that a patient was enrolled in the trial. We will also analyse trends in the PROStep data (ie, PRO survey scores and Fitbit step data) among intervention patients. Exploratory outcomes will include multiple use metrics collected via the electronic medical record (EHR; i.e., number of ER visits, hospitalisations, palliative care consults, documented advanced care planning notes, and documented serious illness conversations. Patient utility will be another exploratory outcome measured using survey data at 3 and 6 months. Additionally, we will further analyse patient surveys by comparing the same two questions from the primary outcome between each individual arm and analyse responses to the remaining survey questions.

If the result is significant, the study will use Tukey's honestly significantly difference test to test pairwise comparisons between the study arms. If the outcomes for any arm are skewed (not normally distributed), outcomes will be log-transformed before applying all tests.\n\nFor the secondary outcomes, a similar analysis will be conducted for the secondary outcome comparing the same questions but taken from the 3-month rather than the 6-month utility survey. We will apply t-tests to compare mean response scores for the remaining secondary outcomes. We will use Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous outcomes and \u03c7 2 tests for categorical variables to compare the secondary outcomes of adherence rates and trends in PROStep data for arm B versus arm C at 3 and 6 months.\n\nTo assess whether responses in surveys of 3-6-months differ across arms, we will conduct an analysis of covariance model with the baseline score and arms as covariates, and change of score as the dependent variable.\n\nPatients are welcome to discontinue the trial at any time, for any reason, via text, email, phone or at a visit with their oncologist. Patients who enrol in hospice will be disenrolled and will no longer receive surveys or prompts to reduce patient burden near the end of life, but we will use their most recent survey in the analyses of 3 and 6 months. If a patient exits the study early but more than 4 weeks after enrolment or 4 weeks after the 3 month survey, they will receive the utility survey of 3 or 6 months, respectively. This may not be possible for some patients who exit the study to enter hospice or due to death. If patients die or are otherwise unable to complete a survey, they will be omitted from the analysis for the relevant outcome. For patients who disenrol from the trial for any reason (voluntary, death, etc) but meet this 4-week threshold, their clinicians will receive a utility survey."

      "text": "Patients with advanced, incurable cancer who receive systemic therapy often have significant symptoms and declining functional status that is under-recognised and poorly managed by oncology clinicians. Remote electronic PRO and wearable step monitoring offer an opportunity to more accurately track and convey longitudinal information about symptoms and activity level for patients undergoing cancer treatment. This trial tests the impact of an intervention consisting of presenting remote PGHD via clinician dashboards, with or without a patient active choice intervention, on shared patient-clinician understanding of symptoms and functional status.\n\nThis study has several strengths, including (1) its patient-level randomised design; (2) enrolment of patients with two advanced cancers who often undergo chemotherapy and experience high symptom burden and functional decline during the course of treatment;\n\n(3) intervention that combines activity monitoring and symptom self-reporting to assess symptom burden and functional status decline; (4) use of patient and clinician behavioural prompts to improve communication about symptom management, rather than just passive measurement of symptoms; and (5) patient-centred primary outcomes that reflect patient's perceptions of adequate clinician communication and management of symptoms and functional status.\n\nLimitations of this pilot study include its (1) singleinstitution setting; (2) potential lack of generalisability to other cancers, particularly haematological malignancies; and (3) reliance on adherence to text-based PRO assessments and prompts. If successful, we plan on conducting larger, multi-institutional randomised controlled trials to test interventions consisting of PGHD collection and behavioural prompts. Additionally, real-world adherence to PRO collection is a limitation of many PRO collection programmes, and our incorporation of passive monitoring may offer an important mechanism of PGHD collection that is not dependent on a patient actively responding to a questionnaire. Thus, despite known limitations, this study is likely to provide novel data to guide the deployment of PGHD programmes in other outpatient oncology settings.\n\nWe hope that nudges to patients and clinicians based on longitudinal PGHD collection will make changes in patient symptoms, quality of life and functional status more transparent to oncology clinicians, leading to more informed discussions and decisions about the burdensome impacts of advanced cancer and its treatment. Future studies may extend this work to evaluate the role of PGHD in monitoring symptoms and functional status for populations excluded from this study, such as patients with other cancers, patients who receive nonchemotherapy anticancer drugs, patients who receive Open access their chemotherapy remotely and patients who do not own a smart phone. Additionally, future studies should also assess caregiver perceptions towards this and other PGHD-related interventions, given the importance of caregivers in facilitating patient understanding of digital health tools and survey completion."

This trial is registered with clinicaltrials. gov with the official title 'A Feasibility Trial Using Remote Patient-reported Outcomes and Wearable Technology-reported Step Data to Compare Engagement, Utilisation, and Functional Status in Patients With Incurable Lung and Gastrointestinal Cancers'.\n\nThe potential risks to human subjects in this project include (1) risks of breach of confidentiality of personal health information, (2) risks of participants misinterpreting this tool as a means of quick communication with their care team and (3) risks of a breach of data for participating clinicians. To minimise these risks, our study employs numerous safeguards to protect human subjects. These include an experienced and well-trained study team, a robust informed consent process, state-ofthe-art data security, and ongoing emphasis that the electronic symptom-reporting tool is investigational and not a replacement for usual means of communication with patients' care teams."
