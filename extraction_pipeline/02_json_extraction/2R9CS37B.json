  "title": "Qualitative Evaluation of mHealth Implementation for Infectious Disease Care in Low-and Middle-Income Countries: Narrative Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have the potential to improve health outcomes in low-and middleincome countries (LMICs) by aiding health workers to strengthen service delivery, as well as by helping patients and communities manage and prevent diseases. It is crucial to understand how best to implement mHealth within already burdened health services to maximally improve health outcomes and sustain the intervention in LMICs. Objective: We aimed to identify key barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of mHealth interventions for infectious diseases in LMICs, drawing on a health systems analysis framework. Methods: We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist to select qualitative or mixed methods studies reporting on determinants of already implemented infectious disease mHealth interventions in LMICs. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, the Social Sciences Citation Index, and Global Health. We extracted characteristics of the mHealth interventions and implementation experiences, then conducted an analysis of determinants using the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases framework. Results: We identified 10,494 titles for screening, among which 20 studies met our eligibility criteria. Of these, 9 studies examined mHealth smartphone apps and 11 examined SMS text messaging interventions. The interventions addressed HIV (n=7), malaria (n=4), tuberculosis (n=4), pneumonia (n=2), dengue (n=1), human papillomavirus (n=1), COVID-19 (n=1), and respiratory illnesses or childhood infectious diseases (n=2), with 2 studies addressing multiple diseases. Within these studies, 10 interventions were intended for use by health workers and the remainder targeted patients, at-risk individuals, or community members. Access to reliable technological resources, familiarity with technology, and training and support were key determinants of implementation. Additional themes included users forgetting to use the mHealth interventions and mHealth intervention designs affecting ease of use. Conclusions: Acceptance of the intervention and the capacity of existing health care system infrastructure and resources are 2 key factors affecting the implementation of mHealth interventions. Understanding the interaction between mHealth interventions, their implementation, and health systems will improve their uptake in LMICs.",

      "text": "Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the use of mobile and wireless technologies to support health objectives,\" have the potential to improve health outcomes globally, including in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . This is achievable through improving patient education, improving disease self-management, decreasing health care costs, and performing remote monitoring of patients, as reported in a recent systematic review of mHealth in LMICs  [3] . In addition, mHealth can support preventative measures, facilitate disease management, or support health workers to strengthen the delivery of health care  [7] [8] [9] [10] . The WHO has highlighted the need to advance national digital health strategies that can facilitate universal health care  [11] . The WHO's \"Recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening\" highlights that digital technologies, including mHealth, can directly address health system challenges by supporting more widespread coverage across population groups and improving the quality and affordability of health care  [6] . This digital transformation of the health care system has been made possible by the widespread availability of affordable digital technology; currently, 95% of the world population has internet access  [12] . mHealth interventions targeting infectious diseases care have the potential to greatly transform the health care landscape of LMICs, where infectious diseases still represent a substantial burden  [13, 14] . This is particularly important given health system challenges such as low health service utilization, poor adherence to clinical protocols among health workers, and geographic inaccessibility of health facilities  [6] .\n\nThe success and sustainability of mHealth interventions require overcoming context-specific barriers and enhancing facilitators of mHealth implementation; these factors must be considered prior to intervention design. The WHO's \"Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025\" acknowledged the need to adapt digital health intervention implementation to unique national contexts, health situations, and trends, as well as a country's vision, available resources, and core values  [11] . The WHO's \"Recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening\" further identified key implementation enablers including health content aligning with recommended practices, intervention functionality, and greater leadership and governance  [6] . The WHO has emphasized that recognizing and addressing digital health implementation challenges uniquely faced by the least-developed countries is a large factor influencing the scalability and sustainability of emerging mHealth technologies  [11] . mHealth interventions in LMICs have had limited success due to a range of health system factors not considered during the development and implementation of interventions  [3] [4] [5] [15] [16] [17] . Many mHealth interventions in LMICs remain as pilot studies that investigate feasibility, usability, and effectiveness, and they have not been scaled-up for integration within the broader health care system  [17, 18] . mHealth initiatives have often been developed for use in higher-resource health systems, with little consideration of differing contexts affecting implementation, such as social norms around a health-promoting behavior or access to resources  [17] . Industry representatives, such as those from mobile phone providers, often push the scale-up of mHealth interventions rather than researchers, governments, or health workers  [19] . This excludes crucial end user perspectives when developing mHealth interventions and risks having market-driven motives unrelated to health care encouraging the scale-up of interventions  [19] . mHealth intervention teams also often fail to understand the relationship between users and mHealth technologies  [2, [19] [20] [21] . Previously reported barriers to the widespread adoption of mobile technologies that uniquely concern LMICs include poor mobile network coverage, limited health care workforce capacity, limited data access, or negative health worker and patient perceptions toward mHealth interventions  [3] [4] [5] [15] [16] [17] .\n\nAmong the limited number of published reviews evaluating mHealth implementation, there is a lack of rigorous evaluation regarding the design and implementation of mHealth interventions to aid policymakers  [3, 16, 20, 22, 23] .\n\nWe therefore conducted a narrative review of the existing literature to understand the determinants of mHealth implementation for infectious diseases in LMICs. The review aims to consider the broader context, drawing on a comprehensive health systems analysis framework."

The TICD framework is a comprehensive checklist of determinants of clinical practice developed to inform implementation research projects that are tailored to local conditions  [25, 26] . The framework can be applied beyond contexts of chronic diseases, as the framework broadly focuses on health system components that determine quality of care. It identifies 7 key domains: guideline factors (clinical care guidelines or mHealth as a \"guideline\"); health worker factors; patient factors; professional interactions; incentives and resources; capacity for organizational change; and social, political, and legal factors. Its strength lies in its emphasis on ensuring tailoring to local conditions, which is valuable to consider for LMIC interventions, and inclusion of contextual (including political and legal) and patient factors affecting implementation. The TICD framework is a comprehensive health systems framework aligned with the systems thinking framework, which considers interactions with the broader context and patient needs in addition to the structural components of a health system  [27] .\n\nThe framework was used to initially categorize the reported determinants of mHealth intervention implementation and was used to structure the reported findings in the results.

For example, users did not respond to mHealth intervention text message prompts because they were uncertain about how to use the personal identification number, were uncertain about how to respond to the message, or received little to no information about the background of the intervention  [7, 30, 33, 39, 40, 43] . Compatibility of the intervention with users' past experiences with either the technology and its use in health care, or the intended change in health care practice, was a key facilitator that aided in implementation. Existing familiarity with the intended behavior promoted by the intervention-such as antiretroviral treatment adherence, HIV testing, or general interactions with the health care systemfacilitated uptake  [21, 29, 35, 38, 41] . The mHealth intervention in Babili et al's study-WelTel, assessed for COVID-19 case and contact management-was previously implemented for HIV epidemic virtual care, which facilitated its implementation as users were familiar with the platform and its functionality  [32] . Similarly, health workers commented on how an app's alignment with existing practices of using the village clinic register increased the likelihood of engagement  [29] . Existing mobile phone use or interest in the use of new technologies were additional facilitators, as users were already familiar with making appointments, making calls, or using SMS technology  [8] [9] [10] 32, 33, 36, 37, 42] . Trustworthiness of the source of the recommendation given by the mHealth intervention facilitated implementation, particularly when the mHealth intervention intended to aid health workers in improving their health care practice or disease management  [10, 29, 32, 35, 40] ."

Health workers in Ide et al's study perceived the app as advantageous over existing systems, as the intervention aided in conducting more accurate, error-free community case management of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia, which facilitated uptake  [29] . Furthermore, for interventions for which the main users were health workers, attitudes toward the intervention were impacted by the perceived effect of the use of the intervention on the health worker's reputation. Ellington et al identified that the perceived loss of trust between patients and health workers in the health worker's ability to diagnose and treat patients due to their reliance on technology to deliver health care was a barrier to using the app  [9] . In contrast, Ide et al commented on how the app facilitated perceived professionalism  [29] .

Network problems were particularly prominent in geographically remote areas. Other barriers included technology that repeatedly malfunctioned (such as periodic freezing and system crashes) and limited access to technology support systems to troubleshoot technological problems  [7, 29, [32] [33] [34] 36, 38, 42, 43] .

Similarly, Ellington et al's study identified that the existing length of the appointment time was not compatible with mHealth intervention use as the time to complete a health assessment through the app took longer than the appointment duration  [9] . Straw et al commented on the compatibility of the mHealth intervention with the existing organization functionality to facilitate normal workflow as a facilitator of implementation  [40] . A lack of management and ownership of the intervention by health workers further contributed to a limited capacity for embedding the intervention within the health care facility  [39] ."

Babili et al commented on how the Rwandan government's support of digitization across all governmental sectors by offering resources for implementation aided the adoption of the digital health intervention  [32] .

Moreover, features such as a user-friendly interface and a streamlined workflow facilitated implementation, while an intervention design that increased the workload of health workers was a barrier to implementation  [32] .\n\nThe study by Mangam et al, whose reminder SMS system replaced the existing door-to-door reminders, uniquely commented on how the absence of face-to-face reminders increased the rate of forgetfulness and patients ignoring the messaging, thereby affecting its implementation  [8] ."

In 4 studies, the mHealth intervention did not lead to an improvement in the health outcome-responses to SMS prompts were low, preventative measures were worse than in the non-mHealth control group, or user uptake was low  [8, 33, 38, 42] . There were nonsignificant changes in health outcomes or behavior in 2 studies  [30, 43] . Quantitative health outcomes were not reported in 6 of the reviewed studies  [9, 10, 21, 32, 34, 36] .\n\nImproved outcomes may be explained by familiarity with the health behavior or technology  [7, 29, 35, 37, 41] , positive attitudes among health workers toward the technology  [29, 31, 35] , or ease of use of the mHealth technology  [7, 35, 37, 41] . Technological barriers, lack of familiarity with technology, and resource limitations  [8, 30, 33, 38, 42, 43]  may have reduced engagement with the intervention or the participants' ability to implement the behaviors enforced by the intervention, therefore diluting the intervention effect."

This relationship is visually depicted in Figure  2 .

Where an app or SMS design engaged users in a way that improved health outcomes, patient engagement with health care services, or health care efficiency, participants were less likely to perceive the use of the mHealth technology as burdensome, facilitating successful implementation  [9, [29] [30] [31] [32] [34] [35] [36] [38] [39] [40] [41] 43 ]. An intervention that provided a clear advantage compared to existing practice facilitated the perception of it being beneficial, as supported by the intervention's design and ease of use. These findings were consistent with Davis's Technology Acceptance Model and its application in health care, which suggests that perceived ease of use and usefulness both affect attitudes toward and use of technology  [46, 47] . Design considerations was an emergent factor unique to mHealth and technology-related interventions, emphasizing the value of iterative design of the mHealth intervention before implementation  [9, 10, 30, 34, 35, 37, 41, 42] . Further reviews reporting on mHealth in the context of antiretroviral therapy adherence and maternal health have identified the importance of intervention design, including tailoring SMS messages and the frequency of reminders  [48, 49] .\n\nPolitical support of the intervention ensured effective implementation; this included stakeholder buy-in and approval of the intervention, and support from health administrators on a district level  [9, 10, 32] . The importance of understanding the need for the intervention to reduce disease burdens or improve health care services is supported by a previous review by Opoku, Stephani, and Quentin  [50] . Therefore, regardless of the target user, perceived benefit of the intervention is crucial for implementation of the initiative, emphasizing the community-wide, integrated nature of mHealth interventions.\n\nHowever, studies by Kaunda-Khangamwa et al and Mangam et al noted that, despite the users' positive attitudes toward the intervention, factors such as lack of communication regarding intervention use and limited resources to implement the behavioral guideline hindered implementation  [8, 30] . Perceived value of the intervention and acceptance alone therefore cannot guarantee successful implementation and positive outcomes from an intervention."

Lack of awareness and clarity regarding how to engage with the intervention were consistently noted across studies with limited user engagement  [30, 33, 43] . Sufficient training has been previously noted in a review as a contributing factor to mHealth intervention implementation, which is closely linked to the perceived ease of use  [2] . For interventions aimed toward health workers, training was either provided by the intervention research team members or between health workers; follow-up on correct use was identified as being important for encouragement and continued intervention use  [7, 9, 10, 30, 42] ."

This suggests that successful mHealth initiatives complemented normative behavior, existing health care practices, and \"new\" practice (eg, interventions to improve treatment adherence), given their importance was already understood. This suggests mHealth has limited value in establishing new behavioral practices but rather is advantageous in complementing existing practices. Compatibility with existing behavior was strongly linked to the perceived benefit of the intervention; when the intended guideline was not yet an established practice or initially perceived as useful, mHealth interventions that encouraged this behavior were less likely to be accepted by the user  [21, 29, 35, 38, 41] . Ide et al's study commented on how the mHealth intervention facilitated existing practices of childhood infectious disease management and improved reliability of the tests  [29] .\n\nAlthough social norms (such as stigma) were only reported in 1 study  [34] , a number of studies commented on how users who were already comfortable sharing diagnoses or their health status were more engaged in the mHealth intervention, suggesting mHealth success is dependent on existing social norms and behaviors  [34, 39, 43] ."

An existing understanding of the benefit of mHealth interventions-or previous positive experiences with mHealth-also affected user uptake. This was indirectly seen in mHealth intervention uptake being influenced by the perceived impact of use on provider-patient relationships  [9, 29, 34] . This factor was conflicting across multiple studies, as Ide et al and Twimkukye et al commented on how the mHealth intervention facilitated perceived professionalism and improved providerpatient relationships, while Ellington et al noted the perceived decreased patient trust of the health worker to diagnose and treat the patient  [9, 29, 34] . A systematic review of maternal health interventions also identified that technological literacy and previous experience of mHealth use were enablers of mHealth uptake, among a range of other factors  [51, 52] ."

      "text": "The importance of capable infrastructure and resource availability have been noted by existing systematic reviews as key determinants of implementation  [2, 5, 15, [50] [51] [52] . Reviewed studies further confirmed this and noted the importance of staffing, network availability, technological support, and reliable technology in facilitating the implementation of the intervention  [9, 29, 33, 34, [36] [37] [38] 42, 43] . These factors were tightly linked to social, political, and legal factors (such as limited staff funding or unstable network coverage to remote areas); these barriers often reflected the greater health care system's resourcefulness. Analysis of the factors influencing implementation therefore emphasized the interaction of health system components and the importance of considering the broader context beyond the health care system, as described in the systems thinking framework  [27] . It is possible that due to the targeted, narrow nature of some of interventions, there was insufficient technological support or insufficient resources for successful implementation. Increased health data reporting on a health care system level could also contribute to improved resource allocation and policy decisions from sociopolitical organizations that could aid in mHealth implementation  [53] . This further emphasizes the importance of understanding the value of the intervention in improving health outcomes across all stakeholders, as it could result in securing increased funding for the improved implementation of the initiative.\n\nFurther determinants of implementation included the system's capacity for change, such as how the intervention fit into existing appointment durations and organizational leadership structures  [9, 36] . This limited capacity for change could reflect the unstable foundation and support of the health care systems within these communities and indicates a potential lack of preparation for future changes or health challenges. Existing reviews on mHealth implementation have also commented on the importance of considering the existing health care system, such as government funding and capacity, when implementing mHealth interventions  [2, 15, 16] ."

The diversity of study settings provides a broad range of factors to consider during implementation in different LMIC contexts. This review synthesized findings by drawing on a comprehensive health systems framework  [25]  and additional themes, further contributing to its novelty. However, our review had several limitations. First, most studies (15/20) were conducted in Africa, limiting generalizability to other regions. Second, it was challenging to weigh the relative importance of each implementation determinant in each study, as the included studies were all qualitative. Regardless, the findings provide insights that quantitative results would not have been able to capture. Third, all studies were limited in that data were mainly from patients, health workers, administrators, or assistants, rather than from a sociopolitical level. Fourth, we did not source the primary quantitative impact evaluations of mHealth interventions. For further study, quantitative outcomes from impact studies can be better correlated with the specific determinants-and their respective strength of association-of implementation."

For example, through pilot testing, Mangam et al identified the need to incorporate interactive voice messaging in their SMS intervention, as many users were unable to read or understand the texts  [8] . To complement the theoretical foundations of an intervention, studies emphasized the importance of stakeholder involvement in the iterative design process during the development of the initiative  [2, 8, 15, 16, 19, 20, 42] ."

Increased training will increase confident user engagement with the intervention for longterm improvement of health outcomes  [10, 33, 36] . Supplying mobile devices and offering technological support were recommended by studies to mitigate technological barriers  [9, 10, 36] .\n\nIt is important to tailor mHealth interventions to complement existing health services and face-to-face practices to optimize the desired health outcome. Adeagbo et al commented on how the mHealth intervention alone was insufficient in completely removing the barrier of accessing HIV testing and health care services  [41] . Mangam et al discussed how future mHealth-based mobile communication should complement the community's existing familiarity with interpersonal communication, particularly as their SMS notifications of health prevention measures were not met with improvement compared to the non-mHealth, face-to-face status quo  [8] . An example of complementing mHealth with non-technology-based communication is seen in the study by Bhattarai et al, who paired SMS text messaging with pamphlets  [37] ."
