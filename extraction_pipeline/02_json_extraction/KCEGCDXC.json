  "title": "Automated Text-Based Symptom Monitoring With Rapid Clinician Triage for Patients With Cancer and Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE Patients with cancer are at greater risk of developing severe symptoms from COVID-19 than the general population. We developed and tested an automated text-based remote symptom-monitoring program to facilitate early detection of worsening symptoms and rapid assessment for patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a feasibility study of Cancer COVID Watch, an automated COVID-19 symptommonitoring program with oncology nurse practitioner (NP)-led triage among patients with cancer between April 23 and June 30, 2020. Twenty-six patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Enrolled patients received twice daily automated text messages over 14 days that asked \"How are you feeling compared to 12 hours ago? Better, worse, or the same?\" and, if worse, \"Is it harder than usual for you to breathe?\" Patients who responded worse and yes were contacted within 1 hour by an oncology NP. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 62.5 years. Seventeen (65%) were female, 10 (38%) Black, and 15 (58%) White. Twenty-five (96%) patients responded to \u2265 1 symptom check-in, and overall response rate was 78%. Four (15%) patients were escalated to the triage line: one was advised to present to the emergency department (ED), and three were managed in the outpatient setting. Median time from escalation to triage call was 11.5 minutes. Four (15%) patients presented to the ED without first escalating their care via our program. Participant satisfaction was high (Net Promoter Score: 100, n = 4). CONCLUSION Implementation of an intensive remote symptom monitoring and rapid NP triage program for outpatients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection is possible. Similar tools may facilitate more rapid triage for patients with cancer in future pandemics.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic's spread through China and Italy in March 2020, it was recognized that patients with cancer were more likely to develop severe symptoms from COVID-19 than the general population.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Initial COVID-19 clinical data from these regions also suggested that patients generally experienced a symptomatic period of 8-14 days that preceded hospitalization.  4 Given the interval between symptom development and hospital admission, remote symptom monitoring was identified as a way in which oncology providers could identify patients requiring clinical escalation while also reducing unnecessary acute care encounters.  5, 6 tomated remote symptom-monitoring programs collect patient-reported data through web-, text-, or phonebased interfaces and identify responses requiring escalation, enabling physicians to hover over patients in nonclinical environments.  7 Remote symptom monitoring programs have been associated with lower symptom burden and hospitalization rates in oncology populations in the pre-COVID-19 era.  [8] [9] ] [10] [11]  Such programs have been adopted to monitor patients with suspected COVID-19 in the general population  5, 12  but may not consider the unique clinical characteristics of oncology patients nor enable oncology provider input. Specially, patients with cancer have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19,  13  higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19,  14  and often have symptoms (eg, fever or shortness of breath) from their malignancy or cancer treatment that must be differentiated from potential COVID-19 infection by clinicians experienced in managing patients with cancer. Given the continued persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility of future other pandemics, there is a clear need to assess the feasibility of remote symptom monitoring for patients with cancer at risk of COVID-19.\n\nTo meet the challenge of safely monitoring patients with cancer who tested positive or developed symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection in the outpatient setting, we created an automated text-based remote symptom-monitoring program with oncology nurse practitioner (NP) triage during the initial surge of patients with COVID-19 in Philadelphia. We chose a textbased interface to quickly implement a low-cost, simple, and scalable intervention that enables early identification of worsening symptoms and rapid escalation of symptomatic patients for triage. Here, we describe the utilization and outcomes of patients enrolled in an implementation study conducted during the initial months of the pandemic."

Cancer COVID Watch used the Way to Health platform,  15  an embedded system in the University of Pennsylvania Epic electronic medical record (EMR) that enables clinicians to enroll patients, receive escalation alerts from patients through EMR inboxes, and review and send text messages through the EMR inbox. The program was reviewed by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board, which determined it qualified as quality improvement; need for informed consent was waived."

Draft symptom check-ins, triage algorithm, and program process were presented at 13 tumor boards and refined iteratively by the study team and clinicians who attended the tumor boards. Near-final versions of the text message interface and symptom check-ins were presented to five thoracic oncology patients and two oncology infusion NPs for feedback. After integration of patient and provider feedback, Cancer COVID Watch was implemented."

      "text": "Oncology clinicians enrolled patients age \u2265 18 years with a diagnosis of cancer who received their cancer care at one of three Penn Medicine clinic locations in Philadelphia, PA, and tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction-based assay or were experiencing symptoms concerning for COVID-19. Patients were excluded if they were being tested for COVID-19 in the absence of symptoms and for the purpose of clearance for a procedure.\n\nEligible patients were enrolled in person or over the phone by clinicians through an order set in our EMR. After the clinician confirmed the patient's phone number and outpatient oncologist in the EMR, patients received a text message inviting their participation. Patients who accepted the invitation received daily automated symptom check-ins at 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM via text message. Patients who did not respond to the text message inviting their participation received follow-up invitations via text message. Patients who did not actively accept or decline any of the invitations were considered to have passively declined enrollment.\n\nEach symptom check-in asked, \"How are you feeling compared to 12 hours ago? Better, worse, or the same?,\" with subsequent messages varying based on the patient's answer (Fig  1 ). Participants who responded that symptoms were worse and wished to speak with a clinical team member or who reported worsening dyspnea were called by an oncology NP for triage within 1 hour during business hours. Patients could also escalate their care to our triage personnel by texting worse at any time. If patients sent a response that was not recognized by our algorithm, patients would receive an automated message stating \"I don't understand that response. Valid choices are:\" followed by the allowable responses as indicated in Figure  1 .\n\nPatient responses that required escalation triggered a message to an EMR inbox monitored by a designated oncology NP who routinely responds to symptom crises. NPs would subsequently review the patient's medical record"

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "We successfully implemented an automated remote textbased COVID-19 symptom-monitoring program for patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our data demonstrate high patient satisfaction with the program and an overall response rate of 78%, similar to other text message-based symptom-monitoring programs outside of cancer.  5 There were no differences in age, race, or insurance status between those who accepted and declined the invitation to enroll. Patients who did not have a health care appointment during the enrollment period were more likely to enroll in the intervention and may be more likely to engage with future interventions.\n\nSeventy-five percent of patients who escalated care via Cancer COVID Watch were managed as outpatients. There were four patients (15%) who presented to the ED without escalating via Cancer COVID Watch first. Since all four patients were admitted to the hospital for acute lifethreatening illnesses (COVID-19, pyelonephritis, Clostridium difficile colitis, or cancer-related chronic hypoxic respiratory failure), escalation within Cancer COVID Watch is unlikely to have changed their disposition to the ED.\n\nStrengths of Cancer COVID Watch include its integration in the EMR, high user satisfaction, and rapid implementation. EMR integration enabled oncology clinicians to directly enroll patients for closer observation and facilitated efficient communication to the patient's primary oncology providers. Given the ubiquity of electronic health records and no additional staff hiring or reconfiguration of roles, this intervention and its findings may be generalizable to other cancer settings. Cancer COVID Watch enrollees were highly satisfied, suggesting that the use and frequency of automated text messages in our program were user-friendly. c Overall response rate is the sum of all responses divided by the sum of all checkins, whereas the individual response rate refers to the calculation of response rates for each participant.\n\nHowever, only four patients responded to the user satisfaction survey question, thus limiting the generalizability of these findings. Finally, the successful rapid development and implementation of the program was in part because of our institutional infrastructure, given similar text-based symptom-monitoring programs have been used by our institution.  5 ere are multiple limitations associated with our singleinstitution study. First, Cancer COVID Watch was deployed after the initial peak of COVID-19, and thus, enrollment in this feasibility study was limited. Second, Cancer COVID Watch was limited to patients who speak English and have a mobile phone that can send and receive text messages. Although 96% of Americans have a cell phone, elderly and low-income individuals are less likely to have cell phones and have been most affected by COVID-19.  19, 20 Third, the Cancer COVID Watch algorithm could interpret only a limited number of responses. Patients occasionally sent descriptive messages with their current symptoms in response to checkins (eg, \"My temperature was 100.6 this morning\"), which the program could not interpret. Clinicians who enroll patients in similar programs should emphasize that these programs cannot understand complicated responses. Finally, the availability of NP and/or after-hours oncologist triage may limit the scalability of the program. Future iterations of Cancer COVID Watch will explore translating text into multiple languages, adopting a voice call option, automatically escalating patients who send concerning responses, and investigating the added clinician time necessary to maintain this program in a cancer care setting.\n\nIn conclusion, an automated text-based COVID-19 symptom monitoring-program is feasible in patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Similar efforts to manage patients with cancer who are symptomatic from other infections may feasibly use a similar approach with acceptable patient engagement."
