  "title": "Effectiveness of community-based participatory research (CBPR) interventions on mental health outcomes: A systematic review",
  "abstract": "Community-based participatory research (CBPR) promotes the significant involvement of community members in research, which helps increase the effectiveness of specific interventions for community members. However, no reviews have investigated the effectiveness of CBPR interventions in mental health outcomes nor the adherence level to CBPR principles. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to (1) examine the effectiveness of CBPR interventions on mental health outcomes and (2) assess the overall adherence to CBPR principles in existing mental health research. A systematic search was conducted in five databases for studies published between January 2000 and December 2022. We included 14 studies in this review based on our eligibility criteria. We assessed the effectiveness of quality appraisal and developed a four-dimensional rating scheme (degree of community involvement in the research process; level of shared decision-making between researchers and the community; level of contribution to community capacity building; level of addressing original health problems in the community) to assess the overall adherence to CBPR principles. Although CBPR interventions impacted mental well-being outcomes, research quality varied, and most studies did not adhere to CBPR principles. Future research using the rating scheme proposed in this study is recommended.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has emerged since the 2000s and has been predominantly used in the domains of public health, medicine, and nursing  (Collins et al., 2018; Wallerstein et al., 2018) . CBPR has been increasingly identified as a promising strategy to reduce health inequalities  (Hicks et al., 2024; O'Bryan et al., 2024; O'Mara-Eves et al., 2015; Ortiz et al., 2020) . Traditional research typically adopts a top-down approach and reinforces the epistemic privilege of academia; conversely, CBPR promotes a bottom-up approach that includes community members' voices and embraces their different ways of understanding the same topic compared to researchers  (Collins et al., 2018) . Importantly, CBPR highlights collaborative processes throughout the research process. By co-working with community stakeholders in all stages of research, from design to dissemination, CBPR encourages mutual learning of academics and community members and creates a sustainable, transformative impact extending beyond the completion of the research  (Wallerstein et al., 2018 (Wallerstein et al., , 2019a)) .\n\nAn abundance of literature has been developed in recent years to explain why CBPR works; examples include a CBPR logic model modified by Belone and colleagues in 2016 based on the work developed by  Wallerstein and colleagues in 2008 ; the logic model illustrates the domains and attributes of CBPR  (Belone et al., 2016; Wallerstein et al., 2008) . Another example includes the social movement approach model developed by Tremblay and colleagues in 2017, which highlights the key components of a CBPR process  (Tremblay et al., 2017) . Although these models provide a framework for understanding why CBPR can be used to address health inequalities, they do not explain how to implement a CBPR. The ten principles developed by Israel and colleagues in 2018 serve as guidelines for implementing CBPR that directly affect its practice. The ten guiding principles highlight that  (Israel et al., 2018) : CBPR (i) recognizes community as a unit of identity; (ii) builds on strengths and resources within the community; (iii) facilitates collaborative, equitable partnership in all research phases and involves an empowering and power-sharing process that attends to social inequalities; (iv) promotes co-learning and capacity building among all partners; (v) integrates and achieves a balance between research and action for the mutual benefit of all partners; (vi) emphasizes public health problems of local relevance and ecological perspectives that attend to the multiple determinants of health and disease; (vii) involves systems development through a cyclical and iterative process; (viii) disseminates findings and knowledge gained to all partners and involves all partners in the dissemination process; (ix) requires a long-term process and commitment to sustainability, and (x) addresses issues of race, ethnicity, racism and social class, and embraces \"cultural humility\". However, our initial review found that adherence levels to these principles varied in existing CBPR studies."

      "title": "1.1.. Reviews of the degree of community engagement in CBPR mental health studies",
      "text": "To date, twelve reviews related to CBPR for mental health have been published. A systematic review synthesizing studies that adopted CBPR to address mental health problems was published in 2011, highlighting the strengths and challenges of using CBPR in minority populations. Of the twenty studies reviewed, most described only mental health assessments and the development of academic community partnerships and programs in the CBPR process, indicating that CBPR is at its beginning. Stakeholders' involvement initially encompassed identifying communities' needs and recognizing community members as vital collaborators in addressing mental health issues among minorities  (Stacciarini et al., 2011) . Another review published in 2024 identified commonalities of intervention components in rural community-based mental health interventions in the United States. The review assessed the degree of community involvement in each study based on the nine principles by Israel and colleagues  (Israel et al., 2018) . The review found that only one out of ten studies satisfied six principles, and the rest satisfied with just two to three principles. However, the review focused on only rural mental health interventions in the US, which is unable to generate a holistic picture of all CBPR mental health interventions  (Mengell et al., 2024) ."

      "title": "1.2.. Review of elements in successful or unsuccessful CBPR interventions",
      "text": "A review that examined the appropriate elements contributing to a successful or unsuccessful CBPR intervention was published in 2012. It identified eight interventional studies that aimed to improve the health and well-being of community members. It reported individual study outcomes, and CBPR interventions were generally found to be effective in improving the health and well-being of communities and eliminating particular health inequalities  (Salimi et al., 2012) . However, the reviews did not examine the effectiveness of CBPR as an intervention in mental health research or the adherence level to CBPR principles."

      "text": "A systematic review that investigated studies using participatory methods on the relationship between consumer involvement process and related outcomes in technology-based mental health and well-being interventions for youth was published in 2015. Although the review highlighted that youths were involved in a consultative capacity; it was not possible to determine the impact of participatory research on intervention effectiveness due to a lack of outcome data  (Orlowski et al., 2015) . A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of co-designed mental health interventions for reducing anxiety and depression symptoms was published in 2024 (Greene  Barker et al., 2024) . The review identified eleven out of twenty studies that characterized the 'co-design' approach under the umbrella of CBPR. However, the review did not specifically include articles that only focused on CBPR interventions, which led to the results being unable to reflect the knowledge of CBPR intervention effectiveness."

      "title": "1.4.. Reviews of CBPR with specific populations",
      "text": "Seven reviews on conducting CBPR with specific populations were published between 2012 and 2024. These included racial-ethnic minorities  (De Ias Nueces et al., 2012; McFarlane et al., 2022; Ricks et al., 2022) , immigrants  (Vaughn et al., 2017) , youth  (Jacquez et al., 2013) , and refugees  (Filler et al., 2021) . Another one aimed to explore how people with lived experience have been involved in prison and forensic mental health research in patient and public involvement (PPI), which shares similar principles as CBPR  (Rutherford et al., 2024) . These reviews focused on the role of the specific population in the CBPR process and the strengths and challenges of engaging this population in CBPR. However, the selected populations in these reviews were relatively narrow.\n\nNone of the existing reviews examined the effectiveness of CBPR interventions in mental health outcomes or the adherence level to CBPR principles. They also focused on a narrow population. Therefore, this article aimed to address these gaps by systematically reviewing the effectiveness of CBPR interventions in mental health research on any population and their adherence level to CBPR principles."

      "title": "3.. Materials and method",
      "text": "We conducted the review according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines  (Page et al., 2021) . We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstract, ProQuest, and Web of Science, using search terms including community-based participatory research*, CBPR, and mental*. Supplementary Table  1  shows the full search strategy. We searched for publications from January 2000 to December 2022 as CBPR has gained popularity since the 2000s. We registered this systematic review on PROSPERO to ensure no duplication of the work (Prospero ID: CRD42022304446).\n\nWe deemed reviewed articles as eligible that: (a) reported an empirical study, (b) adopted a CBPR intervention in mental health studies (defined in consultation with three professors specialized in the mental health field and informed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) definition of mental disorder) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016), and (c) were published in English. We excluded descriptive studies, case studies, editorials, commentaries, letters to the editor, reviews, abstracts, conference papers, dissertations, protocols, and unpublished documents. We also excluded articles that did not evaluate mental health as a primary outcome. We also screened the reference lists of articles confirmed as eligible to identify other potential articles.\n\nWe formed a panel of three CBPR researchers [a PhD candidate (the first author) and two research assistants (the second and third author)], each of whom has more than three years of implementing the CBPR approach in mental health research to conduct this systematic review. We first imported all titles/abstracts into Rayyan, then exported the eligible full-text articles into Endnote. The first and second authors independently completed the title/abstract screening of the 3768 articles using Rayyan and the full-text assessment using Endnote. Agreement was reached on 96.8% of the articles. Disagreement on the remaining 3.2% was resolved through discussion. The first author extracted the data from all 14 eligible articles. Numerous raw data are extracted, including (i) study population; (ii) research aim; (iii) study design; (iv) sample size; (v) intervention; (vi) control; (vii) mental health outcomes (that are included but not limited to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016); (viii) major findings; (ix) community involvement (i.e. description of community members' involvement in the research process); (x) shared decision-making between researchers and the community (i.e. the partnership during the decision-making process, such as mutual respect, trust, and open communication; a clear decision-making process that implies an equal contribution of each stakeholder; a equal decision-making process in all research phases of a CBPR project); (xi) contribution to community capacity building (i.e. skills or knowledge enhancement of community stakeholders; trust building; long-term partnership or continued funding result from the CBPR project); and (xii) addressing original health problems in the community (i.e., disseminating the findings to participants; applying results to a health-related intervention or policy changes; committing to the sustainability of research-related interventions in the community) were extracted and entered into a spreadsheet. The second and third authors cross-checked the data extraction of each study. Conflicting evaluations were resolved through discussions."

      "title": "3.1.. Assessment of effectiveness and quality appraisal",
      "text": "Studies that adopted CBPR interventions on mental health outcomes underwent quality appraisal to gauge the validity of their purported effectiveness. After extracting data on intervention effectiveness as reported in the studies, we conducted a two-step quality appraisal. In Step 1, the first author assessed the level of evidence of the studies using the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) methodology. Level of evidence is a standardized way to determine the quality of a research project based on its study design  (Movsisyan et al., 2018; US Preventive Services Task Force, 1996) . In Step 2, the first author used different tools relevant to each research design to assess the risk of bias or the overall quality of the studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCT)/cluster-randomized studies were evaluated for the risk of bias using Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2)  (Sterne et al., 2018) . Quasi-experimental studies were evaluated for the risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studiesof Interventions (ROBINS-I)  (Sterne et al., 2016) . Single-group studies were evaluated for overall quality using The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality assessment tool for before-after (pre-post) studies with no control group  (Ma et al., 2020) . In this review, the assessment of evidence level for mental health outcomes was based on the research design, which meant that we assessed the risk of bias as part of the quality appraisal only for studies in the same evidence level category."

      "title": "3.2.. Developing the rating scheme to assess the overall level of adherence to CBPR principles",
      "text": "The panel developed a rating scheme to assess the level of adherence to CBPR principles modified from  Viswanathan et al. (2004)  and aligned with the ten principles stated in the literature  (Israel et al., 2018) . The overall level of adherence to CBPR principles was determined by four dimensions: (a) community involvement in the research process, which mainly links to principles iii and viii as these principles highlight the active involvement of community members in the CBPR process; (b) shared decision-making between researchers and the community, which mainly links to principles i and x as these principles highlight the joint and equal commitment of each unit of identity in the process; (c) contribution to community capacity building, which mainly links to principles ii, iv, vii, and ix as these principles highlight the transfer of knowledge and skills in the community for strength expansion and sustainability; and (d) addressing original health problems in the community, which mainly links to principles v and vi as these principles highlight tackling the initial health issues in the community. All panel members discussed and agreed upon the final rating scheme that reflected each criterion. All articles were rated by all panel members independently, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. We applied appraisal tools modified from the existing literature  (Jagosh et al., 2011 (Jagosh et al., , 2012) )  to assess the strength of each dimension (Table  1 ).\n\nDimension 1: Community involvement refers to involving community members in the research process. Community members' involvement in the research process was assessed in ten phases: (i) identification of research question/study population; (ii) study design (including drafting interview questions); (iii) measurement development; (iv) sample recruitment; (v) data collection; (vi) data analysis or interpretation of findings; (vii) dissemination of findings; (viii) intervention development/implementation; (ix) financial responsibility for grant funding, and (x) protocol development. Operationally, we rated the execution of each phase on a binary basis. Involving community members in at least six phases was rated high; 4-5 was rated medium; 3 or lower was rated low.\n\nDimension 2: Shared decision-making between researchers and the community refers to the degree of equal decision-making approach in the CBPR process, assessed by three items (report on the partnership during the decision-making process, such as mutual respect, trust, and open communication between stakeholders; report on a clear decisionmaking process that implies an equal contribution of each stakeholder, such as decisions made on a consensus agreement basis; and report on the equal decision-making process in all research phases of a CBPR project). No indication on any items was rated low; indication on any one of the three items was rated medium; indication on any two or above of the three items was rated high. Dimension 3: Contribution to community capacity building refers to the degree of empowerment of community members, assessed by three items (report on skills or knowledge enhancement of community stakeholders result from the CBPR project; report on trust building result from the CBPR project; and report on long-term partnership or continued funding result from the CBPR project). No indication on any items was rated low; indication on any one of the three items was rated medium; indication on any two or above of the three items was rated high.\n\nDimension 4: Addressing original health problems in the community refers to the degree of addressing health concerns of local relevance to the community involved, assessed by three items (report on disseminating the findings to participants; report on applying results to a healthrelated intervention or policy changes; and report on committing to the sustainability of research-related interventions in the community). No indication on any items was rated low; indication on any one of the three items was rated medium; indication on any two or above of the three items was rated high.\n\nBased on the four dimensions above, we developed a scoring system to rate the overall level of adherence. Each dimension is rated on a 3point Likert scale from 0 (low) to 2 (high). The sum scores of all four dimensions range from 0 to 8. A study was rated as high adherence if it was rated on a sum score of 5 or above, a study was rated as medium if it was rated on a sum score of 3-4. Studies with a sum score of 2 or below were rated low. We assessed the interrater agreement of the rating scheme by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) using R  (L\u00fcdecke et al., 2021; Ten Hove et al., 2022) . Panel members each completed the rating scheme, and this resulted in good interrater reliability (ICC = 0.89) (95% CI = 0.68-091) (Gallego-  Izquierdo et al., 2020) ."

In the eligibility phase, full-text screening was conducted for 215 studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 201 studies were excluded. Fourteen studies were included in this review.\n\nThe included studies were conducted mainly in the USA (n = 10), followed by Canada (n = 2), the UK (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1).

      "title": "4.2.. Evidence of CBPR Intervention's effectiveness on mental health outcomes",
      "text": "The research designs included RCTs (n = 3), a cluster-randomized trial (n = 1), a quasi-experimental design (n = 1), and single-group pre-and-post or single-group repeated measures (n = 9). Regarding quality appraisal, RCT and cluster-randomized trials were rated as Level I evidence, meaning that evidence was strong from such studies. A quasiexperimental design was rated as Level II-1 evidence, meaning that the evidence was moderate. Single-group pre-and-post or single-group repeated measures were rated as Level II-2 evidence, meaning that evidence was weak and obtained from cohort or case-control studies  (Movsisyan et al., 2018) .\n\nDepression: Four studies reported that study participants had significant improvements in depression  (Betancourt et al., 2020; Hergenrather et al., 2013; McGovern et al., 2008; Michael et al., 2008) ; one study reported study participants had improvement in depression over time, yet it was not significant  (Phinney et al., 2014) . One of these studies was rated as Level-I evidence, while three were rated as Level II-2 evidence. The Level-I study showed strong evidence that CBPR was an effective intervention in improving depression (\u03b2 = -0.9.20; p = .04; \u03b2 = -0.92; p = .01) (Betancourt et al., 2020) .\n\nStress: Four studies reported that study participants had significant improvements in stress  (Betancourt et al., 2020; Goodkind et al., 2017; Harley et al., 2020; Jacquez et al., 2019) . Two of these studies were rated as Level-I evidence and two as Level II-2 evidence. The risk of bias of the two Level-I evidence was rated as low and 'having some concerns', respectively. However, the Level-I study provided strong evidence of CBPR being an effective intervention in improving stress (\u03b2 = -0.42; p = .03; \u03b2 = -0.34; p = .001) (Betancourt et al., 2020) .\n\nMental Well-being: Three studies reported that the mental well-being of study participants improved significantly  (Beauchet et al., 2020; Hillman, 2002; Izquierdo et al., 2018) . One of these studies was rated as Level-I evidence, and two as Level II-2 evidence. The Level-I study provided strong evidence of CBPR's effectiveness in improving mental well-being (effect size d = 0.13; 95% CI, 36.7-51.4; p < .05) (Izquierdo et al., 2018) .\n\nQuality of Life or Mental-health-related Quality of Life: Two studies reported a significant improvement in study participants' quality of life or mental-health-related quality of life  (Beauchet et al., 2020; Izquierdo et al., 2018) . The evidence quality of these studies was rated Level-I and Level-II 2, respectively. The Level-I study provided strong evidence of CBPR's effectiveness in improving mental-health-related quality of life (effect size d = 0.92; 95% CI, 34.8-47.2; p < .05) (Izquierdo et al., 2018) .\n\nDaily Functioning: Two studies reported significant improvement in participants' daily functioning [effect size d = 0.45, p = 0.001  (McGovern et al., 2008) ], and improved in mean \u00b1 SD The Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) (pre-intervention, 8.51 \u00b1 3.08; post-intervention, 7.80 \u00b1 2.86; p = .01, effect size d = 0.24) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) (pre-intervention, 6.43 \u00b1 1.31; post-intervention, 5.62 \u00b1 1.09; p < .01, effect size d = 0.67)  (Spoelstra et al., 2019) ]. The evidence quality in both studies was rated Level II-2, with a fair risk of bias. Therefore, although CBPR intervention effectively improved daily functioning, the evidence was weak.\n\nSelf-esteem: Two studies reported significant improvement in study participants' self-esteem  (Hergenrather et al., 2013; Hillman, 2002) . The evidence quality in both studies was rated Level II-2. The overall quality of the studies was rated fair and bad, respectively. Therefore, although CBPR intervention was effective in improving self-esteem [M = 31.14, SD = 1.86), t (6) = 4.05, p = .007, effect size d = 0.75  (Hergenrather et al., 2013) ], the evidence was weak.\n\nSuicide Risk: One study reported a significantly reduced suicide risk among participants (age-adjusted IRR = 0.36; 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.93) (Oyama et al., 2006) . The study's evidence quality was rated Level II-1. Hence, there was moderate evidence that CBPR was an effective intervention for reducing suicide risk.\n\nAnxiety: One study reported anxiety reduction among study participants [(M = 4.85, SD = 2.41), t (6) = -2.40, p = .053], although it is not significant  (Hergenrather et al., 2013) . The evidence quality was rated Level II-2. Therefore, although CBPR intervention effectively reduced anxiety, the evidence was weak.\n\nLife Satisfaction: One study reported significantly improved life satisfaction among study participants (effect size d = 0.40, p = 0.001)  (McGovern et al., 2008) . Its evidence quality was rated Level II-2. Therefore, although CBPR intervention effectively improved life satisfaction, the evidence was weak.\n\nPsychosocial Functioning: One study reported a significant improvement in participants' psychosocial functioning (effect size d = 0.33, p = 0.007)  (McGovern et al., 2008) . The evidence quality was rated Level II-2. Therefore, although CBPR intervention effectively improved psychosocial functioning, the evidence was weak.\n\nCoping Self-efficacy: One study reported a significant improvement in study participants' coping self-efficacy [(M = 109.42, SD = 16.83), t (6) = 2.90, p = .027, effect size d = 0.59]  (Hergenrather et al., 2013) . The evidence quality was rated Level II-2. Therefore, although CBPR intervention effectively improved coping self-efficacy, the evidence was weak.\n\nTable  2  summarizes CBPR interventions on mental health outcomes.

      "text": "Based on the four-dimensional rating scheme of adherence to CBPR principles, we identified eleven studies (79%) with low adherence levels to CBPR principles, three studies (21%) with medium adherence levels to CBPR principles, and none with high adherence levels to CBPR principles (see Table  4 ). Supplementary Table  2  shows data extraction details of adherence to CBPR principles.\n\nDimension 1: Community Involvement in the Research Process. Seventyone percent of the studies (n = 10) only involved the community in three or fewer phases of the research process. These studies usually involved community members identifying the research question or study population, recruiting samples, and developing or implementing the intervention. Community members were less involved in interpreting research data or findings, indicating that the involvement of community members in the research process could have been improved.\n\nDimension 2: Shared Decision-making between Researchers and the Community. Eighty-six percent of the studies (n = 12) were rated low. These studies did not mention how decisions were made between researchers and different stakeholders.\n\nDimension 3: Contributing to Community Capacity Building. Fifty-seven percent of the studies (n = 8) were rated low. These studies did not provide any relevant description or only included a few sentences stating that the CBPR project could contribute to future research or culturally appropriate interventions. Forty-three percent of the studies (n = 6) were rated medium. These studies described the community capacity building of the CBPR research project, such as building trust and social connectedness with community members  (DiClemente-Bosco et al., 2022; Goodkind et al., 2017; Harley et al., 2020; Hergenrather et al., 2013; Izquierdo et al., 2018; McGovern et al., 2008) .\n\nDimension 4: Addressing Original Health Problems in the Community. Seventy-one percent of the studies (n = 10) were rated low. These studies did not describe how the findings were used to address original health problems in the community. Twenty-nine percent of the studies (n = 4) were rated medium. These studies provided specific descriptions of disseminating the research findings to community members or applying the results within the community  (Goodkind et al., 2017; Harley et al., 2020; Hergenrather et al., 2013; Izquierdo et al., 2018) ."

      "title": "5.. Discussion",
      "text": "This was the first systematic review to assess the effectiveness of CBPR interventions and adherence to the CBPR principles in mental health research. Fourteen studies were included in this review. Our review covered CBPR interventions on older adults, ethnic minorities, immigrants and refugees, and LGBT from four countries/regions. The evaluated mental health outcomes were diverse, encompassing depression, stress, mental well-being, quality of life or mental-health-related quality of life, daily functioning, self-esteem, suicide risk, anxiety, life satisfaction, psychosocial functioning, and coping self-efficacy. Our review produced two major findings. First, we found that although all the reviewed articles reported positive mental health outcomes, the quality of these studies varied. Second, most studies did not adhere to CBPR principles. We developed a four-dimensional rating scheme with distinct indicators of adherence to CBPR principles, which could be helpful for future research to implement and report the CBPR process and outcomes.\n\nCBPR interventions were found to be effective for various mental health outcomes. This finding aligned with previous review articles  (De Ias Nueces et al., 2012; McFarlane et al., 2022; Salimi et al., 2012) , showing CBPR interventions to be generally effective in improving the health and well-being of communities and eliminating specific health inequalities. We extended the previous review article by assessing the quality of each study. We found that the quality of the studies varied, and not all positive mental health outcomes were associated with Level-I quality evidence. We recommend further CBPR intervention research adopt a rigorous research design to explore their effectiveness and enrich the field by generating Level-I evidence. Yet, vulnerable communities may distrust traditional rigorous researchers-led study designs. Hence, discussion between researchers and community partners is needed to share their perspectives, and ultimately make joint decisions to work on a research design that optimizes both scientific rigor and community knowledge and cultural practices  (Brown and Stalker, 2021) . Furthermore, we found that three out of four studies with Level-I quality evidence were conducted among immigrants and/or refugees. It might be because immigrants and refugees are often marginalized and excluded from mainstream society due to language barriers, cultural  differences, and discrimination. They possess unique cultural beliefs and practices, and CBPR provides a platform for these populations to be heard and involved in the research process  (Filler et al., 2021) . Seventy-eight percent of studies had low adherence to CBPR principles or did not report adherence. This might be because researchers did not adhere to CBPR principles at all, as they were utilizing a traditional top-down research protocol, or researchers did not report the CBPR process even though they adhered to the principles, as there is a lack of a protocol for documenting the CBPR process. Looking into each dimension, we found that 71 percent of studies had low adherence to community involvement in the research process. Stakeholder involvement within the research process was more at the beginning of the research stages, such as identifying research questions or the study population. Conversely, stakeholders' involvement was limited in the later research stages, such as analyzing the data and interpreting or disseminating findings. This might be because community members' involvement in the identification of research questions was identified as the area contributing to successful outcomes  (Jagosh et al., 2012) . The limited stakeholders' involvement in each stage of the research implies a more active participation in the CBPR process will be needed  (Mengell et al., 2024; Stacciarini et al., 2011) . Future research may consider how each dimension or sub-dimension affects the CBPR intervention's effectiveness and modify the ratings of our scheme if necessary. Eighty-six percent of studies had low adherence levels to shared decision-making between researchers and the community, 57 percent had low adherence levels to contributing to community capacity building, and 71 percent had low adherence levels to addressing original health problems in the community. Although all these are deemed essential principles of CBPR, our review found that most studies did not report these dimensions. Hence, these dimensions need to be clarified. A protocol for implementing and documenting the CBPR process would help researchers to standardize and appraise knowledge gained from CBPR studies, thus furthering scholarly exchanges in this field. Although existing reporting guidelines such as Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public 2 (GRIPP2)  (Staniszewska et al., 2017)  and the assessment scheme by Mercer and colleagues  (Mercer et al., 2008)  share some dimensions as CBPR, they may not be fully applicable to reporting on community involvement in CBPR. GRIPP2 was developed specifically for reporting on patient and public involvement in research studies, while Mercer and colleagues' work was for any form of participatory research (PR). We recommend future CBPR studies implement and document the CBPR process by adopting our four-dimensional rating scheme as we highlighted the use for CBPR studies specifically with unique ideologies highlighted in CBPR principles, such as equal partnership and addressing original health problems in the community  (Wallerstein et al., 2018) .\n\nOur cross-over comparison of the level of evidence and adherence level to CBPR principles shows that fifty percent of the studies had weak evidence and low adherence to CBPR principles. It appears that most CBPR studies adopted single-group pre-and-post or single-group repeated measures in their intervention design; it may be because CBPR interventions prioritize the well-being and autonomy of community members. A single group pre-and-post study design may be considered more ethical than a randomized controlled trial, as it does not involve withholding an intervention from a control group  (Stratton, 2019) . Additionally, the cross-over comparison of the intervention's effectiveness and sum scores on the four-dimensional rating scheme reveals a positive correlation between adherence to CBPR principles and effect size. For both studies that had a larger intervention effect size and a higher sum score on the four-dimensional rating scheme  (Hergenrather et al., 2013; Izquierdo et al., 2018) , there was a medium rating on Dimension 3 (Contributing to Community Capacity Building) and Dimension 4 (Addressing Original Health Problems in the Community). This suggests that the intervention is more effective and valid when community capacity is enhanced during the process, and when community members' concerns are addressed  (Wallerstein et al. ,  Dimension 1: Execution of each phase on a binary basis. Involving community members in at least six phases was rated high; 4-5 was rated medium; 3 or lower was rated low. Dimension 2: Three items were used to assess the decision-making mechanism (report on the partnership during the decision-making process, such as mutual respect, trust, and open communication between stakeholders; report on a clear decision-making process that implies an equal contribution of each stakeholder, such as decisions made on a consensus agreement basis; and report on the equal decision-making process in all research phases of a CBPR project). No indication on any items was rated low; indication on any one of the three items was rated medium; indication on any two or above of the three items was rated high. Dimension 3: Three items were used to assess the decision-making mechanism (report on skills or knowledge enhancement of community stakeholders resulting from the CBPR project; report on trust building result from the CBPR project; and report on long-term partnership or continued funding result from the CBPR project). No indication on any items was rated low; indication on any one of the three items was rated medium; indication on any two or above of the three items was rated high. Dimension 4: Three items were used to assess the decision-making mechanism (report on disseminating the findings to participants; report on applying results to a health-related intervention or policy changes; and report on committing to the sustainability of research-related interventions in the community). No indication on any items was rated low; indication on any one of the three items was rated medium; indication on any two or above of the three items was rated high.\n\nOverall and scoring: Each dimension is rated on a 3-point Likert scale from 0 (low) to 2 (high). The sum scores of all four dimensions range from 0 to 8. A study was rated as high adherence if it had a sum score of 5 or above, a study was rated as medium if it had a sum score of 3-4, and studies with a sum score of 2 or below were rated low. ). Yet; our findings were synthesized from four pre-and-post studies that reported the effect size; more studies are needed to critically examine the association. We recommend future research to synthesize the results with a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between the two variables when there is more evidence in the field. A lack of CBPR interventions was found in low-and middle-income countries. Although CBPR could enhance the validity of intervention, only one was conducted in Japan, and the rest were conducted in Western countries. CBPR is culturally sensitive because community members are involved in the research process  (Stacciarini et al., 2011) . Therefore, future CBPR research should be conducted in low and middle-income countries, and specific guidelines for CBPR execution would be needed in different cultural contexts.\n\nThis systematic review has several limitations. We included studies published in peer-reviewed journals only, excluding unpublished reports or conference proceedings, given that articles published in peerreviewed journals should be the most reliable and easily accessible database for international researchers and policymakers. We excluded studies published before 2000 to yield more updated results of CBPR processes. We also excluded studies that did not focus on any mental health aspect as a primary outcome because they did not fall within the scope of the research. Another limitation is that most journals publish traditional top-down research and do not provide space to expand on the CBPR processes. Therefore, our coding is limited to what is presented in the article.\n\nThe review has significant implications for future practice and  research. First, more CBPR interventions with a rigorous research design to improve mental health should be conducted. Second, the review provides new insight into the CBPR field by creating a four-dimensional rating scheme regarding adherence to CBPR principles. Researchers and practitioners can use our findings to design, evaluate, and report their CBPR process."
