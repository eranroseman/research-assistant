  "title": "Palliative Care Use in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction and Do-Not-Resuscitate Status From a Nationwide Inpatient Cohort",
  "abstract": "Objective: To examine the predictors, treatments, and outcomes of the use of palliative care in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who had a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. Patients and Methods: Using the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sampling database for 2015-2018, we examined the predictors, in-hospital procedures, and outcomes of palliative care recipients among patients with AMI who had a DNR order. Results: We identified 339,270 admissions with AMI that had a DNR order, including patients who received palliative care (n\u00bc113,215 [33.4%]). Compared with patients who did not receive palliative care, these patients were more frequently younger (median age, 81 vs 83 years; P<.001), were less likely to be female (50.9% [57,626 of 113,215] vs 54. 7% [123,652 of 226,055]; P<.001), and were more likely to present with cardiac arrest (11.6% [13,133 of 113,215] vs 6.9% [15,598 of 226,055]; P<.001). Patients were more likely to receive palliative care at a large (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.44 to 1.50) or teaching (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 2.04 to 2.16) hospitals compared with small or rural ones. Patients receiving palliative care were less likely to be treated invasively, with reduced rates of invasive coronary angiography (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.47) and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.48), and were more likely to die in the hospital (52.4% [59,325 of 113,215] vs  22.9% [51,766 of 226,055]). \n Conclusion: In patients who had a DNR status and were hospitalized and received a diagnosis of AMI, only one-third received palliative care.",

      "text": "The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest all-payer inpatient health care database in the United States, was developed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  7 Since 2012, the NIS samples discharge from all hospitals participating in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, approximating a 20% stratified sample of all discharges from US community hospitals.\n\nWe analyzed all adult (18 years) patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of AMI who also had a DNR status from October 1, 2015, through December 31, 2018. Patient and procedural characteristics were extracted using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes provided in Supplemental Table  1  (available online at  http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). Information on patient demographic characteristics were recorded for each hospital discharge, including age, sex, race, admission day (weekday or weekend), expected primary payer, and median household income according to zip code. Patients with missing data for age, sex, elective admission, weekend admission, and mortality status were excluded from the analysis. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) or elective admissions were also excluded from the analysis (Supplemental Figure  1 , available online at  http://www.mayoclinicpro  ceedings.org ). Each discharge record had information on up to 30 diagnoses. A full list of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes used to identify receipt of palliative care as well as other patient characteristics and complications is provided in Supplemental Table  1 . We also used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes to identify procedural information during hospitalization.\n\nThe main outcome measured was inhospital all-cause mortality. Other outcomes included in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and major bleeding. We defined MACCE as a composite of all-cause mortality and acute ischemic CVA or transient ischemic attack. Major bleeding events were defined as a composite of gastrointestinal, retroperitoneal, intracranial, and intracerebral hemorrhage; periprocedural hemorrhage; unspecified hemorrhage; or need for a blood transfusion. Destination of discharge and receipts of invasive procedures such as invasive coronary angiography (ICA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mechanical ventilation, and circulatory support were also measured.\n\nContinuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range due to skewed data, and categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages. Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson c 2 test, while continuous variables were compared using the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Sampling weights were used to calculate the estimated total discharges as specified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between demographic characteristics and comorbidities and receipt of palliative care, as well as the association between receipt of palliative care and in-hospital outcomes and procedures among patients with DNR status, all expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% CIs. The models were adjusted for baseline differences be-  When adjusted for important baseline characteristics and comorbidities (Table  3 ), patients receiving palliative care had lower odds of ICA (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.47) and PCI (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.48) and higher odds of adverse inhospital clinical outcomes such as mortality (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 3.13 to 3.23), acute ischemic CVA (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.95 to 2.06), MACCE (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 3.03 to 3.13), and major bleeding (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.33).\n\nOur key study findings are summarized in the Figure."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The results of this analysis of more than 300,000 patients with a DNR status who were admitted to US hospitals between 2015 and 2018 and during the hospitalization received a diagnosis of AMI revealed several important findings. First, only 1 of 3 patients in this heterogeneous group received palliative care. Second, patients less frequently received palliative care if they were female or presented with cardiovascular risk factors including previous MI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or smoking, whereas they were more likely to receive palliative care if they had comorbidities including heart failure, malignancy (solid or hematologic), or metastatic cancer. Third, they were less likely to obtain palliative care if they presented at a small hospital compared with a medium or large hospital or presented to a rural hospital compared with a suburban or teaching hospital. Fourth, patients who were in receipt of palliative care were less likely to receive in-hospital procedures including ICA and PCI. Finally, patients with a DNR status who obtained palliative care had increased adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, acute ischemic CVA, major bleeding, and MACCE.\n\nOur study identified several patientrelated characteristics that were associated with palliative care use, including ventricular arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock or arrest, STEMI, and malignancy. It is likely that physicians recognize these high-risk factors and subsequently provide palliative care to these patients. Importantly, the frequency of patients receiving circulatory support or mechanical ventilation was significantly higher in the cohort that received palliative care. This is an unexpected finding because one of the key principles of palliative care is deescalation of treatments. Thus, it is possible that this finding is a reflection of treatment failures. This finding raises questions about the appropriateness of such interventions when it may have been more appropriate to get early involvement with palliative care. Our analysis, like that of others, 5 revealed that both the size and type of hospital played an important role in which patients received palliative care. Patients in teaching and urban hospitals were more likely to receive palliative care than those in rural ones. Access to palliative care has been found to be an important proxy outcome measure to determine the quality of care patients receive prior to death, such that in 2014 the World Health Organization made a global resolution to improve palliative care access as a core component of health care.  8, 9 Although access to health care is both a complex and multidimensional concept,  10  it is likely that institutional factors and geography are implicated in less frequent palliative care in patients who were treated in rural and small hospitals. Chukwusa et al  9  found considerable variations in geographic access to inpatient hospice, with evidence that patients who lived further away from hospice locations were less likely to die in a hospice facility. There may be both a lack of availability of palliative care and awareness of the need for this care in the AMI population. Observations that this disparity of care exists for this heterogeneous group of patients with AMI are an important step forward because better access to palliative care is likely to reduce this disparity gap.\n\nOur analysis demonstrates that sex disparities exist, with women who have a DNR status being less likely than their male counterparts to receive a palliative care consultation. This finding is surprising because another recent study in an unselected cohort of patients with AMI reported that females were more likely to receive palliative care.  5 Similarly, Saeed et al  11  reported that in patients diagnosed with cancer, women were significantly more likely to prefer palliative care than men, whereas a multisite prospective cohort study by Sharma et al  12  found that men with cancer were more likely to receive aggressive nonbeneficial intensive care near the end of their life. We previously reported that females who were diagnosed with AMI were more likely than men to have a DNR order.  3 In this high-risk cohort of patients, it is likely that there is a complex interplay between a person's own wishes and priorities toward the end of their life. Given that the presentation and perception of the symptoms of AMI differ between the sexes, it is possible that this may also be a factor in the differences of management.  13, 14 It is important to recognize that there are differences in the use of palliative care in this cohort based on race. In our study, patients who were Black and Asian/Pacific Islander were more likely to receive palliative care consultation than White patients, whereas Hispanic patients were less likely to receive such care than White patients. In a previous populationbased study of 1212 patients, Ornstein et al  15  found that Black individuals were significantly less likely to use hospice and more likely to undergo intensive treatment in the last 6 months of their lives than White individuals regardless of cause of death.\n\nAlthough patient preference and cultural differences are a key factor in differences in the use of palliative care, it is reassuring to see that in this high-risk cohort of patients, Black individuals are not disadvantaged in the receipt of palliative care. Although the AMI cohort of patients who have a DNR order represents a group that generally has poor outcomes and is less likely to receive invasive management compared with those without a DNR order,  3  our analysis revealed that patients who receive palliative care are even less likely to undergo invasive management. One of the key facets of palliative care is \"active listening,\" in which equal importance is placed on patients' attitude regarding their condition and understanding their fears, concerns, and priorities.  [16] [17] 7] [18]  In conditions such as heart failure and cancer, patients with advanced disease often have a preference to not be treated aggressively, with the focus on prioritizing their quality of life.  19 Our results suggest a similar pattern in this high-risk cohort of patients with AMI in which the focus of management is likely to be patient-centered and less focused on interventions that prolong life. The clinical outcomes for patients with AMI including mortality, acute ischemic CVA, major bleeding, and MACCE were significantly worse in patients who received palliative care. This finding is likely multifactorial and in part may be that the patients receiving palliative care are likely to represent a more unwell group of patients who would generally have worse clinical outcomes and may thus be less likely to be offered life-prolongingefocused interventions. Importantly, our study does not have temporal data on the timing of the DNR order, receipt of palliative care, or its relationship with the timing of the AMI. Thus, it is important to recognize that the group of patients who received palliative care in this cohort reflects a highly heterogeneous group of patients. For instance, patients may range from those who had a multimorbidity burden and a preexisting DNR order who were subsequently hospitalized with a noncardiac cause and had an AMI in the hospital to those who were previously well, were admitted to the hospital with an AMI, and initiated a DNR order and palliative care in the hospital following a catastrophic complication. Thus, there exists a highly complex interplay of the receipt of palliative care and its timing in relationship to both a DNR order and the timing of the AMI. For many conditions such as cancer, the initiation of a DNR order has become synonymous with the involvement of palliative care and recognition that the priority of care for the patient and their families should be switched to prioritizing comfort.  20 Importantly, this relationship has not been well defined for AMI, and differences are likely given the varied patient populations and treatments in comparison to patients who have cancer.  21 Thus, our study raises questions about the timing of palliative care within the realms of AMI in view of the immediate lifesaving treatments available, particularly PCI for patients with STEMI. In the past decade, both DNR orders and palliative care have been used increasingly in an ICU setting, both for patients who are expected to die in the ICU and for those discharged either to home or to another department within the hospital, where early involvement has been found to be beneficial.  22, 23 Given the parallels between ICU care and cardiac diseases, it is likely there are lessons to be learned on the timing of involvement of palliative care for patients with AMI by looking at successful use in the ICU.\n\nOur analysis has important clinical implications for practice. Cardiology as a specialty has often been criticized for its reluctance to utilize palliative care, largely attributed to advances in cardiovascular sciences over the past 20 years that allow patients with advanced heart disease to survive events that previously would have been fatal.  [24] [25] 5] [26]  It is important to recognize that a DNR order only reflects the desires of a patient once they experience a full cardiopulmonary arrest and does not reflect their preferences about other forms of life-sustaining treatment. Thus, in this high-risk cohort of patients with poor outcomes, it is likely that increased use of palliative care will have significant benefits for patients and their families in deciding which treatments they would be willing to accept and focusing on their key priorities.  27 f concern, the lower rates of discharge to home with home health care or to a nursing home suggests that in this cohort, palliative care was mostly being reserved as end-of-life care for those identified as at high risk of dying during that hospitalization. \"Late\" use of palliative care has been reported similarly by others,  28  and cardiologists are increasingly being asked to reframe palliative care as a useful added layer of support for those with advanced illness, not just in the final weeks of life but potentially over months and years.  29, 30 There are several barriers to earlier referral,  31  but greater education for physicians and integrated-care pathways with palliative care teams are likely to facilitate a more timely patient-centered approach.\n\nThis study has several strengths. Our analysis represents the largest study to date that examined the use of palliative care in a heterogeneous high-risk group of patients with a diagnosis of AMI who had a DNR status. The NIS database gives insight into the real-world in-hospital outcomes in a large and unselected cohort of patients with AMI, including those who are at high risk and have multiple comorbid illnesses, such that they are underrepresented in clinical trials. The size of the database provides sufficient power to detect differences in adverse outcomes between the 2 cohorts of interest.\n\nOur study also has several important limitations. Despite the NIS using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes and being a validated data set for the purposes of cardiovascular research,  32, 33  it is an administrative data set, and coding error may be a source of bias. The identification of AMI, DNR status, palliative care, comorbidities, and procedural data was based on the use of administrative codes. Second, the NIS data set only records in-hospital outcomes, and therefore, longer-term followup of mortality or other adverse outcomes is missing from our analysis. Third, because the database does not include pharmacotherapy, we were unable to determine if there was a significant disparity in care between the 2 groups regarding pharmacotherapy or to see if the use of pharmacotherapy altered clinical outcomes for those patients with palliative care. Furthermore, the NIS does not capture when the DNR order was instituted, whether it was in place prior to admission,  34  at the point of admission, or during the inpatient episode following a complication/adverse outcome. Thus, the intention of the palliative care is unknown. Similarly, we do not know the timing of the palliative care in relationship to the diagnosis of AMI (even though there is a suggestion that it might be late) or to the DNR status. Importantly, we also don't know whether receipt of palliative care means that patients received highquality palliative care, nor that they received specialist palliative care consultation. It is also possible that unmeasured confounders such as frailty or malnutrition may contribute to the adverse association that we report in patients referred for palliative treatment. Finally, the process by which the palliative care was established and how patients' preferences were elicited in decision making is unknown."

Patients who received palliative care had increased adjusted odds of inhospital mortality, acute ischemic CVA, major bleeding, and MACCE. Further evaluation of the use of palliative care, particularly in patients who had a DNR order in place prior to admission with an AMI, is required to determine its appropriateness and to facilitate greater use in this high-risk cohort of patients."
