      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Individuals living in western countries are increasingly inactive  (1) , which can lead to numerous serious health issues  (2) . A promising method to increase physical activity (PA) are mobile health (mHealth) interventions, such as smartphone PA applications  (3) (4) (5) . Smartphones are well-integrated into people's lives, enable low-effort continuous activity tracking, and can provide continuous feedback throughout the day  (6) . Furthermore, with the rapid evolving technological advances in artificial intelligence, enormous potentials arise for the development of more personalized and adaptive apps  (7) .\n\nThe potential of mHealth apps to increase PA among adults has not gone unnoticed, as a large variety of mHealth apps has been developed and evaluated the last decade  (3, 4, 8) . For instance, several apps have been developed that aim to increase walking by means of a step count app [e.g.,  (9, 10) ] or step count apps with additional text messages [e.g.,  (11) ]. Yet, while some mHealth apps successfully increase PA [e.g.,  (11, 12) ], others do not [e.g.,  (13, 14) ]. It is not well-understood why this is the case  (4) .\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint the cause of this discrepancy in the effectiveness, since mHealth apps are not always described in sufficient detail  (15) . Hence, it is unclear what the \"active ingredients\"  (16)  of the apps are (such as feedback and goal setting) and how these are operationalized in the app. Furthermore, it is not clear which development methods and processes are effective for designing apps. To illustrate, some development processes place a large emphasis on involving the end user in the process  (17) , while others draw heavier on the theoretical embedding of the mHealth intervention  (18, 19) . To gain more insight into how to design and develop effective apps, mHealth researchers are called upon to report their intervention characteristics and the development process in more detail  (20, 21) ."

      "title": "Developing mHealth Interventions",
      "text": "Developing mHealth applications is a complex undertaking, involving many stakeholders (including the end users), working within technical and time limitations, and making difficult decisions regarding the practical implementation of theories in the app designs [i.e., the \"theory intervention gap\"  (22) ].\n\nTo aid the development of effective mHealth interventions, numerous frameworks have been proposed [e.g.,  (20, (22) (23) (24) (25) ]. These frameworks often differ in approach. For instance, some frameworks provide a step-wise instruction to develop an mHealth intervention [e.g., the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework  (20)  and the MRC framework  (23) ], while others provide guidance for specific steps such as the translation of behavioral theories to persuasive strategies [e.g., the behavioral intervention technology (BIT) model;  (24) ].\n\nAlthough the frameworks describe different developmental processes, there are certain steps that are common in the frameworks. First, several frameworks stress the importance of involving potential end users in different phases of the development process, in order to enable the researchers to integrate these needs in the intervention  (20) (21) (22) 26) . Furthermore, feasibility testing prior to large-scale effect studies is recommended not only to gain insights into the usability and acceptability of the app but also to explore if the users enjoy using the app and its individual persuasive strategies  (20) (21) (22) 26) .\n\nMoreover, most, if not all, frameworks argue that mHealth interventions should be grounded in theory. In other words, the intervention should be based on an understanding of the target behavior and the determinants that constitute behavior (change). Subsequently, the intervention should be designed to target these determinants of behavior. By understanding how apps are designed to change behavior, we can better determine the working mechanisms of the mHealth intervention. Therefore, we will discuss the determinants that constitute PA below."

      "title": "Conceptual Model for PA Behavior",
      "text": "There are many factors that underlie PA behavior, such as goals  (27) (28) (29) , motivation  (30) , emotions  (31) , habits  (32) , perceived risk  (33) , and various factors that lie outside of the individual  (34) . These determinants of behavior are described in many different theories, but the abundancy and fragmentation of behavioral theories make it difficult to apply them in an mHealth app  (35) . In a pursuit to design a general model that captures this wide range of factors, the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) model was developed  (25) . The COM-B offers a practical starting point for intervention design that can be enriched by specific theories such as the Self-Determination Theory  (30, 36) , socio-ecological models  (34) , goal-setting theory  (27) (28) (29) , and behavior economics  (37) . The COM-B posits that to engage in a behavior (B), individuals must be physically and psychologically capable (C), their social and physical environment has to offer the opportunity (O), and they have to be motivated (M). The model holds a very broad definition of motivation, which includes all automatic processes of behavior, such as emotions and impulses, as well as conscious processes such as intention and choice.\n\nIn addition to the COM-B model, Fogg's Behavior Model (FMB)  (38, 39)  argues that the individual will not automatically perform the behavior if the opportunity, capability, and motivation are high enough  1  . Rather, according to the FMB, the individual will then be in a \"moment of opportunity, \" in which the individual can be persuaded to engage in PA if she received a trigger. A trigger can be external, such as a notification or seeing somebody else performing sports. Triggers can also be internal, such as feeling restless or bored. In mHealth interventions, providing an external trigger at \"a moment of opportunity\" has been coined as just-in-time (adaptive) interventions (JITAIs)  (7) .\n\nBased on the COM-B model and the FBM, we developed a conceptual model that describes the main concepts of interest and pathways leading to the target behavior, namely PA (Figure  1 ). We expect that when the capability, motivation, and opportunity of individuals to engage in PA is high, a \"moment of opportunity\" arises. If the participant receives a cue to action at such a moment, she will engage in PA behavior."

The behavior change wheel was used to provide a theoretical foundation of the app and to gain a deeper understanding of how the app intents to facilitate behavior change  (25) . Furthermore, based on the suggestions from the IDEAS framework, we incorporated the needs and wishes of end user in different phases in the design process and we will perform a feasibility study  (20, 23) . Lastly, the BIT model  (24)  was used to guide the practical implementation and design of the persuasive strategies in the app.\n\nThe development of the PAUL app consists of two phases (Figure  2 ). It started as a 1-year research project, in which a first version of the app was designed. The aim of this 1-year project was to explore whether location-specific information on performing PA is an enhancement for a PA app. After this 1year project, we continued the development of the app in a larger project (phase 2), allowing for a more structured development and evaluation of the app. Nine steps were taken to design the PAUL app, of which steps one to three were part of phase one of the project, and steps four to nine are part of the second phase.\n\nSteps 1-5 are described in the METHODS section and steps 6 and 7 in the RESULTS section. Step 8 is currently being carried out, and the results will be presented in a separate paper. Step 9 is planned after the feasibility study, under the condition that the PAUL app is a feasible intervention to increase PA."

      "text": "The project originated from a request from the municipality of Amsterdam, with a call for novel initiatives that include innovative technologies to motivate individuals to engage more in PA around certain parks of Amsterdam (Oosterpark and Sloterplas). During exploratory discussions with the municipality, it became clear that the municipality was especially interested in (1) using smartphone applications in combination with beacon technology foot_3  and (2) interventions that were accessible and affordable for a large group of residents that could benefit from performing more PA (i.e., individuals that are not meeting the PA guidelines). Hence, the intervention should include PA behavior that can be performed by most individuals without having to perform a course or buying expensive materials (i.e., running and walking).\n\nAfter the discussion with the municipality, we performed explorative interviews to determine the needs and wishes of potential end users. Through snowball recruiting, we included 10 adults who were between 18 and 65 years, who owned a smartphone, and who lived close to the parks (less than a 5min bike ride). Participants living close to these parks were targeted because of the municipality's requirement to develop an intervention to make this area more attractive for performing PA. Both the ratio of men and women and age distribution were taken into account when recruiting participants. All participants were informed about study participation and signed an informed consent prior to the interviews.\n\nThe interviews were performed according to a topic list that included questions on the types of PA they are performing and/or they would prefer to perform, experiences with exercise applications, perceptions of the Oosterpark, the motivations and barriers to engage in PA, and how application functionalities could help them to overcome the barriers and  also which barriers they perceived for performing PA and how they could be surpassed (see step 2). The interviews were recorded and transcribed by one researcher. Coding was done manually and both deductive and inductive coding was used.\n\nFive females and five males (between 24 and 59 years) were interviewed. Most engaged in regular active transport (n = 8), but they did not engage in leisure time PA (n = 8). During the interviews, participants explained that merely running or walking in the park gets boring very quickly. Hence, they proposed to include other activities as well. Bootcamp exercises or strength exercises were mentioned frequently as an addition to running or walking.\n\nBuilding on the input from these stakeholders, we specified walking, running, and performing strength exercises as the target behavior of the PAUL app. Our project goal is to develop an engaging application with beacon technology that users would like to use on a regular basis (usage aim) to eventually increase their recreational physical activities. By doing so, we aim to improve the general health of individuals (clinical aim). The overarching research aim of the PAUL project is to investigate whether PA applications can increase recreational PA of inactive urban residents. To this end, we aim to explore which designs of applications are more likely to increase PA, how we could implement machine learning to design adaptive and personalized interventions, and to what extent the built environment influences the PA behaviors with the app. Furthermore, we aim to explore to what extent the different cultural contexts of Brazil and the Netherlands influence the views of individuals on exercise apps and the effectiveness of the app.\n\nIdentify Barriers for Performing PA (Step 2)\n\nDuring the interviews described in step one, we also examined the perceived barriers of inactive individuals that hinder the performance of regular PA. By doing so, we could explore which determinants of behavior (i.e., opportunity, capability, or motivation) are insufficiently present for potential end users, and thus, which determinants of behavior the app should intent to change. To determine which barriers participants' experience, inductive codes were constructed. Then, axial coding was applied in which codes that were related were merged into overarching codes (i.e., barriers). Four key barriers were identified, namely, (1) a lack of time, (2) lack of motivation, (3) a lack of knowledge on performing strength exercises (other than walking or running), and (4) environmental barriers."

    {
      "title": "Time Barrier",
      "text": "The most frequently reported barrier was lack of time. Earlier studies showed that a lack of time could indicate that there are factors that lie outside the participants that interfere with the activity (i.e., lack of opportunity), but it could also be caused by an inability to plan their leisure time or that they simply prefer to do other activities that are more fun or easier to perform [i.e., lack of motivation;  (40, 41) ]. During the interviews, individuals explained the time barrier was mainly caused by the latter two points. They explained that they had limited time to exercise next to working or studying, in which they preferred to engage in other activities, such as social activities.\n\n\"I like to do it [sport], but it costs a lot of effort and time.\" (P8)\n\nThus, it appears that the time barrier is related to a lack of motivation. To overcome this barrier, participants indicated that it could help to receive reminders to engage in PA. Yet, they highlighted that they would not appreciate poorly timed reminders. Rather, the reminders should be sent when they have the opportunity to exercise."

Various participants also mentioned that PA would be more fun if they can do it together with others or when game elements were included, such as a competition.

      "title": "Design and Pilot the First Version of the App (Step 3)",
      "text": "Based on the input from all stakeholders, a first version of the app was developed. The app included goal setting functionality, feedback during PA, a history view, real-life rewards, and instruction videos to perform the strength exercises. The bootcamp videos were location specific, that is, the participant received an instruction video of somebody performing the strength exercise at the current location of the participant. In the video, the instructor made use of facilities which were already present in the park (such as a bench), to demonstrate how the physical environment can be used for correctly performing strength exercises. Since the videos had to be very location specific, beacon technology was used (see the Hardware and Software Architecture section for more details).\n\nAfter the development of the app, an informal evaluation was performed to explore if an application combined with beacon technology could be used to motivate individuals to perform strength exercises. Residents living around the Oosterpark were invited to test this app for 10 weeks (n = 12). Afterwards, participants were interviewed to examine the experience with the app and its functionalities. During the interviews, the participants explained that they enjoyed the instruction videos the most, because it provided a nice alteration with running or walking and it was a novel functionality. However, sometimes, the exercises were too soon after each other, resulting in limiting running and walking time.\n\nBased on this study with the first version of the app, the first design requirement for the PAUL app was drafted:\n\nProvide JIT instruction. Individuals should receive instruction videos on performing strength exercises during running or walking, with a 5-min time interval. The instruction videos should provide information on (1) which exercises to perform, (2) how to perform the exercise, (3) where, and (4) when the exercise can be performed. We hypothesize that instruction videos increase feelings of capability, as people can learn through watching others performing the behavior [also known as observational learning;  (30) ]."

    {
      "title": "Theoretical and Empirical Grounding of the PAUL App (Step 4)",
      "text": "After establishing that location-specific instructions on performing strength exercises can be a valuable addition to an exercise app, we continued with developing the other modules of the app. To this end, we first examined findings of other PA mHealth studies and theories of behavior change. The reason for this is 2-fold. First, the findings in steps 1-3 were based on small and informal studies, which could lead to biased conclusions regarding effective app modules. Second, as indicated in the INTRODUCTION, using a theory gives the researchers tools for moving beyond intuition to design and evaluate mHealth apps based on understanding of behavior.\n\nThe conceptual model (Figure  1 ) explains that several determinants constitute behavior change. To target these determinants, interventions incorporate persuasive strategies or \"active ingredients\"  (16) . Persuasive strategies can be defined as \"theoretically underpinned elements of an intervention intended to foster a positive behavior or attitude change toward PA, \" such as goal setting or providing feedback. In order to select (and design) persuasive strategies that target a particular determinant, behavioral theories and insights from previous studies can provide guidance  (25, 42) . For instance, it is theorized that the psychological capability of individuals can be increased by \"providing information on where and when to perform the behavior.\"\n\nBased on three reviews directed at (1) mHealth PA interventions, (2) adults, and (3) the effectiveness of persuasive strategies  (3, 4, 8) , we identified the most-likely effective persuasive strategies for increasing PA. In a meta-analysis, Eckerstorfer et al.  (8)  found that mHealth apps including behavioral goals and/or self-monitoring strategies are likely to increase PA, whereas information on where and when or instruction on how to perform the behavior are not. Interestingly, this latter finding is in contrast to what the potential end users stated in steps 2 and 3. The narrative review of Sullivan and Lachman (3) also described that not only strategies supporting self-regulation skills are most likely effective for increasing PA, including self-monitoring and goal-setting strategies, but also feedback, rewards, social support, and coaching strategies (e.g., sending reminders). In contrast, the systematic review of Stucky et al.  (4)  concluded that there were no persuasive strategies clearly more superior to others for mHealth apps. For instance, their results indicate that PA apps that included \"goal setting\" were not more effective than interventions without this strategy.\n\nA possible explanation for the findings of Stucky et al. (  4 ) is that the same persuasive strategy is implemented and designed differently across mHealth interventions  (43) (44) (45) (46) . To illustrate, regarding the use of \"social media\" in mHealth interventions, 36 different design characters have been identified  (44) . Next, Schembre et al.  (43)  also found that the technical implementation of \"feedback\" varies greatly in PA mHealth interventions (i.e., frequency, timing, and mode of delivery). These diverse design characteristics and technical implementations (in the remainder of this paper, we will refer to this as \"operationalizations\") might influence the effectiveness of the specific persuasive strategy.\n\nThus, in the next step, we explored which operationalizations seem most effective  (47)  regarding the strategies as identified in the previous step:\n\n1) Reminders to engage in PA 2) Goal setting 3) Monitoring of behavior 4) Rewards 5) Social support.\n\nWe performed a snowball and gray literature search to identify literature that evaluated the persuasive strategies in experimental trials (e.g., randomized controlled trial and pre-/post-test). Subsequently, the study methods, implementations, and designs of persuasive strategies and study results were systematically extracted. The results of this review  (47) , the review of Schembre et al.  (42) , and theories on behavior change resulted in the following operationalization considerations regarding the identified persuasive strategies."

Moreover, reminders can function as a \"cue to action\" to initiate behavior in at \"the right time\"  (38, 39) . Our scoping review (Sporrel et al., under review) identified only one study that examined the effect of timing of reminder messages in a PA app that demonstrated that optimized timed reminders were perceived as more useful then randomly timed messages, but this does not necessarily result in more PA  (48) . Additional support for including JITAI reminders can be found in the larger field of preventive healthcare  (7) . Concerning the content of the reminders, PA apps should aim to include personalized messages  (45)  as opposed to generic messages [cf. (14, 49) ]. To optimize timing or content of the reminders, machine learning methods have been presented  (50, 51) ."

This latter finding is inconsistent with the goal-setting theory that posits that goals are likely more effective when they are self-set, either on their own or with the help of others. Therefore, a goal-setting function that combines both selfset and assigned goals [i.e., participatory set goals  (28) ] should be considered."

Both messages and visualizations (such as graphs) can be used to provide feedback in an app (Sporrel et al., under review). To provide feedback, the behavior of the individual must be monitored. Previous studies indicate that monitoring PA in mHealth interventions can be done by a single device, since additional devices (such as wearables) are not likely not increase PA behavior  (9) . However, little is known about the preference for self-monitoring or automatic tracking, nor for the types of behavior (outcomes) that should be tracked (Sporrel et al., under review)."

The questionnaire consisted of 24 dualchoice items, four items in which the participants had to select the two or three best messages on a list of six or eight messages (respectively), and several items on socio-demographics and determinants of behavior. The results indicated that individuals prefer reminders that provides information regarding the progress toward their goal (in line with the findings of the focus groups) and messages that inform individuals on affective, immediate outcomes of performing PA (such as feeling happy). Furthermore, participants preferred messages in which the individual was addressed by name and that were positively framed (results not published).\n\nBased on the outcomes of this study, a message library of 141 messages was built. The messages address the individual by name, are positively framed, focus on affective, immediate outcomes, and are tailored to the activity type (e.g., running, walking, and both). The messages can be classified into three different contents, namely, coping, feedback, and informative messages (see Table  2 ). Individuals have 50% chance to receive a coping message if they did not reach their goal the week before.

The usability of the app is increased by placing the \"start\" button at the landing page of the app (Figure  7A ). By doing so, the user can start to track PA with just one click. Via the menu (Figure  7B ), the user can navigate to the other modalities of the PAUL app.\n\nFor instance, the user can navigate to the \"goal-setting module\" by pressing \"schema.\" Here, the user can reset her goal by performing a simple questionnaire consisting of multiplechoice items (Figures  8A , B ). Open questions were avoided since they might be too difficult and demanding for participants, while choosing between a few options is a relatively easy task. When the goal is set, the user can also view the goal in the goal-setting tab (Figure  8C ).\n\nDuring running or walking, the user can view sustained, numerical feedback whenever she wants (Figure  9A ). The design is simple to ensure the most important feedback can be viewed with a quick glance. After finishing the PA session, the user immediately receives an overview rapport of her PA session (Figure  9B ), where she can also easily monitor how she felt during the session and how heavy the session was by ticking the best suiting icon (Figure  9B ). If the user wants to add more information about her PA session, she can enter this as well. The users can (re-)view their PA rapports as many times and whenever she wants, except during a PA session (Figure  9C ).\n\nThe screenshot of a trigger to perform a strength exercise is shown in Figure  10 . The user can choose to watch the video to get the information on where and how to perform the exercise. The video is displayed on full screen, but since some users might know how to perform the exercise or learns this over time, the user can  also press \"performed\" to monitor that the strength exercise is performed, without having to watch the video.\n\nThe reminders are sent when the user has not performed a session or the amount of notifications that have been sent are below the daily reminder limit. Android has the ability to push messages to the screen of the phone. When a notification is sent, an icon will be visible in the phone's status bar and a notification sound will be played. The notification will also be visible on the lock screen of the phone when the screen has been locked (Figure  11 ).

Novel app components are the optimization of the timing of the reminders via a self-learning algorithm and prompting real-time and locationspecific strength exercises."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "One of the strengths of our methodology is the use of multiple frameworks in the app development, since they complement each other. The BCW was used to draft a hypothesis of how the selected persuasive strategies influence the (determinants of) PA behavior  (25) . With this conceptual model, it is possible to evaluate the working mechanisms of the PAUL app, i.e., if the application indeed changes the determinants of behavior and whether this leads to a change in behavior. Furthermore, as suggested by the IDEAS framework, end users were involved in the development to examine if the promising selection and operationalizations of the persuasive strategies that were identified in the literature are aligned with their needs and wishes. In addition to existing frameworks, we used data-mining techniques to guide the implementation of the personalized timing of the reminders. Data-mining technology has the advantage that already existing data can be used, reducing the participant burden. More importantly, the results of datamining studies can provide a \"warm start\" for a self-learning system, which likely increases the effectiveness of these highly personalized applications  (65) .\n\nThere are also limitations to our study. First, although we did present our initial ideas of the PAUL app with screen shots to the users during the focus group study (step 5), we did not perform a study in which individuals could interact with the app, such as presenting a clickable design of the app to potential end users [cf. (66) ]. Therefore, it is unknown if the app is easy to use and if users would have preferred a different interface. Since the usability and aesthetics of the app can influence the user engagement  (67, 68)  and app abandonment (69), we will explore this during a feasibility study (step 8).\n\nA second limitation is that we only included individuals that lived close to the parks in Amsterdam. Although these individuals were recruited because they are the targeted users of the PAUL application, it limits the generalizability of our findings.\n\nFor instance, it could be that people who live close to these parks (or other parks) might express a preference for bootcamplike exercises, because they see more people performing these exercises in parks. Future studies could examine if similar technologies could be used by other target groups as well. In addition, there are a few limitations inherent to the use of smartphone technology for changing PA behavior, including internet connectivity, missing data, and the accuracy of the measurements [cf. (7) ]. To reduce changes of malfunctioning, the instruction videos were already uploaded in the app. Thus, even if the participant had no internet access, she can receive and could watch the JIT exercise instructions. Furthermore, to increase the accuracy of the JIT exercise prompts, beacon technology was used. However, participants do have to turn on their Bluetooth to enable this function, which could deplete more battery. Lastly, for the application to track their PA behavior, participants do have to carry their phone with them during the run or walk, which could pose a barrier for the uptake of the intervention."

    {
      "title": "Lessons Learned",
      "text": "During the development of the PAUL app, several lessons were learned of which future app developers and researchers could benefit. In regard of the app design, inactive individuals  feel the need for smart and personalized intervention with variation that functions like a coach. Options for personalization should therefore not be limited to one app modality or persuasive strategy but rather across multiple app components. Furthermore, individuals also enjoy novel functionalities, such as the instruction video modality. Regarding the methodology, we encountered three major challenges while developing the PAUL app. First, sometimes the theory and the user's wishes were not aligned. For instance, individuals explained that they liked the idea of the location-based bootcamp video's, while a recent literature review demonstrated that \"information where and when to perform PA\" or \"instruction on how to perform the PA\" were not related to positive intervention outcomes  (8) . A possible explanation is that the implementation of the intervention influences the effectiveness [cf. (43, 44) ]. Thus, it could be that participants like instruction videos because they are new and easy to use, while other implementations, such as information sheets, are not effective. Another example is the goal difficulty; while individuals in step 5 explain they prefer an easy-to-achieve goal, the goal setting theory posits that difficult goals are more effective than easy goals to change behavior  (29) .\n\nTo address these contradictions, we discussed possible solutions within the research team. For the goal-setting module, we developed the module in which participants could receive both difficult and easy goals, depending on their own input. Thus, if they perceived their goal to be too difficult, they could make it easier. Regarding the instruction videos, we decided to keep the instruction videos based on the participants' enthusiastic responses during the first phase and because there are no studies that demonstrated that this operationalization of information is not effective (to the best of our knowledge). Notably, there is one research team that developed an mHealth intervention for running that includes strength training exercises which demonstrated positive results, but no effect study was performed  (70, 71) .\n\nA second challenge was to cross the gap between the persuasive strategies to the operationalization of the strategies (i.e., the design characteristics and the technical implementation). Although the framework of (24) provides useful first design principles (such as tailoring the intervention), it does not provide a \"do or don't\" list regarding the operationalization. A promising method to make this translation is the use of more participatory methodologies, such as co-design or co-creation sessions [e.g.,  (72) (73) (74) ], in which potential end users can (re)design the operationalizations of intervention components to their liking.\n\nThe third challenge relates specifically to developing JIT(A) interventions, namely, to account for potential delays of effects of the reminder on the behavior and the influence of prompts that are not sent by the application (either internal or external prompts). To illustrate, it could be that the reminder does not prompt the individual to engage in PA right away, but it does prompt the individual to make (or remind them to) the plan to go engage in PA when they get back home. Then, the actual cue to engage in PA would be \"getting home.\" It is therefore important to consider the time between sending and engaging with the message into account when evaluating the JITAI reminders. We aim to evaluate this possible delay in the ongoing feasibility study with the PAUL application by examining the user's perception and usage of the reminders with, for instance, interviews."

The user experience with the app (such as user friendliness) was measured with a questionnaire, and semistructured interviews were performed to examine the perception of the (operationalization) of the persuasive strategies of the participants. Since researchers are also called upon to explore if the mHealth interventions with similar theoretical groundings are feasible in a different cultural and environmental context  (35) , we are planning to perform a similar feasibility study in Brazil.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the feasibility study, we will determine the next steps. If the app must be subjected to major changes, we will optimize the design and perform an additional small feasibility study. If the app is feasible, a large effect study will be performed to determine if the intervention increases the PA of individuals. In addition, we aim to investigate to what extent it is feasible to upscale the application. Currently, it's only functional at the three study locations, but other locations likely also support the performance of strength exercises. Therefore, we aim to examine the preferred locations (i.e., green spaces and sports areas) and amenities (i.e., benches, stairs, etc.) for performing strength exercises. This information can be used to determine more locations at which the exercise prompts can be sent."

    "FBM uses different definitions of motivation then the COM-B model. In our work, we uphold the definition of the COM-B model. Additionally, the FBM does not use the concepts \"opportunity\" and \"capability.\" Rather, the FMB describes that the individuals should have the ability to perform the behavior, which is determined by both situations that lie outside of the individual and the characteristics of the individual herself.",
    "A beacon is a small device that sends out a Bluetooth signal, which can be recognized by an app. The app can then translate this signal to a meaningful message, such as an instruction video.
