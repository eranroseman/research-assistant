  "title": "Effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for promoting healthy eating in adults: A systematic review",
  "abstract": "Unhealthy eating is a major risk factor for chronic disease. However, many current strategies to promote healthy eating are not sustainable over the longer-term. More cost-effective wide-reaching initiatives are urgently needed. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, delivered via mobile devices, could provide a solution. This systematic review summarized the evidence on the effect of mHealth interventions for promoting healthy eating in adults. A comprehensive systematic search of five scientific databases was conducted using methods adapted from the Cochrane Handbook. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published up to 1 July 2016, which examined healthy eating interventions delivered via mobile device. Of 879 articles identified, 84 full text articles were potentially eligible and further assessed, and 23 included. Narrative review results indicated small positive effects of mHealth interventions on healthy eating (5/8 trials) and weight loss (5/13 trials). However, the current evidence base is insufficient (studies are of poor quality) to determine conclusive positive effects. More rigorous RCTs with longer-term (> 6 months) follow-up are warranted to determine if effects are maintained.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are premature and preventable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes  (Kontis et al., 2014) . Each year approximately 38 million people die globally from NCDs, with 16 million (42%) dying 'prematurely', before the age of 70 years. The majority (82%) of these 'premature' deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries  (World Health Organization, 2014) . Unhealthy eating is a leading risk factor for NCDs worldwide, accounting for 11.3 million deaths and 241.4 million disability-adjusted life-years lost  (Forouzanfar et al., 2015) . Healthy eating education via face-to-face individual or group consultations has been effectively demonstrated  (Hajek, 2007) . However, these methods are resource intensive, and uptake is generally low  (Karmali et al., 2014) . A large amount of information and support is required to be conveyed within a limited time-frame, and cost and location are significant barriers to accessibility  (Koikkalainen et al., 1996) . Alternative sustainable initiatives for promoting healthy eating are urgently required to reduce the burden of NCDs.\n\nMobile health (mHealth), which is health care using mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other wireless devices provides a potentially cost-effective solution  (World Health Organization, 2011; Stephens and Allen, 2013; Free et al., 2013; Whittaker, 2012) . Mobile phone technology is becoming increasingly accessible, with close to five billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide and up to 85% of the world's population now covered by a commercial wireless signal  (World Health Organization, 2011) . Globally 2.6 billion people own a smartphone; with ownership predicted to rise to 6.1 billion by 2020  (Ericsson, 2015) . There are thousands of health and wellness applications (apps) available to the public, as smartphones begin to become synonymous with patient self-care  (Balady et al., 2011; Wardrop, n.d.) .\n\nA growing body of evidence indicates mobile technology can promote behavior change  (Tomlinson et al., 2013) . Behavior change programs to promote healthy eating can either be installed on a mobile device or app, or sent via text message. Interventions include selfmonitoring of specific behaviors, such a food intake or physical activity; motivational text messages to remind people to eat specific foods; and goal setting  (Burke et al., 2011) .\n\nPrevious systematic reviews have evaluated mHealth interventions for weight loss  (Stephens and Allen, 2013; Burke et al., 2011; Bacigalupo et al., 2013; Shaw and Bosworth, 2012) , general health care  (Klasnja and Pratt, 2012; Fiordelli et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2011; Krishna et al., 2009) , and behavior change for health  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009; Cole-Lewis and Kershaw, 2010) . Whilst other authors  (Coughlin et al., 2015; DiFilippo et al., 2015)  have summarized the data on smartphone apps for promoting healthy eating and improving nutrition knowledge or behavior (non-randomized study designs included). Reviews of eHealth and social media interventions for increasing physical activity and changing nutrition behaviors have also been conducted  (Norman et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2014) . To the best of our knowledge there are no reviews to date which focus exclusively on the effectiveness of interventions delivered via mobile device for promoting healthy eating.\n\nFor the purposes of this review, the term 'healthy eating' was used to describe a variety of eating behaviors associated with good health and consistent with dietary guidelines, such as: increased consumption of foods (or foods containing nutrients) conducive to good health, e.g. fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, vitamins and minerals; decreased consumption of foods (or nutrients) which when consumed in excess are associated with poor health, e.g. fast food, sugar-sweetened beverages, saturated fat, sodium, sugar and alcohol; reduced energy intakes (for overweight or obese people), decreased portion sizes of energydense foods; and adherence to dietary patterns which promote the intake of foods conducive to good health.\n\nThe objective of this systematic review was to collate and summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for promoting healthy eating in adults. The secondary objectives were to investigate the effect of mHealth interventions on: biochemical and anthropometric measures indicative of consumption of a healthy diet, and to explore the effect of specific types of mobile technology used and the intervention duration on healthy eating, biochemical and anthropometric measures."

      "text": "One researcher (R.M.) conducted a systematic literature search based on methods from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions  (Higgins and Green, 2011) . Trials were identified from five electronic databases: Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar, and by hand-searching reference lists and table-ofcontents alerts of relevant reports and peer-reviewed journals. A search strategy was developed for Medline and adapted for the remaining databases (Appendix A1)."

      "title": "2.2.. Inclusion criteria",
      "text": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any duration published in English up to 1 July 2016 were included. Eligible participants were adults (aged \u2265 18 years) of any gender, ethnicity, or health status, recruited from all settings, e.g. the Internet, community, primary care or hospital. Included were studies with 'healthy eating' interventions (see main outcomes) where a mobile device was used as the primary mode of delivery. Interventions which focused on the use of a mobile device as adjunct to written, telephone, face-to-face or Internet-based programs were included if these other modes of delivery comprised < 50% of the total intervention. Trials with other intervention components, such as physical activity were included if such components comprised < 50% of the total intervention. Eligible comparators were control groups receiving a non-mobile based intervention, usual care, or no intervention. Main outcomes were: healthy eating measures (e.g. behaviors associated with good health and consistent with dietary guidelines, such as intake of specific foods, food groups or nutrients) (primary outcome); biochemical measures (e.g. blood pressure) and anthropometric measures (e.g. body weight, percentage body fat, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference) indicative of consumption of a healthy diet (secondary outcomes). Exclusion criteria: quasi-RCTs were excluded due to high risk of selection bias. Trials with HbA1c as the only measure of 'healthy eating' were excluded, as HbA1c is a measure of glycaemic control, not a direct measure of healthy eating per se."

R.M. analysed study titles and abstracts for eligibility, and obtained and scrutinised full-text copies of potentially eligible studies for inclusion. A standardized Data Extraction Form was used as adapted by R.M. from the Cochrane Handbook (Appendix A2)  (Higgins and Green, 2011) . R.M. independently extracted the data, and received feedback from the other authors (H.E. and C.N.M) regarding data extraction and the inclusion/exclusion of specific studies. Authors of potentially eligible studies were contacted for more information where required, and reference lists examined for additional studies.\n\nExtracted information included: objective(s), study design, duration, country, setting, recruitment methods, sample size, participant characteristics, intervention and control groups, outcomes, loss to follow-up, information on risk of bias, funding source, results, conclusions and limitations. For several trials multiple reports were examined and data extracted from each to obtain all relevant information. However, each trial was only counted once. Trial results were compared by specific characteristics, including numbers and types of: participants, interventions and outcomes. A meta-analysis to provide overall summary statistics for mHealth versus non-mHealth interventions (control) was not considered viable due to large between-trial heterogeneity in study interventions and outcomes. Therefore, narrative review was used to summarize the results of included studies."

Trials were published between 2008 and 1 July 2016, and ranged in duration from one to 24 months (median duration six months). The majority of studies (n = 12) were conducted in the United States of America  (Allen et al., 2013; Atienza et al., 2008; Beasley et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 2012; Steinberg et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Laing et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Svetkey et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Spring et al., 2013) , four were from Australia  (Hebden et al., 2014; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Kerr et al., 2016) , two from the United Kingdom  (Carter et al., 2013; Soureti et al., 2011) , two from Europe  (Haapala et al., 2009; Elbert et al., 2016) , one from South America  (Rubinstein et al., 2016) , one from Iran  (Vakili et al., 2015) , and one from Korea  (Kim et al., 2015) . Four trials had more than one associated report; three trials  (Patrick et al., 2009; Spring et al., 2013; Partridge et al., 2015)  each had two reports  (Norman et al., 2013; Duncan et al., 2011; Allman-Farinelli et al., 2016) , and one  (Burke et al., 2012)  had six reports  (Burke et al., 2011; Burke et al., 2009; Acharya et al., 2011; Storcksdieck genannt Bonsmann et al., 2010; Ambeba et al., 2014) , of which only two were relevant to this review  (Burke et al., 2012; Burke et al., 2009) . Trials had between one and three intervention groups, one control group, and a variety of co-interventions. Control groups received no intervention (n = 13)  (Atienza et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 2012; Steinberg et al., 2013; Mummah et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Spring et al., 2013; Hebden et al., 2014; Kerr et al., 2016; Soureti et al., 2011; Haapala et al., 2009; Elbert et al., 2016; Vakili et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015) , a non-mobile based intervention (n = 5)  (Allen et al., 2013; Beasley et al., 2008; Burke et al., 2012; Partridge et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2013) , or usual care (n = 5)  (Laing et al., 2014; Svetkey et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Rubinstein et al., 2016) .\n\nFrom the 23 trials there was an accumulated total of 4725 participants (range: 17 to 856, median: 170). Participant characteristics differed greatly by age (range: 18 to 86 years, mean: 43.0 years) and ethnicity (e.g. Caucasian, African American, Hispanic White, Hispanic Black, Middle Eastern and Asian). Studies were more similar by participant gender, i.e. mostly female (18/23 studies)  (Allen et al., 2013; Atienza et al., 2008; Beasley et al., 2008; Burke et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Laing et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Svetkey et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Spring et al., 2013; Hebden et al., 2014; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Kerr et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2013; Haapala et al., 2009; Elbert et al., 2016; Vakili et al., 2015) , and health status, i.e. mostly overweight/obese with no self-reported health problems (17/23 studies)  (Allen et al., 2013; Beasley et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 2012; Steinberg et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Laing et al., 2014; Svetkey et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Spring et al., 2013; Hebden et al., 2014; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2013; Soureti et al., 2011; Haapala et al., 2009; Rubinstein et al., 2016) . The mean response rate (proportion of screened participants who were eligible and agreed to participate) was 48%.\n\nA range of mobile devices were used for intervention delivery, including smartphones (n = 6)  (Allen et al., 2013; Mummah et al., 2016; Laing et al., 2014; Hebden et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2013; Elbert et al., 2016) , PDAs (n = 4)  (Atienza et al., 2008; Beasley et al., 2008; Burke et al., 2012; Spring et al., 2013) , and other mobile phones (unspecified) (n = 12)  (Shapiro et al., 2012; Steinberg et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Kerr et al., 2016; Soureti et al., 2011; Haapala et al., 2009; Rubinstein et al., 2016; Vakili et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015) .

Secondary outcomes of this review were biochemical measures (e.g. blood pressure; n = 2 trials) and anthropometric measures (e.g. body weight, percentage body fat, BMI and waist n = 13 trials) which are indicative of consumption of a healthy diet. Body weight was the most common outcome measured  (Allen et al., 2013; Shapiro et al., 2012; Burke et al., 2012; Laing et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Svetkey et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Spring et al., 2013; Hebden et al., 2014; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Haapala et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015) . Three trials had measures relevant to this review as secondary outcomes only (all anthropometric)  (Beasley et al., 2008; Steinberg et al., 2013; Carter et al., 2013) . Twenty of the interventions included self-monitoring of food intake, physical activity or weight. Participants were required to self-monitor via mobile app (n = 7)  (Allen et al., 2013; Mummah et al., 2016; Laing et al., 2014; Svetkey et al., 2015; Hebden et al., 2014; Partridge et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2013) , text message (n = 9)  (Shapiro et al., 2012; Steinberg et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Kerr et al., 2016; Haapala et al., 2009; Elbert et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015) , or PDA (n = 4)  (Atienza et al., 2008; Beasley et al., 2008; Burke et al., 2012; Spring et al., 2013) . In 16 trials participants were provided with feedback on their nutrition goals or inputs via mobile-device  (Allen et al., 2013; Beasley et al., 2008; Steinberg et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Laing et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Svetkey et al., 2015; Spring et al., 2013; Hebden et al., 2014; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Kerr et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2013; Elbert et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015) . In studies which measured self-monitoring adherence (n = 9), adherence was found to decline over time  (Steinberg et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Svetkey et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2013; Haapala et al., 2009) ."

      "title": "3.4.. Quality assessment of included studies",
      "text": "Assessment of study quality is detailed in Table  2 . Overall the studies were of poor quality, with inadequate reporting of methods and results. Further, reporting of specific elements of study design prevented accurate assessment of risk of bias, as detailed below. In accordance with the Cochrane Guidelines, 15 of the 23 reviewed studies were categorised as having an overall 'high' risk of bias  (Allen et al., 2013; Atienza et al., 2008; Beasley et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 2012; Laing et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Svetkey et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Spring et al., 2013; Hebden et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2013; Soureti et al., 2011; Haapala et al., 2009; Elbert et al., 2016; Vakili et al., 2015) , four as having an 'unclear' risk  (Steinberg et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015) , and four as having a 'low' risk  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Kerr et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Rubinstein et al., 2016) .\n\nPoor reporting was common related to several domains of bias. Blinding of study personnel and assessors, for example, was only sufficiently described in six trials  (Shapiro et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Svetkey et al., 2015; Partridge et al., 2015; Kerr et al., 2016; Rubinstein et al., 2016) . Further, selective reporting was demonstrated in seven trials  (Allen et al., 2013; Beasley et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2015; Svetkey et al., 2015; Spring et al., 2013; Elbert et al., 2016; Vakili et al., 2015) . Many of the trials were also inadequately powered with only those by  Carter et al. (2013)  (pilot study),  Burke et al. (2012) ,  Fjeldsoe et al. (2016) ,  Haapala et al. (2009) ,  Kerr et al. (2016), and Svetkey et al. (2015)  adequately powered to detect changes in primary outcomes. Seven of the trials in the review were pilot studies  (Allen et al., 2013 ;   Atienza et al., 2008; Steinberg et al., 2013; Mummah et al., 2016; Patrick et al., 2009; Hebden et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2013) , six of which were published prior to 2015. Only the non-pilot studies reported calculation of sample size a priori.\n\nPoor retention rates also had the potential to bias study results and reduce the validity of findings. Attrition was reported in all of the trials, and rates were high (range: 5% to 55%, median: 20%, 12 trials at \u2265 20%)  (Allen et al., 2013; Atienza et al., 2008; Beasley et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 2012; Mummah et al., 2016; Laing et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Spring et al., 2013; Carter et al., 2013; Haapala et al., 2009; Elbert et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015) . Intention-totreat (ITT) analyses was employed in all but four of the trials  (Allen et al., 2013; Atienza et al., 2008; Kerr et al., 2016; Vakili et al., 2015) , although several authors failed to report on the ITT results and only documented the analysis for trial completers. Risk of bias was also potentially higher in the trials by  Haapala et al. (2009)  and  Soureti et al. (2011)  which were funded by commercial organisations (a mobile device software company and a food company), and  Lin et al. (2015)  where one author served on a scientific advisory board and was a stockholder for a company producing weight loss products. Funding sources and potential conflicts of interest were however declared in all instances."

      "text": "A positive effect of mHealth interventions on healthy eating (primary outcome) was demonstrated in 5/8 trials. Measures included: vegetable intake  (Atienza et al., 2008)  portion sizes of high saturated fat foods  (Soureti et al., 2011)  adherence to a low fat vegetarian diet  (Beasley et al., 2008) , and servings of various food groups  (Kerr et al., 2016; Vakili et al., 2015) . In addition, an effect on anthropometric measures indicative of a healthy diet was shown in 5/13 trials: weight loss  (Lin et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2009; Fjeldsoe et al., 2016; Partridge et al., 2015; Haapala et al., 2009)  and waist circumference  (Haapala et al.) . No effects on biochemical measures (e.g. blood pressure) were observed. The validity of the demonstrated effects is unclear, as although statistical significance was demonstrated in all ten of the trials, only those by  Haapala et al., Kerr et al. and Fjeldsoe et al.  were sufficiently powered to detect changes in primary outcomes. As a consequence, for the remaining seven trials the stated positive effects should be interpreted with caution."

      "text": "Measures of food and nutrient intake varied greatly between trials. Only one trial reported a positive effect of an mHealth intervention on intake of a specific nutrient (saturated fat;  Soureti et al., 2011)  and one on adherence to a specific diet (low fat vegetarian;  Beasley et al., 2008) . Two reported positive effects on intake of various food groups (fruit, vegetables, energy-dense foods and sugar-sweetened beverages;  Kerr et al., 2016, and vitamin A rich fruit and vegetable, green leafy vegetable, seafood, dairy products; Vakili et al., 2015)  and one on intake of a specific food group (vegetables;  Atienza et al., 2008) . Only the trial by  Kerr et al.  was significantly powered to detect changes in outcomes. However, effects were gender specific. Kerr et al. conducted a sixmonth three-arm parallel RCT investigating the effectiveness of a healthy eating app, with or without dietary feedback, on change in food intake for 247 adults aged 18 to 30 years in Perth, Australia. Participants were randomized to receive tailored dietary feedback messages, with (n = 78) or without (n = 72) weekly motivational text messages, or no intervention (control; n = 69). All groups recorded their food and drink intake via photographs prior two and following the 'intervention' phase. Those who received the dietary feedback messages without motivational messages significantly reduced their intake of: energydense foods (mean: 1.4 serves/day (p = 0.02); men only) and sugarsweetened beverages (mean: 0.2 serves/day (p = 0.04); women only) compared with controls. Further, those who received the app without motivational messages lost more weight (secondary outcome) than the control group (mean: -1.7 kg (95% CI: -3.2, -0.3); (p = 0.02))."

Haapala et al. reported a significant mean weight loss of 3.4 kg over 12 months, favoring the intervention group who received a tailored text message weight loss program (mean: 4.5, SD 5.0; n = 62), versus control group who received no intervention (mean: 1.1, SD 5.8; n = 62); (p = 0.006). Lin et al. showed a significant mean weight loss of 3.4 kg over six months for those receiving a tailored text message intervention with feedback (n = 30), in comparison to no intervention (n = 21): -3.4 (95% CI: -5.2, -1.7); (p = 0.001). Partridge et al. demonstrated a significant mean weight loss of 2.1 kg (self-reported) over three months, favoring the intervention group (n = 110) who received a tailored text message intervention with access to education and self-monitoring apps in comparison to the control group (n = 104) who received access to a website, printed guidelines and a small number of texts reinforcing the guidelines: -2.1 (95% CI: -1.4, -2.8); (p < 0.001). An additional analysis demonstrated further weight loss at nine months (Allman-Farinelli et al., 2016). Patrick et al. showed a significant mean weight loss of 1.97 kg for those receiving a tailored text message intervention with feedback (n = 33), versus no text messages (n = 32), at four months: -1.97 (95% CI: -0.34, -3.60); (p = 0.02).

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "This systematic review summarizes the evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for promoting healthy eating. Previous research has indicated that the majority of mHealth programs available have not been evaluated, despite their use in clinical care settings  (Mohr et al., 2013) . We found limited evidence for a small positive effect of mHealth interventions on healthy eating, limited mostly to overweight or obese adults living in high-income countries. Moreover, the quality of evidence was poor. Included trials were published between 2008 and July 2016, which reflects the recent introduction of mobile technology. However, only one of the trials, which tested a sixmonth text message intervention for improving intake of fruits, vegetables and unhealthy foods and drinks, was adequately powered and demonstrated significant gender-specific effects. A further two text message trials of six and 12 months duration were adequately powered and showed significant effects on anthropometric measures (weight and waist circumference) which are indicative of a healthy diet. The majority of reviewed studies were of medium-term duration (> 2-6 months). Given the varying and often longer time periods required for sustainable behavior change  (Lally et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2009) , longer-term studies (> 6 months) are needed are to determine the sustainability and maintenance of intervention effects.\n\nThe majority of included trials (13/23) focused on weight loss as a primary outcome. Previous systematic reviews of mHealth interventions primarily focused on weight loss have shown positive effects, particularly in the medium-term (6 months). Shaw and Bosworth (2012)  reviewed 14 RCTs and quasi-experimental studies examining the use of text messaging for weight loss in overweight and obese participants, and reported a significant effect on weight loss in 11/14 studies (p < 0.05). Similarly,  Bacigalupo et al. (2013)  reviewed seven RCTs investigating the effect of portable devices (including mobile phones) on weight loss in overweight and obese adults, and found good evidence for weight loss in the short-term and moderate evidence for the medium-term (only one higher-quality RCT).\n\nSelf-monitoring of food intake, weight and physical activity levels using mobile devices was a common component of interventions in this review (n = 20). The three most successful interventions (those which were adequately powered and demonstrated significant effects) included elements of self-monitoring via text message  (Haapala et al. and Fjeldsoe et al.)  and an app  (Kerr et al.) . Interestingly, for all three interventions participants were also provided with feedback tailored specifically to their self-monitored measures, suggesting that selfmonitoring with tailored feedback may be an important component to intervention success. In the trial by Fjeldsoe et al. participants were required to self-monitor their weight and dietary goals fortnightly and report back to the researchers via text message. Text message prompts to self-monitor and personalized feedback on dietary goals were given. Other authors have also suggested that incorporating feedback with self-monitoring may be an important aspect of mHealth intervention success  (Allman-Farinelli et al., 2016; Bertz et al., 2015) . Further, although self-monitoring adherence has been shown to decrease over time, the use of prompts/cues to remind people to self-monitor may increase intervention adherence and thus success."

      "title": "4.1.. Study limitations and strengths",
      "text": "This review demonstrated potential efficacy for using mobile devices to deliver healthy eating interventions to the public. Robust methods were used for the review; the systematic search was thorough and an in-depth analysis of study quality was undertaken. The research provides useful information regarding the quality of RCTs on mHealth interventions for promoting healthy eating and weight loss. Many of the included studies were identified as having a high risk of bias; many had small sample sizes and inadequate power to detect statistically significant changes in outcomes. A meta-analysis was not possible due to poor reporting and between-trial heterogeneity.\n\nMeasures of healthy eating, such as intake of specific foods, food groups or nutrients (the primary outcome of this review) were assessed in eight of the 23 trials, which was small in comparison to the thirteen trials that measured weight loss. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were included in this review as secondary outcomes under the assumption that these measures are indicative of consumption of a healthy diet. This assumption is limited by the possibility that significant results, such as weight loss, could be obtained without achieving a 'healthy' diet.\n\nAttrition was highlighted as a common theme in this review; half of the trials were characterized as being at high risk for attrition bias. Attrition has been reported as a common problem in studies with technology-based interventions  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009) . High rates of attrition (> 20%) have also been documented in systematic reviews on mHealth and eHealth interventions for weight loss and dietary behavior change  (Shaw and Bosworth, 2012; Norman et al., 2007) . Participant retention (for both control and intervention groups) needs to be considered in future mHealth research. Suggestions include: giving adequate instructions and support to ensure study equipment is easy to use, providing modest financial incentives for completion, and offering the control group the intervention program at the end of the study.\n\nThis review was limited to RCTs only, which reduced its scope. In a recent review of 117 studies (varying study designs) assessing the impact of mobile phones on health,  Fiordelli et al. (2013)  noted an increase in new research designs, namely: observational studies, case studies, case series and cross-sectional, from 2002 to 2012, and suggested that diversification in study design can lead to stronger evidence-based interventions with more positive outcomes. This view is shared by many other researchers in the field  (Anglemyer et al., 2014; Heron and Smyth, 2010; Whittaker et al., 2012) . The rapidly changing nature of mHealth technologies means their \"shelf-life\u2026may be shorter than the time it takes to evaluate\" them. As seen in this review, several of the trials used PDA technology, which is now obsolete. Reviewers should consider including new, adaptive and iterative research designs in future systematic reviews."

      "title": "5.. Conclusions",
      "text": "Mobile health is an emerging field of health research, which offers an alternative, possibly effective, method of improving dietary intakes. The amount of research on the impacts of mHealth interventions for promoting healthy eating is increasing. Although there are promising trends toward effectiveness, the current evidence base is insufficient to determine conclusive effects. More higher-quality RCTs with longerterm (> 6 months) follow-up are needed to robustly assess the effects of interventions using mobile devices on outcomes of healthy eating. This is particularly warranted given the need for sustainable behavior change. Particular attention should be given to the speed at which technology is changing to ensure any research conducted is relevant when results are published.\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at  http://dx.  doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.08.022 ."
