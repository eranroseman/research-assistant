  "abstract": "Background: Diabetes self-management education (DSME) and support (DSME/S) delivered via mobile health (mHealth) is potentially cost-effective, if proven effective. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of DSME, DSMS or DSME/S delivered by mHealth interventions compared to usual care (UC) or attention placebo control (APC) in adults with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We searched (1) MEDLINE, (2) Embase, (3) PsycINFO, (4) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, (5) Clini calTr ials. gov, and (6) World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from the year 2000 to January 31, 2023. We included RCTs comparing DSME/S delivered via mHealth versus UC or APC. Four authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Primary outcome was HbA1c, outher outcomes secundairy. Meta-analysed with random-effects model was used. \n Results: We included 43 trials involving 9328 participants; sample sizes ranging from 20 to 1119. Pooled effects on HbA1c were for DSME: mean difference (MD) of -4 mmol/mol (-0.3%), 95% CI -6 mmol/mol (-0.6%) to -1 mmol/mol (-0.1); p = 0.002; DSMS MD -4 mmol/mol (-0.4%), 95% CI 7 mmol/mol (-0.6%) to -2 mmol/mol (-0.2); p < 0.001; and DSME/S MD of -2 mmol/mol (-0.2%) for HbA1c, 95% CI -3 mmol/mol (-0.3%) to -0 mmol/mol (-0.0%); p < 0.001. We found uncertain effects on other outcomes. \n Conclusions: mHealth interventions delivering self management education with or without support to adults with type 2 diabetes appear to have a modest beneficial effect on HbA1c. Only a few trials investigated patient-reported outcomes.",

      "title": "1. | INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Diabetes self-management education (DSME) provides individuals with type 2 diabetes with the knowledge, abilities and skills necessary for diabetes self-management.  1  To implement and sustain the targeted behaviour, people should also receive diabetes self-management support (DSMS), defined as \"activities that assist the person with diabetes in implementing and sustaining the behaviours needed to manage his or her condition on an ongoing basis\".  2  DSME and DSMS together are referred to as DSME and support, which forms the essential basis for self-management in individuals with type 2 diabetes.  2 raditionally, DSME/S has been delivered via face-toface contact between individuals with type 2 diabetes and healthcare providers. However, the number of diabetes monitoring visits is limited and therefore, healthcare providers are only able to provide individuals with DSME/S a few times per year. This may lead to an overwhelming amount of information for individuals during the diabetes monitoring visits. Additionally, in some countries, the number of healthcare providers cannot keep up with the increasing number of individuals with type 2 diabetes. These shortcomings have prompted the need for innovative and (cost-)effective solutions to support the healthcare providers in delivering DSME/S.\n\nNew technologies have the potential to deliver DSME/S and consequently improve diabetes selfmanagement. A potential low-cost and easily accessible way to provide DSME/S may be by using mobile health (mHealth). mHealth is healthcare that is provided using mobile or electronic devices, such interventions can be personalised to the individual and integrated into daily life. A Cochrane Review on computer-based diabetes selfmanagement interventions, published in 2013 (including any application that takes input from a patient and uses communication or processing technology to provide a tailored response that facilitates one or more aspects of diabetes self-management), found that computer-based interventions had small benefits on glycaemic control (low-to moderate-quality evidence); the effect size was larger in the mobile phone group.  3 Since then, mHealth interventions have continued to gain popularity, but their effects remain uncertain. Due to the continuous introduction of new applications (apps) and the removal of existing ones, it is challenging to determine the precise number of mHealth apps globally. However, by 2021, the count surpassed 350,000,  4  with diabetes being one of the most commonly addressed conditions by these apps.  5 Although randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated a few of these interventions,  6  most apps are not supported by evidence, making it hard to choose one that is suitable to facilitate DSME/S. Evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions may help people with type 2 diabetes and their healthcare providers to make better decisions regarding their use.\n\nThis systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of DSME, DSMS or both delivered by mHealth interventions versus usual care (UC) or attention placebo control (APC) in adults with type 2 diabetes."

      "text": "Relevant publications discussing DSME, DSMS or both interventions were searched in six databases: (1) MEDLINE, (2) Embase, (3) PsycINFO, (4) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, (5) Clini calTr ials. gov, and (6) World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The search string was developed together with a skilled librarian and combined three groups of words; words related to the population, the intervention and the study design (i.e., RCT). Specific search strings are shown in Appendix A. The search was limited to publications published from 2000 and onwards. The last search was conducted on January 31, 2023. Other potentially eligible publications were identified by searching the reference lists of the included publications, systematic reviews, metaanalyses and health technology assessment reports. In addition, authors of included publications were contacted to identify any additional and/or missing information on the retrieved study and to identify further publications that may have been missed. The protocol of the systematic review was published before (CD012869)."

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that unidirectional diabetes self-management education and support delivered is effective in reducing HbA1c. retrieved to determine its eligibility. The full-text of all potentially relevant publications was obtained and screened for eligibility. Any disagreements were resolved through consensus or by recourse to a fifth author (GR).\n\nSeveral inclusion criteria were used to determine eligibility. First, publications were included when they investigated a mHealth intervention that provided: (a) DSME, (b) DSMS, or (c) DSME/S. Second, the intervention should target adults (aged 18 or older) with type 2 diabetes. Trials involving participants with comorbid disorders were eligible for inclusion as long as the primary focus of the intervention was DSME, DSMS or DSME/S. Trials involving a broader population (e.g., individuals with a chronic illness) were only included when the results for individuals with type 2 diabetes were presented separately. When these data were not available, a request was sent to the authors. Third, the study design was an RCT. Fourth, the mHealth intervention was eligible when the intervention was provided either via short message service (SMS), text messages, voice messages (including automated telephone calls) or via a smartphone application. All mobile devices were eligible vehicles for the intervention: mobile phones, smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. Wearables were only included when the intervention was delivered directly to the wearable, or when the intervention was delivered to a mobile phone, smartphone or other mobile device that was connected to the wearable. Fifth, the comparator condition discussed was either UC or APC; the APC group does not receive the actual intervention but receives an intervention that covers the same amount of time and attention as the experimental group received  7  . Lastly, relevant outcome data should be discussed (see 'Coding').\n\nPublications were excluded when they focused on personal communication by mobile devices only, such as telephone calls with healthcare providers. Also, nonautomated interventions, such as tailored feedback on glucose values from healthcare providers, were excluded. Because we were looking for mHealth interventions that could cope with the worldwide increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes and the relative scarcity of healthcare providers, we excluded trials reporting on remote monitoring of patients and novel ways of patient-provider communication, but also trials that investigated mHealth interventions that were primarily data records/diaries. However, interventions with only contact between individuals with diabetes and healthcare providers in case of concern about health outcomes or values, were considered automated as such procedures can ensure safety. Publications investigating personal records, data entries or diaries, and trials investigating mHealth interventions targeting healthcare providers were also excluded. Additionally, non-peer-reviewed papers (e.g., thesis, books), study protocols, reviews and meta-analyses were excluded."

The following data was extracted: (a) first author, (b) publication year, (c) study design, (d) study setting, including country, (e) trial period, (f) intervention characteristics and duration, (g) type of comparator (UC or APC), (h) sample characteristics (inclusion criteria, number of participants randomised, gender, age and diabetes duration), and (i) outcome measure(s) and results.\n\nThe following outcomes were collected. Glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measured as % or mmol/mol. Body weight: measured in kilograms (kg) or as body mass index (BMI, in kg/m 2 ). Hypoglycaemic episodes: classified as mild (self-managed), moderate (daily activities interrupted but self-management) and severe (requiring assistance from others), or as trial authors' definition. Adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life/health status, diabetes treatment satisfaction, self-care behaviours, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipid profile (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol and triglycerides), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and healthcare related costs were also analysed. HbA1c was the primary outcome. Taking the generally accepted minimally relevant difference into account, a mean difference (MD) of 4 mmol/ mol (0.4%) was considered clinically relevant."

Per publication, each domain was rated as having a 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk. The risk was labelled as 'unclear' when insufficient information was provided to make the judgement.

For continuous outcomes measured on the same scale, the MD with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as an estimate of the effect size. The MD for the continuous outcomes was calculated using the mean, standard deviation (SD) and sample size reported at post-intervention. For dichotomous data, the risk ratio (RR) or Peto's odds ratio with 95% CI were used as an estimate of effect. Both were calculated using the frequency of the event in both conditions and the sample size. Peto's odds ratio was used for rare events, occurring at rates below 1%. A random effect model was used with due consideration to the whole distribution of effects and a prediction interval was presented.  8 n case of missing data, the authors of the publication were contacted. When the mean or SD for outcomes was not obtained, we imputed these values by estimating the mean and variance from the median, range, sample size, and figures embedded in the manuscript.  9 Data from crossover trials was included; however, only the data from the first period to avoid the risk of bias due to carry-over effects.  10 Besides investigating whether the effect of the intervention differed from pre-to post-intervention, subgroup analyses were done for the primary outcome HbA1c. These analyses make it possible to identify whether the effect differed for gender, age (<60 years versus \u226560 years), the proportion of people receiving insulin (<50% versus \u226550%), level of metabolic control (HbA1c >64 mmol/mol [>8.0%] versus HbA1c \u226464 mmol/mol [\u22648.0%]), and type of control group (APC versus UC).\n\nHeterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I 2 statistics. There is true variation in the effect size when the Q-statistic is significant, and the I 2 statistic indicates the amount of real variance.  11 A p-value of \u2264. 05 was used to determine significance; however, when the number of studies or sample size was small, a value of \u22640.10 was used.  10 As an indication of publication bias, the funnel plots were visually inspected when there were 10 or more trials for any outcome. The software Review Manager version 5.4.1 was used for all the analyses.  12"

Nineteen trials  19, 28, 30, 31, 46, 47, 51, 52, 55  reported sufficient information on both sequence generation and allocation concealment and were classified as low risk of selection bias.  15, 17, 23, 26, 32, 41, 42, 45, 53, 54 Due to the nature of the interventions, which requires overt participation, blinding the participants was not possible. In two trials, the outcome assessor was blinded,  17, 53  but in these trials, some outcomes were assessed by the participants who were not blinded (for example self-care behaviours). One of these two trials also reported blinding of the treating physicians.  17 In one trial, the outcome assessor of the primary outcome was blinded.  42 We classified the outcome 'all-cause mortality' as a low risk of performance bias since this outcome is unlikely to be influenced by blinding. Concerning detection bias (blinding of the outcome assessor), we judged most laboratory outcomes as low risk of bias. For other outcomes, the risk of detection bias differed per trial.

Therefore, the funnel plots were inspected to identify potential publication bias. The funnel plots are included in Appendix C. The funnel plot of DSMS studies shows a symmetrical distribution, indicating an absence of publication bias (Figure  C1 ). The funnel plot of DSME/S studies shows that the majority of trials are at the top of the graph, and the distribution is more to the right as the sample size decreases (Figure  C2 ). This can be indicative of publication bias and the effect of DSME/S on HbA1c may need to be interpreted carefully."

      "text": "We included 43 trials (45 records) with 9328 participants to assess the effects of DSME and support alone or combined, delivered by mobile health interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe included trials covered a wide variety of mHealth interventions. Also, the aim of the trials varied widely: from improving HbA1c (43 trials) to improving lipid profiles (14 trials), blood pressure (11 trials) medication adherence (4 trials), to improving insulin titration or blood glucose self-monitoring (4 trials). mHealth interventions improved HbA1c by about 4 mmol/mol (0.4%), with the largest effect for DSMS and no significant overall risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. This effect was not only significant but also clinically relevant.\n\nWith DSME, no statistically significant differences were found on other outcomes. Based on eight trials, DSMS showed a significant decrease in BMI; and in four studies, the weekly frequency of self-monitoring blood glucose increased in the DSMS intervention group. Specifically, DSMS had a positive impact on HDLcholesterol in four studies. Based on two trials medication adherence improved with DSME/S, and DSME/S had a significant positive impact on SBP (pooled analysis of 5 trials)."

      "text": "All but seven trials included participants with type 2 diabetes; five trials failed to report on the type of diabetes,  21, 26, 28, 55, 57  one trial investigated both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes but performed a subgroup analysis restricted to type 2 diabetes for HbA1c,  42  and one included both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes with an unknown distribution.  43 Also the level of metabolic control varied widely: from a mean HbA1c of 46 mmol/mol (6.4%)  22  to 88 mmol/mol (10.2%)  39  at baseline.\n\nBased on the variety of the different type 2 diabetes populations, treated both in primary and secondary care and with a wide range of diabetes control, we conclude that the results of our meta-analysis are applicable to the general type 2 diabetes population.\n\nThe outcome data of the included trials were fairly complete. Nevertheless, only nine out of the 19 authors who were contacted replied to our queries. To include the trials with missing data in our meta-analyses, we had to make the following imputations: (1) estimate the SD at follow-up by using the average of the pooled baseline SDs for HbA1c,  22, 45  BMI,  22  SBP,  22  DBP  22  and SDSCA  22  and (2) estimate numbers from figures and use pooled baseline SD when applicable (HbA1c,  41  FPG,  33  weekly frequency of SMBG,  33  proportion of participants with hypoglycaemic episode,  24  and weekly frequency of exercise  34  ).\n\nThe majority of studies poorly defined hypoglycaemia and thus in the majority of studies, it was unclear how hypoglycaemia was assessed. Only two out of seven studies (partly) reported the methodology; one study reported using a fingerprick to confirm  24  and one study used a query.  26 To determine the validity of the methods used, it is important for future studies to clearly define and report on the methodology."

With regard to selection bias, most trials were classified as low risk of bias.\n\nTaking the aforementioned, the overall certainty of the evidence was rated moderate for the objective outcome. While we were unable to investigate potential publication bias by funnel plots, it is important to note that we classified 18 trials as potentially relevant studies awaiting classification. Many of these studies were conference proceedings in 2022 (n = 13), of which we were not able to find a full manuscript reporting the results."

Additionally, studies with longer intervention periods (12-18 months, n = 4 studies) had higher effect sizes and percentage differences on HbA1c (1.52 to 2.92%).  66 o summarise, in agreement with our systematic review, other reviews also found a statistically significant and clinically relevant HbA1c decrease by mHealth interventions. Like our review, other reviews found uncertain effects with regard to other outcomes especially the self reported outcomes like self management and treatment satisfaction. Pooling of self-reported outcomes is challaging since these outcomes are less often included in studies, and when included difficult to pool due to a difference in assessment used."

      "text": "mHealth interventions, those with education and those with support appear to have clinically relevant effects on HbA1c compared to UC and APC in adults with type 2 diabetes, without additional effect of the combination of automated education and support. Education alone had no significant other effects, whereas some interventions with DSMS or DSME/S seem to have beneficial effects on BMI, SBP and HDL-cholesterol, and uncertain effect on self-care behaviours. Since there were no adverse events, and no increase in the number of (severe) hypoglycaemic episodes, the use of a mHealth intervention in practice seems to be justified, even without sufficient evidence for its cost-effectiveness. mHealth interventions that provide support (either DSMS or DSME/S), seem most beneficial on other outcomese besides HbA1c and may focus on a specific self-care behaviour. Healthcare providers and individuals with type 2 diabetes should make an informed, shared decision on which mHealth intervention fits best regarding the individuals' needs and barriers, but also on whether a mHealth intervention is suited for that person at all (Tables B1, B2, B3 and Figures  C1  and  C2 )."

      "text": "The field of mHealth studies is dominated by pilot and feasibility studies. While these types of studies are important, in many cases no sufficiently powered RCT was conducted after the pilot trial. The same applies to the large number of trials awaiting classification. Therefore we suggest that if a pilot study shows effectiveness, researchers should always try to conduct an adequately sized/powered randomised clinical trial instead of developing a new mHealth intervention.\n\nIn many of the included trials, the methods section reporting on the intervention was poorly structured. In 2016, a guideline for reporting mHealth interventions was published by the WHO mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group 67 to improve the reporting of mHealth interventions, they developed a checklist on mHealth evidence reporting and assessment. The checklist provides a minimum set of information needed to define what the mHealth intervention is (content), where it is being implemented (context), and how it was implemented (technical features), to support replication of the intervention.\n\nWe encourage future researchers to report about their mHealth intervention accordingly.\n\nOnly a few trials investigated patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Future research should include patient reported outcomes as well.\n\ninterventions for type 2 diabetes in low-and-middle income countries: a systematic review.
