  "abstract": "Objective: Goal setting is a common feature of behavior change interventions, but it is unclear when goal setting is optimally effective. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to evaluate: (a) the unique effects of goal setting on behavior change, and (b) under what circumstances and for whom goal setting works best. Method: Four databases were searched for papers that assessed the unique effects of goal setting on behavior change using randomized controlled trials. 141 papers were identified from which 384 effect sizes (N = 16,523) were extracted and analyzed. A moderator analysis of sample characteristics, intervention characteristics, inclusion of other behavior change techniques, study design and delivery, quality of study, outcome measures and behavior targeted was conducted. Results: A random effects model indicated a small positive unique effect of goal setting across a range of behaviors, d = .34 (CI = .28 to .41). Moderator analyses indicated that goal setting was particularly effective if the goal was: (a) difficult, (b) set publicly, and (c) was a group goal. There was weaker evidence that goal setting was more effective when paired with external monitoring of the behavior/ outcome by others without feedback and delivered face-to-face. Conclusions: Goal setting is an effective behavior change technique that has the potential to be considered a fundamental component of successful interventions. The present review adds novel insights into the means by which goal setting might be augmented to maximize behavior change and sets the agenda for future programs of research.",

      "text": "A goal is \"the object or aim of an action\"  (Locke & Latham, 2002, p. 705)  and goal setting is one of the fundamental techniques that public bodies and government agencies recommend to promote behavior change (e.g.,  NICE, 2014; NHBLI, 2000) . Goal setting is considered to be a key element in helping individuals to regulate their own behavior and has been used in numerous fields including education (e.g.,  Bandura & Schunk, 1981) , sport (e.g.,  Anshel, Weinberg & Jackson, 1992) , health (e.g.,  Alexy, 1985) , social behaviors (e.g.,  Madera, King & Hebl, 2013) , production (e.g.,  Jackson & Zedeck, 1982)  and the environment (e.g., Baca-Motes,  Brown, Gneezy, Keenan & Nelson, 2012) . Goal setting is a commonly used behavior change technique: A recent review of interventions designed to increase physical activity found that goal setting was the third most often used technique with 34% (26 out of 76) of the interventions including a goal setting component  (Conn, Hafdahl, Phillips, Ruppar and Chase, 2014) . However, despite the popularity of goal setting as a technique to be included in behavior change interventions, and several meta-analyses that explore the effects of goal setting on behavior change  (Chidester & Grigsby, Conn et al., 2014; 1984; Kleingeld, van Mierlo, & Arends, 2011; Mento, Steele, & Karren, 1987; Neubert, 1998; Tubbs, 1986; Wood, Mento, & Locke, 1987)"

      "title": "Goal Setting Theory",
      "text": "Goal setting theory  (Locke & Latham, 2002; Locke & Latham, 2006)  was derived from a series of industrial / organizational psychology experiments regarding work-related task performance  (Locke & Latham, 2002) . The original theory posits that goal setting will promote behavior change when two conditions are met: (a) the goal must be conscious and specific, and (b) the goal must be sufficiently difficult (i.e., over and above what is usually achieved).\n\nThe idea that goals should be \"conscious and specific\" (e.g., \"reduce hill running time by 7 seconds\") can be contrasted with general intentions or vague goals such as \"do your best\" goals (e.g., \"I will do my best at hill running\").\n\nReviews of studies that compared specific goals with \"do your best\" or no goals found a medium sized effect (the overall effect sizes found by the various metaanalyses range from d = .42 to d = .56) for goal setting on behavior or performance  (Chidester & Grigsby, 1984; Kleingeld et al., 2011; Mento et al., 1987; Tubbs, 1986; Wood et al., 1987) . The idea that goals should be \"sufficiently difficult\" is supported by evidence showing medium to large effects on behavior/ performance (the overall effect sizes found by meta-analyses range from d = .44 to d = .82) of setting difficult goals compared with setting easy goals  (Chidester & Grigsby, 1984; Kleingeld et al., 2011; Mento et al., 1987; Tubbs, 1986; Wood et al., 1987) ."

      "text": "Goal setting theory proposes four moderators of the goal setting-behavior relationship  (Latham & Seijts, 2016; Locke & Latham, 2002; Locke & Latham, 2006) . Thus, the positive relationship between goal setting and behavior is hypothesized to be enhanced when: (a) people are more committed to the goal, (b) the task is low in complexity (i.e., the number of acts and decisions required to reach the goal is low;  Wood 1986 ), (c) feedback is received regarding progress towards the goal  (Locke & Latham, 2002)  and (d) there are adequate situational resources / few situational constraints  (Latham & Seijts, 2016) .\n\nTo date, the effect of goal commitment and situational constraints / resources on goal setting have not been subject to meta-analytic review, but task complexity and feedback have. Task complexity has been the focus of two reviews, one of which found that increased task complexity decreased the effect of goals on individual performance  (Wood et al., 1987) . The second review found that task complexity was not a moderating factor for goals that were set for groups rather than individuals  (Kleingeld et al., 2011) . The implication is that the combined capabilities of people in groups exceeds that of solo individuals, meaning that groups are better equipped to handle complex tasks; this reflects the premise that the moderating effect of task complexity is only likely to occur when the person does not have sufficient ability  (Locke & Latham, 1990) .\n\nFeedback has also been found to be a significant moderator of the relationship between goal setting and behavior change when studies compare a goal setting plus feedback condition with a goal setting only condition (the overall effect sizes found by the two meta-analyses are d = .56 and d = .63; Neubert, 1998; Tubbs, 1986) . In contrast with the research reviewed above, in which provision of feedback was experimentally manipulated, meta-analyses that coded for the presence or absence of feedback produced mixed results. For example,  Mento et al. (1987)  found no effects of feedback whereas  Chidester and Grigsby (1984)  found strong positive effects of accompanying goal setting with feedback."

      "title": "The Present Review",
      "text": "Reviews to date suggest that goal setting may be effective in changing behavior, but suffer a number of limitations, including: (a) focusing on a limited range of studies (i.e., a selected behavior, such as work-related goals, health / therapy goals, or only group goals;  Chidester & Grigsby, 1984; Kleingeld et al., 2011; Matre, Dahl, Jensen & Nordhahl, 2013; Mento et al., 1987; Shilts, Townsend, & Dishman, 2013; Tubbs, 1986; Wood et al., 1987) , (b) including correlational studies so causation cannot be inferred  (Chidester & Grigsby, 1984; Kleingeld et al., 2011; Mento et al., 1987; Tubbs, 1986) , (c) including only published studies meaning that publication bias might account for the patterns of findings, and (d) not exploring a range of theoretical and practical moderators.\n\nThe present meta-analysis addresses these issues by assessing studies that have uniquely tested goal setting on behavioral or performance tasks, and excluding correlational studies from the analyses.\n\nFor a behavior change technique to be optimal it is important to determine under which circumstances and for whom goal setting is most effective in changing behavior. This might include exploring the effect of different types of goals, the correspondence between the goal and dependent variable and the effect of adding other behavior change techniques related to goal setting. The following discussion considers the potential moderators of the effects of goal setting on behavior/performance."

      "title": "Proposed Moderators",
      "text": "Behavioral versus outcome goals. Goal setting theory  (Locke & Latham, 2002; Locke & Latham, 2006 ) makes a distinction between goals that focus on behavior and goals that focus on outcomes. For example, someone who wishes to lose weight may set a behavioral goal of not snacking between meals or an outcome goal of losing 1lb of weight per week. More recently, experts involved in the development of the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1;  Michie et al., 2013)  make a similar distinction between these two types of goal setting. However, the taxonomy is limited in so far as the reasons for the proposed distinction between outcome goals and behavioral goals are not made explicit and no evidence is presented with regards to the effectiveness of outcome goals or behavioral goals (or indeed other behavior change techniques).\n\nOne aim of the present research is to address these limitations by examining the proposed distinction between behavioral goals and outcome goals. Ajzen and Fishbein's (1977)  principle of correspondence, the effectiveness of a set goal on the dependent variable (i.e., behavior or outcome) is likely to be related to how closely the set goal resembles the measured behavior or outcome. Thus, goals that are directly related to the dependent variable (e.g., a goal of completing five pages of arithmetic problems each day and a dependent variable that measures the number of pages completed) are likely to have larger effect sizes than goals and dependent variables that are indirectly related (e.g., a goal of completing five pages of arithmetic problems each day and a dependent variable that measures an arithmetic test score). Perhaps surprisingly, the effect of correspondence between goal set and behavior/outcome has not yet been tested."

      "text": "With the exception of feedback  (Chidester & Grigsby, 1984; Mento et al., 1987; Tubbs, 1986) , there has been little exploration of the effect of pairing additional complementary behavior change techniques with goal setting. It is clear that there are other behavior change techniques that would increase the effectiveness of goal setting on changing behavior. To self-regulate their behavior a person compares their current state with a personally desired state (i.e., commitment; BCTTv1 number 1.9) and if a discrepancy is detected this motivates people to perform a behavior that reduces the discrepancy (i.e., discrepancy between current behavior and goal; BCTTv1 number 1.6). The process is iterative so feedback is necessary in order to review progress (i.e., feedback on behavior BCTTv1 number 2.2; feedback on outcomes of behavior BCTTv1 number 2.7). In addition, a person is more likely to choose a behavior in order to pursue a goal if their expectations of success are sufficient therefore reviewing goals to ensure they are achievable could increase goal setting effectiveness (i.e., review behavior goals BCTTv1 number 1.5; review outcome goals BCTTv1 number 1.7). Furthermore, witnessed behavioral contracts (BCTTv1 number 1.8) can only be signed once a goal has been set. The effectiveness of these techniques to enhance the effect of goal setting has thus far not been explored in previous reviews of goal setting (with the exception of feedback), yet each might be expected to augment the effects of simply setting a goal."

There were three inclusion criteria for the review. First, studies had to test the unique effects of goal setting meaning that a condition including goal setting had to be compared with a control condition that was identical minus the goal setting component (for a secondary analysis, papers were also included where the control and intervention conditions differed in goal setting and one of the related techniques of commitment, review of goals, discrepancies, behavioral contract or feedback). Second, the studies had to randomize participants to condition. Third, the dependent variable was behavior or outcome (i.e., an action depicted in the goal e.g., resisting unhealthy food or an outcome associated with such an action e.g., weight loss) -studies that only measured variables related to the goal setting process itself (e.g., satisfaction, ability to form goals) were excluded."

The literature search identified 5,059 potentially relevant references and 133 references were obtained from other sources (i.e., reference lists of included articles, reviews of goal setting, recent edited books / chapters of goal setting e.g.,  Locke & Latham, 2013) . After eliminating duplicate references (n= 628), the remaining 4,564 references were screened for eligibility. Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria from the abstract (n = 4,274) were excluded at this stage, leaving 290 articles for which full texts were obtained and assessed. Principal reasons for exclusion, at the abstract stage, were that the paper did not report a goal setting intervention (n = 2,218), was not an empirical study (n = 1,742), and conditions differed by a behavior change technique that was not goal setting (or was not related to goal setting as per the secondary analysis; n = 246). Examination of the full texts led to the exclusion of a further 111 articles. The principal reason for exclusion at this stage was that conditions differed by a behavior change technique that was not related to goal setting (n = 56). The remaining articles (n = 141) met the inclusion criteria for the main analysis, reporting 384 tests of the impact of goal setting on behavior. A secondary analysis was conducted on articles that had included a behavior change technique that complemented goal setting (n = 38; 85 cases)."

      "title": "Study Coding",
      "text": "For studies that compared multiple goal setting conditions with a control condition an effect size was calculated for each experimental condition compared with the control condition (with the n for the control group adjusted for multiple comparisons) (see Appendix S1). For example,  Bar-Eli et al. (1993)  compared a measurement only control group with four experimental groups who were asked to set \"easy goals,\" \"moderate goals,\" \"difficult goals,\" and \"very difficult goals.\" Four effect sizes were calculated using the control group (n divided by 4) as the comparison.\n\nWhere studies did not report data separately for multiple goal setting conditions the effect size was calculated so that it compared the combined goal setting conditions with the control condition (see Appendix S1). For example, Rosswork (1977) compared four goal setting conditions with four control conditions and so for the present analyses the effect size was calculated on the basis of all four intervention conditions compared with all four control conditions.\n\nWhere studies reported data from several sub-samples, an effect size was calculated for each sub-sample and the sub-samples were treated as separate tests in the meta-analysis to form the basis for moderator analyses (see Appendix S1). For example,  Schnoll and Zimmerman (2001)  compared two goal setting conditions (goal setting with self monitoring and goal setting alone) with two similar control conditions; two tests were coded separately for the metaanalysis to provide an effect size for goal setting only versus control and an effect size for goals setting plus monitoring versus monitoring only control.\n\nWhere studies included multiple control/ comparison groups the effect size in the analysis was calculated using data from the comparison group that most closely matched the goal setting condition (see Appendix S1). For example, Nemeroff and Cosentino (1979) compared three conditions: (a) goal setting and feedback, (b) feedback only, and (c) control; the feedback condition was used as the comparison condition to the goal setting and feedback condition.\n\nWhere studies measured behavior at multiple time points, we adopted the conservative strategy of calculating the effect size only for the measure at the final time-point (e.g.,  Epton et al., 2015; Sheeran, Harris & Epton, 2013) . For example,  Weinberg et al. (1991)  measured sit ups once each week over 4 weeks after the goal setting exercise manipulation; the fourth week measure was used to calculate the effect size reported in the present analyses.\n\nIf multiple behavioral dependent variables were reported, then an effect size was calculated for each and a mean was used in the analysis. For example, in  Alexy's (1985)  study participants each set a number of health goals (e.g., weight loss, seatbelt use) and so an effect size was calculated for each type of goal and the mean used in the present analyses."

The papers consisted of 128 (91%) published articles and 13 theses (9%). The quality of the design of the studies/ reporting of the studies varied in ratings of blinding, randomization and attrition  (Chalmers et al., 1990) . The majority of cases received low ratings on blinding and randomization; i.e., 91% were rated as \"blinding was not possible or unclear if blinded\" and 98% were rated as \"randomized but method not described and experimenter was not blinded to condition\". Ratings regarding attrition and how the studies dealt with this varied, with the majority of studies (67%) receiving the highest rating \"attrition did not occur or all those assigned to condition analyzed\"; however, a large proportion of studies received a lower rating (31%) as \"attrition was not mentioned or completers only were analyzed\".\n\nThe cases varied in the type of populations sampled. Sixty-seven percent recruited university students, 12% recruited the general population, and 13% recruited school children. On average, the samples were approximately equal regarding gender (49.50% female, SD = 24.09), of mostly white ethnicity (M = 61.23%, SD = 29.46) and were 23.71 years old (SD = 11.01).\n\nThe goal setting interventions differed in the type of behavior targeted; 49% were cognitive goals (e.g., complete maze in a certain number of moves), 22% were sporting goals (e.g., performance at archery), 7% were production goals (build Lego models), 6% were health related goals (e.g., weight loss), and 6% were educational goals (e.g., increase study time). The majority of studies asked participants to set goals related to outcomes (70%; e.g., lose 1lb of weight per week) as opposed to behaviors (29%; e.g., eat 5 portions of fruit and vegetables daily), or both (1%). The majority of goals were set in relation to external standards (71%; e.g., do 50 sit ups), as opposed to setting goals relative to the participant's current status (28%; e.g., improve sit-up total by 20%) or both (1%). The mean number of goals set was 1.35 (SD = 1.21), the average number of repetitions of setting a goal was 3.82 (SD = 10.22) and training was given for goal setting in 3% of the cases. The difficulty of goals varied: easy goals (12%), moderately difficult goals (19%), and difficult goals (33%). The mean task complexity was 3.58 (SD = 1.97).\n\nThe experimental and the comparison interventions included a range of behavior change techniques other than goal setting that were present in both the intervention and comparison groups. These included behavioral practice or rehearsal (69%), feedback on outcomes or behavior (40%), instruction on how to perform the behavior (18%), self-monitoring of outcomes or behavior (12%), demonstration of the behavior (10%), and monitoring of outcome or behavior by others without feedback (6%). The mean number of behavior change techniques was 1.74 (SD = 1.14).\n\nThe control groups were mainly \"do your best\" goals (i.e., a vague goal) (66%), and measurement only/ other intervention (31%). A researcher (56%) typically delivered the goal setting intervention, in a university setting (64%).\n\nThe goals were set by varied means; the main means were experimenter verbalizes the goal (27%), participant writes goal (14%) and written goal provided (22%). In a large number of cases the goal was shared with the intervention deliverer only (28%). The goals were mainly individual goals (88%) but also included group goals (9%) or both (3%). Goals were typically set by someone else (74%), but also included self set goals (18%), collaboratively set goals (24%) and a combination of self and other set (1%). The timing of the goals were mainly proximal (81%), with some distal (15%) and few containing both kinds of goals (4%). The mean follow up period was 2.10 (SD = 5.36) weeks after the goal setting intervention."

      "text": "Across 384 tests (N = 16,523) goal setting had statistically significant effects on behavior (d = .34, CI = .28 to .41). According to Cohen's criterion (1992) the effect size is small (whereby d = .20 is small and d = .50 is a medium sized effect). The analysis was repeated with winsorized data to assess the effect of extreme outliers (i.e., +/-3 SD; 8 values were adjusted) and the effect remained the same (d = .34, CI = .28 to .39). The analyses were repeated: (a) excluding the studies that had not provided enough data to calculate an accurate effect size (k = 332, d = .40, CI = .33 to .47), and (b) by replacing the estimates for non-significant results with a value calculated from p = .50 (k = 384, d = .34, CI = .28 to .41).\n\nThe Fail Safe N, a calculation of the number of studies with an effect size of zero that would be needed to make the effect non-significant, is 269  (Orwin, 1983 ). An examination of the funnel plots (see Figure  S1 ) and the metabias command in STATA using the Egger test were used to determine the presence of small study effects; a significant skew was found, B = .66, SE = .27, p = .013. The publication bias for small samples with significant results leads to an excess of underpowered studies, leading to an overestimation of the effect size  (Kraimer, Gardner, Brooks, & Yesavage, 1998) . Therefore sensitivity analysis using studies that meet a 55% power threshold was conducted (recommended by  Coyne, Thombs, & Hagerdoorn, 2010) . For 55% power to detect a medium effect size (d = .50) a sample of 35 or more participants per cell was required  (Epton et al., 2015) . The effect of goal setting on behavior remained significant (k = 69, d = .38, CI = .26 to .50) when this criterion was used 4 ."

There were no differences if the goal was proximal (k = 380 of which k = 324 were proximal) or distal (k = 380 of which k = 70 were distal). There were no differences due to the time interval between the goal setting and the measurement of the dependent variable (k = 378). There were too few cases to analyze differences due to if the goal was made by the person whose behavior or outcomes were measured as opposed to if the goal setting was directed at a person whose behavior was not measured (e.g., physiotherapist set a goal for how to treat a patient but the behavior measured was patient outcomes).

      "text": "Encouraging people to set goals is a technique that is used widely to promote behavior change, and the present review showed a positive effect on behavior. Relative to participants in comparison conditions, participants in goal setting conditions showed greater behavior change across a wide range of behaviors.\n\nVarious analyses and tests indicate that the effect is robust. The small sized effect (d = .34) was retained when: (a) extreme outliers were dealt with (d = .34), and (b) estimates based on an effect size of zero were replaced with values calculated from p = .50 (d = .34). The small sized effect was marginally increased when: (a) studies were excluded that had been estimated based on an effect size of zero (d = .40), and (b) studies were excluded that did not reach a stated power threshold (d = .38). Publication bias was addressed by including papers from unpublished sources, although the Egger test did show that there was skewness. The overall effect found in the present review is smaller than the medium effect sizes of previous reviews (the overall effect sizes found by the previous meta-analyses range from d = .42 to d = .56; Chidester & Grigsby, 1984; Kleingeld, van Mierlo, & Arends, 2011; Mento, Steele, & Karren, 1987; Tubbs, 1986; Wood, Mento, & Locke, 1987) . However, the present review is arguably more robust because it excluded correlational studies, included unpublished dissertations and studies that had reported a non-significant result but did not provide data.\n\nAlthough the effect of goal setting on behavior is small, it is comparable with reviews of other individual behavior change techniques such as those that reflect on a valued self-identity  (d = .32; Epton et al., 2015; BCTTv1 number 13.4)  and action planning (d = .31; Belanger-Gravel, Godin, & Amireault, 2013; BCTTv1 number 1.4). The implication is that goal setting is one of the building blocks for designing effective behavior change interventions. However, behavior change techniques that we identified as complementary to goal setting, namely, feedback, commitment, behavioral contracts, and reviewing goals seemed to add little to the effect of goal setting per se. These findings contradict predictions made by goal setting theory  (Locke & Latham, 2002)  that feedback, commitment, reviewing goals and behavioral contracts would increase the effectiveness of goal setting. However, this lack of effect may be due to the small number of studies included in this analysis (it should be noted that review of behavior or outcome goals had a small sample size of k = 12, that behavioral contract and feedback had modest sample sizes of k = 21 and k = 25, respectively). It is noteworthy that a comparison of current standing and the goal (i.e., discrepancy) was not used in the studies included in this analysis or at least not explicitly detailed."

      "title": "Difficulty.",
      "text": "The studies in the present review provided evidence that goal difficulty (i.e., the extent to which the goal that was set exceeded that which would be typically achieved) moderated the effect of goal setting on outcomes with more difficult goals having a stronger effect than easier goals. The analysis showed that easy and moderate goals were effective but only had a small effect compared to the larger effect of difficult goals; this is comparable to what had been found in previous reviews and is consistent with goal setting theory (Locke improbable difficult goals may be detrimental; most goals coded as difficult in this meta-analysis were still achievable (k = 10 were coded as improbable so it was not possible to analyze the effect of this). It is important to note that goals should still be set within an achievable range for that person, as although improbable goals may still have a positive influence on motivation  (Weinberg, Bruya, Garland & Jackson, 1990) , they may reduce achievement  (Bar-Eli et al., 1997) .\n\nCommitment. Manipulating goal commitment was associated with a small but significant effect; however, the size of this effect (d = .20; k = 27) was significantly lower than the effect of those studies that used goal setting alone (d = .34). Goal theory (Locke &  Latham, 1990; Locke & Latham, 2002; Locke & Latham, 2006)  states that goal commitment is a necessary prerequisite for goal attainment when the goals are difficult. There were too few studies to explore the effect of manipulating goal commitment only when goal difficulty was high (k = 1). However, this result suggests that manipulating goal commitment has a negative effect on goal progress when the goals are easy or moderate. Furthermore, studies that measured goal commitment (after setting the goal but prior to the goal setting task) resulted in less positive outcomes than those studies that did not ask participants about their commitment (k = 74). This negative effect may be due to participants recognizing that they are not committed to the goal, and thus spend little effort on pursuing the goal. However, there are debates around the measurement of goal commitment even using established scales, as these scales included items that reflect outcome expectancies and items that lower the scale consistency  (Klein & Wright, 2001) ; as most studies were conducted prior to new scale development it is not possible to explore the effect of measurement errors.\n\nTask complexity. The present meta-analysis suggests that task complexity does not moderate the effectiveness of goal attainment. This mirrors the results of the meta-analysis of  Kleingeld et al. (2011)  who also found no effect but contrasts with the meta-analysis of  Wood et al. (1987)  who found that increased complexity reduced performance. Kleingeld et al. (2011)  suggests three reasons why a significant effect of task complexity was not found in their meta-analysis: (i) that the groups' goal setting in their meta-analysis showed superior ability to overcome the problems with task complexity than the individuals in  Wood et al.'s (1987)  review, (ii) that only six studies used a highly complex task in their analysis so may not be reliable, and (iii) the moderating effect in Wood et al.'s meta-analysis may have been overstated as the difference between the effect sizes for low, moderate and high complexity was only small. The present meta analysis included studies that mainly sampled university students who would be expected to have sufficient skills and knowledge to conduct complex tasks; however, the review also found that goal setting was less effective in student samples suggesting that high ability might not be the cause of a lack of a moderating effect of task complexity.\n\nGiven that the present review has a modest but larger number of studies (k = 64) with a high task complexity, than  Kleingeld et al. and Wood et al., this  suggests that either (a) the analysis in the present study may also not be reliable or (b) the moderating effect of Wood et al.'s meta-analysis may have been overstated. It is notable that Wood et al. did not conduct a statistical test of the differences between levels of task complexity. The results of the present review (d = .26; k = 107 for low, d = .22, k = 54 for medium, d = .22, k = 64 for high) show that the effects of low, medium and high task complexity were much smaller than those of  Kleingeld et al. (2011; d = .32 to .56 for low, d = .48 to .87 for medium, d = .33 to 1.08 for high) and  Wood et al. (1987; d = . 69 for low, d = .50 for medium, d = .48 for high); however, this could be due to the inclusion of studies in the present analyses that reported a non-significant results with no data to calculate an effect size. An additional factor that may account for the mixed results is the fact that task complexity has typically been operationalized objectively (i.e., the number of task components) but may include subjective components such as the capability of the individual to perform the task. Indeed, later versions of goal setting theory suggest that if the complexity of a task exceeds the person's ability then a learning goal rather than a performance goal should be set  (Locke & Latham, 2006) .\n\nFeedback. The present analyses did not add support to the claim of goal setting theory that feedback increases the effectiveness of goal setting as including feedback (k = 25) was not associated with a significant effect on behavior and outcomes ; however the sample size was moderate so strong conclusions cannot be drawn.\n\nSituational resources / constraints. The review found no studies that had met the inclusion criteria that had explicitly manipulated resources or constraints. Moreover, there was not enough detail reported in the studies to develop a coding frame to explore this variable. It would be valuable in future research to investigate empirically the effects of situational resources/ constraints on the effects of goal setting."

The studies in the present review indicated that goal setting was particularly effective for males, younger participants and samples from the general population or children recruited from schools. It is notable that effect sizes for behavior change were smaller among student samples; given that 67% of the studies reported in the present analyses were carried out with university student participants, the possibility arises that goal setting-based interventions could be particularly effective outside this narrow population base. Moreover, goal setting was most effective for Asian participants, although the analyses should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies containing this information. Nevertheless, it would be valuable in future research to investigate further the effects of goal setting on a wider demographic outside of the undergraduate student body."

Our moderator analyses do not provide strong support for a distinction between setting behavioral goals versus setting outcome goals: further analysis shows that setting behavioral goals had slightly stronger effects on behavior than on outcomes; setting outcome goals had slightly larger effects on outcomes than on behaviors. That said, our data are correlational and no studies to date have directly assessed the effects of setting behavioral goals versus setting outcome goals on behaviors versus outcomes."

Interestingly, goal setting was just as effective when it was used in isolation than when it was combined with all the other behavior change techniques that have thus far been tested when compared to a control group that also included that technique. A relatively large number of studies were included for several behavior change techniques (i.e., behavioral practice / rehearsal, feedback, instruction on how to perform the behavior, self-monitoring of behavior or outcome, and demonstration of the behavior) suggesting that these do not augment the effectiveness of goal setting when compared to a comparison group that just used these behavior change techniques without goal setting.\n\nFifty six out of the 93 techniques in the BCTTv1 have not yet been combined with goal setting. Other behavior change techniques that are successful in changing behavior, such as providing a reward if progress towards the goal is made (BCTTv1 numbers 10.1 to 10.10), may further augment the effect of goal setting  (Shilts et al., 2013) ."

There is also evidence that goal setting interventions should be set face to face rather than online or computerized; however, the number of studies that did not set goals face to face was modest. These results seem to suggest that an actual or inferred social presence maximizes the effect of goal setting.\n\nThe studies included in the present review show clear evidence that there are no differences dependent upon if the goals were set by someone else, self set or participatively set goals. This is in contrast to: (a) predictions made by theories such as self determination theory that suggests the autonomy from self set goals should increase motivation and thus improve behavior change  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) , and (b) recommendations that collaborative goals should be used in clinical settings  (Matre et al., 2013; Shilts et al., 2013) . The results of the present review may be attributable to the participants making goals of insufficient quality when self-setting or collaboratively setting goals in the studies included in this review; furthermore the goal interventions may have not allowed the time necessary for forming effective collaboratively set goals (e.g., guided goal setting;  Shilts et al., 2013) . It is notable that instruction in goal setting (only 10 studies provided training in goal setting).\n\nGoal setting is also more effective if set in a school or workplace (rather than a university). Coupled with the moderating effect of sample type (i.e., that goal setting is more effective for school children and the general population and less effective in university students), the findings suggest that there may be differences between studies set in universities with students and other studies.\n\nThis could be due to the type of behavior targeted as there were substantially fewer studies targeting health and education (that had strong effects) that used university students.\n\nCorrespondence between goal and dependent variable. The level of correspondence between the goal and the dependent variable was a significant moderator. Goals that were directly related to the dependent variable had a significantly larger effect size than those that were more indirectly related. This finding is consistent with  Ajzen and Fishbein's (1977)  principle of correspondence, which is normally associated with attitude-behavior relations but clearly applies equally to relations between goal setting and behavior change.\n\nType of behavior. Goal setting was shown to be effective for a range of behaviors; in particular health, sport, production tasks, education and cognitive tasks. Goal setting has been used rarely for other tasks such as social and environmental issues so conclusions cannot be drawn about the effectiveness of goal setting for these behaviors. Nevertheless, the broad applicability of goal setting implies that it may constitute a key building block of successful behavior change interventions."

      "text": "The review highlights numerous important areas for further research into goal setting that have hitherto received relatively little attention. We would like to draw particular attention to six areas that we believe would benefit from further research. First, it is notable that observations of the unique effects of goal setting on behavior have been restricted to the short-medium term: No studies eligible for inclusion in the present review have yet established whether the effects of goal setting are sustained beyond 12 months post-intervention.\n\nSecond, the unique effects of goal setting have not yet been fully tested in several important behavioral domains (e.g., environmental behavior), among key target populations (e.g., low socioeconomic status) and in key contexts (e.g., primary care). Third, the behaviour change technique taxonomy  (Michie et al., 2013)  and the broader goal setting literature (e.g.,  Kim, 1984)  describe a potentially important distinction between setting goals to achieve outcomes (e.g., weight loss) versus setting goals to achieve behaviors (e.g., increased physical activity), yet there is little experimental research that explores this distinction. Fourth, it is not clear how people should be encouraged to set goals, for example, whether it is sufficient for people to be given a goal or whether they should be trained to set goals and what roles new technologies have to play in helping people to set goals. Fifth, 56 out of the 93 behavior change techniques identified to date  (Michie et al., 2013)  have not yet been paired with goal setting and it is plausible that lack of power might account for at least some of the null effects reported in the present meta-analysis. Sixth, mediators of goal setting have been proposed by goal setting theories (e.g.,  Locke & Latham, 2002) , however, very few studies report the relationship between the mechanisms of action and changes in behavior."

      "text": "The present meta analysis provides an examination of the unique effects of goal setting on behavior change across a variety of domains, populations and contexts. Goal setting was shown to exert small but robust effects on behavior change. Moreover, the analyses support the two central tenets of goal setting theory  (Locke & Latham, 2002; Locke & Latham, 2006) , namely, that setting specific and difficult goals are effective at increasing behavior change. However, there was no evidence to support the hypotheses that that task complexity, feedback and commitment boost the effects of goal setting. Instead, the present findings show that for the studies included in this review goal setting is optimally effective when: (a)it is set face-to-face, (b) it is set publicly, (c) it is a group goal, and (d) it is coupled with monitoring of the behavior or outcome by another person without feedback.

Study quality. Study quality did not moderate the effect of goal setting on behavior; there were no moderating effects of randomization rating (k = 384), blind rating (k = 384), attrition rating (k = 384), actual attrition (k = 288), whether or not the study was peer reviewed (k = 384 of which k = 346 were peer reviewed), or date of study (k = 384). Type of behavior. The largest effect sizes were for environmental goals (e.g., increasing recycling; k = 2, d = .57, CI = .07 to 1.07), health (k = 21, d = .44, CI = .31 to .56), sporting goals (k = 83, d = .41, CI = .33 to .49), production goals (e.g., building Lego models; k = 25, d = .36, CI = .19 to .52), education goals (k = 21, d = .30, CI = .16 to .44), and cognitive goals (k = 188, d = .28, CI = .23 to .32). Other significant effects were found for keeping appointments (k = 2, d = .26, CI = .03 to .49; see Table"
