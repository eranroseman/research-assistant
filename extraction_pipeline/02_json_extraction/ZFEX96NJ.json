  "abstract": "Purpose: To examine the effect of an opt-out default recruitment strategy compared to a conventional opt-in strategy on enrollment and adherence to a behavioral intervention for poorly controlled diabetic patients. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: University of Pennsylvania primary care practices. Participants: Participants of this trial included those with (1) age 18 to 80 years; (2) diabetes diagnosis; and (3) a measured hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) greater than 8% in the past 12 months. Intervention: We randomized eligible patients into opt-in and opt-out arms prior to enrollment. Those in the opt-out arm received a letter stating that they were enrolled into a diabetes research study with the option to opt out, and those in the opt-in arm received a standard recruitment letter. Measures: Main end points include enrollment rate, defined as the proportion of participants who attended the baseline visit, and adherence to daily glycemic monitoring. Analysis: We powered our study to detect a 20% difference in adherence to device usage between arms and account for a 10% attrition rate. Results: Of the 569 eligible participants who received a recruitment letter, 496 were randomized to the opt-in arm and 73 to the opt-out arm. Enrollment rates were 38% in the opt-out arm and 13% in the opt-in arm (P < .001). Conclusions: Opt-out defaults, where clinically appropriate, could be a useful approach for increasing the generalizability of lowrisk trials testing behavioral interventions in clinical settings.",

      "title": "Purpose",
      "text": "In clinical practice, physicians generally make recommendations for care and patients can decide whether to agree, thereby effectively opting out should they disagree with the provider's recommendation. In contrast, in typical research settings patients must first agree to participate, thereby effectively requiring them to opt in. This is a fundamental challenge to the external validity of trials since the opt-in approach often recruits only 5% to 15% of the target population, reducing representativeness, and thereby the ability of the trial to reflect how well participants might do in practice if they receive a given intervention.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Such concerns may be particularly important for behavioral interventions in which personal motivation can be a key determinant of both participation and outcomes. If the enrollment process selects for more motivated individuals, the results of the trial may not reflect the outcomes in the larger subset of individuals who might have been unwilling to enroll in the trial in the first place. A less burdensome process for trial enrollment would enhance both participation and representativeness and increase the applicability of findings to routine practice.\n\nDefault opt-out options make certain choices more likely without restricting choice, with successful application in areas like retirement savings allocations and organ donation.  [4] [5] ] [6] [7]  Default opt-out scheduling of flu shot appointments compared to opt-in scheduling yielded higher vaccination rates among employees.  8 Opt-out defaults used in health-care settings  9  range from facilitating advance care directives among terminally ill patients  10  and increasing human immunodeficiency virus testing in emergency rooms  11  to improving provider electronic ordering of generic prescriptions.  12 odifying the default setting for enrollment in trials from opt in to opt out has increased enrollment rates in several studies involving onetime permissions to use data.  13, 14 We are unaware of prior evaluations of opt-out strategies for enrollment into trials that require ongoing active participation by enrollees. While opt-out defaults may increase enrollment, less motivated individuals on average may enroll, resulting in lower overall participant engagement and follow-up. To examine these potential trade-offs and the implications for clinical trials of behavioral interventions designed to improve health outcomes, we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing opt-in versus opt-out default recruitment methods on enrollment rates and ongoing participation in a diabetes selfmanagement intervention among poorly controlled diabetics."

      "text": "Given the objective of comparing opt-in and opt-out enrollment rates, we randomized potential participants into 2 experimental arms (groups) prior to providing consent. The institutional review board at the University of Pennsylvania approved this study protocol (clinical trial number: NCT01977495).\n\nRandomization procedures. The first 100 eligible patients were randomized into opt-in and opt-out arms using a 5:1 randomization ratio based on preliminary estimates of enrollment for a conventional opt-in recruitment method in a similar study population. Lower than expected recruitment rates in the opt-in arm for the first 100 patients informed our adjustment of the randomization ratio to 9:1 for the remaining 469 patients. Given the nature of enrollment for this intervention, we could not blind the entire study team to the randomization assignment; however, the analysts and investigators remained blinded until the analytic plan was finalized.\n\nRecruitment process. After receiving the randomization assignment, the study team sent 1 of 2 recruitment letters to the eligible patients. Potential participants assigned to the opt-in arm received a letter inviting them to contact the study team if interested in enrolling in the study. The opt-out arm assignees received a letter stating that they were enrolled into a diabetes research program being conducted at their practice and would be contacted within 10 days to set up an initial enrollment visit unless they opted out.\n\nWhile the letter sent to potential opt-out participants stated that they were conditionally enrolled, it also clearly stated that this was a research study, provided details about the study, and also the option of declining participation prior to formal enrollment or at any time thereafter. We considered patients who attended the first baseline visit formally enrolled, or participants, as depicted in the consort diagram (Figure  1 )."

      "text": "We asked participants in both experimental arms to attend 3 study visits (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) at their routine primary care clinical site. At these visits, we assessed blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, and self-reported activation level and medication adherence. We provided a US$50 incentive to attend each of the 3 study visits.\n\nAll participants who attended the baseline enrollment visit received wireless glucometers and blood pressure monitors. The study team instructed participants in both arms to monitor their glucose and blood pressure daily and transmit the readings to the team for the duration of the study. We utilized the Way to Health platform at the University of Pennsylvania, a customizable web-based platform developed to automate recruitment, consent, randomization, incentive provision, and data collection for clinical trials.  15 o enhance intervention effectiveness in improving glycemic control, the first 3 months of the trial included a daily lottery incentive for all enrolled participants, with an expected value of US$1.40 per day.  16 At the enrollment visit, we asked each participant to select any 2-digit lottery number for the duration of the study. Each day the Way to Health platform generated a random 2-digit number. The lottery provided infrequent large payoffs (a 1 in 100 chance of a US$50 reward if both digits were drawn) and more frequent small payoffs (an 18 in 100 chance of a US$5 reward if any 1 of the 2 digits matched). Participants were eligible to win the lottery only if they had utilized their study glucometer at least once the day prior. Participants who used their glucometer the day prior and drew the winning lottery number/s received a congratulatory message from the study Web site, emphasizing their successful device usage and stating the amount they won. Nonadherent participants who drew the winning lottery number/s received an automated text or e-mail message informing them what earnings they would have won had they used their glucometer the day prior. For the second 3 months of the study, we terminated the lottery but continued to monitor patients' adherence to glucose and blood pressure selfmonitoring.\n\nTwo nurse practitioners per practice site received notifications if participants' glucose or blood pressure were either extremely low or high (<60 or >400 mg/dL for glucose; <90/ 60 or >180/100 for blood pressure) or when there was a 3-day lapse in participant glucose self-monitoring activity. Participants with these readings also received messages to contact their health-care provider immediately."

      "text": "The primary end point was baseline enrollment rate. We defined enrollment rate as the proportion of eligible participants who attended the baseline visit and at that time provided written consent to participate in the study.\n\nTo determine ongoing participation after enrollment, we examined adherence rates to intervention activities at 3 and 6 months. We defined adherence rates as glucometer usage for all participants and blood pressure monitoring for those with a diagnosis of hypertension. We calculated glucose and blood pressure wireless device use as a weekly adherence rate reflecting the proportion of days participants used the device at least once as well as an overall adherence rate for the first 3 months and second 3 months of the study period. In this intent-to-treat  1  Two patients were found ineligible immediately at their baseline visit, with an HbA1c <8. These patients did not receive the intervention.  2 At 3 months, 97% of opt-ins (n=59) completed lab and 75% of opt-outs (n=21) completed lab  3   design, all participants attending a baseline visit to receive their devices were thereafter included in the analyses for the secondary end point, regardless of any loss to follow up or withdrawal from study.\n\nAdditional secondary end points included attendance at 3and 6-month visits. In exploratory analyses, we assessed changes in HbA1c between baseline and 3 months and between 3 and 6 months. Finally, we examined the change in patient activation and medication adherence using survey instruments that have been used reliably and with a high degree of validity in many previous applications,  17, 18  by determining the difference in patient survey scores at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months."

      "text": "We compared baseline characteristics between those randomized into opt-in and opt-out arms using Pearson w 2 tests. We used Pearson or Fisher's exact tests to assess differences in enrollment and attrition rates between arms. Within each arm, we estimated odds ratios of enrollment with respect to demographic factors; we then compared the odds of enrollment among those randomized across arms using a test for homogeneity of odds ratios. For analysis of change in adherence levels over time in the 2 arms, we fit a piecewise linear repeated measurements model for mean weekly adherence rate using generalized estimating equations with robust standard error estimates.  19 We included enrollment method and time as the only covariates in the model, to reflect an unadjusted intention-to-treat comparison of adherence. To test equality of the distributions of mean adherence rates between groups in the first 3 months as well as in the last 3 months of the study, we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We used paired t tests to determine any statistically significant differences in HbA1c from baseline to 3 and 6 months in both arms. We compared changes in self-reported patient activation and medication adherence between 2 arms for the same study period using Pearson w 2 or Fisher's exact tests. All reported P values are 2 sided and not adjusted for multiple comparisons. To capture differences in ongoing participation, we powered our study to detect a 20% difference in adherence to device usage between arms and account for a 10% attrition rate. For all statistical analyses, we used R version 3.1.3 statistical software.  20"

      "text": "Of the 569 eligible participants who received a recruitment letter, 73 were randomized into the opt-out arm and 496 into the opt-in arm. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between those randomized into either arm (Table  1 ), or between those who attended the first baseline visit in each arm, except for number of current household residents (P \u00bc .03; Table  2 ). The enrollment rate in  the opt-out arm (38.3%) was significantly greater than that in the opt-in arm (12.7%; rate difference \u00bc 25.6%; 95% CI \u00bc 14.9-37.5; P < .001). The odds of enrollment by baseline characteristics did not differ between arms (Table  3 ). Median glucometer adherence rates from baseline to 3 months were 66.5% in the opt-out arm compared to 91.2% in the opt-in arm (median of the difference in adherences: 13.2%; 95% CI \u00bc 3.2-34.0; P \u00bc .006). From months 4 to 6, the median glucometer adherence rates were 42.8% in the opt-out arm versus 62.6% in the opt-in arm (median of the difference in adherences: 16.5%; 95% CI \u00bc 1.1-37.4; P \u00bc .02; Table  3 ). Adherence in both arms declined steadily over the incentive period, as depicted by the decline in average weekly rate (closely approximated by the linear model), with a statistically significant higher rate of decline in the opt-out arm as compared to the opt-in arm (opt out vs opt in: \u00c00.03 vs \u00c00.01; P \u00bc 0.02). In the postincentive period, the average weekly rate of decline in the opt-out arm plateaued, whereas the rate of decline in the opt-in arm increased, with a significant difference between arms (opt out vs opt in: \u00c00.008 vs \u00c00.02; P \u00bc .02; Figure  2 ). Adherence to blood pressure monitoring among hypertensive patients in both arms showed similar patterns (Figure  3 ).\n\nParticipants in both arms experienced a decrease in mean HbA1c, falling from 9.6 to 8.9 (mean difference \u00bc \u00c00.7; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c01.6 to 0.2; P \u00bc .13) in the opt-out arm and 9.5 to 8.9 in the opt-in arm (mean difference \u00bc \u00c00.6; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c00.97 to \u00c00.2; P \u00bc .003) at 3 months. The degree of change in HbA1c Two patients with HbA1c < 8 were found ineligible and excluded immediately at their baseline visit.\n\nb Among participants with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension.\n\nfrom baseline to 3 months between the arms was not significantly different between the 2 arms (mean difference: \u00c00.1, 95% CI \u00bc \u00c00.87 to 1.09; P \u00bc .8). Between enrollment and 6 months, participants in both arms experienced decreases in mean HbA1c, falling from 9.6 to 8.5 (mean difference \u00bc \u00c01.1; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c02.7 to 0.4; P \u00bc .14) in the opt-out arm and 9.5 to 8.8 in the opt-in arm (mean difference \u00bc \u00c00.7;\n\n95% CI \u00bc \u00c01.1 to \u00c00.3; P \u00bc .001). Change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months between arms was not statistically significant (mean difference: 0.5; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c00.7 to 2.1; P \u00bc .6; Table  3 ). Participants with hypertension (who had measures at baseline and at 3 months) experienced decreases in mean systolic blood pressure in both arms, falling from 146 to 139.8 in the  opt-out arm (mean difference \u00bc \u00c06.2; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c019.8 to 7.45; P \u00bc .35) and 131.7 to 129.2 at 3 months for the opt-in arm (mean difference \u00bc \u00c02.5; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c09.16 to 4.21; P \u00bc .46). The difference in reductions was not significantly different between arms (mean difference: \u00c03.7; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c011.2 to 18.6; P \u00bc .6). Participants with hypertension (with measures at baseline and at 6 months) experienced decreases in mean systolic blood pressure in both arms, falling from 146 to 138.5 in the opt-out arm (mean difference \u00bc \u00c07.6; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c020.7 to 5.4; P \u00bc .2) and 130 to 125.1 at 6 months for the opt-in arm (mean difference \u00bc \u00c04.81; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c011.7 to 2.0; P \u00bc .2). The difference in reductions was not significantly different between arms (mean difference: 4.2; 95% CI \u00bc \u00c07.0 to 15.4; P \u00bc .5; Table  3 ).\n\nThere were no significant differences in measured patient activation and patient-reported medication adherence at baseline between arms (Table  2 ). In the incentivized period, between baseline and 3 months, there was a significant difference in changes in average reported patient activation between arms, with average greater increases in reported activation among opt-in enrollees. During the nonincentivized period, we found no significant difference between arms, in patient activation changes. We found no significant differences in changes in participant medication adherence between arms in either study period. Overall attrition rates were higher in the opt-out compared to opt-in participants during the incentive period; however, among those participants who attended their 3-month visit, there were no significant differences in attrition rates between arms at 6 months (Table  3 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study is the first to examine the impact of enrolling participants in a longitudinal intervention using an opt-out default over the traditional opt-in process. This study has 3 main findings.\n\nFirst, enrollment rates were almost 3-fold higher among patients recruited using an opt-out default compared to a traditional opt-in method. Opt-out approaches reflect the deployment of interventions outside of research settings better than opt-in approaches, because the latter create additional barriers to participation that do not exist in real clinical practice. These considerations support new thinking about allowing randomization prior to consent for minimal risk studies conducted in operational settings like clinics.  21 econd, we found higher attrition rates among participants recruited using the opt-out approach during the first half of the study. This finding is consistent with the view that enrollment using opt-out approaches on average requires less activation energy and so, on average, these participants may have less motivation to continue. This interpretation supports the concern that opt-in recruitment strategies select for more motivated patients who may not represent target populations. For the second half of the study, among participants who attended their 3-month visit, there were no differences between arms in attrition rates. Third, we found significantly worsened adherence in the opt-out arm compared to the opt-in arm during the incentive period of the study, despite similar baseline measures of patient activation between arms. However, in the nonincentive period of the study, the decline in weekly adherence rates in the optout arm plateaued, whereas the decline in weekly adherence in the opt-in arm increased slightly, with a significant difference between arms. This finding suggests that opt-in compared to default opt-out enrollees may be more sensitive to the removal of the incentive.\n\nOur results extend the findings from prior work demonstrating opt-out recruitment into studies that did not warrant ongoing participation beyond enrollment. In an Australian randomized controlled trial, 1129 families of newborn children were given 4 weeks to consent, via opt in or opt out, to linking their child's vaccine and hospital records for safety surveillance. The opt-out arm participation rates were approximately 4 times that of the opt-in arm (95.6% vs 21.3%; P < .001) and the opt-out arm was a more representative sample.  13 In a UK trial conducted at 2 general practices, 510 patients were randomized into an opt-in or opt-out arm, to assess enrollment rates into an observational study, with approximately 49.6% in the opt-out arm compared to 38.1% in the opt-in arm (P \u00bc .01).  14"

This approach may be useful in minimal risk trials testing the effectiveness of interventions that require significant participant motivation and ongoing engagement."
