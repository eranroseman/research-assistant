  "title": "Application of substitution box of present cipher for automated detection of snoring sounds",
  "abstract": "Background and purpose: Snoring is one of the sleep disorders, and snoring sounds have been used to diagnose many sleep-related diseases. However, the snoring sound classification is done manually which is timeconsuming and prone to human errors. An automated snoring sound classification model is proposed to overcome these problems. Material and method: This work proposes an automated snoring sound classification method using three new methods. These methods are maximum absolute pooling (MAP), the nonlinear present pattern, and two-layered neighborhood component analysis, and iterative neighborhood component analysis (NCAINCA) selector. Using these methods, a new snoring sound classification (SSC) model is presented. The MAP decomposition model is applied to snoring sounds to extract both low and high-level features. The presented model aims to attain high performance for SSC problem. The developed present pattern (Present-Pat) uses substitution box (SBox) and statistical feature generator. By deploying these feature generators, both textural and statistical features are generated. NCAINCA chooses the most informative/valuable features, and these selected features are fed to knearest neighbor (kNN) classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The Present-Pat based SSC system is developed using Munich-Passau Snore Sound Corpus (MPSSC) dataset comprising of four categories. Results: Our model reached an accuracy and unweighted average recall (UAR) of 97.10 % and 97.60 %, respectively, using LOOCV. Moreover, a nocturnal sound dataset is used to show the universal success of the presented model. Our model attained an accuracy of 98.14 % using the used nocturnal sound dataset. Conclusions: Our developed classification model is ready to be tested with more data and can be used by sleep specialists to diagnose the sleep disorders based on snoring sounds.",

      "text": "Snoring is a sleep disorder affecting 45 % of people worldwide  [1]  and the studies show that 45 % of people have snoring problems  [2, 3] . This problem is more common in men and the elderly  [4] . Sleep problems cause many ailments such as daytime fatigue, drowsiness, sleepiness, social activity disorders, problems between spouses, problems in the family, problems in business life, and health problems  [1] . A few studies have shown a positive association between high snoring and risk of stroke or even death  [2, 3] . It is important for people to have good quality sleep without snoring problems.\n\nSnoring is the problem with airflow in the airways during sleep. Soft-tissue structures in the upper airways (UA) are stimulated by inspiratory airflow and vibrate. Thus, the person cannot perform healthy breathing during sleep and hence snores. This problem may trigger different diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), brain and heart disease  [2] . The source of the problem must be diagnosed to treat the snoring. Different methods are used to diagnose snoring, such as detailed clinical history and examination, polysomnography (PSG)  [3] , drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE)  [4] , camera  [5] , and voice recording  [6] . The purpose of all methods is to diagnose the reason for snoring and suggest appropriate treatment  [7, 8] .\n\nThe PSG is a reliable diagnostic method used to diagnose the type and severity of sleep-related breathing disorder  [9] . However, it has limited use in identifying the underlying mechanisms. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a method developed to determine obstruction in the palate or tongue area during sleep and problems in the airway structures  [4] . During DISE, the patient is examined intranasal using a nasopharyngoscope (an endoscope for visually examining the nasal passages and pharynx) while the patient is unconscious during sleep  [4] . During the test, video, audio recordings, and documentation are made, and then the expert evaluation is made. However, it is not possible to do it at home or during natural sleep because the patient takes medication, the process takes a long time, and the endoscope is attached to the patient. Sound-based snoring diagnosis studies have become popular in recent years because of their easier and more convenient application  [2, 10, 11] . Many studies have shown that the snoring sound occurs during the air passage through the respiratory system and has different acoustic properties in different locations  [6] . Therefore, it is possible to classify snoring sounds by using characteristic acoustic properties. The sounds collected during sleep can be detected using artificial intelligence-based computer-aided diagnostic systems. There are many sound-based studies done using artificial intelligence in the literature. Several automated snoring sound detection methods have been presented  [6, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Studies generally focused on distinguishing snoring from OSA or snoring / not snoring  [2, [16] [17] [18] . There are also many sound-based studies linking sleep sounds to sleep stages  [19, 20] . Also, fewer studies are presented to determine the location of sound in the respiratory system  [21] . In their study, an automated system is proposed to classify the snoring sound's location in the respiratory system using the Munich-Passau Snore Sound Corpus (MPSSC) dataset.\n\nNowadays, many studies have been conducted on vibration source classification using snoring sound. Some of them are discussed below. Albornoz et al.  [22]  proposed a model using spectral properties of a sound signal, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)  [23] , and support vector machine (SVM)  [24, 25] . Their model has shown an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 49.38 %. Amiriparian et al.  [10]  showed a method using the convolutional neural network (CNN)  [26]  and Alexnet  [26]  to classify the snoring sounds. They have reported the performance of 67.0 % using CNN and Alexnet with deep spectrum features. Demir et al.  [27]  presented an image processing-based SSC model. They extract spectrogram images of the snoring sound and used a local binary pattern (LBP)  [28]  and a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)  [29]  extractors-based classification model. MPSSC dataset was used for testing, and they reached a UAR of 72.60 %. Tuncer et al.  [6]  proposed a method using iterative hybrid feature selector and local dual octal pattern (LDOP). They presented a multileveled feature generation model using LDOP local extractor, and a two-layered feature selector picked the most valuable features. They attained UAR of 94.65 % and accuracy of 95.53 % using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)  [30]  training and testing strategy. Vesperini et al.  [31]  used a scattering spectrum transformation with a deep neural network, using MPSSC dataset and reported UAR of 74.19 %. Wang et al.  [32]  presented a model to detect obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by analyzing acoustic snoring sounds. They obtained 91.14 % recognition rate using SVM classifier. Lim et al.  [13]  showed that snoring sounds can be classified using recurrent neural network (RNN)  [33] . For this purpose, a dataset is created consisting of different environmental sounds and snoring sounds. Their method is able to detect the snoring sound with an accuracy of 98.9 %. Cavusoglu et al.  [2]  proposed a method to determine the relationship between sleep sounds and snoring. They have shown that collected sounds during the polysomnography test are classified with an accuracy of 97.3 % using spectral features and robust linear regression classifier."

It was collected from 3 health centers: Munich Technical University, Alfried Krupp Hospital Essen, and University Hospital Halle.\n\nA total of 2174 raw records collected from 3 centers were used to create this dataset. Records were taken from 38 subjects from Munich Technical University from 2013 to 2014, 2090 subjects from Alfried Krupp Hospital Essen between 2006 and 2015, 46 subjects from University Hospital Halle from 2012 to 2015. 331 suitable snoring subjects were selected from raw DISE records  [39] . Subsequently, 219 subjects suitable for VOTE classification were selected manually by the experts. The sound samples are labeled in four classes: V, O, T, and E  [40] . The 'V' is the vibration level in the velum, 'O' is the oropharyngeal vibration level in the tonsils, 'T' indicates the vibration of the tongue base and the posterior pharyngeal wall, and 'E' denotes the vibration of the epiglottis represents. Finally, the dataset containing sound samples of 828 snoring events from 219 subjects is created. There are a total of 828 sound samples (484 V, 216 O, 39 T and 89 E) of 16 bits and sampled at 16 kHz frequency. The average sample time is 1.46 s (range 0.73\u2026 2.75 s).

      "title": "The presented SSC model",
      "text": "Detection of various sleep orders using snoring sounds is complex and time-consuming. Hence, automated systems have been proposed for this work. We have used the MPSSC dataset containing 828 snoring sounds with four categories to develop the automated model. Most of the prior methods have used the conventional feature generation methods and used widely known sound descriptors. In this work, we have presented an automated SSC method using nonlinear feature generation functions to obtain the highest classification performance. Our proposed method consists of three phases: multiple kernelled Present-Pat (the prime feature generation function), MAP decomposer, and NCAINCA selector. The proposed multiple kernelled Present-Pat generates nonlinear features using both signum and ternary binary feature extraction functions. It efficiently extracts the hidden nonlinear features from the sound signals. The multileveled extraction method can obtain both low-level and high-level features with more detailed hidden changes. The maximum pooling (MAP) method routes only peak values and minimum pooling routes only minimum values. The main idea behind the MAP is to obtain an efficient and simple decomposition/ routing function. The neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is presented to select clinically significant features. The main problem in NCA is its inability to choose the optimal feature vector automatically. Hence, iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA)  [41]  is used to overcome this problem. However, the computational complexity of INCA is high. Hence the proposed new selector (NCAINCA) overcomes this problem. Hence, we have developed our SSC model using these three functions coupled with a kNN classifier  [42] . The general flow diagram of our proposed automated SSC model is shown in Fig.  1 .\n\nThe presented SSC model has three main sections: multileveled nonlinear multiple kernel feature extraction, NCAINCA based feature selection, and classification. The details of these sections are given in the following sections."

This function aims to generate nonlinear features by using nonlinear pattern (SBox of the Present cipher) and two binary features extraction functions. The used kernels (binary feature generation functions) are signum and ternary. 16 sized overlapping blocks (windows) are used to generate local features as the used SBox of the present cipher is a 4-bits SBox and its length is 2 4 = 16. Steps of the recommended Present-Pat are;\n\nStep 1: Divide sound signal into 16 sized overlapping blocks. Herein, L -15 overlapping blocks are created using the signal of length = L.\n\nStep 2: Use SBox of the lightweight present cipher for constructing nonlinear pattern. The used SBox is given in Table  1  and it shows indices of the generated pattern.\n\nThis SBox (see Table  1 ) is used as the pattern of proposed feature generation function. Therefore, this function is named present pattern (Table  2 ).\n\nStep 3: Generate 48 bits using signum and ternary functions\n\n) bit(t + 16) = { 0, blck(S(t) )blck(t) \u2265thr 1, blck(S(t) )blck(t) <thr (2) bit(t + 32) = { 0, blck(S(t) )blck(t) \u2264 thr 1, blck(S(t) )blck(t) > thr (3)\n\nwhere blck represents an overlapping block with a size of 16 and thr is a threshold value. We selected the threshold value as half of the standard deviation of the snore sound (SS). As seen from Eqs. (  1 ) to (4), the binary feature generation process is defined mathematically. Eq. (  1 ) shows the signum function, and first 16 bits are generated to deploy the signum function. The Eqs. (  2 ) and (  3 ) indicate the ternary function. Eq. (  2 ) shows the lower bit generation using the ternary function, and Eq. (  3 ) denotes the upper bit generation.\n\nStep 4: Create six map values by calculating the generated 48 bits. We have used binary to decimal conversion in this step.\n\nAs stated in Eq. (  5 ), the generated 48 bits are divided into six groups with 8-bits length as local binary pattern use 8-bits for coding. By employing Eq. (  5 ), six map signals are calculated for feature generation.\n\nStep 5: Compute histograms from the generated map signals (six map signals). The developed Present-Pat is a histogram-based feature generator, and hence histograms are generated in this step.\n\nwhere histo k defines k th histogram value.\n\nStep 6: Merge the generated six histograms and obtain the feature vector."

Our developed model has yielded an accuracy of 97.1 % and UAR of 97.6 % using kNN classifier with LOOCV strategy. This SSC model performed better than the state-of-the-art techniques and can be used in medical centers to diagnose sleep-related diseases accurately by detecting the type of snoring sound (see Fig.  8 ).\n\nWe have obtained the highest detection performance using MPSSC and nocturnal datasets. In future, we intend to explore the possibility of using our developed model to detect various arrhythmias and neurological disorders using electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, respectively. Also, our developed system can be tested with big SSC and nocturnal datasets to classify sleep sound automatically. Our developed SSC model can be used in sleep centers to assist the sleep specialists in making accurate diagnosis."

They used a spectrogram image of sound signals and a pre-trained deep feature generator. A metaheuristic optimization-based feature selector is utilized to select the features and these selected features are classified using SVM classifier. Their model used deep learning and metaheuristic optimization-based feature selectors, which is computationally expensive (high computational complexity). Our presented model reached higher performance than Freitag et al. [54]  model with lower time burden. Furthermore, Vesperini et al.'s [31]  used a deep model to classify these snoring sound signals and obtained an accuracy of 74.19 %. But our model has yielded the highest accuracy of 97.58 % and lower computational complexity."
