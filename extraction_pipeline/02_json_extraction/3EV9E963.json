  "title": "Randomised control trial SMS communication improves exclusive breastfeeding and early postpartum contraception in a low to middle income country setting: A randomised trial",
  "abstract": "Objective To assess the effect of short message service (SMS) communication on facility delivery, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and contraceptive use. \n Design Mobile WACh was a 3-arm unblinded individually randomised controlled trial Setting A public sector maternal child health (MCH) clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. Population Three hundred women attending antenatal care were randomised, 100 to each arm, and followed for 24 weeks postpartum. Pregnant women 14 years old with access to a phone and able to read SMS were eligible for participation. Methods Women were randomised (1:1:1) to receive 1-way SMS versus 2-way SMS with a nurse versus control. Weekly SMS content was tailored for maternal characteristics and pregnancy or postpartum timing. Main Outcome Measures Facility delivery, EBF and contraceptive use were compared separately between each intervention arm and the control arm by Kaplan-Meier analysis and \u03a7 2 tests using intent-to-treat analyses. \n Results The overall facility delivery rate was high (98%) and did not differ by arm. Compared to controls, probability of EBF was higher in 1-way SMS arm at 10 and 16 weeks, and in 2-way SMS arm at 10, 16, and 24 weeks (p<0\u2022005 for all). Contraceptive use was significantly higher in both intervention arms by 16 weeks [1-way SMS: 72% and 2-way SMS: 73%; p=0\u202203 and 0\u202202 versus 57% control, respectively] however this difference was not significant when correcting for multiple comparisons. \n Conclusion One-way and 2-way SMS improved EBF practices and early contraceptive use. Two-way SMS had an added benefit on sustained EBF, providing evidence that SMS messaging influences uptake of interventions that improve maternal and neonatal health.",

      "text": "Despite progress in improving maternal and infant health indicators, an unacceptable number of women and newborns continue to die from preventable complications and many countries face challenges in achieving the maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH)-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators. (1) (2) (3)  For infants, the peripartum period is particularly high risk, with over 40% of child deaths occurring in the neonatal period, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa.(3) Skilled delivery services, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and contraception have potential to decrease maternal and infant mortality rates; yet, uptake of these interventions is suboptimal in many low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)  Counselling and decision support during pregnancy and postpartum may increase uptake of effective practices. (9)  Given high clinic volume and health care worker (HCW) shortages, counselling time may be limited and health concerns often occur between visits. Mobile health (mHealth) tools, those that utilize mobile phone and other wireless technologies to support health, provide an attractive strategy to augment clinic-based support. Short message service (SMS) messaging, also known as text messaging or texting, could provide guidance to women between clinic visits. There is evidence that mHealth can be used to educate, provide reminders for visits and medications, improve communication between HCWs and patients, and improve self-efficacy, all potentially leading to better outcomes.(10-13) SMS programs for MNCH have been implemented in South Africa, Bangladesh, India, Nigeria and the United States. (14, 15)  To date, program efficacy data are lacking. (16, 17)  There is some evidence that multistep mHealth interventions improve antenatal care (ANC) attendance and Author Manuscript 14710528, 2018, 12, Downloaded from  https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.15337 , Wiley Online Library on [16/07/2025].

(22)  One cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) observed a significant decrease in perinatal mortality with a combined unidirectional SMS and voucher intervention. (23)  Together, these studies suggest that mHealth may be a useful strategy to improve MNCH outcomes but more evidence is needed on their efficacy, mechanisms, and best implementation approach.\n\nMNCH SMS programs are predominantly unidirectional  (1-way) . With this design, it is difficult to understand the real-time influence of the messages. In contrast, bidirectional  (2-way)  communication between a woman and a HCW not only enhances patient-provider communication, but also enables communication when women or infants are experiencing health issues. To our knowledge, no study has directly compared the efficacy of unidirectional versus bidirectional SMS approaches on MNCH intervention uptake or outcomes.\n\nIn this 3-arm RCT, we compared the effect of 1-way SMS versus 2-way interactive SMS text messaging versus control on facility delivery, EBF, contraceptive use, and MNCH outcomes."

Women who agreed to participate underwent screening and at randomisation, a tabletbased questionnaire designed in Open Data Kit (ODK) was administered to assess sociodemographic and medical history, and experience with mobile phones.\n\nWomen in the control arm received routine clinic-based counselling and care. Women in the 1way and 2-way trial arms were registered into the Mobile WACh SMS delivery platform and indicated their preferences for message delivery including their name, language (English or Kiswahili), and day of the week and time for delivery.\n\nParticipants were classified into tracks (routine, adolescents, first time mothers, women with a previous caesarean section and those with multiple gestations) with messaging tailored to the specific track. Participants received routine messages unless they met criteria for another track.\n\nAdolescents were defined as 14-19 years of age. The automated system incorporated a personalized approach that provided gestational age-appropriate educational and counselling messaging. All messages included participant name, clinic and nurse name, an educational message and actionable advice targeting one of the main study outcomes. SMS topics included ANC, pregnancy complications, family planning, infant health, EBF, infant immunization and visit reminders. All messaging was free of charge to the participant using a reverse billed short code.

Delivery information was ascertained by self-report at the 2-week visit. EBF was defined as no introduction of complementary feeding (including water) at the time of clinic visit. Contraceptive use was defined as current self-reported use of a modern contraceptive method [oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), injectables, implants, intrauterine devices (IUDs), condoms, or tubal ligation (TL)]. Secondary outcomes included clinic attendance (retention), maternal mortality, infant mortality, and maternal report of any other serious maternal or infant illness. Secondary contraceptive outcomes included use of long-acting, reversible contraception (LARC) defined as IUDs, implants or TL. Prior to the initiation of the trial, primary outcomes also included number of subsequent ANC visits and PMTCT uptake.\n\nDue to systems errors data on ANC visits was not collected. Only 6 women in the study reported being HIV+ and testing kits were not available for the majority of the study period, therefore we modified the protocol and clinicaltrials.gov profile during follow-up.

Sample size estimates for facility delivery and contraception rates utilized Nairobi informal settlement data from 2003, which was the most recent at the time of study design  (24) . The risk of facility delivery in each intervention arm relative to the control arm was compared by \u03c7 2 test.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method was used to model the time to (1) contraceptive use and (2) introduction of complementary food and drink and estimate probabilities of contraceptive use and EBF at the pre-specified time points of 10, 16 and 24 weeks postpartum. Probabilities of these primary outcomes were compared by Wald test. As a secondary analysis, Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios comparing uptake of contraception and introduction of complementary foods between study arms throughout the follow-up period. Secondary outcomes were compared with the \u03c7 2 test. All analyses were intention to treat (ITT) and were completed in STATA (version 13). The Holm-Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons in the primary outcomes.\n\nFor each of the primary outcomes of facility delivery, EBF and contraception use, two sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the influence of missing data. For EBF and contraception use, the 22 participants who were missing follow-up visit data were assumed to have the outcome (cessation of EBF and uptake of contraception respectively) at either 1 week postpartum or at 25 weeks postpartum. Survival analysis and estimation of probabilities at 10, 16 and 24 weeks postpartum was conducted as described above. For facility delivery, the 23 participants who were missing delivery data were assumed to have delivered in a facility or not in a facility. Risk was compared by \u03c7 2 test as described above.\n\nFunding was provided by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science and the University of Washington Global Center for Integrated Health of Women Adolescents and Children (Global WACh).

Of these, 278 were included in the outcome analysis. Fourteen perinatal deaths, 3 withdrawals and 3 losses to follow-up occurred prior to the first follow up visit and these participants were not included in the primary outcome analysis. Retention in the study to the 24-week visit was 86 (87%), 82 (83%), 91 (91%) in the 1-way, 2-way, and control arms, respectively and did not differ significantly by arm (p=0.35 and p=0.09 comparing the control arm with one-way and two-way arms respectively). Overall, there were 16 (5%) stillbirths and neonatal deaths and 3 women withdrew from the study.\n\nMedian age was 23 years (IQR 21-26) and median gestational age at enrolment was 26 weeks (IQR 21-30). Table  1  presents baseline characteristics. Most (93%) women were married, 55% completed primary school, and 46% had a prior pregnancy. The majority, 246 (83%), owned their own phone, but only 102 (34%) reported using SMS regularly, and less than 10% had ever used the internet.\n\nFacility delivery was very high in all 3 arms; the SMS interventions had no effect on uptake.\n\nAmong 277 women providing delivery data, 273 (98.6%) reported delivering in a facility, with no difference between the 1-way and control arms [relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0\u202297-1\u202203;   S1 ).\n\nOf 278 women who attended postpartum visits, all reported EBF for some duration. Women in both intervention arms were significantly more likely to EBF at 10 weeks and 16 weeks than women in the control arm (Table  2 ). The probability of EBF to 24 weeks postpartum was higher in both intervention groups than in the control, but only statistically significant in the 2-way messaging group [0\u202249 in 1-way, 0\u202262 in 2-way, and 0\u202241 in control, (p=0\u202230 and 0\u2022005 for 1way and 2-way vs. control, respectively)] (Table  2 ). Median time to introduction of food or water was 2 weeks longer (26 weeks) in the 2-way messaging group compared to the control group (24 weeks) (Figure  2 ). Findings were similar in sensitivity analyses assigning extreme timing of introduction of complementary feeding to participants with missing follow-up data (Table  S2 ). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved (p=0\u202203 and 0\u202202 for 1-way and 2-way vs. control, respectively)], however this difference was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (Table  2 ). Contraceptive use remained higher in intervention arms at later time points but the difference was not statistically significant [0\u202283 in 1-way, 0\u202283 in 2-way and 0\u202277 in control at 24 weeks]. Median time to contraceptive initiation was shorter in intervention arms (1-way: 11 weeks, 2-way: 12 weeks) than the controls (13 weeks) but these differences were not significant (Figure  3 ). Findings were similar in sensitivity analyses assigning extreme timing of contraceptive uptake to participants with missing follow-up data (Table  S3 ). Contraceptive continuation was high among women starting contraception at 10 weeks; however, 44 (30%) of contraceptive users across all arms switched methods between 10 and 24 weeks.\n\nOverall, there were 16 stillbirths and neonatal deaths (5%); 14 occurred prior to the first postpartum follow-up visit. One miscarriage occurred before 20 weeks. There were fewer stillbirths and infant deaths in the 2-way group compared to the control group (3\u20221% versus 8%, p=0\u202221), however, this difference did not attain statistical significance (Table  S4 ). There was one maternal death and her infant was among the neonatal deaths. No serious adverse events occurred as a result of the intervention.\n\nThe Mobile WACh platform delivered over 3000 messages to participants in the intervention arms and received over 1100 messages, with 83% engagement among 2-way users. Infant health and breastfeeding comprised 20% of all SMS received. Specific breastfeeding concerns included milk production and introduction of complementary feeds. Sixteen percent all messages received were about contraception, including concerns about myths and side effects."

      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first individually randomised controlled trial assessing the influence of SMS on uptake of MNCH services and comparing 2-way SMS messaging to 1-way SMS.\n\nUnlike other studies, we did not include a package of interventions which allowed us to determine effects of SMS alone.\n\nOur study did have some limitations. Major temporal changes occurred during the study period likely effecting uptake of services across all three arms. Free maternity care was rolled out in early 2013 and resulted in 98% facility delivery in all RCT arms. Additionally, the study nurse encouraged uptake of MNCH services at study visits, which likely caused increased uptake in the control arm. Women in the study were not blinded to their assignment which may have led to performance bias. Additionally, outcomes were obtained by self-report which could have introduced bias for social desirability, but this likely occurred across all arms.\n\nThe study was not powered to find a difference in maternal or infant mortality. Larger studies will be necessary to demonstrate these effects. In addition, mHealth interventions that promote engagement in care are partially dependent on high quality health systems to deliver good outcomes. Increasing uptake of proven MNCH services and behaviours does not guarantee impact on health outcomes and demand creation may encourage women to use services that do not meet their needs."

      "text": "We found that both SMS intervention arms in our study demonstrated higher rates of EBF through 10 and 16 weeks, and women in the 2-way SMS arm were significantly more likely to adhere to recommendations to EBF through 24 weeks. Breastfeeding is a critical intervention for reducing under-5 mortality and provides benefits for both mother and infant. (7)  There are few studies of SMS interventions to improve EBF.(25) A quasi-experimental study of 1-way SMS in China found longer duration of EBF in mothers receiving weekly SMS about infant feeding, compared to controls. (22)  A cluster RCT of a multi-pronged intervention, including in-person meetings, text or voice messages and mini-dramas in Nigeria, also found higher rates of breastfeeding to 6 months in the intervention group. (26)  In contrast, an RCT of twice-monthly voice-based lactation counselling did not find differences between EBF among women receiving\n\nAuthor Manuscript 14710528, 2018, 12, Downloaded from  https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.15337 , Wiley Online Library on [16/07/2025].

All rights reserved the intervention. (27)  In our study, messages were delivered throughout the critical time period for establishing and sustaining EBF. There is evidence that multi-visit counselling sessions during both the antenatal and postpartum period may increase EBF. (28, 29)  Support tools that provide reassurance, information, and the opportunity to respond to questions may also increase EBF. (30)  Our findings suggest that SMS augmented in-clinic counselling to sustain EBF. Two-way SMS was used to support EBF when challenges occurred and to discuss ways to overcome cultural pressures which can influence sustained EBF. (31)  In our study, we found that both 1-way and 2-way SMS approaches increased early uptake of contraception by 16 weeks postpartum, though this was not statistically significant when correcting for multiple comparisons. Early initiation of postpartum contraception has benefits including prevention of very short birth spacing and pregnancy prevention prior to the resumption of menses.(32) There have been conflicting findings regarding the effect of mHealth programs on contraceptive use. One RCT in the United States found that daily 1-way SMS resulted in higher OCP continuation at 6 months.(33) Another RCT in Cambodia observed higher rates of contraceptive use among women using an interactive voice recording (IVR) system and optional counsellor phone call. (34)  In contrast, two SMS studies in Africa (m4RH in Kenya and 6001 system in Uganda) did not observe improved contraceptive uptake. (35, 36)  There are important differences between our trial and these studies, both in terms of the intervention and the target population. The m4RH intervention targeted general consumers who signed up for 2-way informational family planning SMS. While messages improved knowledge, contraceptive use did not increase, and response rates were low (13.5-51.8%). (35)  The 6001 system allowed phone users to text questions and responded with pre-prepared advice using an algorithm but found no increase in knowledge or change in attitudes. (36)  In contrast, our RCT involved women attending care in a public MCH clinic and we initiated contact through push messaging rather than relying on participants to seek advice. Our finding of high engagement from women and high uptake of early contraception suggests that our trial population may have more motivation for FP than women in the general population. Increased early contraceptive use in the intervention arms suggests that larger studies should explore the use of this personalized approach to FP counselling. Contrary to our hypothesis, 2-way SMS did not confer additional benefit for contraceptive use over 1-way. However, over 16% of all messages from 2-way participants were about contraception. Given high levels of contraception SMS engagement it is possible that 2-way\n\nAuthor Manuscript 14710528, 2018, 12, Downloaded from  https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.15337 , Wiley Online Library on [16/07/2025].

All rights reserved SMS may demonstrate additional benefits in clinic settings with lower rates of postpartum contraception than in our trial.\n\nSMS is low cost in comparison to voice calls and in-person visits, and the Mobile WACh platform allowed us to efficiently send and receive SMS. This type of efficiency has potentially major impacts on reducing human resource needs. One nurse responded to SMS from all women in the 2-way group while performing recruitment, follow-up and clinical duties. This messaging approach could potentially be integrated into routine clinical services but the 2-way SMS approach had added cost, both in terms of airtime and nurse effort. While it is difficult to ignore the enthusiasm of women in this trial for 2-way SMS for support, advice and triage of illness; further research on cost-effectiveness and potential for integration will be important to scale this type of intervention. Two-way communication may have averted unnecessary visits or expedited critical visits which could be cost-saving for both the family and health system.\n\nMobile WACh messages were crafted to be personalized, actionable and outcome focused. However, it is not clear how much message content effects behaviour change. Other studies have used a simpler approach with significant effects on behaviour and health outcomes. (11)"

      "text": "In conclusion, our SMS intervention resulted in longer EBF and early contraceptive use during the postpartum period. These findings suggest that incorporating SMS messaging into MNCH care has the potential to engage patients and support the use of essential services and ultimately improve the health of women and infants. This trial suggests that rigorous evaluations of larger mHealth trials are warranted to guide the future of mHealth within MNCH and that caution should be taken in scaling SMS programs without a vision for determining impact on health outcomes."
