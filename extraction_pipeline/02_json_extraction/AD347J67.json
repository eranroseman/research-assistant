  "abstract": "Objective: Psychosocial comorbidity and quality of life (QOL) and its association with knowledge, utilization, and need for psychosocial support have been studied in long-term breast cancer survivors. Methods: One thousand eighty-three patients were recruited through a population-based cancer registry an average of 47 months following diagnosis (66% response rate). Self-report measures (e.g., Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, and Short-Form Health Survey) were used. Results: Thirty-eight percent of patients had moderate to high anxiety, and 22% had moderate to high depression; posttraumatic stress disorder was observed in 12%. The overall psychological comorbidity was 43% and 26% for a possible and probable psychiatric disorder. Disease progress, detrimental interactions, less social support, a lower educational level, and younger age were predictors of psychological comorbidity (P b.004). Lower QOL (P b.01) and higher levels of anxiety (P b.001) were observed in cancer survivors compared to ageadjusted normative comparison groups. Time since diagnosis had no significant impact on psychological comorbidity as well as QOL. Forty-six percent of women felt insufficiently informed about support offers. Insufficient knowledge was associated with older age and lower education (P b.05). Since diagnosis, 57% had participated in cancer rehabilitation and 24% in other psychosocial support programs. Fifteen percent of all patients and 23% of those with a possible psychiatric disorder expressed their need for psychosocial support. Women with distress and perceived support needs who did not participate in past support programs were older, less educated, and less informed (P b.05). Conclusion: Findings show the longterm impact of breast cancer and indicate need for patient education, screening for psychosocial distress, and implementation of psychological interventions tailored in particular for older women.",

      "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Germany as well as in developed countries with an estimated annual incidence of 1,152,161 new cases worldwide  [1, 2] . The increase of breast cancer incidence with age and the improvement in survival rates through use of enhanced treatment regimes within recent years lead to a growing number of older patients and long-term survivors  [2, 3] . The consequences that evoke from this development do not merely include only physical health components such as a variety of late side effects during follow-up care  [4] , but also a wide range of potentially persistent psychosocial problems and needs  [5, 6] .\n\nOver the past decades, a considerable amount of research has shown the significant emotional and social impact of breast cancer and its treatment on patients and their families  [6] . Previous studies using self-report screening measures have reported distress, anxiety, and depression in, on average, one quarter to one third of breast cancer patients with levels up to 50% following diagnosis and treatment  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . While high levels of psychosocial distress have been found within the first year postdiagnosis, there is evidence for an improvement in distress, psychosocial well being, and quality of life (QOL) in long-term survivors  [13] [14] [15] , even though few research has shown no improvement or even a decline in physical and/or mental health (MH), specifically in older women  [6, 11, 16, 17] . Risk factors for psychosocial distress and lower levels of QOL include fewer personal resources and maladaptive coping strategies, poorly controlled physical symptoms, lack of social support, psychiatric medical history, poor doctor-patient communication, lower educational level, as well as younger or intermediate age  [6, 18, 19] . However, although younger women seem to have higher levels of psychosocial distress and report more unmet needs  [20] , they were also found to be more aware of psychosocial interventions and more likely to participate in support offers than older women  [21] .\n\nResearch has shown that older women  [22] [23] [24]  and those with lower socioeconomic status  [25]  are less likely to receive standard treatment and information about breast cancer care. Whether this might also be the case for psychosocial care has not been widely investigated so far. A study in breast cancer patients aged from 55 to 97 years  [26]  found that older women do highly value the information about breast cancer care provided by their breast cancer physician. However, while younger women did also receive more written information from other sources such as primary care physicians, family, and friends, specifically, women aged 57 years or older were found to get less written information from other sources. Furthermore, women who rated their ability to communicate with their physicians less highly were found to have lower levels of emotional health, suggesting that, in particular, patients with substantial need for support are less likely to actively seek help. However, although this study focused on oncological care information, it can be assumed that information about psychosocial care and support might also be less given to older women.\n\nKnowledge about psychosocial support offers is an important requirement for their use. Eakin and Strycker  [27]  led a study in 2001 on the knowledge about and participation in psychosocial support offers among patients with breast, colon, and prostate cancer. The findings indicated that only a percentage of patients were informed of existing support offers, and that knowledge of these offers was not consequently accompanied by participation in them. The authors were able to show that, in addition to a higher degree of education, a referral by the physician played an important role for the utilization of psychosocial support offers.\n\nWhile many psychosocial and QOL studies have been conducted with breast cancer patients, few studies have concentrated specifically on the association between psychological comorbidity and the awareness and utilization of psychosocial support offers in long-term survivors. Hodgkinson et al.  [28]  found a high percentage (86%) of reported unmet needs in breast cancer survivors and a significantly higher percentage in those patients with high levels of anxiety or depression. However, research including older women has been relatively rare so far.\n\nThe purpose of this cross-sectional cancer registry-based study is to provide information about the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as about health-related QOL in long-term breast cancer survivors. Group comparisons with populationbased normative values for anxiety, depression, and QOL have been undertaken. We furthermore investigate perceived knowledge, utilization, and subjective need for psychosocial support. The study examines predictors of psychological comorbidity as well as predictors of psychosocial support needs, taking into account specifically the time since breast cancer diagnosis, age, and educational level. We hypothesize that psychological comorbidity and awareness of and need for psychosocial support are significantly associated with age, educational level, time since diagnosis, and disease stage."

      "text": "Patients older than 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of breast cancer confirmed between 6.5 years and 18 months prior to our survey were recruited through the populationbased Cancer Registry of the Federal German state of Hamburg. The period of 18 months postdiagnosis was the earliest feasible time due to the cancer registration procedure. The Hamburg Cancer Registry has a case completeness for breast cancer higher than 95%  [29] ; however, registration and participation in research projects are voluntary for patients. The protocol received local research ethics committee approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\nFor each year postdiagnosis (18-24 months, up to 36, 48, 60, and more than 60 months to less than 78 months), the data sets of 400 women were randomly selected by the cancer registry. The upper time limit of 78 months postdiagnosis was determined by the cancer registry due to the fact that several studies in breast cancer patients using self-report measures were conducted at the same time as our research. The limit was defined to avoid possible distress in patients caused through repeated requests for study participation. The data sets contained name, address by date of registration, age, month and year of cancer diagnosis of each patient, as well as complete TNM status and histopathological grading for the majority of patients (77.1%). A set of self-report questionnaires, consent forms, and a selfaddressed stamped envelope were mailed to a total of 2000 patients. A reminder letter was sent after 4 weeks. Among these women, 321 (16.1%) had moved to an unknown address and did not receive our set of questionnaires, 39 (2.0%) had recently died, and 7 (0.4%) were not able to participate due to severe cognitive or physical problems (e.g., dementia, actively dying) noted by their relatives. Of the remaining eligible 1633 patients, evaluable questionnaires were returned by 1083 patients (66.3%). Participants (1083) and nonparticipants (550) did not differ in terms of age (mean=61.8\u00b19.8 vs. mean=58.9\u00b110.6) (P = .46), months since initial diagnosis (mean=46.5\u00b117.5 vs. mean= 46.9\u00b117.0) (P = .66), and tumor stage (P = .51). Sociodemographic and medical characteristics of the participants are listed in Table  1 ."

Years and months of breast cancer diagnosis as well as TNM classification were received through the cancer registry.\n\nThe Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-German Version is a validated screening instrument for anxiety and depression in somatically ill patients  [30] . According to the German Manual of the HADS, a score of 0 to 7 is categorized as normal, a score of 8 to 10 is considered to indicate a possible anxiety or depressive disorder, and a score of 11 or above is considered to indicate a probable anxiety or depressive disorder. Representative populationbased standardized values for women at different age groups were computed through regression analyses as recommended by Hinz and Schwarz  [31] . The following equations were applied: 0.026\u00d7age+0.69\u00d71(female gender)+3.09 for anxiety and 0.079\u00d7age+0.15\u00d71(female gender)+0.73 for depression.\n\nThe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C)  [32, 33]  assesses the PTSD symptom criteria intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Participants estimate the degree, to which they have been concerned, of each symptom during the past month. The term \"distressing event\" was replaced by the term \"cancer or cancer treatment.\" Participants are considered likely to have a PTSD if they meet at least one intrusion, three avoidance, and two arousal symptoms (rated as \"moderately\" or above).\n\nThe Short-Form Health Survey  [34]  assesses dimensions of QOL: general health (GH), physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), MH, role emotional (RE), and two summary scores for physical (PCS) and mental health (MCS). Each item score or summary measurement ranges from 0 to 100, higher scores indicating better health. Representative populationbased reference data for women at different age groups for Germany were published by Ellert et al.  [35] .\n\nSocial support was assessed using the 24-item validated German version of the Illness-specific Social Support Scale  [36] , which measures positive support (15 items) and detrimental interaction (9 items). Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always).\n\nPerceived need for and utilization of professional psychosocial support offers were assessed by single-item questions using Likert or categorical answer scales."

Eleven percent of the patients were classified as having moderate depression and further 11% as having high levels of depression. Cancer-related PTSD was observed in 12% of the patients. No group differences were found in the frequency of anxiety, depression, as well as PTSD between patients at different months postdiagnosis. Furthermore, ANOVA for QOL between the different time groups gave nonsignificant results for all QOL dimensions (Table  2 ).\n\nWith regard to the overall psychological comorbidity, we found 43% of the sample having at least one psychological diagnosis (anxiety and/or depression and/or PTSD) when using a HADS cutoff \u22658 and 26% when using a HADS cutoff \u226511 (Table  2 ). Again, using HADS cutoff \u22658, 21.2% of the patients had one diagnosis, 13.9% had two diagnoses, and 7.8% had three diagnoses. Using HADS cutoff \u226511, 13.9% of the sample had one diagnosis, 7.8% had two diagnoses, and 4.7% had three diagnoses.\n\nThe sample was divided into three age groups: (a) up to 50 years (n=153), (b) 51 to 65 years (n=519), and (c) 66 years and older (n=411). Analysis of variance for anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms between these three age groups gave significant results.

      "text": "This cancer registry-based study examined the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD as well as health-related QOL in long-term breast cancer survivors. The second objective was to investigate perceived knowledge, utilization, and subjective need for professional psychosocial support offers.\n\nThe term long-term survivor has been used differently within the current literature  [6] . According to the National Cancer Institute in the United States  [3] , \"an individual is considered a cancer survivor from the time of cancer diagnosis through the balance of his or her life\"  [37] . Other definitions determine the term long-term survivorship at a minimum of 5 years postdiagnosis  [3] . Other authors such as Mullan  [38]  and Bloom  [39]  have suggested that survivorship can be divided into different temporal stages such as (a) acute survival, including the first year after diagnosis and primary cancer treatment, (b) extended survival, which includes the period from the first through the third years after treatment when recurrence is most likely, and (c) permanent survival, which extends from the third year throughout the life and includes the longer-term adjustment period. Although all women in our sample were at least 18 months postdiagnosis and had completed treatment primary cancer treatment, according to the latter definitions, our sample represents the majority of women in the acute and extended survival phase, whereas 27% of women can be seen as 5-year postdiagnosis permanent survivors.\n\nOverall, high levels up to 38% for moderate to severe anxiety and up to 22% for moderate to severe depression have been found independently from time since initial breast cancer diagnosis. Previous studies in breast cancer survivors assessing long-term psychological comorbidity have reported noticeable lower rates of moderate and high levels of anxiety or depression  [10, 11, 28] , although similar or higher rates have been following diagnosis and primary breast cancer treatment  [6, 40, 41] . The prevalence rates found here are twice as high as the rates observed in a recent study by Hodgkinson et al.  [28] . Also, the total number of women suffering from at least one possible or probable psychiatric disorder (anxiety and/or depression and/or PTSD) can be considered as remarkably high with 43% and 26%. As the used measures (HADS and PCL-C) are sensitive self-report questionnaires with very good psychometric properties, these high prevalence rates indicate an insufficient professional psychosocial support system for long-term breast cancer patients in Germany. In particular, anxiety, fear of progression, and cancer relapse are not well investigated and clinically addressed in cancer patients and seem to be a persistent burden  [42] , possibly leading to depression and impaired QOL.\n\nThe comparison with population-based data reveals significant higher levels of anxiety in all patient age groups. However, the effect size is specifically large in younger women. These results provide evidence that the experience of breast cancer has a long-lasting impact on anxiety. In particular, fear of progression and cancer-related worries might be salient problems that have been found as major and persistent sources of stress in cancer patients  [42, 43] . Interestingly, similar findings have been publicized by Hodgkinson et al.  [28] , showing higher anxiety scores in long-term breast cancer survivors compared to community levels, but no differences in depression and QOL. In our study, rates of depression were even significantly better in breast cancer patients older than 51 years compared to ageadjusted population-based prevalence rates. Thus, breast cancer appears to induce higher levels of anxiety but could concurrently lead to a redefinition and reappraisal of life perspectives and life goals that might be a buffer against feelings of depression. The estimation of PTSD was 12%, a number that corresponds with the 1% to 20% estimates reported in the empirical literature  [12, 44]  but is slightly higher than the PTSD lifetime prevalence rates of women in the general population  [45] .\n\nConsistent with the literature  [6] , we found cancer progress, detrimental social interactions, and lower levels of social support, as well as lower educational levels, to be significant predictors for overall psychological comorbidity. Surprisingly, age was found to be a significant but rather weak predictor in this study. Furthermore, time since initial diagnosis did not play a significant role in prevalence rates of psychological comorbidity, which was also observed in previous research  [46] . An explanation for the apparent lack of differences in psychological comorbidity in women with rather large time differences since diagnosis is that anxiety is a predominant feature following cancer diagnosis and treatment that appears to be rather stable over time with regard to the enduring threat of a possible disease recurrence. The specification of subtypes of anxiety in long-term survivors such as panic disorder, general anxiety disorder, or fear of progression requires further investigation.\n\nBreast cancer survivors did report impaired QOL in the majority of dimensions, which is only partly consistent with other findings in breast cancer survivors. Whereas the majority of studies reported improvement in QOL in breast cancer survivors  [6, 14, 15] , several research did not find an increase in physical or mental QOL domains  [16, 17] . Only marginal differences were found between younger and older age groups. However, it is noteworthy that a consistent lower QOL in breast cancer survivors was found even years after diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn our study, a relatively high percentage of breast cancer patients (62%) participated in a cancer rehabilitation program provided in Germany to regain physical and psychosocial functioning, and/or received other forms of psychosocial support. The findings emphasize the importance of cancer rehabilitation following diagnosis and primary cancer treatment. However, the percentage of women that does participate in other psychosocial support offers or self-help organizations is much lower (24%).\n\nRather surprising was the relatively high rate (46%) of women that feel insufficiently informed about psychosocial support offers, because Hamburg is a city with a comparatively well functioning network of psychosocial support offers for cancer patients, including inpatients consultation and liaison services in cancer centers and major hospitals, psychosocial ambulatory services, as well as several cancer support information centers. In particular, patients older than 65 years and patients with lower educational levels are less informed. Insofar, our results provide emphasis to previous research that indicates that the quality of patient-physician interaction and information giving declines in older patients and in patients with lower socioeconomic status  [23, 47] .\n\nIn contrast to other research  [28] , we found a rather low (15%) percentage of perceived need for psychosocial support. Only 23% of those patients with a possible psychiatric disorder had the subjective desire for professional support. Although it was not assessed in this study, due to other research  [27] , it can be assumed that referral by primary care physician or oncologist may be very important for the participation in support offers. In particular, older women and women with lower school education might benefit from a valid psychosocial screening and referral.\n\nThere are several important limitations of the study. The response rate of 66% of eligible patients can be evaluated as rather positive given a cancer register-based survey where no personal clinical contact between patients and our institution (Department of Medical Psychology) was established before. Participants and nonparticipants did not differ in important variables such as age, time since diagnosis, and tumor stage. Nevertheless, there remains a certain level of uncertainty regarding the representativeness and a possible sample bias. In the view of 34% of nonparticipants, our findings may over-or underestimate the prevalence of psychological comorbidity and the levels of QOL in breast cancer survivors. As this is a cross-sectional study, important information about pre-or posttreatment psychological adjustment and QOL is missing to specifically determine the course of psychological morbidity and QOL in breast cancer survivors. Furthermore, perceived knowledge and need for psychosocial support were assessed using singleitem questions. The use of comprehensive questionnaires would add substantial information here. Future studies may need to take account of breast cancer survivors five and more years postdiagnosis. However, despite these limitations, results of this study may have important implications for patient education and information, screening for psychosocial distress, the promotion and implementation of psychological interventions tailored in particular for older women, as well as further psychosocial research."
