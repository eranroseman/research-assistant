      "text": "We included four randomised controlled trials involving 1933 participants.\n\nFor the primary outcome category of health, there was moderate quality evidence from one study that women who received prenatal support via mobile phone messages had significantly higher satisfaction than those who did not receive the messages, both in the antenatal period (mean difference (MD) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.72) and perinatal period (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.01). Their confidence level was also higher (MD 1.12, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.73) and anxiety level was lower (MD -2.15, 95% CI -3.42 to -0.88) than in the control group in the antenatal period. In this study, no further differences were observed between groups in the perinatal period. There was low quality evidence that the mobile phone messaging intervention did not affect pregnancy outcomes (gestational age at birth, infant birth weight, preterm delivery and route of delivery).\n\nFor the primary outcome category of health behaviour, there was moderate quality evidence from one study that mobile phone message reminders to take vitamin C for preventive reasons resulted in higher adherence (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.74). There was high quality evidence from another study that participants receiving mobile phone messaging support had a significantly higher likelihood of quitting smoking than those in a control group at 6 weeks (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.70) and at 12 weeks follow-up (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.84). At 26 weeks, there was only a significant difference between groups if, for participants with missing data, the last known value was carried forward. There was very low quality evidence from one study that mobile phone messaging interventions for self-monitoring of healthy behaviours related to childhood weight control did not have a statistically significant effect on physical activity, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages or screen time.\n\nFor the secondary outcome of acceptability, there was very low quality evidence from one study that user evaluation of the intervention was similar between groups. There was moderate quality evidence from one study of no difference in adverse effects of the intervention, measured as rates of pain in the thumb or finger joints, and car crash rates.\n\nNone of the studies reported the secondary outcomes of health service utilisation or costs of the intervention."

      "title": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "We found very limited evidence that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may support preventive health care, to improve health status and health behaviour outcomes. However, because of the low number of participants in three of the included studies, combined with study limitations of risk of bias and lack of demonstrated causality, the evidence for these effects is of low to moderate quality. The evidence is of high quality only for interventions aimed at smoking cessation. Furthermore, there are significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects, risks and limitations of, and user satisfaction with, such interventions."

      "text": "Many costly and disabling conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer or diabetes are linked by common preventable risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy nutrition, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol use. However, prevention still plays a secondary role in many health systems as all too o en, healthcare workers fail to seize interactions with patient as opportunities to inform them about health promotion and disease prevention strategies. This review examined whether mobile phone applications such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) can support and enhance primary preventive health interventions.\n\nThere was moderate quality evidence from one study which showed that pregnant women who received supportive, informative text messages experienced higher satisfaction and confidence, and lower anxiety levels in the antenatal period than women who did not receive these. There was low quality evidence that there was no difference in pregnancy outcomes.\n\nWe found one trial that provided high quality evidence that regular support messages sent by text message can help people to quit smoking, at least in the short-term. One study assessing whether mobile phone messaging promoted use of preventive medication reported moderate quality evidence of higher self-reported adherence by people receiving the messages. A fourth study on healthy behaviours in children found very low quality evidence showing that the interventions had no effect.\n\nThere was very low quality evidence from one study that people's evaluation of the intervention was similar between groups. There was moderate quality evidence from one study of no difference in harms of the intervention, measured as rates of pain in the thumb or finger joints, and car crash rates. There were no studies reporting outcomes related to health service utilisation or costs.\n\nAlthough we find that, overall, mobile phone messaging can be helpful for some aspects of preventive health care, much is not yet known about the long-term effects or potential negative consequences."

      "text": "Mobile phone messaging is an important means of human communication globally. Mobile phone penetration is rapidly increasing, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, with 90% of the global and 80% of rural population having access to a mobile network in 2010. The number of subscriptions in 2010 reached 5.3 billion, representing a 76.2% global penetration rate (ITU 2010). The penetration rates are 70% to 90% in high-income countries, with a similar rate of increase across all socio-economic groups (Atun 2006). Most digital mobile phones provide Short Message Service (SMS), also known as text messaging, and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) for transmitting graphics, video clips and sound files. SMS, in particular, has developed into a powerful communication medium, particularly among young adults. The total number of text messages sent globally tripled between 2007 and 2010, from an estimated 1.8 trillion to 6.1 trillion, with about 200,000 messages sent every second (ITU 2010).These short messages, where up to 160 characters of text are sent from the Internet or from a mobile phone to one or several mobile phones, provide an important, inexpensive medium of communication. The terms text message, text, or txt are more commonly used in North America, the UK, Spain and the Philippines, while in many other countries the term SMS is used.\n\nIn this review we will use the term 'text messaging' to refer to the use of SMS only, distinguishing it from the term 'mobile phone messaging', which encompasses both SMS and MMS. Increasingly, the latter term also refers to mobile email and 'instant messaging' delivered to the mobile phone.\n\nText messages, compared to other communication channels, have the advantage of instant transmission and low cost. There is also a smaller chance of being misplaced compared to print materials, and of being invasive to daily lives compared to phone calls  (Kaplan 2006) . Features such as ubiquity, mobility, direct and instantaneous access and direct communication offer the possibility of using mobile phones for health information transfer  (Atun 2006) . A literature review on the use of mobile phones in health care has demonstrated the wide application and potential of mobile phones to: increase access to health care; enhance efficiency of service delivery; improve diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation; and support public health programmes  (Atun 2006; Car 2008b) .\n\nMobile phone messaging has, for example, been used to provide appointment reminders  (Bos 2005) , to improve patient compliance with medications  (Fairley 2003; Marquez Contreras 2004; Vilella 2004) , to monitor chronic conditions  (Ferrer-Roca 2004; Kwon 2004; Ostojic 2005)  and to provide psychological support  (Bauer 2003) . Mobile phones have also been used in managing communicable diseases (e.g. in contact tracing and partner notification for sexually transmitted illnesses  (Newell 2001) ) and in health promotion programmes  (Obermayer 2004; Rodgers 2005) . Furthermore, the use of mobile phones has been shown to improve service utilization among population groups such as teenagers and young adult males who do not typically use health services, by providing the opportunity to remotely access care providers for advice (Atun 2006b). However, for older adults, some of whom are less able or willing to use mobile phones, the effect on improved service utilization could be limited (Atun 2006b).\n\nChallenges in using mobile phone applications in health care include incomplete coverage of mobile networks across regions, lack of standards, and possible information overload (Adler 2007).\n\nThis review is part of a series of four reviews which aim to determine the effects of mobile phone messaging in improving the processes of healthcare service delivery and service utilization:\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for preventive health care (this review);\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations (Gurol-Urganci 2012); \u2022 Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments  (Car 2012 ); \u2022 Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self-management of long-term illnesses (de Jongh 2012)"

      "title": "Description of the condition",
      "text": "Many of the costly and disabling conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes) facing health systems today are linked by shared risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy nutrition, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption, which can be addressed through preventive interventions  (Goldstein 2004) .\n\nPrevention measures in health systems can take various forms, and are generally divided into health promotion and disease prevention (Canadian 1994). Health promotion aims at encouraging people to adopt and maintain a healthful lifestyle. Disease prevention aims to prevent avoidable diseases or to identify diseases early, in order to minimise their impact.\n\nPrevention measures targeted at specific illnesses (such as infectious diseases), risk factors (such as obesity), target groups (such as young people) and settings (such as schools) positively influence the health of populations. Effective strategies for the long-term improvement of population health include primary, secondary and tertiary prevention interventions that are directed to the different stages of disease. Primary prevention increases a person's ability to remain free of disease. The aim of secondary prevention is to identify asymptomatic individuals at an early stage of disease when early identification promises a significantly better response to treatment than a er the disease has progressed. Tertiary prevention aims to minimize the disability caused by existing disease  (McWhinney 1997) . Prevention interventions such as counselling, screening, immunisation and chemoprophylaxis, when integrated into general clinical services, offer an efficient way of providing comprehensive care.\n\nThe ability of a health system to provide effective preventive health care is important not just from an ethical perspective but, equally, from an economic one. However, most health systems better respond to acute problems, urgent needs and pressing concerns of patients. Despite evidence of the effectiveness of preventive services, integration of preventive care guidelines into public health and clinical practice has been modest  (Davis 1997; Wei 2005; Weingarten 1999 ). Barriers to the delivery of preventive health care include healthcare systems' traditional focus on a 'responsive' rather than a 'pro-active' approach to individuals' and populations' health. Within the consultation context, factors such as lack of time, deficit of clinician expertise, logistic difficulties, lack of interest by patients, other urgent concerns, inadequate reimbursement, and patient concerns regarding the interventions, can play a role  (Kottke 1993; Mirand 2002; Szilagyi 2005) ."

With shortages of physicians in some countries  (Bodenheimer 2006) , and large and rapidly-growing competing demands and guidelines, physicians will probably be able to do less rather than more preventive service during each visit  (Pollak 2008) . They may have to make choices about preventive services on a case by case basis, weighing patient characteristics, medical needs and time restraints against the need for intervention. Prioritising those patients needing preventive services may involve moving away from face-to-face patient care to various forms of patient education through telephone or electronic media  (Atherton 2010; Yarnall 2003) .\n\nPatients are increasingly involved in managing their health care  (Cline 2001) , and providers are challenged to motivate, educate and help people adhere to healthy behaviours and medication regimens using new communication technologies  (Demiris 2008) .\n\nAdvances in information technology have introduced new approaches to support healthcare delivery and patient education  (Revere 2001) . Understanding people's behaviour and identifying the factors underlying behavioural change help in the development and evaluation of effective health behaviour interventions  (Bandura 1977; Glanz 1997; Prochaska 1997; Rhodes 1997) ."

In contrast to traditional sources of health information (such as print media), interactive health communication using mobile phone messaging offers the potential to combine the scalability of public health interventions (such as mass media campaigns) with individualized health care through the use of tailoring  (Eng 1999; Robinson 1998) .\n\nRelevant interventions support healthier lifestyles such as smoking cessation, increased physical activity, healthy nutrition, and weight control, or support health education or adherence to preventive medications."

      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "Mobile phone messaging may help to address some preventive health challenges by enabling remote delivery of care, facilitating timely access to health advice and medications, prompting selfmonitoring and medication compliance, and educating patients (Demiris 2008). These interventions are particularly suitable for outpatient use, as patients can carry mobile phones with them easily. The price of mobile communication devices has dropped dramatically in the last decade; increasing functionality and decreasing cost provide opportunities for preventive interventions that were previously not feasible (Revere 2001). However, participants in preventive health behaviour interventions may not be motivated to initiate communication if they feel healthy. Mobile phone messaging interventions can be used to enhance self-efficacy (such as feedback on treatment success) (de Jongh  2012) , to provide a form of social support (from peers and health professionals), or to establish social networks (support groups, peer-to-peer networks). By increasing self-efficacy  (Bandura 1977; Bandura 1982 ) and providing support mechanisms  (Christakis 2004; Cobb 2002) , these interventions may influence health behaviours and enhance preventive health care. Mobile phone messaging could affect health outcomes through individual tailoring, personalization and behavioural feedback. Tailoring refers to building an intervention, in part, on specific knowledge of actual characteristics of the individual receiving the intervention. Personalization involves designing the intervention to be delivered in a way that makes it specific for a given individual. Finally, behavioural feedback refers to providing consumers with messages regarding their status, well-being, or progression through the intervention. These messages may come in many different forms.\n\nThey can be motivational (such as \"You did great today!\") or purely data driven (such as \"You completed 80 percent of your goal today\").\n\nInvitations and reminders may be an effective way to increase the uptake of preventive care activities such as adult immunisation (Vilella 2004) and cancer screening  (Stone 2002) . Electronic technology may facilitate communication with patients about preventive care based on clinical guidelines and strengthen the continuity of care between patient and clinician by improving access and supporting the coordination of healthcare activities from a single source  (Balas 1997) . Text messaging has been shown to facilitate adoption of healthier behaviours, such as smoking cessation  (Rodgers 2005) .\n\nOur parallel review describes the use of text messaging in self-management programmes for long-term conditions, that are relevant for secondary and tertiary prevention (de Jongh 2012)."

      "title": "Acceptability and risks of the intervention",
      "text": "Possible risks of using mobile phone messaging include the risk of inaccurate data input  (Norwell 2003) ; lack of understanding or misinterpretation of the information; and difficulties in reading for those with poor vision or problems with literacy. Furthermore, mobile phone messaging technology is intended to support or complement the process of care delivery rather than to substitute for it. A possible risk of a narrow focus on the technology is that providers may misinterpret it as an endpoint to their responsibilities within the care delivery process, believing that their work is completed once the message is sent. This may result in inadequate follow-up of patients a er the intervention.\n\nAdditionally, text messaging cannot capture the verbal and nonverbal cues that may also influence the interpretation of the message. Participants' perceptions of personal invasion and behavioural control may be affected by inappropriate SMS initiation methods and the intervention may have the opposite effect of that intended.\n\nHaving correct patient contact information and securely stored health records are essential to meet privacy, confidentiality and data protection requirements. Failures or delays in message delivery are rare but possible; however, harm is unlikely as senders are usually notified instantly in cases where there was a transmission problem. There may be additional monetary and time costs, as backup systems may be needed. Lastly, risks associated with mobile phone messaging in general may apply, such as an increased risk of car accidents as a result of messaging whilst driving."

Use of SMS messaging was applied to four different clinical areas: adherence to preventive medication  (Cocosila 2009) , prenatal support (Jareethum 2008), smoking cessation  (Rodgers 2005) , and health behaviours  (Shapiro 2008) . Participants in three studies were people in the community  (Cocosila 2009; Rodgers 2005; Shapiro 2008 ) and in one study healthy pregnant women attending an ambulatory antenatal clinic (Jareethum 2008). The target group for the intervention varied.\n\nParticipants in one study were children aged 5 to 13 years and their parents  (Shapiro 2008 ).\n\nRodgers 2005 targeted current smokers aged over 16 years. The studies by Cocosila 2009 and Jareethum 2008 targeted participants aged over 18 years. Three studies included both men and women; the proportion of males included in the studies ranged from 38% to 45%. Jareethum 2008 included only women. Participants in Rodgers 2005 came from all income levels: 26% from low, 42% from middle and 31% from higher income level. The intervention group in Jareethum 2008 had a higher proportion of pregnant women with a bachelor degree than the control group (P = 0.061). Other studies did not report the socio-economic status of the participants. Ethnicity was reported in Rodgers 2005: the study included 21% Maori and 79% Non-Maori participants. Details about race were presented only in the study by Shapiro 2008; the study included 60% white, 34% black, 1% Asian and 1% Hispanic/Latino participants. Interventions Purpose The purpose of the SMS intervention varied across studies. One study used SMS to support antenatal care of healthy pregnant women (Jareethum 2008). In another study, current daily smokers interested in quitting within a month were sent regular, personalised text messages providing smoking cessation advice, Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews support and distraction  (Rodgers 2005) . In addition, several other text message based services were provided for the intervention group: Quit buddies (participants with similar characteristics and quit days were put in touch with each other); TXT crave (participants could 'pull' text messages on demand by sending a text message to a short code number and they would receive a tip on how to get through the cravings); TXT polls (for example, messages sent to all participants on current topics, and the answers were sent back to all); and TXT quizzes (questions were sent out, followed by answers the next day).\n\nTwo studies involved two-way communication between participants and an automated system. In Cocosila 2009 participants were sent SMS medication reminders, and, depending on their reply (i.e. acknowledgement or not), a remindingreinforcing or a reminding-correcting message. Participants in  Shapiro 2008  sent text messages to provide information on any of three targeted behaviours: pedometer usage, estimating beverage serving sizes, and estimating screen time (TV, video game, computers). For each SMS sent, they would receive an immediate, automated SMS feedback message."

In the study on smoking cessation an algorithm based on keyword matching was developed to match participant characteristics with a database of over 1000 text messages, so that an individualised programme was provided during a free month of text messaging  (Rodgers 2005) . In Shapiro 2008 for each SMS sent participants received an immediate, automated SMS feedback message from the program, which was hosted on a secure server.\n\nParticipants in Cocosila 2009 received compensation: in the control group 15 US dollars (USD) and those in the intervention group 30 USD (a higher amount covering additional activities and the SMS air-time during the study). In Shapiro 2008 each family was given one phone to share for the duration of the study and they were instructed not to use the phone for anything except study-related SMS. In three other studies participants used their own mobile phones."

      "text": "In Cocosila 2009, participants in the intervention group were sent SMS medication reminders with fresh content from a virtual friend called 'Tim'. Some messages included jokes and ended with a 'smiley'. All texts were in a direct, non-formal language. Three types of reminders were sent: basic (a medication reminder: a er each such message participants were requested to reply with a one-letter SMS a er taking the vitamin, no later than the midnight of the same day), reinforcing (encouraging messages with fresh jokes, brief information) and correcting (those who did not acknowledge the basic reminders were sent brief information about the importance of taking the vitamin with no 'smiley'). In Jareethum 2008 SMS messages were appropriate to the women's gestational age, and contained information and warnings relating to abnormal symptoms that would require consultation with a doctor. The study on smoking cessation  (Rodgers 2005)  used personalised text messages providing smoking cessation advice, support, and distraction, by matching participant characteristics with a database of text messages . Participants' nicknames were also incorporated into the text messages. In Shapiro 2008 hundreds of feedback messages were developed to avoid duplicate messages; algorithms were based on (1) how many goals were met and (2) enhancement or deterioration from the previous day (for example, \"Wow, you met your step and screen time goals-Congratulations! What happened to beverages?\"). Timing and frequency The timing and frequency with which messages were sent and received varied across studies. During the first two weeks of the one-month Cocosila 2009 study, participants in the intervention group were sent one reminding-basic message daily at random times within a two hour time interval and, depending on their reply (i.e. acknowledgement or not), a reminding-reinforcing or a reminding-correcting message every two days. In the last two weeks, participants received one reminding-basic text message every other day, and either a reminding-reinforcing or a remindingcorrecting message every three days. In Jareethum 2008 the study group received two text messages per week from 28 weeks of gestation until giving birth. SMS messages were sent on Mondays and Thursdays during the daytime to avoid making a disturbance. In the study on smoking cessation (Rodgers 2005) five messages were sent per day for the week leading up to the quit day and for the following four weeks. Six weeks a er randomisation, coinciding approximately with the end of the free text messaging month, the intervention became much less intensive, with the number of sent text messages reducing from five a day to three per week until the end of the 26-week follow up. Families in Shapiro 2008 began monitoring on day one of the program and sent two text messages per day (one for parent and one for child) for the full eight weeks of the study. For each text sent, they received an immediate, automated text feedback message, regardless of the time of day. Outcomes Cocosila 2009 reported on self-reported adherence through missed tablets of preventive medicine (vitamin C) in the final week, increase in number of tablets taken per week and selfreported increased adherence (SMS versus control) to taking the tablets. Jareethum 2008 reported on satisfaction levels, confidence scores, anxiety scores and pregnancy outcomes (e.g. gestational age at birth and fetal birth weight) in the antenatal and perinatal periods (SMS versus control). Rodgers 2005 on smoking cessation reported quit rates at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks, and percentage abstaining from smoking at 26 weeks. Shapiro 2008 reported on treatment acceptability, attrition (SMS versus paper diaries versus control), adherence to self-monitoring (percentage of total monitoring days: SMS versus paper diary) and preliminary efficacy of SMS in affecting behavior change in children.\n\nFor determining the rate of attrition in this study, completers were defined as participants who completed the 8-week post assessment and who attended at least two of three educational sessions."

Also the percentage of participants who completed the study varied between groups (SMS 72% versus paper diaries 39% versus control 50%). In this study final analysis was performed on only those participants who had completed the study, which could influence generalisability of the findings  (Shapiro 2008) . The methods of analysing incomplete data collected varied across studies with analysis and reporting based on intention to treat analysis (ITT) in  Cocosila 2009 , and on only participants who completed the study  (Shapiro 2008 ).\n\nIn the study on smoking cessation  (Rodgers 2005 ) a number of sensitivity analyses were used to assess the potential effect of data missing from follow-up, mis-classified quit status, and adjustment for baseline prognostic variables. Assuming those participants lost to follow up as smokers is standard practice in cessation studies. However, sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of other possibilities on the results in Rodgers 2005. The two main shortcomings of the study lay in the potential over-reporting of quitting status and the comparatively large and differential loss to follow up. The results of salivary cotinine verification for those reporting to have quit at six weeks demonstrated overreporting of quit rates, with no clear evidence that this occurred at different rates in the intervention and control groups. These factors are unlikely to have biased the treatment effect estimates at six weeks, since at that time follow up was high and possible over-reporting rates appeared similar in both groups. At 12 and 26 weeks there were more lost to follow-up in the active group and so, assumptions of smoking status for those lost to followup could have led to important differences to the treatment effect estimates. Researchers discussed the different scenarios modelled for treatment of missing data. Under all scenarios there remained a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation rates at six weeks, even under the most conservative assumptions. As well, there remained an increase in prevalence of non-smoking in the active group compared to the control group at 12 weeks. However, the between-group differences were less clear at 26 weeks."

Consequently, follow-up rates reduced to around 67% in the intervention group and to 78% in the control group by six months. The reported quit rates increased over time in the control group. One possible explanation is that some participants may have thought their free text month might depend on reporting quitting.\n\nAlthough differential use of incentives could have led to bias, this is expected to have led to an underestimation of effect rather than an overestimation.\n\nIn Cocosila 2009 the figures regarding vitamin C consumption increased for both groups at endpoint: by 246% for the intervention group and by 131% for the control group. However, the differences between groups were not significant.\n\nA possible cause of the non-significant difference between the intervention and control group at endpoint may have been potential 'cross-contamination' between intervention and control groups due to the way participants were selected for the study. In addition to the small sample size, Shapiro 2008 had several other limitations, including only English-speaking families and intermittent difficulties with using SMS (e.g. phone companies merged, plans discontinued, changed coverage areas, which probably influenced generalisability. Furthermore, the questionnaire used to explore the preliminary efficacy of SMS in promoting behavioural change was not validated. There was also no validation of accuracy of reporting."

Of those who did provide a sample, 54.8% (n = 17) in the intervention group were verified as having quit, compared with 33.3% (n = 6) in the control group. Therefore the study demonstrates a higher degree of over-reported quitting by those in the control group than those in the intervention group.\n\nThe evidence that mobile phone messaging interventions positively impact on smoking quit rates is considered to be of high quality (Summary of findings for the main comparison)."

However, no difference was found in pregnancy outcomes  (Jareethum 2008) . The evidence on the effects of text messaging on smoking cessation comes from one large study  (Rodgers 2005) . This study reported significant shortterm beneficial effects on behaviour modification among the intervention group participants, but no significant effect was found for the long-term. There were, however, significantly higher rates of continuous abstinence from smoking at 26 weeks among the intervention group participants.\n\nWe found very low quality evidence that text messaging had no effect on self-monitoring healthy behaviours relevant to childhood weight control (specifically, increasing physical activity, and reducing sugary drink intake and screen time)  (Shapiro 2008) . However, the sample size was small, and no generalisations can be made until the intervention is rigorously evaluated in larger followup studies that test the efficacy of the intervention.\n\nWe found moderate quality evidence that SMS medication reminders increased adherence to preventive medicines, in a small study  (Cocosila 2009) . Interestingly, this study used two-way communication between participants and an automated system. Accordingly, it was possible to see if participants acknowledged their daily vitamin taking, and how late a er the prescribed intake time this was done. As the research literature asks for more objective measures of adherence  (Haynes 2008) , this approach has the potential to become a suitable system for promptly reporting self-reported adherence to medication.\n\nParticipants' evaluation of text messaging in supporting preventive healthcare measures was addressed in only one study  (Shapiro 2008) . In this small feasibility study no significant differences were found in most treatment acceptability measures across any of the groups; the only exception was that parents in the control group were more likely to participate again than those who received SMS messages. Evidently, the acceptability of text messaging in preventive healthcare is an area that requires further attention.\n\nNone of the included studies focused on direct and indirect costs associated with text messaging. It should, however, be recognised that such costs may depend on the nature of the intervention and the size and characteristics of the target group. Given the current global enthusiasm with which mHealth applications are being embraced, more attention to the cost implications seems warranted."

      "text": "We systematically collected and analysed the evidence to date on the effects of mobile phone messaging as a mode of delivery for preventive health care. However, when interpreting the results of this review, some of the limitations should be taken into consideration. Firstly, in considering studies for the review we have taken a narrow focus: including only those studies in which the intervention is exclusively delivered through text messaging, and communication is between provider and participant only.\n\nWe excluded studies combining SMS with other forms of data transmission, such as email, Internet or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), as it would be difficult to assess the independent effect of a text message within such complex interventions.\n\nHowever, this strategy restricted the body of evidence that we were able to examine. Our review thus contains only a small number of studies. Combined with the substantial heterogeneity in the selected studies, this means it is very difficult to assess to what extent the review's findings have more general relevance. Secondly, the fact that no data has been collected beyond a study period of 26 weeks means that it is difficult to predict the long-term effects of text messaging in supporting the primary preventive measures directed to behavioral changes.\n\nWe included three studies from high income countries (Canada, New Zealand, USA) and one study from a lower-middle income country (Thailand). Text messaging for preventive health care seemed promising in the area of smoking cessation and antenatal care. However, as our review contains only one study for each individual field of primary prevention, it is very difficult to assess to what extent our findings have more general relevance.\n\nNone of the studies evaluated potential loss or misinterpretation of the data, or considered issues of costs, security and confidentiality.\n\nParticularly in low-income countries where mobile phones are frequently shared between family members, these are important issues that need to be taken into account."

      "text": "The included studies were of varying methodological quality; some studies provided insufficient information to accurately assess the risk of bias. On the whole, sequence generation for randomisation was considered adequate in all studies. Only two of the four studies provided information on allocation concealment. The lack of blinding of participants in all studies can be partly explained by the interactive nature of the SMS interventions, which does not permit the blinding of patients or their healthcare providers.\n\nThere is, however, a potential for bias from the apparent lack of blinding of outcome assessors, as only one study reported on blinding of personnel collecting and analysing the samples. The individual studies examined a wide variety of outcomes, and the heterogeneity in these outcome measures makes it difficult to draw unambiguous conclusions on the effects of text messaging.\n\nThe study on smoking cessation attempted biochemical verification of self-reported quit rates at 6 weeks and found greater over-reporting of quitting in the control than the intervention group. Although the numbers involved were very small, it is possible that reliance on self-report in this study could underestimate the effect of the intervention.\n\nSome conclusions come from studies with small sample sizes, and the effects of these interventions need to be rigorously evaluated in larger follow up studies. While the study on adherence to preventive treatment is of moderate quality, the results have limited generalisability to improving treatment adherence for outpatients with more complex chronic disease regimens. It should also be taken into account that tools used to explore the preliminary efficacy of text messaging to promote behavioural change for children's weight control were not validated.\n\nBecause of the limited number of studies included in this review and the relatively small number of participants in some studies the effectiveness of using mobile phone messaging in supporting preventive health care cannot be assessed.

      "text": "This review follows on two other reviews with a similar focus. Fjeldsoe 2009 reviewed the evidence for behaviour change interventions delivered by SMS, whereas Krishna 2009 more broadly looked at healthcare delivery via mobile phones in the management and prevention of disease. One study on smoking cessation  (Rodgers 2005)  in our review was also included in both of those reviews.\n\nHowever, our review differs from these two reviews in several respects. First, Krishna 2009 focused on all possible fields of application for mobile phones in disease management and prevention, rather than on their utility as a mode of delivery for preventive health care alone. Their conclusions were thus based on an even more heterogeneous set of studies, complicating the process of deriving robust conclusions. Secondly,  Krishna 2009  was not restricted to text messaging applications alone but also included interventions whereby mobile phones were used for regular phone calls or for data transmission by GPRS, e.g. to transmit data received from a wireless device, thus including a number of studies which we have excluded from our review to minimise possible confounding. Interestingly, Krishna 2009 is more positive overall regarding the effects of mobile phones on health outcomes, compliance with medication and self-efficacy. A possible explanation could be that interventions employing a more extensive range of technologies in patient-provider communication are better tailored to patients' needs and preferences than those which rely exclusively on text messaging. Fjeldsoe 2009's focus was somewhat closer to that of our review, as it looks specifically at behaviour change interventions, evaluating changes in both preventive health behaviour and those associated with the management of clinical conditions. The review, however, used less stringent selection criteria, and included studies without a control group. Furthermore, although text messaging had to be the main method of intervention delivery the review also considered studies in which other technologies were used as adjuncts. Despite the wider scope of the review and the inclusion of less rigorous studies, Fjeldsoe 2009's conclusions -that text message based interventions can have some positive short-term behavioural outcomes, but that further research into long-term effects and acceptability is required -are largely in line with those of our review."

There is no evidence that mobile phone messaging interventions have longterm benefits for preventive health care. Furthermore, very little is known about costs, and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention. Before these issues are examined further, caution is advised about implementing these technologies on a large scale."

These studies used the individual person as the unit of randomisation. The number of participants in the included studies was low and most participants were young adults. The studies had a relatively short duration, with none exceeding 26 weeks. Causal pathways between interventions and outcomes were not clearly defined, especially in one study that also included financial compensation and where the effect of the SMS intervention and financial incentive could not be disaggregated. None of the studies included economic evaluations. These limitations, combined with the significant risk of bias, mean that the evidence on health effects is of low to moderate quality, and that long-term effects or economic benefits cannot be demonstrated. It is also not possible to ascertain whether the effects can be sustained over a period of time. There is, therefore, a need for more robust studies into these issues.\n\nFuture studies should have larger sample sizes and include different age groups that may benefit from preventive health interventions. The studies should be for longer duration, preferably up to at least three years, to demonstrate whether such benefits can be sustained over time -critically important as achieving sustained behaviour change is difficult. Studies which have a bundle of interventions, for example combining text messaging with professional support or financial incentives, should have appropriate designs to assess the effect of text messaging, both with and without such additional interventions.\n\nFuture studies should also compare effects in different contexts, for example in low and middle income countries with weaker health systems and significant shortages in the health workforce.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating intermediate measures, such as uptake of interventions or sustained adherence to them, future studies should measure effects on health outcomes -for example, reduced incidence and prevalence rates, or in the case of secondary prevention reduced disease progression, improved physiological measurements, reduced complication rates or lowered hospital admissions. In addition, future studies should explore acceptability of the interventions to users, as well as their economic costs and benefits."
