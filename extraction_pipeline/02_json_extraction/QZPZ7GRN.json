  "title": "SELF-CHANGE AND THERAPY CHANGE OF SMOKING BEHAVIOR: A COMPARISON OF PROCESSES OF CHANGE IN CESSATION AND MAINTENANCE",
  "abstract": "Cigarette smokers who quit on their own (n = 29) were compared with subjects from two commercial therapy programs: Aversion Group (n = 18) and Behavior Management Group (n = 16). Subjects were administered a Change-Process Questionnaire and a demographic and smoking-history questionnaire within seven weeks of successful cessation, then interviewed again in five months. Using a transtheoretical model of change developed by Prochaska (1979) six verbal and four behavioral processes of change and three stages of change (Decision to Change: Active Change; Maintenance) were analyzed. Subjects in each treatment group were middle class, heavy-smoking adults. The change-process analysis of cessation discriminated between the self-quitters and therapy quitters and between the two groups of therapy subjects on five variables. Stages of change interacted with the processes of change in the cessation of smoking behavior. Verbal processes were seen as important in making the decision to change while action processes were critical for breaking the actual smoking habit. Maintenance of cessation was related to, but not dependent on, how subjects actively changed smoking behavior.",

      "text": "In the decade following the Surgeon General's report on Smoking and Health (I 964) the proportion of adult males and females who smoked dropped from 52 to 39% and 32 to 29070, respectively (Adult Use of  Tobacco, 1975) . Of the estimated 29 million Americans who quit smoking during this decade, 70 to 80% were able to stop without formalized treatment. Furthermore, a majority of smokers indicated that if they were to quit, they would not attend a formalized treatment program  (McAlister, 1975) .\n\nDespite the preference for and preponderant use of informal self-quitting approaches, research on smoking cessation has focused primarily on formalized treatments. Reviews of these studies  (Bernstein, 1970; Bernstein & McAlister, 1976; Bradshaw, 1973; Keutzer, Lichtenstein & Mees, 1968; Lichtenstein & Danaher, 1977a , 1977b; Schwartz & Rider, 1977)  point up their heuristic value, but no treatment has been identified as a reliable change agent.\n\nIn one of the few studies on self-change, self-change quitters did not appear to differ from individuals in formalized treatments on smoking habits, locus of control, and measures of the Jackson Personality Inventory  (Pederson & Lefcoe, 1976) . Based on retrospective interviews given 6 to 12 months after cessation, two studies suggest a variety of cognitive and behavioral techniques used by self-quitters to achieve and maintain cessation  (Pederson & Lefcoe, 1976 ; Hecht, Note 1).\n\nThe present study compared the processes of change used by individuals who quit through self-directed and therapy-directed procedures. The study employed a model of change developed by  Prochaska (1979)  in a comparative analysis of 18 therapy systems and a critical review of 300 therapy outcome studies. In addition to non-specific variables of expectation, attention, and the therapeutic relationship, this model assumes that systems of therapy can be represented by five basic processes of change *Requests for reprints should be addressed to Carlo C. DiClemente, Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, 1300 Morsund, Texas Medical Center, Houston, Texas 77030.\n\n(see Table  1 ). These processes are differentiated along two dimensions. The verbal/behavior dimension categorizes change processes according to their primary mode of application: i.e., therapies which rely on verbal interaction or those which rely on behavioral manipulation. The experiential/environmental dimension categorizes each change-process as operating either at the level of the individual's experience (A) or at the level of his/her environment (B). A Change-Process Questionnaire for smoking cessation was developed from this model and became the central measurement device for the present study.\n\nThe processes of change were assumed to be related to a temporal dimension of stages of change. Horn (1972 Horn ( , 1976) )    The more I became aware of the reasons I smoke, the more I was able to quit.\n\nThe educational campaigns about smoking really enlightened me and this information was an important element in my quitting.\n\nI had a highly emotional experience that changed my thinking about cigarettes and helped me to quit. The feelings I had when I was watching or listening to advertisements and warnings about cigarette smoking reaIly moved me and helped me to change.\n\nIt was really a day-today commitment not to smoke and to stay away from cigarettes that helped me to quit smoking. The social movement to protect the rights of nonsmokers helped me to decide to quit.\n\nI found other ways besides smoking to relax and deal with the tension and nervousness that would get me to smoke.\n\nI got rid of a lot of things that reminded me of smoking, like putting away ashtrays, throwing out partially full packs of cigarettes and hiding other things that were cues to smoke for me.\n\nI congratulated myself for not smoking and told myself at the end of each day that I did not smoke how great it was that I could give up this habit. 1 got other people involved in my efforts to quit by betting with them, telling them I quit, having them remind me not to smoke so that they would reward me for not smoking and make it embarrassing for me to smoke.\n\nThis study addresses the following questions: were the experiences of the change processes different for self-changers and therapy subjects? If so, how did they differ? Do successful maintainers and recidivists employ the same change-processes? Do the processes of change relate to the stages of change in a particular pattern?"

All subjects had been 99% free of their former habit for at least two weeks. The one-percent leeway allowed for minor lapses while achieving abstinence. Subjects were interviewed within several weeks of quitting to insure that the experience would be recent and precede long-term change. Three types of subjects were recruited.\n\nSelf-quitters. These were 12 males and 17 females who had not attended any formal smoking-cessation program. They were recruited through flyers, advertisements, and a newspaper article. All volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were interviewed. At the time of the interview four volunteers were dropped because they had returned to smoking.\n\nAversion group. ,These were 11 males and 7 females who completed a $500 treatment-program that primarily used aversion procedures. One-hour individual sessions were completed on five consecutive days and consisted of smoke satiation, rapid smoking and mild electric shock paired with smoking. Eight optional follow-up sessions covered nutrition, weight control, relaxation techniques, goal achievement and smoking-related educational films. Research volunteers were recruited via flyers handed out at the end of treatment or at a follow-up meeting. Approximately 35 individuals were contacted and 21 volunteered for the study. Three volunteers were excluded at the time of the interview because they did not meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nBehavioral-munagement group. These were 6 males and 10 females who completed a commercial nine-week group-treatment program which cost $225. This program utilized educational and behavioral techniques including deconditioning, stimulus control, a decisional balance-sheet, group support and a buddy system, and a target quit-date five weeks into the program. Sessions were conducted by a graduate of the program. Subjects were recruited through flyers handed out at the final session of two such groups of approximately 20 participants each. Fourteen subjects volunteered from one group and two volunteered from the second group. The reason for the small number of volunteers from the second group was that the group leader did not allow the investigator to ask for volunteers until the graduation ceremony was over and the participants were on their way out of the room. All individuals who volunteered were interviewed and met the inclusion criteria,"

      "text": "A questionnaire was developed for this study to analyze the processes of change defined by the model. The items for the questionnaire were generated from statements reported by subjects in a pilot study who quit smoking recently. Three independent judges, advanced graduate students in psychology, classified a large group of these statements about smoking cessation according to conceptual definitions of the ten change processes  (DiClemente, 1978) . Only statements that were unanimously agreed upon to represent one and only one of the ten processes were selected to be included in the questionnaire. Thus, interrater reliability for the items included in the questionnaire was 100% and supported the face validity of the questionnaire. Although, the size and nature of the sample in this study did not allow for a more extensive analysis of the reliability and validity of the questionnaire, initial results from a three year longitudinal study using an expanded version of the questionnaire demonstrated extremely good reliability and substantial support for the validity of the structure of the questionnaire.'\n\nTable  1  presents a representative item for each of the processes. The Change-Process Questionnaire included three statements representing each of the ten change-processes. Subjects rated each statement on a scale of one (not important at all) to five (extremely important) signifying its importance in quitting smoking. Subjects also indicated in which of the following time periods the experience was most helpful: (1) Decision to Quit (the time from their decision to quit prior to the first efforts to quit); (2) Active Change (the time of their first efforts to quit to two weeks after their last cigarette); (3) Maintenance (the time from two weeks after their last cigarette until the time of the first interview)."

All subjects were asked to rate the difficulty staying off cigarettes and their current desire to smoke on a five-point scale. They also reported their current smoking habit, the number of cigarettes smoked since the quit-date, weight gain and perceived advantages and disadvantages of quitting. Successful maintainers were asked about the chief factors in their success and recidivists the factors in their failure to maintain. PROCEDURE At the initial interview subjects were asked open-ended questions about their quitting which were used for an analysis of the change-process model and reported on elsewhere  (DiClemente, 1978) . The Change-Process Questionnaire was then verbally administered and the subjects' responses were recorded on tape. These responses were accumulated for future refinements of the questionnaire. Subjects were asked to rate each statement both for importance and for its relationship to one or more periods of change. Finally, the subjects completed the Demographic and Smoking History Questionnaire and were told that they would be contacted in four to six months. The entire initial interview lasted approximately 45 minutes. Five months after their quitting, all subjects were interviewed by phone using the standard follow-up interview question-'An expanded version of this questionnaire is currently being employed in a large-scale, longitudinal study of the self-change of smoking behavior. A principal component analysis of the responses of 463 subjects recovered the structure of the change process questionnaire with some minor changes yielding 10 independent factors.

Generally, subjects were middle-aged (M = 35 years, SD = 11 .f$, had attended college, had predominantly white-collar jobs and were in the mid-to-upper-level of socio-economic status. Subjects began smoking regularly as teenagers (M = 17 years, SD = 2.6), had smoked over a pack and a half of cigarettes per day (M = 33 cigarettes, SD = 15) prior to this attempt to quit, and had made at least two previous attempts to quit. The elapsed time between the quit-date and the initial interview of this study averaged four weeks and was not significantly different for the three groups. The distribution of males and females among the three groups was not significantly different (Chi-Square (2) = 2.37, ns).\n\nThe significant (JJ < .Ol) differences that did emerge from the Neuman-Keuls analyses were all attributable to the Behavioral-Management Group. Behavioral-Management subjects were older (M = 42 years, SD = 11.6). They also spent more years smoking cigarettes (M = 25 years, SD = 11) than either of the other groups = 18 years SD = 12 for the Aversion Group and M = 15, SD = 10 for the Selfgitters) and prior to this attempt had successfully quit smoking for a shorter period of time (one month) than either of the other two groups of subjects (3 to 6 months). Behavioral-Management subjects demonstrated a greater investment of time in the smoking habit suggesting that they may have been the most dependent subjects among the total group of subjects.\n\nAlthough the subjects were not representative of the general population of smokers, they appeared to represent a population of heavy smokers with a firmly established habit.

The type of cessation procedure the subject underwent and the demographics of the subjects did not relate to successful maintenance of smoking cessation. The only significant differences between long-term successes and recidivists appeared in retrospective assessments made by the subjects at the follow-up interview. Successful maintainers reported significantly greater weight gain averaging from 5 to 12 pounds than the recidivists who averaged a one-to four-pound gain (p c .05). Recidivists, on the other hand, reported more difficulty staying off cigarettes and a more intense desire to smoke (p < .005). In response to the open-ended questions concerning what helped or hindered maintenance, recidivists mentioned personal problems, inconsistency in maintaining either exercise or some health-related physical activity, a belief that the habit was under control, the experience of missing the smoking habit and job-related tension as the central factors that led to recidivism. Successful maintainers reported self-statements reinforcing their quitting smoking, physical exercise and deep breathing as substitutes for some aspect of the smoking habit, avoiding people and situations that were cues to smoke, a firm commitment and social support or pressure as important elements contributing to their success. A separate 2 x 3 analysis of variance was performed for each of the ten change processes using change-process scores as the dependent variable and group membership and long-term success as the independent variables. There were no significant differences in change-process scores for the comparisons between successful maintainers and recidivists. Moreover, no significant interaction effects were found between group and success variables. Group differences on the five change-processes already mentioned above accounted for all significant differences. Thus, although the change-process scores discriminated among the three groups of subjects, they did not relate to successful maintenance of smoking cessation."

      "title": "Periods-of-change analysis",
      "text": "While completing the Change Process Questionnaire, if subjects rated a statement as in any way important in their quitting, they were asked to identify in which period or periods of change the experience was most helpful. A contingency table was constructed from the frequencies in order to examine the relationship between the ten change processes and the three periods of change (see Table  3 ).\n\nThe overall chi square was significant x2 (18) = 324.45, p < .OOl, indicating that a relationship exists. Although not as well known as the corresponding procedure for ANOVA tables, contingency tables may be partitioned into additive components  (Maxwell, 1961) . This procedure is particularly appropriate when an a priori basis exists for the partitioning. In this case, the theoretical model underlying the Change Process Questionnaire suggested the partitioning based on a comparison of Verbal Processes and Behavioral Processes. A significant difference existed between the Verbal Processes and the Behavioral Processes x2 (2) = 240.79, p C .OOl. The comparison between the six Verbal Processes was also significant, x2 (10) = 71.14, p < .OOl, while the comparison between the Behavioral Processes was not, x1 (6) = 11.86, p > .05.\n\nAn additional analysis was performed to investigate the significant difference between the six verbal processes. This was an exploratory analysis suggested by an examination of the data. The overall Verbal Processes table was partitioned to compare Self-Liberation to the five other Verbal Processes. The comparison between Self-Liberation and the other Verbal Processes was significant, x2 (2) = 60.97, p c .OOl, while the comparison between the other five Verbal Processes was not, x1 (8) = 10.57, p > .Ol.\n\nAn explanation of the frequencies suggests that the Verbal Processes tend to be employed much more frequently in the first, or Decision to Quit, stage. The Behaviora Processes are employed more frequently in the last two stages, the Active Change Period and the Maintenance Period. The only exception to this was the Self-Liberation  Process, theoretically classed as one of the Verbal Processes, which tended to be most frequently employed in the last two stages like the Behavioral Processes. It should also be noted that the Maintenance Period received fewer endorsements overall. One reason for this may have been that many subjects had just begun this period and may have had some difficulty assessing it separately from the preceding periods of change."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The study of self-change and therapy-change subjects yielded several important findings. Self-Quitters differed significantly from therapy subjects on the importance given to five of the ten processes of change. Self-Quitters were as successful as the formalized treatment group in maintaining cessation at the five-month follow-up. Maintainers did not differ significantly from recidivists on the processes of change that were emphasized in producing change. In general, the Verbal Processes of change were significantly more important during the Decision Stage, while the Behavioral Processes were most important during the Active Change and Maintenance Stages.\n\nWhile provocative, these findings may be limited by reliance on self-reports. The fact that the experimenters were unrelated to the subjects' treatment was assumed to lessen some biases of self-report. Nevertheless, future studies need to validate smoking status with more objective measures. Self-reports for assessing the processes of change that subjects emphasize are appropriate, though limited, means for beginning process research. The reliance on available volunteers, though difficult to avoid, may result in selection biases that could systematically affect the findings.\n\nGiven such qualifications, the present study still provides an interesting perspective on self-changers. The self-changers appeared to have been as entrenched in their smoking habit as the therapy-change subjects. On the average, each group began smoking as teenagers, had smoked for over 15 years and had tried to quit at least twice previously.\n\nSelf-change cannot be accounted for by the type or intensity of the smoking habit or the previous success or failure of the individual. Why some individuals go to therapy programs for smoking cessation rather than quitting on their own continues to be an intriguing question. It is especially intriguing, since at five month followup self-quitters were able to maintain cessation of smoking as well as the subject who attended expensive, sophisticated treatments. As expected, the change process model was effective in differentiating the three treatment groups on the importance of particular processes, Self-Quitters rated Feedback, Stimulus Control and Social Management as significantly less important in quitting than did the therapy groups. This finding supports the validity of the questionnaire since it is consistent with the fact that self-quitters did not have available to them group feedback and reinforcement or instructions on behavioral techniques as did the therapy subjects. The Commitment Process of self-liberation was given the highest rating of importance by self-quitters and yet it has received the least attention in the therapeutic research literature  (Prochaska, 1979) . Inadequate attention to the process of Self-Liberation may partially explain why self-change remains a difficult phenomenon to explain.\n\nThe Behavioral-Management subjects rated Counterconditioning as most important and more important than the other two groups. The finding is consistent with the emphasis that behavioral treatments place on Counterconditioning as an effective alternative for managing stress and anxiety. The ability to manage stress and anxiety may also have been especially important for this group of subjects since they had spent more time smoking and could be considered more dependent on the habit. The fact that the Aversion subjects rated Self-Liberation as most important in their success is puzzling, since aversion techniques are generally viewed as Counterconditioning and Social Management processes. It is possible that the large financial commitment and the ordeal of undergoing unpleasant procedures either reflected or increased the personal commitment of these subjects.\n\nContrary to expectation, there were no significant differences between the maintainers and recidivists on any of the change-processes. The expectation in this study was based on the common assumption that if change processes are powerful enough to produce change they should be powerful enough to maintain change. While it is possible that the model and/or the questionnaire did not identify the initial variables of cessation that relate to maintenance, the most direct interpretation suggests that there may be no intrinsic relationship between the processes involved in short-term cessation and the processes of long-term maintenance. This interpretation is consistent with  Marlatt and Gordon's (1979)  view of maintenance as a separate treatment entity and Bandura's construct self-efficacy as a separate mediator of maintenance  (Bandura, 1977; DiClemente, 1981) . Many treatments have been able to produce short-term smoking cessation but have difficulty with long-term maintenance. The maintainers in this study reported that self-statements about smoking, physical activity, and active control over smoking related events were especially important in maintaining abstinence. Maintenance may not be maintenance after all but may really be continued change.\n\nThe idea that maintenance is continued change received further support from the data on periods of change. Subjects reported that different processes were important at different times in the course of changing. Verbal processes were more important when the decision to change was being made. Behavioral processes were more important in the Active Change stage and in the initial phase of Maintenance. The exception to this pattern was that Self-Liberation was associated more with Active Change, as if personal commitment is not realized until action is taken. By integrating processes of change along a time dimension of periods of change, a more comprehensive model may be developed in which verbal and behavioral approaches both contribute to successful change. The verbal processes may be most important in preparing individuals for action, while the behavioral processes become more important once individuals have committed themselves to act."
