  "title": "What is User Engagement? A Conceptual Framework for Defining User Engagement with Technology",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement a term not defined consistently in past work as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "In the past few decades, human-computer interaction studies have emphasized the need to move beyond usability to understand and design for more engaging experiences  (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006; Jacques, Preece, & Carey, 1995; Laurel, 1993) . A Web interface that is boring, a multimedia presentation that does not captivate users' attention, or an online forum that fails to engender a sense of community are quickly dismissed with a simple mouse click. Failing to engage users equates with no sale on an electronic commerce site and no transmission of information from a Web site; people go elsewhere to perform their tasks and communicate with colleagues and friends. Successful technologies are not just usable; they engage users. Despite the need to engage users and create engaging technologies, there is no agreed upon definition of the construct. Chapman (1997)  stated emphasizes playfulness and sensory integration in engagement, which she also refers -  (2003)  proposed that engagement is a dimension of usability, and is influenced by users' first impression of an application and the enjoyment they derive from using it. Multiple studies of engagement have described it according to different characteristics, such as media presentation, perceived user control, choice, challenge, feedback, and variety  (Jacques et al., 1995; Said, 2004; Webster & Ho, 1997; Chapman, 1997; Chapman, Selvarajah, & Webster, 1999) . Cumulatively, these attributes demonstrate the physical, cognitive, and affective components of user experiences.\n\nThe objective of this study is to develop an operational definition of engagement and to identify the key components that make up engagement. To do so, we first reviewed and analyzed previous research on engagement, including its use in various application areas and its relationship to other established theories of human-computer interaction. Next we conducted an exploratory study of first-person accounts of engagement with four computer applications: online shopping, Web searching, Webcasting, and video games. We conclude with a model of user engagement."

For learning to take place, multimedia presentations should engage their audiences  (Webster & Ho, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995)  and educators should critically engage students with technology in the applications. The fervor of discussion about engagement suggests that engaging interactions are sought after by both users and developers of computer systems and applications. Just as we have worked to identify users' perceptions, actions, and attitudes about how to make a system functional and intuitive to use, we must concentrate on understanding how to make systems more engaging. Given the increased emphasis on user experience, it is no longer sufficient to ensure that a system is merely usable  (Blythe, Overbeeke, Monk, & Wright, 2003) ."

      "title": "Theoretical Underpinnings",
      "text": "Prior research has suggested that engagement consists of users' activities, attitudes,  (Kappelman, 1995) , goals and mental models, and motor skills  (Said, 2004) , and that it manifests itself in the form of attention, intrinsic interest, curiosity, and motivation  (Chapman, 1997) . Jacques et al. (1995)  looked at a limited number of cognitive and affective variables in relation to the format and display of a specific multimedia system. Said's approach was based on children's interactions with video games, and Chapman's research examined university students' reactions to presentation software. Thus existing frameworks are based on research conducted in specific domains and with particular user groups and applications, with little or no attempt to generalize beyond the individual work and without theoretical foundations to support that work. The exception to this is Chapman and colleagues  (Chapman, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999)  who related engagement to flow theory  (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) . In addition to flow theory, other theories emerged from our analysis of previous research of user experiences in humancomputer interaction: aesthetic theory  (Beardsley, 1982)  play theory  (Stephenson, 1967) , and information interaction  (Toms, 2002) . We examine all of these theories flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction to inform our understanding of user experiences. seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great  mihalyi, 1990, p. 4) . Flow theory has been used to explore situational and personality variables associated with computer-based tasks  (Woszczynski, Roth, & Segars, 2002) , to predict and design for flow experiences  (Finneran & Zhang, 2003) , and to understand users' reactions to and motivations for using applications  (Ghani & Deshpande, 1994; Konradt & Sulz, 2001) . Engagement has that engagement may share some attributes with flow, such as focused attention, feedback, control, activity orientation (i.e., interactivity), and intrinsic motivation  (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) . Previous studies indicate that engagement consists of system feedback, user control  (Brown & Cairns, 2004) , attention, motivation  (Chapman, 1997) , and the ability of the system to challenge individuals at levels appropriate to their knowledge and skills  (Skelly, Fries, Linnett, Nass, & Reeves, 1994) . Despite the common threads between engagement and flow, we propose that there are differences. Specifically, flow involves intrinsic motivation, yet engaging experiences may come about as well during the nonvoluntary use of a system. Further, flow requires sustained, long-term focus and loss of awareness of the outside world; engagement should still occur in the midst of today's multitasking and dynamic computer environments. Jennings (2000)  suggested that aesthetic experiences are intrinsically motivating, require focused attention, stimulate curiosity, and are interesting and pleasurable. Some of these attributes, including interest, as well as aesthetics itself, have been associated with engagement  (Chapman, 1997) . Aesthetics is the visual appearance of the interface as it conforms to design principles  (i.e., symmetry, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, rhythm, and unity; Beardsley, 1982) . Aesthetic theory has been applied by software developers in interface design  (Skelly et al., 1994; Lavie & Tractinsky, 2004) . Aesthetics has been linked to usability and users' skills and needs, as well as to the sensory aspects or format of the application  (Laurel, 1993; Hummels, 2000 , as cited in Overbeeke, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, Wensveen, & Frens, 2003) . As a result, aesthetics is important to engagement, but clearly is only one aspect of engagement.\n\nPlay is the physical activity that encourages learning and creativity, develops and satisfies psychological and social needs, and involves aspects of competition and collaboration  (Rieber, 1996) . Play has also been associated with having an experience, such as news reading  (Stephenson, 1967)  and browsing  (Toms, 1998; 2000) , and has recently been examined in the context of educational technologies  (Rieber, 1996; Said, 2004) , video games  (Pausch, Gold, Skelly, & Thiel, 1994) , and decision making on the Web  (Atkinson & Kydd, 1997) . Play has been associated with increased frequency and satisfaction of system use  (Atkinson & Kydd) , and has been attributed to increased motivation, challenge, and affect  (Woszczynski et al., 2002) . Thus elements of play are intrinsic to engagement.\n\nInteraction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer interface  (Schneiderman, 1997) , where the interface is the medium enabling user experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e., the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses;  Shedroff, 1994) . Information interaction is  (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ) . For the user, this sequence of events or activities occurs when people use systems  (Wright, McCarthy, & Meekison, 2003)  and is contingent upon attributes of the user (e.g., motivations, expectations), system (e.g., usability), and contextual or environmental (e.g., organizational culture) characteri-stics  (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006) , in addition to task  (Marchionini, 1995)  and content  (Toms, 2002) . Information interaction provides the connectivity for engagement. The computer system may be aesthetically appealing with design elements that promote play. The user may be susceptible to the state of flow. However, it is the interaction between users and systems operating within a specific context that facilitates an engaging experience.\n\nTable  1  maps the characteristics that emerge from the literature for flow, aesthetics, play, and information interaction theories. In the final column, we hypothesize which of these attributes may be intrinsic to engagement. Concurrent with these theories, an engaging experience is encouraged by the sensory appeal of the system and the level of feedback and challenge the user receives from the system. Engaged users are affectively involved, motivated, and perceive themselves to be in control over the interaction. However, there are other characteristics inherent in flow, play, aesthetic, and information interaction theories that are unlikely to be present in engagement. Engaging experiences have the attention of the user, but, unlike experiences in flow and aesthetic theories, do not require users to become so focused that they lose their awareness of physical reality. In contrast to flow and play, engagement may not be dependent on the user forming specific goals for the interaction. Users may use an application without any specific purpose or desirable outcome and have an engaging experience. While information interaction focuses on the user experience with content, engagement is an expression of that interactivity. While some of the other frameworks stress the meaningfulness of the experience (i.e., aesthetics and flow), an engaging experience may make a lasting impression but have no more meaning than that the experience was enjoyable or challenging.\n\nTABLE 1.

      "text": "Based on our exploration of these four theoretical frameworks and previous research on engagement, an understanding of engagement emerges. Like flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction, engagement builds upon the foundation of a usable system that is effective, efficient, and satisfying. The theoretical framework that informs engagement integrates system attributes (i.e., feedback, challenge, sensory appeal) with the affective propensities of the user. Thus engagement is conceptually a holistic framework for understanding the integration of user and system variables, and how they combine to push the boundaries of user experience from merely perfunctory to pleasurable and memorable."

      "title": "Application Areas",
      "text": "We chose to explore engagement in four application areas: online shopping, Web searching, educational Webcasting, and video games. Our rationale for this was that studies of engagement exist predominantly in education and video games, while there is sparse research about engagement in online shopping and Web searching. By looking at these four applications, we intended to confirm past findings in the areas of video gaming and education applications, and to see what the areas of Web searching and online shopping would contribute to the understanding of engagement.\n\nEducation researchers have emphasized that engagement should be a pleasurable experience that involves intellectual challenge or stimulation  (Douglas & Hargadon, 2000; Read, MacFarlane, & Casey, 2002) . Read, MacFarlane, and Casey observed children's facial expressions to identify instances of engagement and fun, and linked remembering enjoyable situations and intending to perform them again. In addition to fun, researchers have explored the impact of specific technologies, including educational multimedia  (Jacques et al., 1995) , presentation software  (Webster & Ho, 1997) , computer-based versus video-based training applications  (Chapman et al., 1999) , and film and hypertext  (Laarni, Ravaja, Kallinen, & Saari, 2004 ) on engagement. The characteristics of engaging systems that emerge from these studies have included ease of use, aesthetic appeal, and choice  (Jacques et al.) ; feedback, challenge, and variety  (Webster & Ho) ; interactivity  (Chapman et al.; Laarni et al.) ; and sensory appeal through the use of different multimedia components including text, graphics, and sound  (Laarni, et al.) .\n\nA number of these same attributes (e.g., feedback, intrinsic motivation, fun, user control, and interactivity) have been studied in video games  (Carroll & Thomas, 1988; Vorderer, Hartmann, & Klimmt, 2003; Choi & Kim, 2004) . Said (2004)  varied the amount of control participants had over a video game, i.e., some children took on the role of characters, some manipulated the characters' world, and others watched the game unfold without being able to intervene. Results indicated that immediate feedback from the system, well-defined goals, prior experience, and increasing challenge in proportion to gameplaying skills were essential attributes of engagement. Physiological arousal  (Ravaja et al., 2004) , as well as players' sense of social presence  (Champion, 2003)  and sensation seeking  (Ravaja et al.) , were all factors of engagement with video games.\n\nEngagement has rarely been examined in online shopping and search applications. However, given the role of affect in both of these contexts (see, e.g.,  Nahl & Bilal, 2007; Arnold & Reynolds, 2003) , we can extrapolate that engagement in these areas will be not only purposeful but pleasurable, and that this emotional component will make people more likely to return to a specific product or company Web site  (Webster & Ahuja, 2004) . Qualities of Web sites, such as novelty  (Toms, 1998; 2000)  and aesthetics  (Lavie & Tractinsky, 2004; Skelly et al., 1994) , as well as feedback, navigability, control, and interactivity  (Huang, 2003) , have demonstrated that users' needs for both information and entertainment must be satisfied when it comes to engaging searching and shopping experiences. Poor Web site design and usability may Web searching is hampered by a Web site's poor navigational structure, users are left feeling disoriented and frustrated  (Atkinson & Kydd, 1997; Webster & Ahuja, 2004) , and that they lack control over the interaction  (Rozell & Gardner, 2000) .\n\nAn examination of these application areas reveals what qualities of video games and educational applications make for an engaging experience; studies in the areas of usability and user affect suggest what factors will predict engagement in searching and online shopping environments. Table  2  summarizes the attributes of engagement that emerge from reviewing research in the areas of education, video games, online shopping, and searching. Of note is that some of these characteristics differ from the earlier theoretical discussion (compare Tables  1  and  2 ). Our definition of an engagement attribute is a characteristic of the user-computer interaction that influences or is a component of the engagement. Engagement attributes are products of users' interactions with the technology, since they depend on what the user finds innately compelling. Previous research across the four applications areas suggests that challenge, pleasure, endurability, attention, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control are attributes of engagement. We predict that an engaging experience is characterized by these attributes.\n\nTABLE 2. Attributes of engagement suggested by previous research in four areas of application. Applications Attributes of Video Educational Online Web engagement games applications shopping searching Aesthetics appeal a Attention a Challenge a Endurability Feedback a Interactivity Perceived user control a Pleasure b Sensory appeal a Variety/Novelty a Indicates that these attributes also appear in Table 1 as characteristics of flow, aesthetic, play,and information interaction theories. b"

      "title": "METHODOLOGY",
      "text": "There are a variety of methods that we might have employed to study this construct, including surveys, participant observation, and so forth. However, due to the exploratory nature of our research, we could not be confident in creating questionnaire items or classifying observed behaviors. Nor could we be certain that studying this phenomenon while participants were actively engaged would not interfere with their experiences. In addition, it was our belief that there is more to engagement than we could garner by studying the activity itself.\n\nWe concluded that conducting semistructured interviews was the best method, because it enabled us to delve into the thoughts, behaviors, and feelings of our participants and to allow them to recount a real-life experience. A drawback to this methodology is that  Wright, 2004) , a conclusion reached by  Ericsson and Simon (1993)  in their analysis of retrospective verbal protocols. As such, it may be biased by users' reflections of events as they relate to other experiences; some details may be withheld or changed since this method relies on accurate recall and depends on what participants deem important or memorable. On the other hand, if an experience was truly memorable, then participants likely remember the details of the experience. Ericsson and Simon further acknowledged that situations of intense cognitive activity, such as that required for the applications we were investigating, tend not to produce useful data when done concurrently with real-time data collection in the form of think-alouds. Given the methodological research in this area, the method we chose was the best given this set of circumstances. Thus, we acknowledge that our interview data is part recall and part interpretation on the part of our participants, but we believe that participants' reflections of their experiences communicate memorable information about the nature of their engagement."

Recruitment notices were sent via listservs that solicited interviewees who were online shoppers, searchers, video game players, and distance learners of a specific webcast application. Thus, this was a purposive sample with individuals chosen on the basis of their interaction with the applications of interest to this study. Recruitment continued until the researchers felt there were no new ideas emerging from the interviews  (Oppenheim, 1992) . Our intention was not to saturate each application area, but to examine engagement in general using a variety of applications.\n\nAs a group, the 10 females and 7 males were educated and technologically savvy. All used e-mail on a daily basis and searched the Web daily (95%) or weekly (5%). All had a high school diploma; 88% had some undergraduate education, and 30% held college diplomas; 71% had completed or were currently enrolled in a masters program. Fortyone percent were currently students. Most of the participants were under age 35 (n = 13), while the remainder were between 36 and 45 (n = 3) and over 55 (n = 1)."

Based upon our conjecture that engagement is a quality of user experience, we used McCarthy and  Wright's (2004)  framework for interpreting our results. The four threads of experience are (a) compositional (i.e., beginning, middle, and end); (b) spatiotemporal (i.e., the subtasks being performed as part of participants' application use, such as searching, browsing, comparing information, and communicating with others, as well as their awareness of themselves and their environments, and characteristics of the technology); (c) emotional, (e.g., pleasure, fatigue); (d) sensual (i.e., cognitive [e.g., problem solving], and behavioral [e.g., interactivity] components of the experience). The interview was designed to elicit participants' reactions to each of these components of experience.\n\nSpecifically we asked them to recount their affective responses, sensory impressions of their environments and the interface, and perceptions of how much time they spent on the computer-based activity. In accordance with the compositional thread, we allowed our participants to tell us a story.\n\nThe same interview questions were used for all applications, with slight modifications made to reflect the specific application. For example, one question for online shopping uestions were included throughout the protocol, but were used only if participants had difficulty articulating the experience. The interview ended when all of these semistructured questions had been addressed. The order of the questions was allowed to vary so that the interview flowed more like a conversation between the participant and the researcher."

      "text": "We practiced theoretical sampling in that we decided to interview users of four different applications. Our goal was to generate a strong theoretical foundation for the construct of engagement; as such our coding scheme was theoretically sensitive and concerned with validating or refuting past research. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a qualitative software package, Qualrus. Fifty-two codes (see Appendix B) were generated from the data using Strauss' grounded theory, which is systematic in its approach  (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) . As such, we acknowledge that we approached the data with preconceived ideas based on our review of the research, and that our reading of previous research may have influenced some of our coding categories.\n\nThe interview transcripts went through five iterative examinations. We used McCarthy and  Wright's (2004)  threads of experience to organize the data. The first pass through the data focused on emotional representations in the data and incidences of positive, negative, or neutral affect. The sensual thread examined the qualities of the system, such as its appearance and the interactivity of the technology. Lastly, the spatiotemporal thread described what the participant was doing (e.g., browsing, comparing products, etc.) and their perceptions and awareness of their physical environments. The compositional thread was woven around these other threads and identified the beginning, middle, and end of the experience. In addition, we also coded the data for the attributes of engagement suggested by previous research, and for the new attributes that emerged in this analysis.\n\nThe coded segments were subjected to interrater reliability by an independent coder. The coder was provided with the complete list of codes and their definitions, as well as the interviews. The coder was asked to apply the codes to all of the interviews, or to create new codes if none were appropriate. Once this was complete, the primary researcher compared the codes assigned by the coder with her own, noting discrepancies in the assignment of codes and any new codes that the independent coder had created. The researcher then met with the independent coder to discuss the analyses, focusing on the missed and disputed codes. The result of this process was a 92% agreement. For the coded segments in which an agreement was not reached between the researcher and the independent coder, the second researcher was asked to weigh in."

The source of interruptions was from environmental factors, such as a kitchen timer going off, e-mail alerts, or other people who were sometimes there in person.

Disengagement was also brought about by technological issues. A webcast viewer stated that broadcasts couple of it, but at the same time it doesn't offer anything new.

Online shoppers talked about the importance of viewing products from multiple perspectives (P12), while graphics were also essential to video gamers for evoking realism in the game (P5, P9). Searchers and webcast viewers focused their attention on the salient attributes of the interface (P6, P17). For example, presentation materials were deemed more engaging if cases. visual incorporated other media such as videos. The auditory aspects of video games, such as gamers.\n\nInteractivity was also part of the engagement. Video game players customized features whether as a member of a war campaign in a strategy game, or as a race car driver. Another gamer described playing a simulation game in which she created characters and their environments and manipulated both of these through game play. The many features of the webcast interface video, presentation slides, and chat failed to engage some of the webcast viewers (P15, P16). One participant wanted to be able to manipulate the size and placement of the features, which were fixed (P15); another commented part due to the time lapse in communication tools that prevented truly synchronous feedback between the learners and the speaker. Thus, for the webcast viewers, some of the interaction was of a social nature. Lastly, Web users experienced interactivity in their ability to select information. Shoppers talked about zooming in on and rotating products (P10).\n\nIn summary, interviewees' visual, auditory, and tactile senses were engaged during their interactions with the applications.

      "title": "A PROPOSED MODEL OF ENGAGEMENT",
      "text": "The outcome of this exploratory study is the identification of four distinct stages of engagement and the attributes that characterize each stage. The point of engagement is initiated by the aesthetic appeal or novel presentation of the interface, the users' motivations and interests, and users' ability and desire to be situated in the interaction and to perceive that there is sufficient time to use the application. Engagement is sustained when users are able to maintain their attention and interest in the application, and is characterized by positive emotions. Users want to customize the interface to meet their needs and receive appropriate and timely feedback from the application. In addition, they want to lose their perception of time and others during some interactions, but keep their awareness of others in cases where engagement is enhanced by social interaction. Users disengage for many reasons such as the usability of the technology (i.e., challenge and interactivity), and distractions in their environments. This stage, depending on the outcome, resulted in either positive or negative emotions. Figure  1  illustrates the model."

    {
      "title": "FIGURE 1. Proposed model of engagement and its attributes.",
      "text": "The fact that our participants were not always engaged, and that they described disengaging and reengaging in the same session, indicates that a single session contains a range of engaging experiences that vary in intensity. Users may be engaged or not engaged, but engagement itself operates on a continuum. In this way it is similar to the construct of usability in that it may be poor, average, or high.\n\nThe point of engagement may occur at any point during the interaction when users delve beyond the mechanistic or routine level  (Norman, Ortony, & Russel, 2003)  and invest themselves in the interaction. We propose that, at this stage, the interface must present information in a novel or aesthetically pleasing way in order to capture users' motivation and interest and situate them in the interaction.\n\nOur research suggests that once engaged, users' attention and interest must be maintained. Users must be made to feel part of the interaction through an awareness of what the system is doing (feedback) and feeling connected to the technology (interactivity) or to other people (social awareness), and in control over what is happening. The richness of the application generates positive emotions in users. A representation of attributes during this stage is depicted in Figure  1  to convey the dynamic interaction that is taking place during this period. The intensity of these attributes may vary depending on the users' expectations of and experience with the technology, the type of interaction, and the nature of the technology itself.\n\nd, or to stop using the system altogether. In this case the user slips back into a mechanistic interaction with the system, devoid of affective or cognitive stimulation. Disengagement is associated with positive emotions (users' needs and motivations are satisfied and they feel successful) or with negative feelings of frustration, uncertainty, being overwhelmed by challenges or information, loss of interest or motivation, and lack of novelty or challenge.\n\nUsers may cycle through the stages of engagement several times during a single session; thus reengagement is intrinsic to the model. Reengagement may be shortterm. During Web searching, a user may engage with a particular page, disengage, and then return to the same or a different page. Web searching illustrates that engagement may continue with a topic, but not with a website; likewise, a website may be so engaging that the user abandons their original task. Reengagement may also be longterm, for example, when a search is extended over time.\n\nPrevious frameworks of engagement have emphasized what users are doing and thinking (e.g.,  Said, 2004)  or feeling  (Kappelman, 1995) . The first contribution of our model is that it is holistic and presents the behaviors, cognitions, and emotions of users in the context of content, design, and interactive features of the application. In addition, engagement has not been explicitly identified as a process. Chapman (1997)  examined which may equate with our point of engagement stage but most researchers have not articulated engagement as having a beginning, middle, and end, nor what attributes might characterize each of these stages. The idea of reengagement that may occur during the same session with an application or at a future time is novel. The second contribution of this model is that we have linked attributes of engagement to each stage of the process. We have considered all of the disparate engagement attributes, and we have identified which attributes are most significant to particular stages of the engagement process."

Using flow, aesthetic, play and information interaction theories as our foundation, we discovered that the attributes of engagement challenge, affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, perceived control, and interactivity are products of the user-system interaction. Previous work suggested that challenge, pleasure, endurability, attention, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, variety/novelty, interest, interactivity, and perceived user control were attributes of engagement. We confirmed the presence of these attributes in the engagement process. In addition, we discovered that awareness of others and one's environment, and perception of time, were also part of engaging experiences. Thus, we have expanded our original definition of engagement to include these additional attributes:\n\nEngagement is a quality of user experiences with technology that is characterized by challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect.\n\nIn the midst of conceptually and operationally defining engagement, we have articulated a process model of engagement."

      "title": "Process Model of Engagement",
      "text": "The experience threads, in particular the compositional thread, clearly delineated a systematic process that depicts engaging experiences. Engagement consists of a point of engagement, a period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and (possibly) reengagement. In prior research, engagement was associated with a variety of attributes: feedback, control, focused attention, motivation, challenge, aesthetic and affective appeal, and novelty  (Jacques et al., 1995; Said, 2004; Webster & Ho, 1997; Chapman, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999) . Previous models of engagement have viewed engagement as a process (defined as a task) or product of information-system development  (Kappelman, 1995) , rather than a quality of users' experience with technology. Chapman (1997)  investigated engagement influences and outcomes, but his results are limited to a specific educational software package and user group. In addition, he concluded that some of the measurement items could have been improved in order to ensure that they measured what they were intended to (p. 123). In addition, both  Kappelman (1995)  and  Chapman (1997)  look at dimensions of engagement (i.e., product versus task, influences versus outcomes), but they do not define engagement as a process with a beginning, middle, and end, or state that there is an iterative component to engagement.\n\nParticipants indicated that interest in and attention to the content and aesthetics of the computer application were present during the point of engagement, and that they typically had a goal (sometimes well-defined, sometimes social, and sometimes to have an experience) in mind when initiating an interaction with a computer application. Goal setting was put forward by  Said (2004)  as an untapped variable to consider for engagement. Whereas this study identified interest, attention, motivation, and aesthetics as attributes at the point of engagement,  Chapman (1997)  found that feedback and control were influences on engagement. These latter variables were more prominent in this study during the engagement phase. The experience of being engaged was perpetuated by the interactivity of the computer environment sometimes physical, social, or cognitive and the usability of the interface as they matched the users' attention, motivation, interest, and need for aesthetic and sensory appeal, novelty, control, and challenge. Like  Said (2004) , we found behavioral and cognitive manifestations of engagement during this phase, as demonstrated in users' appraisals of the challenge, novelty, and control afforded to them by the system, and their actions, mediated by the system's ability to provide feedback and customization options. However, we also saw the role of affect in positive and negative emotions, a finding similar to  Kappelman (1995) , who identified attitude as a major component of his product/process matrix of system involvement. However, unlike Kappelman, our interest was in engagement as an experience; he studied it as an outcome of participants' level of involvement in software development.\n\nInterviewees disengaged for internal reasons that were physiological or based on time pressures and their inner voices to move on to other activities. External reasons for disengaging included interruptions in the environment and technology issues. During this phase, there was a mixture of positive and negative emotions expressed; at the same time, some participants mentioned that their emotions were dependent upon the situation and influenced by the interaction.\n\nOriginal to this study is the concept of reengagement. Participants described reengagement as both a short-term and long-term activity. Short-term reengagements were precipitated by interviewees' decisions to pause the activity to attend to other needs or stretch the task out over time, and by the technology or environmental factors disengaging them before they were ready. With regard to reengagement, attributes such as convenience and ease of use, the need for information, and novelty were most salient. Users returned to the application because they had past success with it, or it offered them something new (a product or an experience) that could not be obtained elsewhere, and was able to provide adequate levels of control, challenge, and feedback to ensure interviewees were neither bored nor frustrated. Overall, positive experiences influenced participants' likelihood of returning to an application  (Rozell & Gardner, 2000; Webster & Ahuja, 2004) .\n\nParticipants described several factors that prevented engagement from taking place, or caused their engagement to lapse; nonengagement has not been addressed in previous studies. These included the inability of the online experience to emulate a real-life encounter, technology issues such as information overload and pop-ups, communication tools that delayed feedback, and being required to multitask or manage interruptions. Although  Webster and Ho (1997)  found evidence for higher levels of engagement with more interactive applications, the amount of interactivity was not indicative of engagement in this study. Rather, it was the quality and appropriateness of the interactivity to the user's task that precipitated engagement. This is supported by  Jacques et al. (1995) , who found that students' preferences for visual-or text-based educational multimedia depended on the task they needed to perform, and by  Skelly et al. (1994) , who warned that more interface features and choices do not necessarily lead to engagement.\n\nOverall, when engagement occurred, participants described cycling through a dynamic process of initiating and sustaining their engagement until internal or external circumstances disengaged them. However, they often experienced multiple engaging episodes during the same session, or returned to the application in subsequent sessions. This likelihood of return is a strong predictor of systems success  (DeLone & McLean, 1992) , and likely of whether systems are engaging."

      "title": "Attributes of engagement.",
      "text": "Central to this research was identifying the attributes of engagement. Interwoven throughout the engagement process were a variety of attributes: attention, novelty, interest, control, feedback, and challenge. In addition, we found evidence for emotional (affect and motivation), sensory (aesthetics and interactivity), and spatiotemporal (perception of time, and self-and external awareness) threads of experience. These findings both confirm and dispute previous research. We found evidence for more attributes during the engagement phase than Webster and colleagues  (Webster & Ahuja, 2004; Webster & Ho, 1997)  and  Jacques et al. (1995) , who concluded that engagement was composed of three elements: attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest. Skelly et al. (1994)  suggested that engaging experiences were comprised of curiosity, feedback, and challenge, while  Webster and Ho (1997)  concluded that feedback, challenge, and novelty, but not perceived control were attributes of engaging presentation software. However, we found evidence to suggest that users do need to perceive they are in control of the interaction (see, e.g.,  Said, 2004) , though some of our participants were comfortable with some unpredictability, which likely is applicationspecific.\n\nOur findings are inline with other research that has emphasised self-directed, meaningful involvement with materials or applications based on cognitive challenge and motivation  (Kearsley & Schneiderman, 1999)  because participants across applications needed personal (e.g., interest) or external incentives (e.g., tangible product, rewards in a game) to continue their tasks and adequate levels of physical or cognitive challenge. Like  Carroll and Thomas (1988)  and  Pausch et al. (1994) , our study found that engagement failed to begin or was curtailed when systems were perceived by the user as either too difficult or too easy to use. Wells and Matthews (1994)  state that attention may be based on the cognitive judgements people make about the relevance of specific stimuli to themselves or their tasks. This was the case with our participants who attended to interface features that would enable them to efficiently complete a task or to content on the interface that resonated with their personal interests.\n\nNovelty played an important role in this study in sustaining users' engagements with the applications. For video gamers, this took the form of unexpected auditory or visual stimuli  (Aboulafia & Bannon, 2004) ; shoppers were interested in seeing new products, and webcast viewers and Web searchers sought new content. However, there was a ceiling for novelty  (Webster & Ho, 1997) , because participants did not wish for so much Feedback was shown to be an essential component for inciting and maintaining engagement. Feedback is inextricably linked to communication whether between a human and an artefact, or between several humans using the technology and awareness of others. In the webcast environment, for example, participants underscored their ability to interact with other remote viewers and individuals at the host institution. This is not surprising given people's strong bias for socialization  (Picard, 1997) . Participants also demonstrated a need for tangible feedback (e.g., textual, visual, or aural)  (Pausch et al., 1994)  that allowed them to orient themselves in a Web search or game, gauge their success in completing a shopping transaction, and see that their messages were received by others in the Webcasting environment. However, it is apparent that the attributes of engagement identified in this study interest, motivation, affect, attention, challenge, feedback, aesthetics and sensory appeal, awareness, novelty, perceived control, perceived time, and interactivity are products of the user-system interaction. Some of these attributes are associated with usability variables of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. This demonstrates that usability is intricately woven into the experience of engagement; while an application may be usable, it may not be engaging, but engaging applications do appear to have an inherent baseline of usability."

We observed all participants moving through the engagement process on much the same trajectory, and being impacted upon by the same attributes. However, we noted some differences among the groups. For example, video gamers seemed to have more difficulty disengaging than users of other applications, and were more likely to want more challenging experiences. One area of future research is examining the model more systematically within each of the application domains. Potentially, for example, the intensity of an attribute may vary with the application. In addition, the specific notion of disengagement is also of interest and pertains to computer addiction  Charlton (2002) . When, if ever, does intense engagement cross the line into addiction?\n\nThere are attributes (e.g., challenge, feedback, perceived control) that are components of not only engagement, but also usability. Future work will examine the relationship between these two constructs. Quesenbury (2003)  suggests that engagement, along with effectiveness, efficiency, ease of learning, and error tolerance, are dimensions of usability. It is our conjecture that usability facilitates engagement, but a usable system may not be engaging. Thus we view engagement as a higher order experience that encompasses more than usability. The fact that our participants described aesthetics, novelty, endurability, and so forth supports this.\n\nOne of the major gaps in the literature on engagement is in empirical evidence about how it should be measured  (Webster & Ho, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995) . Thus far attempts have been incomplete, nongeneralizable, or one-dimensional. Our future goals are to develop and rigorously test an instrument to assess users' perceived engagement. In addition, we intend to triangulate this subjective measure with behavioral and physiological (e.g., heart rate, galvanic skin response) methods. Studies have been conducted to explore entertainment and emotion (cf. Mandryk, 2004; Mandryk, Atkins, & Inkpen, 2006 ) using these techniques. This will provide a holistic view of engagement that encompasses all of the threads of user experience."

      "text": "This research provides insights into the phenomenon of engagement and is a foundation for further research. We have confirmed and expounded a conceptual model that views engagement as a process in which computer users initiate and sustain engagement, disengage with the application or task, and potentially reengage several times during a single interaction with an application. The process is defined by the presence of multiple attributes that vary in intensity depending on a combination of user and system attributes that emerge during the interaction. We have put forward a model that defines which attributes of engagement are most prominent during each phase in the process. We have highlighted attributes including attention, aesthetics, interest, challenge, control, motivation, novelty, and feedback as the user, system, and interaction components of the compositional, emotional, sensual, and spatiotemporal aspects of users' experience that predict and facilitate engagement. Our work has acknowledged the derivation of engagement from other constructs, such as flow, aesthetic experience, play, and information interaction and concluded that, while it shares attributes with these other frameworks, its combination and expression of components is unique. We have also demonstrated that engagement is consistent across different types of applications in terms of the attributes present and the trajectory followed by users through the process."
