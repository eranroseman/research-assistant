  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Employer-sponsored benefit programs aim to increase access to behavioral health care, which may help contain health care costs. However, research has either focused solely on clinical outcomes or demonstrated reductions in medical claims without accounting for the costs of behavioral health services, leaving the financial return on investment unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a clinically effective employer-sponsored behavioral health benefit is associated with net medical cost savings. \n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included participants eligible for an employer-sponsored behavioral health benefit between November 1, 2019, and May 31, 2023. Eligibility criteria included having a behavioral health diagnosis and, in the program group, attending at least 1 behavioral health appointment. Program users were matched to nonusers on medical risk scores, behavioral health diagnoses, date of diagnosis, age, sex, and employer. Participants were followed up for 1 year before and after the benefit launch. EXPOSURE A digital platform screened individuals for common behavioral health conditions and provided access to video and in-person psychotherapy, medication management, care navigation, and self-guided digital content. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were per member per month (PMPM) medical spending, inclusive of all medical claims and program costs. A difference-in-differences analysis was used to compare changes in net medical spending between groups from the year before and up to 1 year after an index mental health diagnosis. \n RESULTS This study included 13 990 participants: 4907 of 4949 (99.1%) eligible program group members were matched to 9083 control participants. Their mean (SD) age was 37 (13.2) years, and most participants (65.5%) were female. Costs decreased in the program group relative to the control group, with a net difference-in-differences of -$164 PMPM (95% CI, -$228 to -$100 PMPM), corresponding to savings of $1070 per participant in the first program year and a return on investment of 1.9 times the costs (ie, every $100 invested reduced medical claims costs by $190). Behavioral health costs in the program group increased relative to the control group but were more than offset by decreases in physical health care costs. Savings were larger for participants with higher medical risk. \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study, every $100 invested in an employersponsored behavioral health program with fast access to psychotherapy and medication management was associated with a reduction in medical claims costs by $190. These findings (continued) Key Points Question Does a clinically effective employer-sponsored mental health benefit result in net medical cost savings? Findings In this cohort study of 13 990 employees and dependents, medical claims costs were reduced by $190 for every $100 invested in the mental health benefit. Meaning These findings suggest that expanding access to behavioral health care may be a financially viable costreduction strategy for health care buyers.",

      "text": "The total health care costs of undertreated behavioral health disorders are more than $290 billion each year in the US alone.  1  Behavioral health conditions have been linked with up to 3-fold spending increases for individuals with otherwise the same physical disease burden.  2, 3 The impact is largest for patients with high-cost physical health conditions.  4, 5 More than half of patients with a high-cost condition also have a behavioral health disorder,  6  and behavioral health disorders lead to increased medical spending for chronic pain,  7, 8  cardiovascular disease,  [9] [10] [11]  and diabetes.  12, 13 Expanding timely access to specialty behavioral health treatments may be a cost-effective solution to improve behavioral health and physical health.  1, 2, 4, 14, 15 havioral health and physical health are intertwined. Behavioral health difficulties influence physical health by negatively affecting health behaviors. Depression has been linked to lower adherence to hypertension medication,  16, 17  lower attendance to cardiac rehabilitation,  18  and decreased physical activity.  19, 20 Untreated behavioral health conditions are linked to illness persistence, higher medical complication rates, preventable hospitalizations, and greater health care service use.  4  In contrast, behavioral health interventions positively affect physical health, such as decreasing pain  [21] [22] [23]  and improving glycemic control for type 2 diabetes.  12 or access to care is a substantial barrier to effective treatment, with only 20.8% of diagnosed individuals receiving care from a behavioral health specialist within a year.  24 Structural barrierssuch as difficulty finding appropriate clinicians, limited appointment availability, and high costsdiscourage patients from seeking care, often leading to emergency or hospital visits when conditions worsen.  [25] [26] 6] [27]  Although many employers sponsor behavioral health programs to alleviate these barriers, high-quality evidence demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing medical costs is limited by methodologic issues.  28, 29 Common issues include failing to include the cost of the intervention itself,  3, 30  failing to validate or enhance risk adjustment using preprogram medical spending,  30  or using no risk adjustment at all.  31  Thus, expanding access to behavioral health care is a promising avenue to improve health outcomes and lower costs, but the evidence base would benefit from more rigorous research designs.\n\nThis study used a rigorous matched cohort design, with a difference-in-differences analysis and medical risk scores derived from more than 150 health conditions to evaluate the association between an employer-sponsored behavioral health program and total medical spending. Secondary objectives explored changes in behavioral health care use after the program was launched, differences in spending across medical service categories (eg, emergency department), and whether program outcomes differed for participants with high-cost medical conditions."

An ROI multiple of 1.0 represents full cost offset (total costs are equal between groups), with values greater than 1.0 indicating net-positive ROI. Service categories were analyzed by fitting separate models to the spending accrued for each category, further stratified by whether spending was associated with a behavioral health diagnosis.\n\nModeration analysis was conducted by fitting separate models with Program Group \u00d7 Phase interactions for each candidate moderator. To determine whether any conditions were especially responsive to behavioral health treatment, we controlled the Program \u00d7 Risk Score \u00d7 Phase interaction and re-estimated the high-cost condition moderators.

PMPM indicates per member per month.\n\nthe program group also increased, but by $164 PMPM less than the control group, in line with actuarial expectations of the effect of behavioral health care reported previously.  1  Together, this resulted in an ROI of 1.9 times the costs in the year following program implementation.\n\nBehavioral health care use increased by 47.0% relative to the year before launch. This increase was likely attributable, in part, to the program attracting new users to behavioral health care, because use via health plan clinicians did not decrease after launch. The increase in use contrasts with prior research on a different employer-sponsored program, which showed no increase in behavioral health care utilization.  31 The increase in use observed here is likely due to reduced financial barriers to care because sessions were subsidized by the employer and to a modern web-based platform that made it easier to choose clinicians, schedule appointments within days, and attend treatment sessions.\n\nHigher financial and operational barriers to care among control group participants could have delayed their care until their behavioral health difficulties progressed and required more intensive treatment. Indeed, among the 33.4% of individuals in the control group who used specialty care, the average number of sessions was 2.5 more than program group participants. Lower session use in the program group may also reflect a more consistent use of measurement-based care by program clinicians, in which symptom measures administered throughout therapy enable clinicians to more quickly course-correct patients for a successful outcome and more quickly identify when patients meet their treatment goals.  38 havioral health spending in the program group in this study shifted toward more effective services earlier in the care continuum. Behavioral health spending was higher overall in the program group than in the control group (in particular for behavioral health specialists) but was lower for office visits, emergency department visits, and hospital settings. Prior research has shown that office visits, emergency department visits, and hospital visits are characterized by infrequent or brief treatment episodes rather than comprehensive courses of care and, consequently, are less clinically effective than behavioral health care.

The gray markers at the bottom of panel A represent the distribution of risk scores. The distance between regression lines represents the difference-indifferences at a given risk score. C, High-cost condition savings estimates are plotted at the average risk level for members with that condition. The downward slope of the dashed line, labeled \"risk-based savings estimate,\" shows how program savings increased for participants with higher medical risk scores. Chronic pain, gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, and hypertension fell substantially below the risk-based savings line, suggesting that spending on these conditions is more responsive to behavioral health treatment than would be expected from overall medical risk alone. COPD indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HHS-HCC, Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories; PMPM, per member per month.\n\nthat they required more time and cost-intensive settings such as the emergency department or inpatient stays. Consistent with this interpretation, an exploratory analysis revealed above-average spending reductions in the index month, when medical activity was highest, followed by smaller but increasing reductions after 4 months, enough time to complete a standard course of care. These savings likely result from (1) diverting care to behavioral health services earlier in the continuum and\n\n(2) improved mental health reducing the need for other health care services.\n\nThe program group's increased behavioral health care costs were more than offset by decreased physical health care costs. Behavioral health care may reduce physical health care costs in both indirect and direct ways. For some people, behavioral health care may indirectly improve physical health by addressing barriers to engaging in preventive or disease management practices, such as exercise or medication adherence. Research shows that unaddressed behavioral health disorders are associated with higher rates of preventable hospitalizations in patients with diabetes,  42, 43  asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  43  supporting the notion that behavioral health can impair medical disorder care adherence practices.\n\nFor other people, behavioral health care may directly improve physical health. In this study, 3 physical health conditions (chronic pain, hypertension, and gastrointestinal conditions) had substantial savings that could not be explained by their level of medical risk alone. These conditions are similar in that they are biologically linked to stress, anxiety, and depression, which amplify the body's pain response,  44, 45  increase blood pressure,  46, 47  and exacerbate ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome.  48, 49 These and other conditions that can be affected directly by a behavioral health condition may deliver outsized cost savings when a high-quality behavioral health program is readily available.  [21] [22] [23] 50, 51  Overall, these findings support the enhancement of access to behavioral health care among individuals with high-cost conditions as a strategy not only for cost containment but also for improving both mental and physical health treatment outcomes."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The study has several limitations. The nonrandomized design may have introduced selection bias, because control group patients may have initiated care for different reasons than program participants, possibly inflating program savings estimates. We mitigated this by using medical risk scores at the time of behavioral health diagnosis to account for new medical information at care initiation. Although a validated algorithm for identifying chronic conditions would enhance the generalizability of our results, we selected diagnostic codes most relevant to mental health conditions because common algorithms focus on severe populations and explicitly exclude psychological factors (eg, chronic pain).  52 Relatedly, the small but statistically significant prevalence differences for several high-cost conditions could indicate residual bias from the matching process or may reflect an association between program use and subsequent condition prevalence during the study year. However, the close match on overall risk scores and the use of difference-in-differences modeling should mitigate any bias."

Participants receiving treatment from both the program and the health plan during the study year were excluded to prevent complications in causal attribution of potentially time-delayed effects. To mitigate survivorship bias between control group participants (possibly in ongoing care at program launch) and program group participants (by definition, initiating a new care episode), a washout period was implemented requiring all participants to have 6 consecutive months without treatment from a behavioral health specialist prior to their index diagnosis. If a control group participant did not receive treatment from a behavioral health specialist at or after their index diagnosis, they were required to have 6 months without any behavioral health diagnosis. Program group participants needed at least 1 psychotherapy or medication management session with the program; they could also receive a diagnosis via the health plan, but it was not required.
