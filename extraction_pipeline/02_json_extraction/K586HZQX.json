      "text": "An unresolved question for the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology is why a significant percentage of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals do not develop detectable downstream tau pathology and, consequently, clinical deterioration. In vitro evidence suggests that reactive astrocytes unleash A\u03b2 effects in pathological tau phosphorylation. Here, in a biomarker study across three cohorts (n = 1,016), we tested whether astrocyte reactivity modulates the association of A\u03b2 with tau phosphorylation in CU individuals. We found that A\u03b2 was associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau only in individuals positive for astrocyte reactivity (Ast + ). Cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-positron emission tomography analyses revealed an AD-like pattern of tau tangle accumulation as a function of A\u03b2 only in CU Ast + individuals. Our findings suggest astrocyte reactivity as an important upstream event linking A\u03b2 with initial tau pathology, which may have implications for the biological definition of preclinical AD and for selecting CU individuals for clinical trials.\n\nRapid advances in fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers have facilitated the understanding of the dynamic associations between Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathophysiological processes in the living human brain. These biomarker studies suggest that brain accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) precedes tau pathology in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals  [1] [2] [3]  , which is closely related to the development of cognitive symptoms  [4] [5] [6]  . However, the reasons why A\u03b2 pathology is not associated with AD-related progression in some CU individuals is one of the most pressing questions in the field  [7] [8] [9]  . In addition to revealing key biological players associated with disease progression, finding predictive markers of early A\u03b2-related tau pathology would allow for the identification of CU individuals who are more likely to develop AD even before the first signs of pathological tau, facilitating enrollment in early prevention clinical trials  10  .\n\nThe fact that A\u03b2 leads to tau pathology in some individuals, but not in others, suggests the presence of other biological processes capable of triggering the deleterious effects of A\u03b2 in the early disease stages. Postmortem studies show that astrocyte reactivity is a Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02380-x A\u03b2 burden and plasma p-tau181 in CU Ast + (\u03b2 = 0.34, t = 5.37, P < 0.0001; Fig.  1b  and Extended Data Table  1 ) but not in CU Ast -(\u03b2 = 0.04, t = 1.06, P = 0.29; Fig.  1b ) individuals. A significant interaction between A\u03b2 burden and astrocyte reactivity status on plasma p-tau181 (\u03b2 = 0.31, t = 4.62, P < 0.0001; Fig.  1b ) further supported that the presence of astrocyte reactivity was key to determining A\u03b2 effects on tau phosphorylation. These results were replicated using different cutoff values to determine reactive astrocyte positivity (Extended Data Table  2 ). In addition, linear regression using only continuous values for A\u03b2, p-tau181 and GFAP levels confirmed that these results were not driven by biomarker thresholds (\u03b2 = 0.10, t = 3.22, P = 0.0013; Fig.  1c ). Cohen's d analysis revealed that the presence of both A\u03b2 + and Ast + has a large magnitude of effect on tau phosphorylation (Cohen's d = 0.80), whereas A\u03b2 + in the absence of Ast + presented a negligible effect size (Fig.  1d ). Voxel-wise analysis confirmed that A\u03b2 levels associated with plasma p-tau181 only in the presence of astrocyte reactivity in some brain regions previously shown to present early A\u03b2 pathology in PET studies, including the posterior cingulate, precuneus and insula  25  (Fig.  1e ).\n\nConsistently, the stratified analysis within cohorts showed similar results. In the three enrollment sites, plasma p-tau181 levels increased as a function of A\u03b2 burden only in CU Ast + (Pittsburgh: \u03b2 = -0.35, t = 3.10, P = 0.003 (Fig.  1f ); MYHAT: \u03b2 = -0.20, t = 2.26, P = 0.026 (Fig.  1h ) and TRIAD: \u03b2 = 0.57, t = 4.36, P < 0.0001 (Fig.  1j )). A steeper increase in plasma p-tau181 was observed in the research cohorts (TRIAD and Pittsburgh) compared to the population-based cohort (MYHAT). Similarly, we observed a significant interaction between A\u03b2 burden and astrocyte reactivity status on plasma p-tau181 levels in the Pittsburgh (\u03b2 = -0.29, t = 2.30, P = 0.022; Fig.  1g ), MYHAT (\u03b2 = -0.19, t = 2.07, P = 0.039; Fig.  1i ) and TRIAD (\u03b2 = 0.46, t = 2.92, P = 0.004; Fig.  1k ) cohorts. In a subset of participants from the Pittsburgh and MYHAT cohorts with available A\u03b2-PET (n = 150), we also found increased plasma p-tau181 as a function of A\u03b2-PET only in Ast + (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). No significant effect of apolipoprotein \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54) status was observed in the aforementioned associations (Extended Data Table  3 ).\n\nWe also explored the impact of Ast + in the associations of A\u03b2 burden with plasma p-tau231 (available for Pittsburgh and TRIAD cohorts, n = 502) and p-tau217 (available for the TRIAD cohort, n = 136) levels in subsets of individuals that had these markers available. Plasma p-tau231 increased as a function of A\u03b2 only in CU Ast + individuals (Fig.  1l ). Additionally, we found a significant association between A\u03b2 and plasma p-tau231 in CU Ast + (\u03b2 = 0.36, t = 4.62, P < 0.0001; Fig.  1m  and Extended Data Table  3 ) but not in CU Ast -individuals (\u03b2 = 0.10, t = 1.87, P = 0.06). We also observed a significant interaction between A\u03b2 and astrocyte reactivity status on plasma p-tau231 (\u03b2 = 0.26, t = 2.84, P = 0.004; Fig.  1m ). common neuropathological finding in CU individuals and, like cortical A\u03b2 plaques, one of the earliest abnormalities in AD  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  . Experimental literature suggests that astrocyte reactivity is critical for triggering A\u03b2-induced tau phosphorylation  16  and that the attenuation of astrocyte reactivity mitigates tau pathology  17, 18  . Additionally, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes can internalize tau and may contribute to its propagation  19, 20  . Altogether, these experimental results support a close link between A\u03b2, astrocyte reactivity and tau.\n\nClinical studies support that plasma measures of GFAP correlate with its CSF levels and are increased in CU individuals with AD pathophysiology, representing a robust proxy of astrocyte reactivity in the brains of these individuals  [21] [22] [23] [24]  . Based on this previous literature, we designed a multisite biomarker study including three cohorts to test the hypothesis that the presence of astrocyte reactivity biomarker abnormality is a key element in determining the association of A\u03b2 burden with early tau phosphorylation and aggregation biomarkers in preclinical AD."

      "text": "In summary, we provide biomarker evidence across multiple cohorts that shows that increased astrocyte reactivity, as indicated by elevated plasma GFAP, plays a role in the association of A\u03b2 with early tau phosphorylation in preclinical AD.\n\nThe fact that the presence of abnormal astrocyte reactivity determined A\u03b2-triggered tau pathology in CU individuals may prove to favor the inclusion of astrocyte reactivity biomarkers in the biomarker modeling  1  and biological definitions  27  of AD. Our findings support previous biomarker studies in suggesting that plasma p-tau levels rise in response to early A\u03b2 in preclinical AD  3  but also add that this occurs mainly in the concomitant presence of astrocyte reactivity biomarker abnormality. These results suggest that astrocyte reactivity abnormality could be placed as an early upstream event, likely before tau pathology, in the hypothetical biomarker models of AD progression  28  . Furthermore, we can argue that an A\u03b2/Ast/p-tau biomarker scheme could provide a more granular early classification for preclinical AD. Specifically, CU classified as A\u03b2 + and Ast + would be more likely to progress to tau positivity, which is closely related to the development of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline  6, 29, 30  . Further studies measuring A\u03b2, tau and GFAP biomarkers at multiple time points with long follow-up durations are needed to confirm the temporal order of appearance of each biomarker abnormality and to determine other possible factors associated with early astrocyte reactivity in preclinical AD.\n\nOur results may have implications for clinical trials. As clinical trials have increasingly focused on individuals in the earliest preclinical phases of AD, our results highlight that the selection of A\u03b2 + /Ast + CU Although our sensitivity analysis supported plasma GFAP levels 2 s.d. above the mean of CU devoid of detectable A\u03b2 as a robust cutoff to enhance A\u03b2 and p-tau association, a cutoff validation using antemortem blood samples associated with postmortem GFAP characterization is desirable. In addition, experimental literature suggests as a possible mechanism underlying our findings that A\u03b2-mediated astrocyte signaling (for example, through cytokines, caspases and reactive oxygen species) induces tau pathology  3, 13, 29  , which is corroborated by studies showing that the suppression of this signaling is able to halt tau phosphorylation  17  . Thus, we can speculate that a combination of drugs targeting A\u03b2 and reactive astrocyte mediators may potentiate the prevention of early tau pathology in trials conducted in preclinical AD individuals. We found that the effect of astrocyte reactivity on the association between A\u03b2 and tau phosphorylation was greater in CU men than women. Previous studies have shown increased tau biomarkers in women compared to men; however, whether this is driven by A\u03b2 or other sex-specific factors remains unclear  [31] [32] [33]  . Therefore, our results showing that astrocyte reactivity had a greater impact on the association of A\u03b2 with tau in men does not contradict the above-mentioned previous studies. In fact, our findings might be reflected in the recent outcomes of anti-A\u03b2 therapies, which might be modifying this A\u03b2astrocyte-tau pathway, showing a higher magnitude of effect in men than women  34  .\n\nThe strengths of our study include a large sample size for the main analysis and the use of well-characterized research and population-based cohorts. Limitations include the fact that the analysis using longitudinal tau-PET had a relatively small sample size; thus, replication of this finding is highly desirable. As biomarkers are naturally continuous, dichotomizing cutoffs are invariably subjected to conceptual and analytical idiosyncrasies and may change depending on the method used. Finally, although our cohort represents significant socioeconomic diversity, the main limitation is that our cohorts are composed mainly of White participants, which limits the generalizability of our findings to a more diverse world population.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that detecting astrocyte reactivity biomarker abnormality is critical to predict whether CU A\u03b2-positive individuals will develop tau pathology and, consequently, clinical symptoms."
