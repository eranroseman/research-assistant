  "title": "Technology-delivered adaptations of motivational interviewing for health-related behaviors: A systematic review of the current research",
  "abstract": "Objectives-The aims of this paper were to describe and evaluate the methods and efficacy of technology-delivered motivational interviewing interventions (TAMIs), discuss the challenges and opportunities of TAMIs, and provide a framework for future research. Methods-We reviewed studies that reported using motivational interviewing (MI) based components delivered via technology and conducted ratings on technology description, comprehensiveness of MI, and study methods. \n Results- The majority of studies were fully-automated and included at least one form of media rich technology to deliver the TAMI. Few studies provided complete descriptions of how MI components were delivered via technology. Of the studies that isolated the TAMI effects, positive changes were reported. \n Conclusion-Researchers have used a range of technologies to deliver TAMIs suggesting feasibility of these methods. However, there are limited data regarding their efficacy, and strategies to deliver relational components remain a challenge. Future research should better characterize the components of TAMIs, empirically test the efficacy of TAMIs with randomized controlled trials, and incorporate fidelity measures. Practice Implications-TAMIs are feasible to implement and well accepted. These approaches offer considerable potential to reduce costs, minimize therapist and training burden, and expand the range of clients that may benefit from adaptations of MI.",

      "text": "As technology advances at a rapid rate, clinical researchers have started developing alternative modalities to deliver interventions for a range of health-related behaviors  [1] [2] [3] . Despite this growth in development, many of these advances have not been empirically evaluated, and many questions remain about how technology may be used to enhance treatment efficacy and effectiveness  [4] . The aims of the current paper are to: (1) conduct a systematic review of the research on these interventions in order to characterize the methodical features of the studies to date and how technology has been used to deliver adaptations of motivational interviewing (MI), (3) evaluate evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of these approaches, (4) outline both advantages and challenges related these methods, and (5) provide suggestions for future work in this rapidly expanding area of research."

      "title": "Motivational Interviewing",
      "text": "MI is a collaborative, client-centered therapeutic approach that is focused on evoking the client's personal reasons for change, collaborating with the client, and promoting their autonomy  [5] [6] [7] . These elements are exhibited by drawing on the client's goals and values, honoring their perspective, and affirming the client's ability to make their own changes. MI has been described as incorporating both relational and technical components  [8, 9] . Certain strategies have been developed to help foster the relational \"MI sprit\" such as collaborating with the patient, evoking intrinsic reasons for change, and accepting the client's right to maintain problematic behaviors  [9] . The focus of MI is to promote 'change talk', defined as a client's verbalization of motivation to change maladaptive behavior. The clinician promotes change talk by expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy. These techniques create a collaborative and empathetic environment in which the counselor is able work within the individual's framework and promote the client's positive self-regard  [5] [6] [7] .\n\nThere are specific techniques that help counselors deliver interventions that promote the MI spirit  [9] . For example, encouraging the client to articulate his/her own reasons for change promotes self-efficacy. Efforts to develop discrepancies between the client's desired states and current behavior have been facilitated by discussing pros and cons of change. Other techniques that are used to evoke change talk are summarizing and elaborating points, and listening for change talk \"buzz words\" (e.g., 'I want', 'I can'). Together these techniques help the counselor heighten ambivalence, elicit change talk, and support self-efficacy while maintaining fidelity to the spirit of MI  [5] [6] [7] . Adherence to these features and proficiency in implementation can be assessed by measures such as the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC  [9] ) and the Motivational Interviewing Integrity Code (MITI  [10] ), which systemically measure and assess the multiple components critical to delivering MI in an adherent manner.\n\nAdaptations of MI (AMIs) are defined as interventions that remain true to the four primary aspects of MI: expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy, but may incorporate other techniques (e.g., feedback). Burke and colleagues  [11]  conducted a review investigating face-to-face (FTF) AMI interventions and found that AMIs have demonstrated efficacy in a range of populations (e.g., HIV medication adherence  [12] ; weight loss  [13] , smoking cessation  [14] ) and have been modified to suit a number of different clinical settings  [11] ."

      "text": "The use of technology and technology-based media to facilitate treatment delivery (e.g., telemedicine or telehealth) has increased rapidly  [15] . Researchers have used mobile phones, the Internet, computers and more to deliver interventions across multiple populations  [3] . Using technology to deliver health behavior interventions is associated with a number of advantages including reduced therapist burden  [16] , lower cost stepped-care options  [17] , and improved capacity to reach populations who might not otherwise receive care  [18] . These advantages may be offset by limitations such as technical difficulties (e.g., service/ streaming problems  [19] ), over-simplification of material  [20] , and loss of non-verbal communication  [21] . Moreover, the impact of some aspects of technology-delivered care remains unclear (e.g., when is self-disclosure best facilitated by FTF vs. technology-based interactions? [22] ). In sum, technology offers a number of positive advances for health care delivery, but these advances are coupled with challenges that merit continued research."

      "title": "Technology and MI",
      "text": "A number of investigators have begun to explore the potential of utilizing technology to deliver MI and AMIs [e.g.,  23, 24] . Given the strong emphasis on therapeutic style and interpersonal elements that constitute core aspects of MI, delivering MI/AMIs through these alternative modalities may be particularly challenging. Questions arise such as: can the \"MI spirit\", or relational components, be captured without person-to-person contact? Are specific MI tools more easily adapted to technology than others (e.g., readiness ruler verses reflective questions)? The goals of this review are to obtain both a descriptive overview and qualitative understanding of MI/AMIs delivered through electronic media. In the current review, the term technology assisted motivational interview (\"TAMI\") is used to define adaptations of MI delivered via technology and various types of media (i.e., computer, video, mobile phone, animation, telephone). Similar to Burke and colleagues'  [11]  definition, some of the TAMIs incorporate additional intervention components that are distinct from MI. Specifically, we aim to: (1) characterize the type of technology and the specific MI components incorporated into TAMIs aimed at addressing health related behaviors, (2) evaluate study methods, (3) review extant evidence for the efficacy of these approaches, and (4) highlight some of the important research questions that need to be addressed."

      "text": "Scientific databases, specifically Pubmed and Psychinfo, were searched to identify potentially eligible studies using the following search terms: technology, telehealth, textmessage, Internet, computer, virtual reality, mobile phone, m-health, e-health AND motivational interviewing, motivational enhancement therapy, motivational intervention. Inclusion criteria for the review were: 1) published in peer review journals within 2003 -2015 (last search: February 27, 2015), 2) written in English, 3) description of at least one technology-delivered intervention as incorporating MI principles based on the primary MI guides foot_1    [5] [6] [7] 25]  4) inclusion of at least one acceptability/feasibility or behavioral/ psychological outcome regarding the TAMI and 5) enrolled at least ten participants. Studies that only included MI delivered in-person, over the telephone or via videoconference were excluded from this review unless assisted by computer or other form of technology that would result in the MI intervention to be adapted for the technology. More specifically, telephone and videoconference delivered MI were excluded because the real-time voice-tovoice contact would eliminate the need to adapt MI for technology. We included interventions that were developed using the theoretical framework of MI and those that added components to the current perspectives on MI (e.g., \"MI with feedback\" interventions but not \"feedback-only\" interventions). Outcomes were defined as acceptability/feedback regarding the intervention and/or behavioral or psychological change related to the target health behavior. Protocol papers (i.e., manuscripts that only provided a detailed description of the protocol methods without outcome or acceptability data) were excluded. For example, Schaub and colleagues  [26]  described their randomized controlled trial protocol \"Snow Control\" that involved MI principles delivered via the web for cocaine use without providing outcome data. As a result, this study was not included in the current review. Studies that included both protocol details and relevant outcomes (i.e., data regarding acceptability/feedback and/or behavioral or psychological change) were included in the review. Studies were selected for an in-depth review based on information provided in the title and abstract. The full-text of potentially eligible studies were then screened and included based on meeting all of the above inclusion criteria. See Figure  1  for PRISMA screening diagram. Forty-one papers met inclusion criteria. The full set of studies and results are presented in Appendix A. Eight studies  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]  that were secondary analyses and/or follow-up analyses of the reviewed papers  [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40]  were excluded from the qualitative ratings (i.e., Tables  1 2 3 4 ) because they provided no additional detail regarding the TAMI. The outcome data from these studies are detailed in Appendix A.\n\nAfter the screening process, descriptive data (i.e., target behavior, sample characteristics, setting, and additional interventions delivered with or integrated into the TAMI) were collected. The articles were then coded for 1) description of the technology used (e.g., Were audio and/or video files used? Did the intervention permit synchronous communication); 2) quality of the comprehensiveness of the MI component within the TAMI foot_2  (e.g., Were methods of rolling resistance described? Were methods of collaboration described?); 3) quality of the technology description (adapted from the CONSORT E-HEALTH guidelines  [41] ; e.g., Was the mode described for the intervention? Were screenshots provided?); and 4) study design methods foot_3  (e.g., Was it a randomized control trial? Were longer follow-up outcomes reported?). Study ratings were conducted by both authors and a subset of ratings (20%) were double coded to assess inter-rater reliability (\u03ba = 0.85). See Appendix B for the quality measures."

While the target behaviors in these studies were similar, the populations recruited were quite diverse [e.g., individuals seeking or in treatment  [42] [43] [44] [45] , non-treatment seeking smokers [cannabis, tobacco; 46,47] mothers with a recent history of drug use in an obstetric department  [48, 49] , adolescents presenting to the emergency room with a recent history of violence and drinking  [35] , college students  [39, 50, 51] , criminal offenders  [52] ).\n\nRisky sexual behaviors were the next most frequent target behavior, addressed in four studies with varied populations: offenders on probation  [53] , men who have sex with men (MSM  [54] ), youth with HIV  [55] , and college students enrolled in a psychology course  [56] . These researchers aimed to reduce HIV risk and other sexually transmitted infections by increasing education and use of protection.\n\nAnother subset of studies (n = 13) focused on a range of health behaviors such as having a mammogram  [57] , weight-loss  [58, 59] , reducing blood pressure  [60] , self-management of epilepsy  [61] , HIV  [62, 63]  and asthma  [64] , and increasing healthy eating  [65, 66]  and physical activity  [67, 68] . These researchers also recruited a range of populations (e.g., women who were overdue for a mammogram  [57] ; overweight adults  [58]  and adolescents  [68] ; youth with HIV  [55, 62] ). The final subset (n = 5) recruited individuals seeking treatment for Axis I disorders (other than substance use disorders) and targeted depression in individuals with chronic pain  [69] , eating disorders  [38, 70, 71] , and social phobia  [72] ."

      "text": "-eight studies delivered the TAMI in a hospital, clinic/ community center, school, or university lab indicating some level of human contact during the study visit (though not necessarily during the intervention). The remaining studies (n = 13) were conducted completely online without any form of FTF interactions.\n\nTen groups of researchers delivered the TAMI as a free-standing intervention  4  [e.g.,  24, 46,48-50 62,63] . These researchers did not describe other therapy techniques (e.g., CBT) as part of the intervention. In contrast, twenty-six studies integrated TAMI components with other non-MI based therapeutic frameworks, interventions or approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; [e.g.,  30, 36, 40, 42, 43, 71] ), skills training  [35, 54, 56] , the Blood Pressure Action Plan  [60] , the transtheoretical model of change [e.g.,  39, 57, 61, 65] , and social cognitive theory [e.g.,  55, 65, 73] . Within these protocols, the TAMI was not described as a separate intervention. For example, Blankers et al.  [40]  described their intervention as \"CBT/MI.\" Because these authors did not detail how the separate approaches were delivered (e.g., Did the protocol involve one MI session followed by CBT? Or were the principles delivered as needed over the course of the intervention?), we have conceptualized the TAMI as integrated within the other frameworks. Four interventions had clearly defined separation between the primary therapy (e.g., CBT) and the adjunctive TAMI (as opposed to the TAMI being integrated within another intervention or approach described above). Specifically, these interventions included a tailored non-MI based website with adjunctive TAMI emails  [65] , online diary cards with a computerized TAMI assistant  [59] , an online CBT program with an adjunctive motivation-based discussion  [72] , and motivational messages  [37] . Finally, VanDeMark and colleagues'  [44]  TAMI was a prelude to residential or outpatient substance use treatment. No interventions were delivered as a means to provide posttreatment care."

Audio files? Video files? See Table  1 )."

      "title": "Degree of Interactivity",
      "text": "-There were differing levels of therapist and client interaction via technology, with n = 9 using expert-guided protocols and n = 32 delivering fully-automated TAMIs (i.e., no therapist/expert interaction). Of the interventions that included expert guidance, n = 5 researchers used synchronous (i.e., real-time) communication. For example, Blankers and colleagues'  [40]  program included real-time online-chat therapy sessions  [40] . Costanza et al.  [57]  used a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) during which the counselor recorded the participants' answers into a computer that provided MI consistent response prompts  [57] . In these cases, communication was synchronous but assisted by technology. Four sets of researchers only incorporated asynchronous communication via emails  [38, 62, 70]  and messages  [68] .\n\nIn contrast to using technology to allow for remote therapist-guided contact, the majority of the researchers (n = 32) used fully-automated TAMIs. In these studies, live counselors were not interacting with the participants during the TAMI portion of the intervention. Rather, the technology program was developed to administer MI exercises such as a 'readiness ruler' or exploration of barriers to change without any communication with professionals. Examples include Alemagno and colleagues'  [53]  talking computer that asked participants questions such as: \"Look at the ruler below. How ready are you to make some changes to reduce your risk for HIV?\" and the SafERTeens  [35]  talking \"buddy\" who helped the teens identify reasons to avoid alcohol use and violence."

A subset of the programs used video, voice, or animation that was specifically developed to mirror interpersonal communication (e.g.,  35, 48, 48, 53, 59, 62) . For instance, Blanson-Henkemans et al.  [59]  incorporated the 'iCat' computer assistant who had emotive facial expressions and spoke to and supported the participants during the intervention. Gerbert et al.  [23]  used a \"video doctor\" actor who provided personalized responses in the MI style. Thus in these programs, video or animation mimicked live interaction. One study that investigated an online program for social anxiety disorder  [72]  exclusively described text-based technology within the TAMI."

Quality ratings of how these studies described the use of TAMIs included 1) the comprehensiveness of the MI component described within the TAMI (i.e., what aspects of MI did the researchers explicitly describe in their manuscript?), 2) whether measures of adherence to MI within the TAMI were used, and 3) the level of description of the technology used to deliver the TAMI (e.g., did they describe the mode of delivery? Provide screenshots?). Evaluation of each of these studies also included ratings of the overall attention to different methodological features as well as whether or not the change in outcomes could be attributed to the TAMI."

      "title": "Comprehensiveness of MI in TAMI protocols-",
      "text": "In order to assess whether or not MI as a whole was delivered via technology, we rated how many components of MI were described in each protocol. We investigated the relational components (e.g., collaboration, evocation, and acceptance  [9] ) as well as technical components (e.g., openended questions, asking permission). Overall, the level of comprehensiveness regarding using MI principles was low, with researchers detailing an average of 4.78 (out of 16; SD = 2.69; Range: 1-13) MI elements on the MI quality rating scale (See table  2 ). Two  [23, 24]  of the four studies that only included acceptability outcomes provided the greatest detail surrounding the MI protocol. The most common MI components were 'strengthening commitment to change' (e.g., developing a change plan), described in n = 32 studies and developing discrepancy (e.g., discussing pros and cons of change), described in n = 28 studies. Examples of tools used for other MI components were using branching algorithms (to tailor to the participant's readiness to change), discussing personal strengths (to enhance self-efficacy), and envisioning one's life in five years (to evoke reasons to change).\n\nThirteen studies provided verbatim examples of how they delivered MI principles via technology. These excerpts offer insight into how to create a more interpersonal-like discourse when using technology-based interventions. For example, in the computerized iCat program, empathy was created by remarks demonstrating that the iCat understood participants may have other priorities in their life (i.e., \"You were not successful in achieving your goal for today. Maybe you have been busy,\"  [42] ). Friederichs et al.  [67]  provided an excerpt from their protocol that included tailored information and a reflection, and multiple researchers [e.g.,  23, 53, 58, 68]  included a table of verbatim statements and how they aligned with MI principles (e.g., \" Would it be OK if we spent a few more minutes discussing your drinking\" was categorized as 'asking permission')."

      "title": "Fidelity to MI-Treatment",
      "text": "fidelity is an evaluation of the therapist's application of the therapy model and the experience of the participants. The use of technology to deliver treatment raises questions regarding whether or not the technology is adequately delivering the intervention model. Given the interpersonal/relational emphasis of MI and the multicomponent nature of AMIs  [14] , the question of MI fidelity within TAMIs becomes particularly challenging.\n\nIn the research to date, only two studies reported MI treatment fidelity data (See Table  2 ). Blankers and colleagues  [40]  had independent coders rate transcripts from their Internet chat-therapy sessions using the Yale Adherence and Competence Scale-II and found an acceptable rating for the TAMI. In contrast, DiIorio et al.  [61]  included an 11-item questionnaire focused on how supportive and encouraging the participants found the intervention and labeled it as a fidelity measure. Ninety-three percent of the participants reported that the program helped them find their own ways to improve sleep quality and half of the participants noted the program was encouraging. Although described as an adherence measure, these ratings do not offer insight into whether MI was adequately delivered.\n\nAlthough formal adherence measures were generally omitted, additional researchers other than DiIorio et al.  [61]  addressed 'softer' components that may be related to MI fidelity. For example, Osilla et al.  [24]  reported that participants said the program promoted their autonomy. This suggests the intervention potentially addressed some of the nuances associated with translating MI to technology, but we cannot confirm this hypothesis without formal adherence measures. One study, Outlaw et al.  [62] , reported that the participants felt that the narration voice was 'robotic.' This may be particularly important to treatment fidelity in MI given the relational emphasis. Moreover, experts in the field who consulted on Budney and colleagues'  [42]  study suggested increasing the interaction and reflective components of the TAMI. Due to budget constraints, they were unable to make such changes."

Three studies reported feasibility and acceptability of the treatments without behavioral outcomes  [23, 24, 44] . These researchers found high levels of acceptability and participants generally reported feeling supported. Gerbert and colleagues'  [23]  video doctor was rated highly (mean = 6.13 on 7 point scale), though the individuals reported that they would have felt more comfortable answering questions from a \"real doctor.\" In contrast, individuals participating in Osilla and colleagues'  [24]  program reported that they felt more comfortable disclosing their risky drinking behavior to a computer and felt as though the web-MI evoked reasons for change and promoted their autonomy. Participants in van de Mark's  [44]  trial felt that E-TREAT offered another outlet for support and appreciated the ability to talk to online recovery coaches.\n\nThirty-eight studies reported behavioral or psychological outcomes (See Table  4 , Appendix A). Of the studies that included a FTF comparison group, positive changes were reported in the technology arms (e.g., reduced alcohol and/or cannabis use  [42, 50, 51] ) though the FTF counselor generally resulted in greater behavior change. Kay-Lambkin and colleagues  [43]  found that the computer condition led to comparable changes compared to the FTF condition in depression and alcohol use at twelve months follow-up and in follow-up studies investigating a similar protocol, the authors found that the computer assisted CBT/MI condition led to greater reductions in alcohol use at the 3 month follow-up assessment  [30, 36] .\n\nTwelve groups of researchers who included behavioral/psychological outcomes isolated the TAMI effects [e.g.,  37, 46, 50, 59, 62, 63] , allowing for evaluation of the influence of the TAMI itself on behavioral or psychological outcomes (See Table  4 ). Of these studies, ten groups reported positive results regarding the target behavior. For example, Alexander et al.  [65]  found a greater increase in fruit/vegetable consumption when MI-focused emails were sent in addition to participation in a web-based healthy eating program. Outlaw and colleagues  [62]  found that participants achieved a higher rate of goal success regarding HIV medication adherence after participating in an online TAMI. In contrast to improved target behaviors, Titov and colleagues  [72]  did not find any additional benefit in reducing social phobia symptoms with the addition of motivational strategies to an Internet based CBT program, but those in the TAMI arm reported higher completion rates. McClure and colleagues  [37]  reported more web-content was viewed when prescriptive messages were sent as opposed to motivational messages and Becker et al.  [46]  noted lower retention rates in the TAMI arm compared to a web-based assessment with personalized feedback. No studies reported negative effects due to the technological components.

To our knowledge, this is the first paper to review how technology has been used to deliver MI-based interventions (i.e., TAMIs). This topic is of increasing interest given the rising number of studies incorporating TAMIs into the study design -seventy percent of the papers reviewed were published between 2010-2015 and approximately twenty-five percent were published between 2014-2015. We found that researchers have used a range of technologies (e.g., chat rooms, automated responses, emoticons) to deliver TAMIs and related techniques (e.g., decision balances, readiness rulers, open ended questions). The results indicate that there is considerable promise for the use of TAMIs given that studies overall reported high acceptability and, for those that evaluated outcomes, researchers generally indicated positive behavior change."

      "text": "Limitations and suggestions for research-Some limitations of the research on TAMIs were identified in the review. First, although primary components of MI (e.g., expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance) were incorporated in various ways, few interventions included all or most of the features of MI as outlined by Miller and colleagues  [5] [6] [7]  with the median of four MI components included. TAMIs were best characterized as representing features rather than MI in its entirety.\n\nSecond, few investigators specifically addressed the issue of whether MI could be accurately delivered via technology. The 'how' is particularly important given the complexities of translating features of interpersonal interaction to technology and the strong relational focus of this intervention. While studies described methods such as automated computer prompts, chat rooms, emails, videos, and animated characters to deliver TAMIs, the majority of manuscripts did not describe how they translated MI principles into the technology-based method or how the relational components were resolved. The components of MI that investigators paid most attention to were strengthening commitment to change and developing discrepancy. We hypothesize that this is likely because there are structured tools related to these MI components (i.e., creating a change plan, decision balance exercise) that may be more easily translated to technology. It may be more difficult to translate aspects that require the MI spirit such as \"expressing empathy\" or \"collaboration\" to technology. While multiple studies included data on the clients' perspectives on the intervention, indicating that the programs supported and encouraged clients, these data do not address adherence or quality of MI delivery. In order to address these limitations, we suggest researchers investigating TAMIs incorporate more traditional fidelity measures (e.g., the MITI  [10] ). Treatment fidelity data would help researchers understand whether or not the components of MI (both technical and relational) are being delivered adequately via technology.\n\nTechnology that replaces FTF contact may have both positive and negative effects on treatment related variables (e.g., increased disclosure of sensitive information  [74] , but oversimplification of therapeutic information  [75] ). Given the interpersonal foundation of MI, future work is needed to understand the role of human interaction in MI-based interventions (i.e., Do individuals feel comfortable disclosing information? Do they understand the MI information when presented via technology? Are effects reduced when MI is delivered via technology compared to FTF?). This research will help improve the development of TAMIs moving forward. We also suggest future researchers detail specific ways both the technical and relational aspects are delivered. For example, how a computer program was developed to be empathic (e.g., Via emoticons? Open-ended questions? Video?). A minority of studies detailed how the protocol was developed to be MI consistent by providing verbatim examples (e.g.,  [23] ) and by discussing how aspects of the protocol aligned with MI principles (e.g.,  [24, 35] ). Such details provide future researchers information about optimal ways to deliver MI via technology. Outside of this review, Looijie and colleagues  [76]  provided a detailed example of how researchers could address these questions. Their study was non-intervention based, but rather posed questions such as how an animated character (i.e., the iCat) was rated on dimensions like empathy and acceptance. Similarly, Friederichs et al.  [77]  compared types of questions (open-ended without reflections, multiple choice with reflections and a combination) to see which type promoted greater autonomy when developing a web-based TAMI program. Because not all protocol details can be included in all data-driven papers, methodological papers or online appendices that outline how protocols were developed and delivered (e.g. [26] ) may be particularly helpful. Method based papers and supplemental appendices would assist in understanding whether non-technical aspects of MI can be successfully delivered via technology. Some potential options for increasing the spirit/relational components in TAMIs surfaced in the review. Researchers included emoticons, virtual 'buddies', or talking narrators in order to increase the possibility of more person-like discourse. Others collected information dedicated to understanding the participants' feedback beyond acceptability. Including these types of 'soft' outcomes (e.g., Asking questions such as: Did you feel pushed into a specific change strategy? Were you offered the opportunity to provide your own perspective on change?) may help future researchers obtain a better understanding of how participants felt during the intervention and may uncover ways researchers can increase the 'spirit' of MI within technology.\n\nThe final limitation that surfaced in this review was the lack of control groups isolating the TAMI effect and comparing it to FTF interactions. Approximately one third of the studies specifically varied the MI technology component, and no study design captured in the search strategy of this review included an RCT comparing the TAMI to a FTF MI control group. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions as to the efficacy of TAMIs. It is important to note that while the range of study design features was large (i.e., ratings fell between 2 -12; see Table  4 ), lower study design ratings do not necessarily indicate poorer study design. Rather, lower ratings may indicate different aims of the study such as preliminary pilot outcomes as opposed to tightly controlled efficacy outcomes. For instance, Osilla and colleagues  [24]  had the lowest study methods score, but their description of the MI components within the TAMI was one of the most comprehensive. This illustrates a more protocol design focused study as opposed to efficacy focused. Nonetheless, this range of research designs indicates that future research isolating the effects via RCTs or more controlled designs using FTF comparisons would help us understand the impact TAMIs have on behavior change. Comparison studies may also need to address new forms of outcomes that may be more appropriate for TAMIs, such as content viewed on websites  [37]  or frequency of text message responses  [45] , in order to operationalize TAMI effects.\n\nAddressing these major limitations would offer important new data focused on how to optimally use technology within this relationally focused therapeutic style. While the first step for researchers should be increasing awareness of the complexities associated with merging MI and technology, future researchers should also target if these interventions promote positive behavior change."

      "title": "Advantages of technology delivered",
      "text": "AMIs-Certainly one of the major advantages of the TAMI is to reduce the time and resources necessary for the interventionist. Because MI requires significant training  [78] , the use of TAMIs may reduce the need for staff to participate in costly and/or lengthy MI training programs. Researchers have identified a number of ways that TAMIs may reduce therapist burden. For example, Kay-Lambkin and colleagues  [43]  reported a 79% reduction of therapist time in the computer delivered CBT/MI (which included short FTF check-ins to review homework and assess risk) compared to the therapist delivered CBT/MI. Using TAMIs in conjunction with FTF contact may also provide a way to extend the intervention beyond what a therapist could offer FTF. Additionally, tools such as branching options also allow for personalized and tailored interventions without therapist-dedicated time. Training in MI can be time consuming and may not be feasible for a clinic; therefore, technology may offer a means to reduce therapist burden and allow clinicians who are trained in MI to use their skills in a productive and time-efficient way.\n\nTAMIs may also be used to enhance the fidelity to MI principles and the implementation of MI skills for interventionists. The use of certain technologies such as computer-assisted prompts and asynchronous communication may help guide treatment providers to elicit appropriate MI responses. For example, the use of technology such as email or other asynchronous methods may provide time for deliberation prior to responses  [79] . This would allow the counselors time to think about how to best emulate MI (e.g., using open as opposed to closed questions) within their response. Similarly, some studies used computer prompts to provide MI consistent responses for counselors  [57] . Thus asynchronous communication or technology assisted prompts may be effective ways to increase adherence for professionals who have limited experience or training in delivering MI. Multiple studies incorporated branching algorithms to tailor the intervention. It would be worthwhile to examine whether specific components of MI are more effective when delivered via technology or with the aid of technology versus FTF (e.g., Are technology based branching algorithms more accurate in tailoring to level of motivation than FTF counselors? Are asynchronous communications more MI consistent than synchronous communication?) Understanding the strengths and limitations of both technology delivered care and FTF care may assist in building more efficacious TAMIs. Finally, our review suggests that TAMIs have the potential to increase access to care for underserved populations (e.g., rural populations  [30, 80] ). In the present review, the samples were diverse with regard to socio-economic status (SES), clinical presentation (e.g., substance users, general population, overweight individuals), level of stigma surrounding target behavior (e.g., post-partum drug-use  [48, 49] , HIV medication adherence  [62] ), and recruitment settings (e.g., hospital and community settings). This suggests that TAMIs may be applied across populations, including those who are underserved or stigmatized, within a variety of settings. Moreover, studies of difficult to reach populations such as low-income urban post-partum women  [48, 49] , non-English speakers  [24] , and teens presenting at the ER  [27, 28, 35] , reported generally positive results and high satisfaction. Despite the opportunities to reach underserved populations through technology-based tools, there remain obstacles even with these approaches (e.g., individuals with a lower levels of education report less computer and internet access  [81] , ethnic minorities report reduced broadband internet access  [82] ). Indeed. VanDeMark and colleagues  [44]  noted that access to computers was one of the primary limitations to program use. Thus, while overall the results are encouraging, it is important to continue to investigate strategies for improving the implementation of technology delivered care in these populations."

      "title": "Limitations of the current review",
      "text": "While the results from the current review offer an important foundation for future research using technology within MI, there are important limitations regarding the review to be discussed. First, our review focused on protocols that self-defined as incorporating MI techniques specifically derived from seminal MI guides. This may have led to the exclusion of technology-based interventions (e.g., e-check-up to go, drinker's check-up) that used motivational techniques without labeling them as MI. Second, using different search terms may have identified a slightly different set of studies relevant to this domain. Third, Some of the manuscripts did not provide specific details surrounding the MI protocol, limiting our ability to assess whether or not MI can be effectively translated to technology. Finally, the methodological features of the studies ranged considerably and relatively few of them were designed to evaluate the impact of the TAMI on outcomes. Thus the question of whether TAMIs are efficacious or \"as good as\" FTF interventions is still largely unanswered."

      "text": "This systematic review examines current research on the use of technology to deliver adaptations of motivational interviewing to promote health-behavior change. This review has shown the wide range of technologies that have been used in this emerging field. These approaches offer a number of distinct advantages to traditional FTF treatment approaches. Although there have been relatively few studies that have tested the efficacy of TAMIs, extant research suggests that these approaches have considerable promise as a method of delivering adaptions of motivational interviewing across a variety of health behavior outcomes. Future research in this field may benefit from closer attention to the delivery of interpersonal components of MI (e.g., MI spirit), methods of assessing fidelity to treatment, and more detailed characterization of TAMI features."

      "text": "The studies reviewed suggest that TAMIs are acceptable among participants and potentially effective in changing target behaviors. TAMIs may offer distinct advantages such as decreased therapist burden and clinician training, the potential to extend treatment beyond a common set of sessions, a means to provide care to hard to reach populations or within clinics that have limited training resources, and potential for reduced stigma for individuals who are disclosing risky, illegal, or socially unsanctioned behavior (e.g., high risk sexual behaviors in MSM  [54] , post-partum drug use  [48, 49] , underage drinking  [35] ). While the research to date is still preliminary, future research in this area may help uncover optimal ways to deliver MI via technology in order to maximize a clinician's ability to reach a diverse set of clients in varied clinical settings.\n\nIndividuals with depression and chronic pain C: None E: Computer tablet intervention -E: Decrease in depression -Program was acceptable Alemagno et al.
