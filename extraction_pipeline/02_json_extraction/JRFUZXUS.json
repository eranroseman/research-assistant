  "abstract": "This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Children's Yale -Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). A total of 61 children and adolescents, aged 4 -18 years, who were diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) participated. Thirty-seven of these children also participated in a second CY-BOCS administration by the same rater an average of 41 days later. Good internal consistency and test -retest reliability were found for the CY-BOCS Obsession and Compulsion Severity Scores and the Total Score. CY-BOCS scores demonstrated strong correlations with clinician-rated measures of impairment, obsessions, and compulsions. In addition, CY-BOCS scores were moderately related to measures of depression, aggressive behavior, and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but were not significantly related to clinician ratings of tics or self-reports of general anxiety. Findings suggest that the CY-BOCS is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of childhood obsessions and compulsions.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common childhood and adolescent disorder, affecting between 2% and 4% of the general youth population  (Douglass et al., 1995; Maina et al., 1999; Rapoport et al., 2000) . Childhood OCD is associated with significant social, academic, and familial impairment  (Piacentini et al., 2003) , as well as comorbid psychiatric difficulties such as depression, social phobia, and substance dependence  (Douglass et al., 1995) . Further, youth with OCD are at risk for significant disruptions in normative social and educational development due to distress and frequent ritual engagement  (Thienemann et al., 2001) . Such impairment during childhood and adolescence has been associated with later interpersonal and psychological impairment in adulthood  (Flament et al., 1990; Thomsen and Mikkelsen, 1995) .\n\nThis growing awareness of and interest in childhood OCD have created the need for psychometrically sound clinician-rated measures for its assessment. The Children's Yale -Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS;  Scahill et al., 1997 ) is a clinician-rated instrument that is based on the adult version, namely the Yale -Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS;  Goodman et al., 1989a,b) . The CY-BOCS is a 10-item semi-structured measure of obsession and compulsion severity over the previous week. The measure is administered by a clinician to the child and parent(s) either jointly or separately based on the clinician's judgment. The clinician is given latitude to adjust ratings based on behavioral observations, clinical judgment, and other sources of information. Ratings of the severity of obsessions and compulsions assess five items each: time occupied by obsessions  (compulsions) , interference due to obsessions (compulsions), distress associated with obsessions (compulsions), resistance against obsessions (compulsions), and degree of control over obsessions  (compulsions) . The Obsessions Severity Score is derived by adding the five items pertaining to obsessions (range = 0 -20); the Compulsions Severity Score is derived by adding the five items pertaining to compulsions (range = 0 -20). A Total Score is derived by summing all items with higher scores corresponding to greater symptom severity.\n\nDespite the widespread use of the CY-BOCS in pediatric OCD trials, to date, only one psychometric investigation has been conducted  (Scahill et al., 1997) . High internal consistency was found for the CY-BOCS Total Score in a sample of 65 youth diagnosed with OCD (a = 0.87). Internal consistency for the Obsession and Compulsion Severity Scores was not reported in this study. Interrater agreement for the Obsession and Compulsion subscales, and the CY-BOCS Total Score ranged from good to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.66 -0.91). Convergent and divergent validity was supported, as the CY-BOCS scores demonstrated stronger associations with a measure of obsessive thinking than with measures of general anxiety and depression. In addition, CY-BOCS scores were negatively related to parent report of social competency. Finally, several studies have demonstrated that the CY-BOCS is sensitive to treatment effects  (Benazon et al., 2002; Geller et al., 2003; Piacentini et al., 2002; Scahill et al., 1997) . Although these data are encouraging, a number of important psychometric questions have yet to be addressed, namely what is the stability of the CY-BOCS and how does the CY-BOCS relate to clinician-rated impairment and behavior, and measures of anxiety other than the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale  (Reynolds and Richmond, 1985) ? Given that the CY-BOCS is widely used in studying pediatric OCD, formally evaluating the psychometric properties of this measure is crucial to accurate assessment.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the psychometric properties of the CY-BOCS. We addressed the following questions: (1) What are the internal consistency and interscale correlations of the CY-BOCS? (2) What is the stability of the CY-BOCS over a period of approximately 6 weeks? (3) Does the CY-BOCS correlate with measures of impairment, anxiety, depressive symptomatology, and Tourette's disorder symptomatology?"

      "text": "Participants were obtained from the following two sources: (1) consecutive patients diagnosed with OCD who were enrolled in a prospective observational research study examining Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder associated with Group A Streptococcal Infection (PANDAS) (n = 44), and (2) children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD who were seen for psychotherapy in the University of Florida Department of Psychiatry's Child and Adolescent Clinic (n = 17) between the dates of January 2000 and October 2003. For children in the PANDAS study, diagnoses were made based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Lifetime and Present versions (K-SADS-PL;  Kaufman et al., 1997)  and confirmed by a board-certified child psychiatrist (T.K.M.) with 10 years of experience. For children seen for psychotherapy, diagnoses were made by a licensed clinical psychologist with 15 years of experience in OCD treatment (G.R.G.). Secondary diagnoses, when present, were as follows: Tourette's disorder (n = 22), social phobia (n = 2), major depression (n = 1), oppositional defiant disorder (n = 1), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), com-bined type (n = 23). There were no differences in diagnostic patterns between children seen in the PAN-DAS study and those seen for psychotherapy.\n\nThe final sample consisted of 61 children and adolescents (27 females and 34 males). Children ranged in age from 4 to 18 years with a mean age of 10.33 years (S.D. = 3.13). A total of five children were under 7 years of age. The ethnic composition was as follows: 91.8% Caucasian, 1.6% African American, 4.9% Hispanic, and 1.6% Asian."

Initial psychometric data identified a four-factor model accounting for 99% of the model variance with factors named Aggression, ADHD, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and Tics. The TODS-PR is internally consistent (a = 0.92). Good convergent validity was found, with significant positive relations between the TODS-PR Total Score and the Tourette's Disorder Scale-Clinician-Rated version (r = 0.88), the Yale Global Tic Severity Score  (Leckman et al., 1989 ; r = 0.47), the Sheehan Disability Scale  (Sheehan et al., 1996 ; r = 0.65), and the Family Impact Scale  (Wilkinson et al., 2000 ; r = 0.59). In addition, TODS-PR factor items were positively and significantly related to items on the Child Symptom Inventory-Fourth Edition  (Gadow and Sprafkin, 1997 ; CSI-4) that measure similar constructs. Supporting divergent validity, the TODS-PR Total Score was not related to the psychosomatic and learning subscales of the Conners Parent Rating Scale  (Conners and Barkley, 1985) .

Clinicians who administered the CY-BOCS as part of the pretreatment assessment did not treat the patients. The CY-BOCS was administered to the child and parent(s) jointly, and the final rating was based on both responses, as well as clinical judgment. The CY-BOCS was administered jointly, as opposed to separately to the child and parent, to minimize the time needed to complete the assessment. The administering clinician also provided CGI ratings immediately after the baseline assessment.\n\nA portion of patients completed the MASC and CDI (n = 52) and were administered the TODS-PR (n = 40). The primary reason for not completing the MASC or CDI was age (e.g., too young). Children seen for psychotherapy were not administered the TODS-PR.\n\nProcedures for the CY-BOCS interviewer training are described in  Scahill et al. (1997) . Clinicians were a postdoctoral clinical psychology fellow for the psychotherapy participants or three licensed psychiatrists and one psychiatric nurse for the PANDAS study participants. All had extensive clinical experience working with pediatric OCD. Training consisted of an instructional meeting about the CY-BOCS content and structure with W.K.G. Clinicians completed the CY-BOCS for each interview. Discrepancies were discussed and clarified.\n\nTo examine the test -retest reliability of the measures, a subsample of 37 youth in the PANDAS study were readministered the CY-BOCS an average 40.76 days later (S.D. = 8.95; range = 23 -62 days) by a different clinician using similar procedures. Children in this subsample (males = 22 and females = 15) ranged in age from 6 to 17 years (M = 9.65, S.D. = 2.41). All of these children were being treated pharmacologically over this interval."

To examine convergent and divergent validity, Pearson productmoment correlations were computed between CY-BOCS scores and measures of anxiety, depression, Tourette's disorder symptoms, and clinician-rated impairment. Differences in the magnitude of corre-lations between the CY-BOCS Total Score and other measures were examined using Fisher's r to z transformations."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "The results of this study provide further evidence that the CY-BOCS is a reliable and valid clinicianrated measure for assessing OCD symptomatology in youth. The Obsession and Compulsion Severity  Scores, as well as the Total Score, demonstrated good internal consistency. A high level of intercorrelation between the CY-BOCS Obsession and Compulsion Severity Scores was evident, which could be adequately explained by a higher order factor related to OCD symptomatology. This finding is somewhat surprising as studies with adults have found a substantially lower relationship between the scales, suggesting a higher level of symptom dependence among youth (e.g., r = 0.19;  Arrindell et al., 2002) . Test -retest stability over an average of approximately 41 days for the total score and subscales was good. We found decreased reporting of symptoms at the second assessment. This issue, known as the retest effect, has been cited as a potential source of unreliability in psychometric studies  (Arrindell, 2001; Jensen et al., 1995; Storch et al., 2004) . That time 2 scores decreased without intervention has significant clinical implications, including the possibility that treatment effects may be artificially inflated or that researcher attention may have actual therapeutic effects  (Arrindell, 2001) . To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the temporal stability of the CY-BOCS. Information about temporal stability is integral in determining the extent to which differences in scores over time are due to actual or error variance.\n\nThe CY-BOCS demonstrated good convergent validity with a measure of global impairment and parent ratings of obsessions and compulsions on the TODS-PR. It is important to note, however, that the CGI is based on clinician ratings and, thus, the relations may be artificially inflated by shared method variance  (Campbell and Stanley, 1963) . Divergent validity was also satisfactory, as demonstrated by the findings of moderate relations between measures of depression and clinician ratings of aggressive behavior and ADHD symptoms. Somewhat surprisingly, the CY-BOCS scores were not significantly associated with ratings of general anxiety. One explanation for this finding is that childhood OCD is a conceptually distinct disorder not necessarily characterized by the general anxiety symptomatology assessed by the MASC.\n\nDespite positive psychometric findings, an uncertain issue is what scoring structure for the CY-BOCS is most appropriate. Although the use of separate obsession and compulsion scores was derived on a conceptual level, a different scoring structure may prove optimal. Indeed, the high relation between the Obsession and Compulsion Severity Scores may indicate that the actual factor structure of the CY-BOCS does not match its subscale structure, suggesting that a different scoring procedure may be optimal to increase the precision of assessment. Similar to the findings in adults (e.g.,  Amir et al., 1997; McKay et al., 1995 ), McKay et al. (2003)  found that two alternative twofactor models fit their sample data: one comprised obsession and compulsion factors, and one comprised disturbance and severity factors. Therefore, it will be important for future studies to confirm the CY-BOCS factor structure."

    {
      "title": "4.1.. Limitations",
      "text": "Several limitations of this psychometric investigation should be noted. First, the generalizability of our results may be constrained given that the present sample was largely Caucasian and many children's symptoms were related to PANDAS. Further, complete demographic information was not available for this sample. For example, although unstructured clinical interviews suggested that the majority of families were of ''middle class'' socioeconomic status or above, we were unable to determine the exact socioeconomic status of families. Second, we used selfreport measures to assess anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Youth may have underreported levels of distress to present a favorable impression. Third, we do not have information on the interrater reliability of the study clinicians. One indication, however, that rater agreement was high is the relatively high ICC values even with the use of different raters. Stated differently, strong consistency is shown between two administrations temporally separated and completed by different interviewers, which is a more stringent test than examining either factor alone. Fourth, diagnoses for participants receiving psychotherapy were made on the basis of an unstructured clinical interview and, thus, may reflect some subjectivity. On balance, it is worth noting that the diagnosing psychologist had considerable experience working with pediatric OCD and child psychiatric disorders. Finally, some of the participants in our test -retest sample received pharmacological services during the interval. Although ICCs were good across CY-BOCS scores, clinical services or the episodic nature of PANDAS-related OCD  (Murphy and Pichichero, 2002)  might have affected the strength of the stability coefficients found."

To our knowledge, this is the only clinician-rated instrument specifically designed to assess pediatric OCD and, as such, documenting the psychometrics of the CY-BOCS is of significance. Although the CY-BOCS is not intended to serve in isolation to diagnosis of childhood OCD, overall scores, as well as ratings on specific items, may assist in treatment planning and assessing treatment response. We highlight the need for future research to examine the CY-BOCS factor structure, as well as the temporal stability of the measure over short (e.g., 2 weeks) and long (e.g., 1 year) periods."
