  "abstract": "Aims: T2DM reach epidemic levels in the Arab countries. In this study, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to underline the susceptibility genetic profile of Arab patients with T2DM that result from SNPs. \n Methods: We searched four literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science) through January 2019. We included all SNPs in candidate genes with an OR > 1 that were associated with T2DM among Arab patients with T2DM. Statistical programs such as software Review Manager (Version 5.02) and STATA (Version 15.1) were used. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random effects model or a fixed effect model depending on the heterogeneity among studies. I 2 statistics and Egger's tests were performed to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. Results: Out of 2245 studies, 47 were used for meta-analysis. We captured 31,307 cases and 26,464 controls in which we collected 71 SNPs in 32 genes. A pooled meta-analysis demonstrated 24-69% increase in T2DM risk. Among the 57 SNPs (in 32 genes) that were not included in the meta-analysis, the OR for diabetes ranged from 1.02 to 5.10, with a median of 1.38 (interquartile range 1.33-2.09). Ten studies examined the association between the TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and T2DM, leading to an aggregated OR of 1.34 (95%CI 1.27-1.41). \n Conclusion: The genetic profile that confer susceptibility to T2DM in Arab patients is diverse. This study may serve as a platform for designing a gene panel for testing the susceptibility to T2DM.",

In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, 18 out of 21 countries are populated by Arabs; this demographic has the second  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2019.03.037  0168-8227/\u00d3 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Arab countries comprise 22 countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Comoros, Djibouti, Mauritania, and Yemen) that vastly diverse, both socioeconomically and geographically  [1, 2] . Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a complex disease that is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors  [3] . Genetic factors are believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of T2DM with a heritability rate that varies across different ethnic groups and is estimated to range from 20% to 80%  [4] . A positive family history of affected first degree relatives with T2DM increases the risk of developing T2DM by 3 times  [5] . The concordance rate of T2DM among monozygotic twins was reported at 70%, compared to 20%-30% among dizygotic twins, indicating that genetic factors contribute to the susceptibility of individuals to T2DM  [6] . Many candidate genes that are associated with susceptibility to T2DM were mapped across the genome through high-throughput SNP genotyping technology, and numerous SNPs in over 222 candidate genes were reported to be significantly associated with T2DM  [7] .\n\nT2DM is considered to have reached epidemic proportions throughout Arab countries  [1] , and genetics are believed to play an important role in the pathogenies of diabetes and may contribute to disease incidence in Arabs possibly due to the unique genetic architecture of Arabs which renders them susceptible diabetes  [1] ; furthermore, the majority of Arab T2DM patients are believed to be undiagnosed  [8] . Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis to investigate the significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes that are associated with susceptibility to and development of T2DM among patients from 22 Arab countries."

The selection was quality controlled by five scientists (AQ, FN, HA, NB and RB) independently to assure that the data were captured correctly. A consensus through discussion was reached to collect all the information related to the SNPs that were significantly associated with T2DM with an OR > 1 among Arab patients (Tables  1 ).

      "text": "Our initial search yielded 2245 citations, of which 47 met our inclusion criteria and were therefore included in our metaanalysis (Fig.  1 ). The 47 studies included in the metaanalysis were conducted in 13 different Arab countries. All of the studies were case-control studies in which the total number of cases was 31,307 cases and the number of controls was 26,464. The number of captured SNPs was 71, which mapped onto 32 different genes (Table  1 , Fig.  2 ). No genetic data were captured from 9/22 Arab countries (Camaros Island, Djibouti, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Syria, Bahrain, Somalia and Yemen). Most of the genetic studies captured populations in Tunisia (n = 10), Saudi Arabia (n = 10), Lebanon (n = 5), Morocco (n = 5), Egypt (n = 4), Qatar (n = 2). The Transcription Factor-7-Like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was the most reported among Arab patients with T2DM, and eight different SNPs were found in nine Arab countries. Interestingly, all variants of this gene were intronic. The most common variant detected among Arab patients was TCF7L2: c.382-41435C > T (rs7903146), which was identified in 16 different studies, followed by the variant TCF7L2: c.483 + 9017G > T (rs12255372), which was reported in eight Arab countries (Table  1 ). In the CDKAL1 gene, 17 SNPs were identified in four Arab countries (Morocco, Lebanon, Oman, and Tunisia) that were significantly associated with Arab patients with T2DM (Table  1 , Fig.  3 , and Supplementary Fig.  1 ).\n\nFourteen SNPs were eligible for meta-analysis based on the number of studies per SNP (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Of these 14 meta-analyses, five studies included five SNPs in TCF7L2 (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs4506565, rs12243326, and rs7901695); two studies included two SNPs in CDKAL1 (rs7754840 and rs10946398); and one study included one SNP for each of the genes CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), KCNJ11 (rs5219), FTO (rs9939609), IGF2BP2 (rs1470579), MTHFR (rs1801133), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), and HNF1A (rs7957197) (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The pooled meta-analysis for the individual 14 meta-analyses is shown in Fig.  3  and demonstrates the significant risk association between these 14 SNPs and developing T2DM.\n\nWe were able to perform publication bias for only one eligible SNP, which was reported in more than ten studies (Fig.  4 ). Although the funnel plot suggested no publication bias, Egger's test found otherwise (p = 0.014). No heterogeneity was found in any of the meta-analyses. Fig.  5  shows the ORs for diabetes among the 57 studies (32 genes, 59 SNPs) not included in the meta-analysis. The ORs for diabetes among these studies ranged from 1.02 to 5.10, with a median of 1.38 (interquartile range 1.33-2.09)."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the risk-associated gene polymor-phisms with T2DM among Arab patients in case-control studies. We captured all gene variants that were reported to be significantly associated with T2DM among Arab adults. The number of cases was 31,307, and the control was 26,464. We captured 71 SNPs in 32 genes (Table  1 ). Gene variants in 32 genes were found to increase the risk of T2DM by 30-40% based on the median of the OR compared to individuals without diabetes. We conducted 14 meta-analyses on 14 SNPs for nine different genes (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) that demonstrated the potential risk of developing T2DM. The pooled meta-analysis for the 14 different analyses indicated that there was no heterogeneity in the captured studies, and the pooled effect of the SNPs was potentially conferring significant risk, indicating that all captured SNPs potentially conferred the risk of developing T2D. Most of the ORs were in the range of 1.3-2.0, indicating a significant association (Supplementary    The TCF7L2 gene was the most reported among Arab patients with T2DM, and it was reported among patients from ten Arab countries (Palestine, UAE, Lebanon, Qatar, Tunisia, Sudan, Algeria, Oman, Egypt and Saudi Arabia) that are socioeconomically diverse. rs7903146 (c.382-41435 C > T), which is the most predominant intronic variant that repre-sents a 3-fold increased risk for T2DM among Arab patients  [9] , was reported in 11 different studies (Table  1 ) and was reported to significantly confer susceptibility to T2DM (Fig.  3  and Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Thus, rs7903146 is considered to be the most significant risk variant for developing T2DM to date  [10] . A recently published meta-analysis suggested that TCF7L2 is a member of the TCF family and acts as a transcription factor in a bipartite fashion (b-catenin/TCF)  [12] ; TCF7L2 plays an important role in regulating glucose metabolism in both the liver and pancreas  [13] . TCF7L2 is also an integrated signaling regulator of adipogenesis and is reported to reduce Fig. 3 -Summary of 14 individual meta-analyses. glucose-dependent insulin secretion and beta cell function  [14] . Therefore, changes in the structure of TCF7L2 due to genetic variants might cause adipocyte dysfunction and could be a cause of T2DM  [15] . The TCF7L2 gene is considered the most common susceptible gene for T2DM among various ethnic groups worldwide. We captured seventeen variants in the CDKAL1 gene in T2DM Arab patients in six individual studies that reported in six Arab countries (Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Oman, Mauritania, and Saudi Arabia) that are geographically and socioeconomically diverse; interestingly, most of the SNPs were found in Lebanon (16/17), with rs7756992 (n = 2), rs7754840 (n = 4) and rs10946398 (n = 2) reported in more than a single study (Table  1 ). A comprehensive meta-analysis investigated 21 studies for rs7756992, 17 studies for rs7754840 and ten studies for rs10946398 of the CDKAL1 gene, and their effect on the genetic susceptibility to T2DM found that these three SNPs showed significant associations with T2DM among different ethnic groups  [16] .\n\nWe found three significantly mutated genes among our T2DM patients' cohorts that were associated with obesity (ADIPOQ, FTO, and MC4R). Three SNPs were mapped to the FTO gene (n = 3) among Iraqi, Tunisian, and Palestinian patients  [17] [18] [19] . We captured six SNPs in two studies (n = 2) in the ADIPOQ gene: four were identified among Tunisian T2DM patients (n = 1)  [20] , and two SNPs were captured among Egyptian patients (n = 1)  [21] . We captured one SNP in the obesity gene MC4R (rs6567160); this SNP was considered the most significant SNP in a meta-analysis of BMI that was performed on 71,412 individuals among African Americans  [22] . The FTO gene plays an important role in controlling energy consumption and feeding behavior, and it is described as ''the first locus unequivocally associated with adiposity\"  [23] . The ADIPOQ gene is exclusively expressed in adipose tissues and is involved in fatty acid breakdown in the liver and muscles and in regulating glucose levels  [24] , stimulating the consumption of energy. The MC4R gene is considered to be the most common cause of monogenic obesity  [25] . Genetic variants in the FTO, ADIPOQ, and MC4R genes are associated with obesity, which represents a major risk of developing T2DM  [26] . According to the WHO, there is a high prevalence of obesity among Arabs, especially the Arabs of the Gulf, mainly in Kuwait, United Arab Emirate, and Saudi Arabia  [27] .\n\nThe KCNJ11 gene contributes to the formation of four out of the eight subunits of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel of the pancreatic beta cells that secrete insulin. Our search strategy found KCNJ11-rs5219 in six studies (n = 6) among Arab patients belonging to five countries (Tunisia, Mauritania, Oman, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia). Numerous reports have reproduced the association of SNPs in the KCNJ11 gene with susceptibility to T2DM; more specifically, a meta-analysis and 24 association studies reiterated a strong association between the rs5219 polymorphism and susceptibility to T2DM, whereas 21 studies did not replicate this relationship  [28] .\n\nThe HNF1A and HNF4A genes are known to be associated with monogenic diabetes of the young (MODY) genes  [29, 30] . Among Arab patients, the variant HNF1A rs7957197 was detected (n = 1) among T2DM patients from Tunisia and Morocco. Our search identified the variant HNF4A: rs4812829 in Saudi Arabian patients with T2DM; this variant was previously identified as conferring a significant risk for patients with T2DM from Asia and Europe  [31] . These two genes are involved in beta cell functions. Polymorphisms in these genes that do not cause MODY were found to be associated with susceptibility to T2DM in different ethnic groups. Mutant forms of HNF1A and HNF4A were reported to decrease secretion of insulin  [29, 30] .\n\nWe used STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ ) to demonstrate the potential interaction between the genes we captured, the genes were transferred to Cytoscape v3.7.1 ( https://cytoscape.org/ ) for demonstration (Fig.  6A ), and we found massive network of interactions of the genes, suggesting overlapping functions. We conducted a PANTHER classification analysis with the 32 genes  [32] , we found that these genes are contributing to diverse number of molecular functions (Fig.  6B ) and different pathway involvement (Fig.  6C ), including, glucose levels and insulin regulation pathways; for example, the GLUT1 gene plays an important role in glucose transport across plasma membranes  [33, 34] . The IRS-1 plays a role in insulin signal transduction. The SLC30A8 is important in glucose homeostasis, and CAPN10 may play a role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and the IGF2BP2 may play a role in glucose hemostasis and beta cell function  [35] . These genes and the remainder captured genes in our study seem to have a complex network of interactions, as shown in Fig.  6 , and several or a few might take part in the pathogenesis of T2DM; these putative interactions merit further investigation.\n\nWe performed 14 meta-analyses for 14 different SNPs that were detected in nine genes to investigate the association between these SNPs and T2DM susceptibility profiles among Arabs; the ORs ranged from 1.19 to 7.43. Pooled estimates for the summary of the 14 meta-analyses showed that these SNPs are associated with risk, and no publication bias was observed; the publication bias plot showed symmetry in the publications (Fig.  4 ). This was done only for one SNP that  satisfied the publication bias criteria when only the ten or more studies that we could assess the publication bias for were considered.\n\nWe encountered several limitations in our study. First, there are a limited number of genetic epidemiological studies about T2DM in the Arab world and therefore we could not perform a sensitivity analysis to confirm the reliability and stability of the meta-analysis. Second, there was a lack of a comprehensive publicly accessible diabetes registry. Third, we were not able to perform a publication bias analysis because most of the SNPs were found in less than ten publications.\n\nIt seems that Arabs share susceptibility alleles with other ethnic groups. It surprised us that most of the studies were conducted in Lebanon and Tunisia, while Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt have the greatest T2DM prevalence. According to the last report from the IDF, obesity rates in Arabs are one of the highest in the world. Therefore, we think the current efforts to understand the Arab genome  [36, 37]  will help in characterizing Arab patients with T2DM and resultant Fig.  5  -Odds ratio (95% CI) for T2DM according to the SNPs in the Arab countries. All the single studies which are not meta analyzed are presented in this Figure . analyses are expected to identify Arab-specific variants that might be important in the molecular pathology of T2DM and might contribute to identifying meaningful genotypephenotype correlations. These studies might contribute to disease prognosis and disease management in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, we collected 71 SNPs that were reported in case-control studies that are significantly associated with Arab patients with T2DM that belong to 13 Arab countries. We performed 14 meta-analyses for 14 different SNPs that were captured in nine different genes, and we combined these 14 meta-analyses in a single, representative metaanalysis. Although the pooled meta-analysis of the 14 SNPs that were captured in nine different genes is statistically powerful, the number of studies that evaluate such combined effects is considered to be small. Compared to the magnitude of the problem in the Arab world, there is a need for better, well-controlled epidemiological studies that serve as a base for dissecting the genetic architecture that renders Arab patients susceptible to T2DM. We were able to map the significant interaction of the affected proteins in this study; mapping is expected to positively aid molecular diagnostic technology for diabetes by developing a diagnostic panel for diabetes. However, more studies need to be performed to pinpoint the significance of these genes in contributing to the direct pathogenesis of T2DM. Therefore, this study may serve as a platform for designing a gene panel for testing the susceptibility of Arab patients to T2DM and will be helpful in global molecular diagnostic purposes."
