  "title": "Effectiveness of Mobile App-Assisted Self-Care Interventions for Improving Patient Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and/or Hypertension: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile app-assisted self-care interventions are emerging promising tools to support self-care of patients with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The effectiveness of such interventions requires further exploration for more supporting evidence. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to examine the effectiveness of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions developed for type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension in improving patient outcomes. Methods: We followed the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus for relevant studies published between January 2007 and January 2019. Primary outcomes included changes in hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Changes in other clinical-, behavioral-, knowledge-, and psychosocial-related outcomes were included as secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes and objective secondary outcomes that were reported in at least two trials were meta-analyzed; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 27 trials were identified and analyzed. For primary outcomes, the use of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions was associated with significant reductions in HbA 1c levels (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.44, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.29; P<.001), SBP (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.03, P=.02), and DBP (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.03, P=.02). Subgroup analyses for primary outcomes showed that several intervention features were supportive of self-management, including blood glucose, blood pressure, and medication monitoring, communication with health care providers, automated feedback, personalized goal setting, reminders, education materials, and data visualization. In addition, 8 objective secondary outcomes were meta-analyzed, which showed that the interventions had significant lowering effects on fasting blood glucose levels and waist circumference. A total of 42 secondary outcomes were narratively synthesized, and mixed results were found. \n Conclusions: Mobile app-assisted self-care interventions can be effective tools for managing blood glucose and blood pressure, likely because their use facilitates remote management of health issues and data, provision of personalized self-care recommendations, patient-care provider communication, and decision making. More studies are required to further determine which combinations of intervention features are most effective in improving the control of the diseases. Moreover, evidence regarding the effects of these interventions on the behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes of patients is still scarce, which warrants further examination.",

      "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are two common, serious medical conditions that can lead to the development of other disabling and life-threatening health problems such as stroke and heart attack. The two diseases are closely interlinked and frequently coexist. Globally, approximately 80% of type 2 diabetic patients have hypertension  [1] . US statistics indicate that type 2 diabetes is 2.5 times more prevalent in hypertensive individuals than in normotensive individuals  [2] . In Hong Kong, 58% of diabetic patients exhibit increased blood pressure (BP), whereas 56% of hypertensive patients have hyperglycemia  [3] . These figures emphasize that the treatment and management of both of these conditions are essential.\n\nDiabetes and hypertension management requires lifelong self-care by patients, which can be demanding and overwhelming because patients are often unskilled or unaware of self-care and also lack the necessary knowledge, tools, and support  [4] . Technology is increasingly being used to help address these challenges. In particular, mobile app-assisted interventions that capitalize on smart and networking features are suggested to facilitate patient-care provider communication, information exchange, health literacy, decision making, and peer support, without the constraints of time and geography  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , all of which are important for self-care.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions developed for type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension requires more supporting evidence and thus warrants a systematic review. First, previous reviews on the use of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions for diabetes  [12] [13] [14] [15]  and hypertension  [16]  have mainly focused on the effects of these interventions on hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) levels or BP and have paid relatively little attention to other variables important for effectiveness evaluation such as behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes. Second, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  [17] [18] [19]  have recently been conducted to test the effects of such interventions on patient outcomes, and these studies must be reviewed. Third, little is known about the features of such technologies that are effective at improving blood glucose (BG) and BP management. In light of such knowledge gaps, this study systematically reviewed the existing evidence on the effectiveness of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions developed for type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension in improving patient outcomes. In this review, mobile health apps refer to mobile device-based software programs that provide health-related resources and support for the self-care of patients with type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension."

      "text": "This systematic review identified 27 trials that examined the effectiveness of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions developed for type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension. Overall, our review showed that the use of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions led to significant reductions in HbA 1c levels, SBP, and DBP-the fundamental clinical parameters in diabetic and hypertensive patients. For HbA 1c levels, we observed an SMD of -0.44 and an absolute MD of -0.49%. The effect size was clinically meaningful and similar to that reported in previous reviews that examined other similar types of health technology (ie, SMD -0.30 to -0.40  [15, 46] , absolute MD -0.40 to -0.49%  [12] [13] [14] [15] 47] ). As for BP, overall, the use of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions led to significant reductions in SBP (SMD -0.17, absolute MD -2.32 mm Hg) and DBP (SMD -0.17, absolute MD -1.53 mm Hg).\n\nThe subgroup analysis of BP by disease type showed that among hypertensive patients, the effect size for SBP (SMD -0.28, absolute MD -4.20 mm Hg) could be regarded as clinically important and was similar to that found in previous reviews that studied hypertensive patients (absolute MD -3.74 to -4.71 mm Hg)  [48] [49] [50] . However, diabetic patients did not show significant reductions in SBP, consistent with previous reviews that examined changes in SBP among diabetic patients  [15, 47] . This observation could be explained by the reason that the diabetic patients examined might not have severe hypertension; therefore, room for BP reduction in those patients was relatively low. Significant reductions in DBP were not observed in either hypertensive patients or diabetic patients.\n\nAll of the reviewed interventions had more than one feature, and our subgroup analysis revealed that the effects of the features on patient outcomes varied, as follows. The presence of medication-, BG-, and BP-monitoring features were favorable in reducing HbA 1c levels, SBP, and DBP. Such result could be because patients already had a belief that the behaviors of monitoring of medication, BG, and BP were more immediately relevant to the control of the diseases, and, thereby, with the support of the features, patients' engagement in the behaviors was further developed. Also, because the features could enable the tracking and organization of the health parameters in a more structured and systematic manner  [16, 51] , patients could be more likely to be confident in their self-care and achieve improved outcomes  [52] . For diet-, physical activity-, and body weight-monitoring features, their presence yielded limited efficacy. This may be due to the reason that patients might perceive the behaviors of dietary, exercise, and body weight control less directly relevant for diabetes and hypertension control, so patients' use of the features or their engagement in the behaviors could be weak. Or even though the behaviors were considered important, it might not be easy for patients to engage in them, especially long term  [53] . Education or motivational strategies may be necessary for increasing patients' awareness about importance of diet, physical activity, and body XSL \u2022 FO RenderX weight control in chronic disease management. Features that enabled automated feedback and communication with HCPs were effective in improving patient outcomes. This finding could probably be explained by the fact that providing personalized feedback and suggestions based on patient health data and conditions could help patients interpret changes in their vital signs and inform them about how to deal with different situations related to the variability in their vital signs. This was especially true for patients who had low health literacy and were unable to make good use of health information. The presence of the personalized goal setting feature was favorable in reducing BP because setting specific, realistic, and timely goals could make patients more motivated to engage in planned and targeted disease management. However, this observation was not consistently reported for HbA 1c levels. Further evaluation is required to clarify the situations under which goal setting has a positive effect and the manner in which this feature could be used more effectively. The presence of reminder, education material, and data visualization features was associated with desirable reductions in SBP. In particular, these features could lead to higher adherence to self-care behaviors, enhanced diabetes and hypertension knowledge, and improved decision making. However, the trend was not consistently observed for HbA 1c levels and DBP; therefore, the efficacy of these features warrants further examination.\n\nWith respect to secondary outcomes, our meta-analyses indicated that mobile app-assisted self-care interventions had significant lowering effects on FBG and waist circumference. No significant differences were observed in body weight, BMI, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides between the intervention and control groups, probably because the design of the interventions was less targeted for these health indexes. Our narrative synthesis indicated that in a small number of trials, the interventions were helpful in improving several clinical, behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes. According to these trials, it appeared that such interventions have a potential to engage patients in disease management, including maintaining a healthy lifestyle, improving self-care knowledge, and addressing psychosocial needs. On the other hand, there were trials that examined these outcomes that did not show positive effects. In fact, two trials demonstrated negative effects of the mobile app-assisted self-care interventions on depression and medication dose. Given the mixed results yielded from only a small set of studies, to further understand the impacts of the interventions on these outcomes in the self-care of the diseases, more research is needed."

      "title": "Implications for Research",
      "text": "Our review suggests several implications for research. First, limited RCTs have emphasized behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial aspects as primary outcomes in their examination. Further RCTs should focus more on these outcomes to obtain better understanding of whether or not, how, and to what extent mobile app-assisted health interventions change the health, self-care behaviors, and health technology adoption behaviors of patients; expand their knowledge base about health decision making and care; and influence their feelings about and attitudes toward technology-based self-care. Second, although the associations between each intervention feature and improvements in patient outcomes have been examined, information about the appropriate/optimal combinations of the features is important and limited. Future studies should further examine which combinations of intervention features are more effective for patients and disease self-care. Perhaps, the design can exploit artificial intelligence techniques to identify patients' needs and then combine and present appropriate features tailored to those needs. In addition, our results also indicated that some features, including personalized goal setting; data visualization; and monitoring of diet, physical activity, and body weight, were not always associated with (more) improvements in patient outcomes. Further studies are required to determine the possible reasons for these observations, such as variations in patients' acceptance and adoption of the features, engagement in the self-care activities that the features intended to support, or perceptions of the design and efficacy of the features. Design of the technology as well as patients' attitudes toward and acceptance of the technology determine whether the technology could demonstrate its benefits and impacts  [11, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . Third, the implementation duration for most of the reviewed studies was 6 months or less, which is a relatively short time period for studying health behaviors related to chronic disease management. Whether the technology would motivate patients to engage in self-care activities and achieve long-term sustained benefits remains unknown."

      "title": "Implications for Practice",
      "text": "Our review also provides recommendations for the design and development of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions. First, our results suggest that mobile app-assisted self-care interventions should incorporate features including logging, personalized feedback, communication with HCPs, education, and data visualization in the design and implementation phases of the interventions. This suggestion is consistent with that of Greenwood et al  [45]  who recommended that it is important to provide a complete feedback loop between patients and their HCPs that incorporates communication, logging data, education, and personalized feedback to make the self-care process more effective. Second, some studies suggested that technical difficulties or usability problems were associated with patient withdrawals  [30, 32, 44] , whereas some other studies reported that lacking a user-friendly design is one of the most common reasons for nonadoption or low use of the technology  [55, 61, 62] . These issues emphasize that the design and development of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions should follow human factors design methodologies and principles  [55, [63] [64] [65] [66]  to provide more reliable and convenient technologies for self-care. Usability tests are important in the design and development phases to identify design deficiencies. Third, some trials reported a decline in the use of such interventions over the implementation duration  [34, 37, 41] . More effective mobile app-assisted self-care interventions should be developed to motivate patients to engage in self-care behaviors and further enhance health-related outcomes."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "Our review has several strengths. It provides evidence regarding the effects of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions developed for type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension on patient outcomes. In addition to HbA 1c levels and BP, several relevant outcomes that were scarcely examined in previous reviews are also analyzed in our review. Our review also provides an evidence-based review of the features of such interventions and their associations with improvements in glycemic and BP control. Our study has limitations. First, although type 2 diabetes and hypertension overlap in population and are closely interlinked, combining the two diseases into one systematic review may cause high heterogeneity. In this study, subgroup analysis by disease type was only conducted for primary outcomes to understand the effects of the intervention in different disease population. The effects of the intervention on the secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution due to the variability in disease type. Second, the reported effects should be interpreted with caution because control patients in some of the reviewed trials received enhanced usual care, including additional education or phone call communications with their HCPs. Third, 42 patient outcomes were examined using narrative synthesis by simply counting their statistical significance. The effect sizes and significant levels of these outcomes were not obtained. Fourth, publication bias was detected when BMI was the examined outcome. Fifth, only English language articles were included in our review, which may have introduced language and publication bias. Finally, the review lacked an a priori and published protocol."

      "text": "For type 2 diabetic and/or hypertensive patients, performing self-care and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are necessary but also challenging. The use of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions appears to be effective in improving glycemic and BP management and control; however, this effectiveness was not consistent in some other outcomes. Hence, further investigations on the effects of the interventions on other outcomes are warranted. Moreover, it will be valuable to determine which combinations of features of such interventions are most effective in achieving improvements in the desired outcomes, as it can guide the optimal design of such interventions."
