  "title": "The impact of utilizing inclusive leadership among nurses during crises: A multisite comparative study",
  "abstract": "Nurses' psychological wellness and satisfaction are threatened by exposure to many stressors. Adopting a promising leadership style has beneficial impacts at different levels, especially during crises. This study aimed to examine the impact of inclusive leadership on nurses' satisfaction and psychological distress during crises, focusing on three Arabic countries. A cross-sectional descriptive design was utilized to meet the study goal. Data were collected electronically in the three countries using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Carmel's Inclusive Leadership Scale. Two hundred seventy-four participants fully responded: 90 from Egypt, 82 from Saudi Arabia, and 102 from Jordan. Descriptive statistics, Pearson R, Spearman Rho, Point biserial, and ANOVA tests were used to answer the research questions. There were statistically significant differences between countries in the mean scores of inclusive leadership and psychological distress. In addition, statistically significant relationships between inclusive leadership, psychological distress, and job satisfaction were found. The study focused on the importance of approaching inclusive leadership to increase employee satisfaction, reduce psychological distress, and achieve organizational goals.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Nursing is widely recognized as one of the most demanding professions in the world, as nurses are exposed to physical and psychological problems due to the nature of their work  [1] . Nurses, in particular, have faced heightened risks during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with increased exposure to life-threatening infections. This exposure negatively impacts the well-being of nurses, largely because highly contagious pathogens pose a significant threat. Moreover, nurses often work in isolation units or other settings where direct contact with infected individuals is common  [2] . Psychological distress is widespread among nurses as researchers have linked depression and anxiety to exposure to life-threatening conditions and other serious work-related stressors  [3] .\n\nLeaders' roles can positively influence the level of psychological wellness among nurses. Fair leadership has been shown to minimize the symptoms of depression and anxiety in contaminated work environments  [4] . Leaders and organizations need to spot factors and adopt leadership styles that promote the psychological wellness of nurses in such complicated environments since they affect the quality of care provided and the main organizational outcomes. One of the modern influencing leadership styles in such situations is Inclusive Leadership  [5] .\n\nInclusive leadership helps alleviate mental pressure among employees  [6] . Leaders adopting inclusiveness add value to the organization by treating employees from diverse cultural backgrounds effectively, implementing a culture of equity and fairness, and initiating a healthy work environment that promotes psychological wellness  [7] .\n\nIt is undisputed that workplace job satisfaction is important to retain and develop human capital in the business strategy  [8] . Job satisfaction in nursing is related to role performance, provided care quality, and the satisfaction of clients  [9] . However, nurses are often unsatisfied due to many internal and external factors  [10] . Inclusive leadership integrates many concepts that play dynamic roles in incorporating nurses in decisions and mapping their career plans, thus promoting job satisfaction among nurses. The COVID-19 pandemic shed light on this issue and its impacts on nurses and organizations  [11] .\n\nEffective leadership inspires a constructive work environment that ensures the optimal achievements of each person  [12] . Thus, adopting a promising leadership style such as inclusive leadership is necessary to improve nurses' job satisfaction, psychological wellness, and ability to cope with stressors, achieve organizational goals, and improve the quality of care  [13] . The study examined the impact of inclusive leadership on nurses' satisfaction and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in three major Arabic countries: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan.\n\nThis study made its significance by shedding light on the importance of implementing inclusive leadership in hospitals in the Arabic region, whereas no such studies have been conducted. Furthermore, it is the first study applied at the regional level (3 main Arabic countries), in which the results were compared and justified. In addition, inclusive leadership impact was studied on two of the most important outcomes affecting nursing retention, quality of provided care, and patient safety. Moreover, the study was conducted during the COVID pandemic, when the surrounding conditions and employees' demands were different and increased."

      "text": "A cross-sectional-descriptive design was utilized to examine the impact of inclusive leadership on psychological distress and job satisfaction among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the results between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. The authors developed an online questionnaire and distributed it to the most popular nursing groups in the three countries through various social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.\n\nThe G*Power 3 software  [14]  was used to compute the sample size. Based on G power calculations, a total of 200 participants was required minimum for an \u03b1 of .05, a power of 0.80, and a medium effect size of 0.25. The link to the questionnaire was shared with the most popular nursing groups on social media platforms in the three countries. A total of 274 participants fully responded and answered all questions in the questionnaire, with 90 participants from Egypt, 82 from Saudi Arabia, and 102 from Jordan. All participants met the following inclusion criteria: working directly with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, being able to read and write both Arabic and English and holding at least a diploma degree in nursing. Nurses not assigned to care for COVID-19 patients were excluded from the study."

To assess psychological distress (depression and anxiety), the authors used the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), a valid and reliable 10-item-5 points Likert scale. Scores below 25 indicate normal or mild symptoms, 25-29 suggest moderate, and 30-50 indicate severe symptoms. K-10 is a valid and reliable tool; the reported Cronbach's alpha is 0.88  [15] . In this study, the K-10 showed good consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.82).\n\nJob satisfaction was measured using the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), a valid and reliable 20-item-5-point Likert scale. Scores range from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Reported Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.85-0.91 [16] . In this study, the Cronbach's alpha was 0.85. Inclusive leadership was assessed using Carmel's Inclusive Leadership Scale, a valid and reliable 9-item-7 points scale with a reported Cronbach's alpha of 0.94. Scores range from 7 to 63  [17] .

Furthermore, the higher inclusive leadership behaviors in Egypt than in other countries is an additional justification, as job satisfaction was positively correlated with inclusive leadership.\n\nThe results showed that the majority of nurses in the three countries suffer from moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. These results align with results reported in Malaysia  [31]  and China  [28] . This underscores the need for nursing administrators to develop a well-structured workplace protocol to alleviate psychological distress among nurses. This protocol should contain guidelines to curb psychological distress levels, measures to identify suitable nurses, and actions to handle affected nurses. Adopting inclusive leadership is an important, affordable option, as this study showed a significant negative relationship between psychological distress and inclusive leadership.\n\nAdditionally, it was found that older nurses, expert nurses, nurses with higher education, and nurses in supervisory positions had significantly less psychological distress. This finding aligns with existing literature, as it is widely recognized that nurses with greater age, experience, education, and supervisory responsibilities tend to have greater expertise in coping with workplace stressors, which are reflected in their psychological wellness  [28] .\n\nSpecifically, Saudi Arabian nurses reported higher psychological distress than those from Jordan and Egypt. This finding might be due to the extreme cultural diversity in the workplace in Saudi Arabia. Recent literature showed that Saudi nurses comprise around 38% of the total nurses in the kingdom, and the other proportion considered foreign nurses from countries such as the Philippines, India, and Malaysia  [32] . Another contributing factor may be the challenges discussed in another study  [33] , including a lack of specialty, education, and research opportunities, which could contribute to increased psychological distress among Saudi nurses."

      "text": "Nurses are the frontline healthcare professionals who work against the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for nursing and hospital leaders in the Arabic region and globally, emphasizing the significance of adopting inclusive leadership. This leadership style can positively impact nurses' job satisfaction and psychological wellness, specifically after the COVID-19 battle. This recommendation is supported by the results of another study  [19] , which found that inclusive leadership could curb psychological distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and foster a culture of psychological safety among nurses after the COVID-19 crisis. Improving nurses' psychological wellness and satisfaction will be very helpful in meeting the organizational, national, and regional contemporary health vision by improving the quality of the care provided and patients' safety  [34, 35] ."

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": "Crises management is an integral part of organizational management, and in today's globalized world, diversity has become a prevalent feature within organizations. Managing crises in culturally diverse organizations is a major challenge facing leaders during those times. Leaders need to recognize how to execute their roles effectively to gain the optimal advantages of diversi-circumstances, and little is known about the roles of leadership styles during pandemics and crises  [18] . This study worked on filling this gap by investigating the impact of inclusive leadership during significant workplace changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this is a multi-site study that collected data from three Arabic countries to confirm the results, being the first study conducted at the regional level within the Arab nations.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the mean inclusive leadership score among the three countries was around the midpoint, indicating that nurses perceived the behaviors of their leaders as moderately inclusive during the pandemic. These results are relatively lower than those reported in South Korea  [17]  and Wuhan, China  [19] . No data were available about the situation in Arabic countries for comparison. This acceptable moderate level of perceived inclusive leadership could be attributed to the unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Crises of this magnitude may prompt nursing leaders to adopt more open, accessible, and available communication approaches with their nursing staff, ultimately leading to an increase in perceived inclusive leadership qualities  [18, 20] .\n\nThe results showed that younger females with less experience and lower education tended to perceive their nursing leaders as more inclusive. This result agrees with another study, which also observed an increase in perceptions of inclusiveness among younger and less experienced female nurses, although it did not find a significant association with education level  [21] . The negative correlation between inclusive leadership and education might be justified by the advanced abilities of nurses with postgraduate degrees to critique and appraise the organizations and their advanced and integrated vision toward leadership practices.\n\nEgyptian nurses reported a higher level of inclusive leadership than those from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Differences in workplace conditions in terms of organizational structure and accreditation bodies of control and the nature of humans in perceiving stressors in difficult situations may explain the variation. Egyptian nurses have solid cultural relationships with colleagues and leaders, which makes them accessible and available all the time  [22] . On the other hand, the lower level of perceived inclusive leadership in Saudi Arabia compared to other countries might be linked to the severe shortage of Saudi nurses, leading the country to rely on nurses from various nations and cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe mean score of job satisfaction among the three countries included in the study was slightly above its midpoint, suggesting a moderate level of nurses' job satisfaction. These results are congruent with those reported in Iran  [23]  and Iraq  [24] , but higher than those reported in Beijing  [25] , the Philippines  [26] , and the United Kingdom  [27] . Since nurses are considered frontline healthcare professionals, efforts are still needed to increase nurses' job satisfaction  [28, 29] .\n\nIn the same context, the study found that nurses working less than 40 hours per day and nurses working in supervisory positions had higher job satisfaction scores. This could be explained by the fewer working hours and the nature of the supervisory positions in which less physical effort is needed. Previous studies showed contradictory results, where job satisfaction significantly differed based on nurses' sex, age, and years of experience, but not necessarily according to job designation or working hours  [30] . This contradiction is accepted since the cultural backgrounds are different between the studies. Specifically, Egyptian nurses reported a higher level of job satisfaction compared to nurses from Saudi Arabia and Jordan. This"
