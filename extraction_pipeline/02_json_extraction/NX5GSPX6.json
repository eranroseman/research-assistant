Learning health systems are those which engage patients and elicit patientreported outcomes (PROs) data to continuously improve and drive clinical practice.1 Incorporating PROs into clinical decision making and health management has led to improvements in patients' quality of life, improved patient-provider communication, and reductions in unscheduled acute care such as emergency department visits.2,3 Nonetheless, in real-world contexts, collecting PROs has remained challenging and integration into clinical decisions remains sparse.4,5 A large motivator for change in how health care is delivered, monitored, and researched has been the boom of simple digital technologies. The ubiquity of mobile health devices (cell phones, smart phones, tablets) continues to permeate society and health.6 Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has dramatically scaled the use of digital technologies in health care.7 Engaging patients and capturing PROs remotely, in between outpatient visits would provide a robust and deep understanding to support care remotely.5 As digital strategies continue to expand, research has yet to describe the optimal ways to reach patients and capture PROs. Indeed, less is known about the various methods of engaging, collecting and monitoring patient reported data in remote fashions. Testing varying approaches would provide clinicians and researchers critical data and inform the use of effective strategies. Research in areas of mobile health (mhealth) has grown dramatically in the past decade.8 Health care providers have attempted to use mhealth to track medication adherence9,10, encourage healthy ehaviors11, boost home monitoring12, and institute automated 'hovering' to track chronic disease.13 The rapid growth is likely largely due scalability, accessibility, and lack of large federal regulations. The evidence generated by these studies has not been well defined or characterized.14,15 In today's digital era, what is the best way to interact with patients remotely? How do researchers and providers build systems which efficiently capture meaningful patient-centered data?

This was an intentional design of a larger institutional program aimed to understand acute opioid prescribing. The approach allows for remote consent in an attempt to offload clinical providers and improve the scale of engaging eligible patients. Following an elective, outpatient surgery within the Department of Orthopaedics, patients receive a brief initial text message within a two-day period following the procedure. This message informs the patient of 1) safe text messaging data practices; 2) links to further information regarding follow up research study; 3) offers the ability to opt-in or opt-out of further messaging. Patients consent via a simple text response of \"yes.\" Enrolled patients were then sent text messages on post-operative days number 4, 7, 10, and 14. Patients were block randomized to receiving either 1) a hyperlink to a web based mobile survey or 2) automated, chatbot questions in a conversational text messaging fashion. Mobile survey questions and conversational questions were identical and included questions on patientreported pain intensity, use of prescribed pain medications, and ability to control pain. Block randomization was used to achieve balance in the two groups across demographics, procedure date, and dates of mobile engagement.\n\nImportantly, in accordance with institutional approval, individuals who either 1) did not respond, 2) opted-out, or 3) self-reported no further planned use of acute opioid medications were not subsequently messaged. For example, if a participant completed either the mobile survey or conversational messaging on post-operative day 4 and indicated they were no longer planning on using their opioid prescription, no further messaging was sent on day 7, 14, 21 or 28. Participants who did not respond to any messaging, would receive a reminder message within 30 minutes, if that also did not trigger a response then no further messaging was sent.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZBSUp1bwOc_OimqcS64RdfIAFvmrTSkZQL2-3O8O9hrL5Sw/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dGlKd2Z2Q1lNS\u2026  22/58\n\nsubitem not at all important 1 2 3 4 5 essential 4b) Settings and locations where the data were collected 4a-iii) Information giving during recruitment\n\nInformation given during recruitment.
