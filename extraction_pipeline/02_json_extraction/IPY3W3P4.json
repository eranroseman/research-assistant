  "title": "Implementation Strategies to Improve Blood Pressure Control in the United States: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association and American Medical Association",
  "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors that contribute to incident cardiovascular events. A multitude of US and international hypertension guidelines, scientific statements, and policy statements have recommended evidencebased approaches for hypertension management and improved blood pressure (BP) control. These recommendations are based largely on high-quality observational and randomized controlled trial data. However, recent published data demonstrate troubling temporal trends with declining BP control in the United States after decades of steady improvements. Therefore, there is a widening disconnect between what hypertension experts recommend and actual BP control in practice. This scientific statement provides information on the implementation strategies to optimize hypertension management and to improve BP control among adults in the United States. Key approaches include antiracism efforts, accurate BP measurement and increased use of self-measured BP monitoring, team-based care, implementation of policies and programs to facilitate lifestyle change, standardized treatment protocols using team-based care, improvement of medication acceptance and adherence, continuous quality improvement, financial strategies, and large-scale dissemination and implementation. Closing the gap between scientific evidence, expert recommendations, and achieving BP control, particularly among disproportionately affected populations, is urgently needed to improve cardiovascular health.",

      "text": "Identifying and addressing barriers to successful implementation of interventions is a critical component of BP control.  20 Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in which people live and work that affect health risks and outcomes. Adverse SDOH include socioeconomic factors (eg, disinvestment in education, low health literacy, inadequate employment opportunities, constrained social support, concentrated poverty) and the built environment (eg, inadequate-quality affordable housing, fragmented and undermaintained transportation systems, neighborhood deprivation). They can affect health directly through stress and other mechanisms and indirectly by influencing the ability to adapt behaviors and preventing access to quality health care.  21 Race is a social construct, and racial disparities in BP control are not due to inherent biological causes or genetic traits  22, 23  but can be explained by SDOH and the experience of racism, which is a major cause of adverse SDOH.  24 A meta-analysis of 44 studies 25 demonstrated that perceived racial discrimination, including institutional racism, was associated with hypertension status and higher BP.\n\nHerein, the socioecological framework  17  was used as a guide to identify potential barriers to the successful implementation of BP control interventions (Table  1 ). The socioecological framework includes barriers at several levels-individual, organization, community, and policythat may be singular or exist across multiple levels. Many of the SDOH operate at multiple levels of the socioecological framework and impede successful BP control.  3, 26, 27 Although the underlying causes of the recent decline in BP control have not yet been fully elucidated, this scientific statement focuses on the major barriers to BP control."

[32] [33] 3] [34] [35] [36]  Clinicians may also not believe that BP measured in the office setting reflects their patients' real BP in normal daily life, which may lead to clinical inertia if out-of-office BP measurements are not performed.  37"

The US Blood Pressure Validated Device Listing  69  and STRIDEBP  70  websites list validated BP devices for use in office and out-of-office settings. Oscillometric BP devices that obtain BP readings automatically at preset intervals are preferred over manual devices.  39 Guidelines 18, 71 endorse out-of-office BP monitoring for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension and determining BP control. SMBP monitoring improves BP control, particularly when provided with cointerventions, which include education, behavioral change management, communication of treatment recommendations to patients, telemonitoring and telecounseling, nurse or pharmacist management of antihypertensive medication, or prescription monitoring.  41 Data from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that using SMBP monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, to titrate antihypertensive medication leads to lower BP than titration guided by office BP and is likely to be cost-effective.  72, 73   blicly available online resources exist to instruct patients and clinicians in accurate BP measurement and the successful conduct of SMBP monitoring.  [74] [75] ] [76]  Accurate office BP measurement and SMBP monitoring strategies have been successfully implemented in primary care practices and community settings. For example, the American Medical Association (AMA) MAP Framework is a practical model that summarizes best practices in 3 intuitive domains: measure accurately, act rapidly, and partner with patients. A set of checklists that include accurate office BP measurement, evidence-based treatment protocols, and engaging patients in self-management and SMBP monitoring help clinical teams overcome challenges to effectively controlling BP in patients with hypertension.  77 An intervention program based on the AMA MAP Framework (AMA MAP BP), which included 20 hours of practice facilitation and monthly dashboards for physicians and staff in 16 family medicine clinics and >16 000 patients, resulted in improved BP measurement accuracy and decreased therapeutic inertia, with improved BP control from 64% to 74%, which was sustained at 12 months.  77 Strategies for implementing accurate office Downloaded from  http://ahajournals.org  by on June 8, 2025\n\nBP measurement included training clinic staff using standardized protocols with proper patient preparation and position, using the correct cuff size, and using a validated and automated device to obtain multiple readings. Strategies for implementing SMBP monitoring included use of standardized monitoring protocols, patient education on hypertension management and how to perform SMBP monitoring, effective patient-centric communication, use of a systematic approach to ensuring that patients and clinicians act rapidly to elevated BP readings, and telephone-based guidance on BP readings.  77, 78   e transmission of SMBP readings to the care team and communication of the treatment plan back to the patient have been underused and are inadequate in most care settings.  79 The use of SMBP monitoring with telemonitoring increases the sharing of patient-collected data with the care team and facilitates treatment decisions that are communicated back to the patient. Studies show that expanding access to validated telemonitoring devices and high-speed internet and cloud services in rural and low-socioeconomic-status communities can help ensure that implementation of these technologies does not widen disparities in BP control.  80 Having structured fields in the electronic health record for documenting average systolic and diastolic SMBP readings may also facilitate more timely treatment decisions."

In the Veterans Administration, 103 where BP control rates improved from 45% to 76% between 2000 and 2010, automatic reminders in the electronic medical record alerted clinicians when BP was elevated. Regular feedback was given to clinicians based on regimen adjustment and performance relative to national standards. In Kaiser Permanente Southern California,  96  where BP control increased from 54% to 86% from 2004 to 2010, feedback was provided to overcome physician therapeutic inertia, with lower-performing physicians receiving additional education, mentoring, and coaching. As described, AMA MAP BP, an intervention program  77  based on the AMA MAP Framework, which included 20 hours of practice facilitation with monthly dashboards for physicians and staff, resulted in improved BP control."

      "text": "Strong evidence supports that reducing or eliminating patient out-of-pocket costs of antihypertensive medications improves hypertension control.  48 Although almost all effective monotherapy and single-dose combination antihypertensive medications have low-cost options, cost can be a burden when a patient is on 7 to 10 medications because of having multiple chronic conditions or when the use of the newer single-dose combination antihypertensive medications is considered.  104, 105 eyond medications, SMBP monitoring devices may not be affordable for many patients. Data on the impact of eliminating cost sharing for patients with regard to SMBP monitoring devices are limited. Current coverage for devices is insufficient, and although a plan may partially cover automatic devices, inadequate coverage remains problematic for wider implementation of SMBP monitoring.  41 Some clinical settings have implemented device loaner programs, although they are not yet widespread.  106 Rethinking insurance coverage through a value-based insurance design model, which includes both antihypertensive medication and SMBP monitoring devices, can improve costs related to individuals not taking medications as prescribed.  107, 108 Providing medications and devices is often cost neutral or cost saving for insurers because they are preventing the high cost of later complications and hospitalizations.  41, 109 Because antihypertensive medication adherence can be improved by simplifying medication regimens and refill synchronization, ideal antihypertensive medication coverage would support these prescribing and dispensing methods.  110 inancial incentives as part of QI efforts have been shown to improve BP control  97, 99  and are currently used in many value-based payment models. Financial incentives for providing services for lifestyle counseling may be advantageous for implementing lifestyle changes for BP control more broadly in clinical practice and health systems. For SMBP monitoring, lack of adequate reimbursement for clinician and staff time to train patients to use devices and interpret patient-generated BP readings may prevent clinicians from recommending SMBP monitoring.  50 On January 1, 2020, 2 Current Procedural Terminology codes, 99473 and 99474, were introduced for initial and ongoing clinical services for SMBP monitoring, although they are currently underused.  16, 41"

      "title": "LARGE-SCALE IMPLEMENTATION AND DISSEMINATION",
      "text": "Large scale implementation and dissemination of evidence-based strategies to improve BP control have been successful in accelerating the translation of evidence into care.  59, 65, 66 Active implementation efforts have had greater impact than passive dissemination strategies, although these efforts are often used together to enhance impact.  59 Consultation and practice facilitation, which includes not only QI but also practice management, coaching, and organizational management delivered on site by a trained individual or team, have been a cornerstone of successful large-scale implementation efforts. A systematic review by Wang et al 111 demonstrated that practice facilitation led to improvements in BP and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Health Resources and Services Administration, Million Hearts, the National Association of Community Health Centers, the AMA, the AHA, and others have focused on BP control efforts. Many of these efforts focus on selected areas of the socioecological framework, focus on selected regions or states, or are time limited because of grant or program funding and therefore have limited reach. Coordinated multilevel interventions across the United States could facilitate large-scale implementation and dissemination to improve BP control; sustainability efforts could ensure that the gains in BP control are maintained.\n\nIncreased education for interested parties, including patients, clinicians, practices, health systems, community organizations, the private sector (including insurance companies), and governmental agencies, may help with successful implementation of aforementioned strategies for improved BP control by interested parties. Some key areas of education are adverse implications to public health attributable to poor BP control, barriers to BP control, and the potential for implementation strategies to improve BP control."

      "text": "Despite multiple advancements in hypertension management, BP control has recently fallen in the United States. Although BP can be controlled with lifestyle modification and antihypertensive medications, increasing gaps are noted between recommendations from guidelines and scientific statements and successful BP control. Barriers to BP control exist across multiple levels of the socioecological framework, including individual, organization, community, and policy levels. Key areas for implementation include antiracism efforts; accurate BP measurement; team-based care; lifestyle modification programs at the organization, community, and policy levels; standardized treatment protocols using team-based care; medication acceptance and adherence; continuous QI; and financial levers. These strategies could be coupled with successful large-scale implementation and dissemination strategies and shared accountability at multiple levels of the socioecological framework to achieve successful BP control in the United States."
