  "title": "The Effectiveness of Wearable Devices as Physical Activity Interventions for Preventing and Treating Obesity in Children and Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents remains a global public health issue. Wearable devices may offer new opportunities for prevention and intervention in obesity. Previous systematic reviews have only examined the effect of the wearable device interventions on preventing and treating obesity in adults. However, no systematic review has provided an evaluation of wearable devices as physical activity interventions for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents. Objective: The purpose of this review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes in children and adolescents. \n Methods: Research articles retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EBSCO from inception to February 1, 2021, were reviewed. The search was designed to identify studies utilizing wearable devices for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents. The included studies were evaluated for risk of bias following the Cochrane recommendation. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions on body weight, body fat, BMI z-score (BMI-Z), BMI, and waist circumference. Subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether the characteristics of the interventions had an impact on the effect size. Results: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (3227 participants) were selected for meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, wearable device interventions had statistically significant beneficial effects on BMI (mean difference [MD] -0.23; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.03; P=.03; I 2 =2%), BMI-Z (MD -0.07; 95% CI -0.13 to -0.01; P=.01; I 2 =81%), body weight (MD -1.08; 95% CI -2.16 to -0.00; P=.05; I 2 =58%), and body fat (MD -0.72; 95% CI -1.19 to -0.25; P=.003; I 2 =5%). However, no statistically significant effect was found on waist circumference (MD 0.55; 95% CI -0.21 to 1.32; P=.16; I 2 =0%). The subgroup analysis showed that for participants with overweight or obesity (MD -0.75; 95% CI -1.18 to -0.31; P<.01; I 2 =0%), in the short-term (MD -0.62; 95% CI -1.03 to -0.21; P<.01; I 2 =0%), wearable-based interventions (MD -0.56; 95% CI -0.95 to -0.18; P<.01; I 2 =0%) generally resulted in greater intervention effect size on BMI. \n Conclusions: Evidence from this meta-analysis shows that wearable devices as physical activity interventions may be useful for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents. Future research is needed to identify the most effective physical activity indicators of wearable devices to prevent and treat obesity in children and adolescents.",

      "text": "With the development of society and technology, human lifestyles have undergone tremendous changes. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has risen rapidly since 1975. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese  [1] . As a global public health issue, obesity might cause a number of serious health conditions, such as high blood pressure, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, abnormal lipid metabolism, and psychosocial problems  [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, effective interventions for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents are urgently needed.\n\nAt present, regular physical activity seems to be one of the effective means for the prevention of and intervention in obesity among children and adolescents and has been discussed in many studies  [6] [7] [8] . Traditional physical activity intervention methods (such as school group physical activity interventions  [9]  and face-to-face interventions with health professionals  [10] ) require significant effort and costs. However, wearable devices may provide an alternative means of addressing obesity in children and adolescents. Wearable devices, such as pedometers, sports bracelets, sports watches, and accelerometers, can offer easy and effective ways to collect physical activity data (steps, heart rate, energy expenditure, physical activity, and physical activity time of different intensity) and allow users to monitor their data  [11, 12] . These quantitative data can stimulate the user's motivation for physical activity, increase physical activity time, and increase energy expenditure, thus enabling weight loss  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .\n\nA considerable body of work related to the use of wearable devices to prevent and treat obesity has been already published  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Most previous reviews have focused on adults, in which it was demonstrated that wearable devices can achieve a significant effect size in reducing the BMI of adults with obesity (\u03b2=-1.57; P<.001) or adults with chronic diseases (\u03b2=-1.30; P<.001). However, evidence on the effectiveness of wearable device interventions remains inconclusive. Furthermore, wearable devices have no significant effect size on adults with normal weight (\u03b2=-0.49; P=.07)  [17, [24] [25] [26] . The characteristics and cognitive abilities of children and adolescents are different from those of adults, and emerging technologies have great appeal to children and adolescents  [27, 28] . Children and adolescents are in a sensitive period of growth and development. Compared with diet control, children and adolescents are more suited to perform increased physical activity for preventing and treating obesity  [29, 30] . Wearable devices have been proven to be valid and accurate  [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , providing consistent feedback and inducing behavior changes in individuals, which result in increased physical activity  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Therefore, there is a need to explore the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions for preventing and treating obesity in this population.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no reviews evaluating wearable devices as physical activity interventions for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents. It is thus necessary to explore the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions to prevent and treat obesity specifically in these populations. The results may contribute to public health guidance on the use of wearable devices for addressing obesity in children and adolescents. Therefore, the objectives of this review and meta-analysis are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes in children and adolescents and (2) determine whether the characteristics of the interventions had an impact on the effect size through subgroup analyses."

This is consistent with the results of other systematic reviews. Two previous reviews that examined the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions for adults found that after using wearable devices, there were statistically significant improvements in obesity-related outcomes such as BMI and body weight  [17, 25] . These conclusions further confirmed the effect of physical activity on preventing and treating obesity. These conclusions"

      "text": "RenderX also demonstrate that physical activity plays an important role in the effectiveness of wearable devices for preventing and treating obesity. According to the behavior intervention technology model, wearable devices can promote physical activity through self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, and motivation enhancement  [55] . Assuming no drastic changes in dietary behavior, increasing physical activity, especially of moderate and vigorous intensity, will contribute to a negative caloric balance, leading to weight loss and BMI reduction  [13, 15, 25] . Future research is needed to further explore what are the most effective physical activity indicators (eg, step count, total physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity) of wearable devices to prevent and treat obesity.\n\nFour previous reviews examined the effectiveness of mobile health technology interventions in preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents  [56] [57] [58] [59] , finding that mobile health technology interventions yielded no significant improvements in obesity-related anthropometric outcomes such as BMI and body weight. These 4 reviews mixed different intervention strategies (promoting physical activity, monitoring food consumption, and strengthening communication and guidance) to explore the effects of mobile health technologies on prevention and treatment in obesity. By contrast, our review only concentrated on a single intervention strategy (promoting physical activity). These results may aid in the formulation of the most suitable intervention strategies on the use of mobile health technologies for addressing obesity among children and adolescents.\n\nWaist circumference is a common indicator of abdominal obesity. This meta-analysis indicated that the wearable devices as physical activity interventions had no significant effect on waist circumference. This result is different to that of another meta-analysis in adults  [17] . The reason may be that children and adolescents are in a sensitive period of growth and development, and waist circumference tends to increase, which will counteract part of the intervention effect  [60] . It is worth noting that neither of these 2 systematic reviews included more than 5 RCTs. Thus, these conclusions must be treated cautiously.\n\nA subgroup analysis found that, compared with participants with normal weight, those who were overweight or obese had a significantly greater intervention effect size on BMI. This result is consistent with other meta-analyses  [17, 25, 26] . The reason may be that, compared with people with normal weight, the lifestyle of people with obesity is normally accompanied by more sedentary behaviors and less physical activity, and the level of physical activity is lower than that recommended by the World Health Organization  [61, 62] . Wearable devices can quantify the gap between the current activity level and the recommended amount  [12, 34] . Such a quantitative gap can motivate individuals to improve their physical activity level, and users can utilize self-regulation to change their physical activity habits as well as sedentary behaviors to manage their weight  [13, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Wearable devices have achieved weight controlling effects by prompting a change in the lifestyle of people with obesity. For people of normal weight, the quantified physical activity level is not much different from the recommended amount. It cannot stimulate awareness of any deficiencies in their own activity, so the intervention effect is not obvious  [68] . These facts suggest that the same intervention program may have different effects on different populations. Therefore, we need to analyze the baseline physical activity levels of different populations and formulate targeted intervention programs to achieve better intervention effects.\n\nAnother subgroup analysis found that interventions with a duration of \u22644 months had a significantly greater effect on BMI than those with a duration of >4 months. This is supported by the other systematic literature reviews  [57, 69] , which showed that it is difficult for people to maintain focus on technology over time. Beyond 4 months, the freshness and interest in wearable devices disappear, resulting in the gradual disappearance of the intervention's effect  [70] . However, 2 meta-analyses previously reported that wearable device interventions with the duration exceeding 4 months can achieve better BMI reduction  [17, 66] . It was preliminarily evidenced that children and adolescents were prone to losing interest and had poor compliance  [71] . When using wearable devices for long-term interventions, targeted strategies should be applied at different periods of the intervention (such as self-monitoring in the first 3 months, peer competition at 3-6 months, family incentives at 6-9 months, and cash rewards at 9-12 months) so that children and adolescents can effectively maintain long-term interest and compliance.\n\nThe subgroup analysis clarified that, compared with the multifaceted intervention program, the wearable-based intervention program had a significantly greater impact on BMI. Wearable-based interventions focused on improving the user's physical activity levels to achieve weight loss. However, multifaceted interventions are based on multiple components. On the one hand, the intervention strategies did not focus on improving the physical activity level through wearable devices. On the other hand, the primary goal of intervention was not to prevent or treat obesity  [37, 57] . Therefore, the multifaceted intervention had a limited ability to reduce BMI. This suggests the need to focus on improving physical activity levels through wearable devices to prevent and treat obesity in children and adolescents."

Third, our review concentrated on a single intervention strategy (promoting physical activity through wearable devices). Fourth, the included studies were all RCTs with high-level evidence. Finally, this systematic review performed subgroup analyses to determine whether the characteristics of the interventions had an impact on the effect size.\n\nThe limitations of our review results must be clarified. First, relatively few studies met our inclusion criteria. This made it difficult to draw any definite conclusions. Second, 4 studies were found to have a high risk of bias of incomplete outcome data, for which the dropout rates were >25%. Third, the high heterogeneity of the BMI-Z and body weight indicators in this meta-analysis cannot be ignored. Finally, in the meta-analysis of obesity-related anthropometric indicators, individual studies occupied excessive proportion in the analysis. Accordingly, the results of the meta-analysis may be affected by a single study."

      "text": "This meta-analysis indicated that the use of wearable devices as physical activity interventions can significantly reduce BMI, BMI-Z, body weight, and body fat in children and adolescents, but failed to significantly improve waist circumference. The subgroup analysis showed that for participants with overweight or obesity, in short term, wearable-based interventions generally resulted in greater improvements in BMI. Therefore, wearable devices as physical activity interventions may be useful for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents. Future research is needed to identify the most effective physical activity indicators of wearable devices to prevent and treat obesity in children and adolescents."
