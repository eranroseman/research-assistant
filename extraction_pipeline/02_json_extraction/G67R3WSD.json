  "title": "Effectiveness of Targeted Insulin-Adherence Interventions for Glycemic Control Using Predictive Analytics Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Patient adherence to antidiabetic medications, especially insulin, remains poor, leading to adverse outcomes and increased costs. Most adherence interventions have only been modestly effective, partly because they are not targeted to patients who could benefit most. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether delivering more intensive insulin-adherence interventions only to individuals with type 2 diabetes predicted to benefit most was more effective than delivering a lower-intensity intervention to a larger group of unselected individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 3-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial used data from Horizon, the largest health insurer in New Jersey, on 6000 participants 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who were receiving basal insulin. Patients were excluded if they were insured by Medicaid or Medicare or had fewer than 3 months of continuous enrollment. The study was conducted from July 7, 2016, through October 5, 2017. Analyses were conducted from February 5 to September 24, 2018. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomized to 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified based on baseline availability of 1 or more glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) test values. All arms were designed to cost the same, and each cohort received a tailored pharmacist telephone consultation varying based on (1) proportion receiving the intervention and (2) intensity, including follow-up frequency and cointerventions. Arm 1 offered a low-intensity intervention to all patients. Arm 2 offered a moderate-intensity intervention to 60% of patients based on their predicted risk of insulin nonadherence. Arm 3 offered a high-intensity intervention to 40% of patients based on glycemic control and predicted risk of insulin nonadherence. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was insulin persistence. Secondary outcomes were changes in HbA 1c level and health care utilization. Outcomes were evaluated in arms 2 and 3 vs arm 1 using claims data, intention-to-treat principles, and multiple imputation for missing values in the 12-month follow-up. RESULTS Among 6000 participants, mean (SD) age was 55.9 (11.0) years and 3344 (59.8%) were male. Compared with arm 1, insulin nonpersistence did not differ in arm 2 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.03) or arm 3 (relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.06). Glycemic control was similar in arm 2 and arm 1 (absolute HbA 1c level difference, -0.15%; 95% CI, -0.34% to 0.05%) but was better in arm 3 (absolute HbA 1c level difference, -0.25%; 95% CI, -0.43% to -0.06%). Total spending and office (continued) Key Points Question Is delivering more intensive insulin-adherence interventions to targeted subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes more effective than delivering a lower-intensity intervention to a larger group of unselected patients? Findings In this 3-arm randomized clinical trial of 6000 patients with type 2 diabetes receiving basal insulin, delivering a high-intensity intervention to those predicted to benefit most did not improve insulin persistence but improved mean glycemic control compared with a low-intensity intervention for all patients. Meaning Targeting patients for more intensive interventions based both on predicted risk of nonadherence and level of disease control may be more effective than untargeted approaches.",

      "text": "Despite numerous new therapies, the management of chronic cardiometabolic diseases remains suboptimal, in part because of poor adherence to medications.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Patients with diabetes requiring insulin therapy are a particularly vulnerable subgroup because of unique administration challenges, including anxiety about self-injection and fear of hypoglycemia, and barriers, such as medication costs attributable, in part, to rising costs of insulin.  4 Although the barriers to optimal medication use are complex, interventions designed to improve medication use are often simple and broadly delivered.  5, 6 As a result, they have generally only been modestly effective.  7, 8 e ability to effectively target adherence interventions to patients who are most likely to benefit has the potential to improve their effect and efficiency, but this hypothesis has not been adequately evaluated.  5, 9 Even for patients with complex conditions, such as insulin-requiring diabetes, not all require adherence support.  10 From a population health perspective, focusing efforts on those who are most likely to be nonadherent or those with poor disease control may be more effective. Given that more intensive interventions tend to result in larger improvements in adherence,  7  focusing only on individuals most likely to benefit may allow more resources to be devoted to fewer individuals without increasing overall costs of an intervention program.  7, 11, 12 A more potent effect for a comparatively small subgroup may also make it more likely to observe population-level effects when appropriately analyzing quality improvement trials using intention-totreat principles, even though patient acceptance of interventions may be less than 30%.  7, 12, 13  test this hypothesis, we launched the Targeted Adherence Intervention to Reach Glycemic Control With Insulin Therapy for Patients With Diabetes (TARGIT-Diabetes) study, a pragmatic, prospective, intention-to-treat randomized clinical trial.  14 This trial evaluated the effectiveness on insulin persistence and glycemic control of a pharmacist-delivered intervention with 3 levels of increasing intensity to progressively more-targeted groups of patients. The core intervention in this trial (ie, a pharmacist telephone consultation) was similar in design to those that are regularly used by many health care organizations, such as telephonic medication therapy management consultations.  7, 15, 16"

Costs were determined by Magellan Rx Management,  20  a pharmacy benefit management company, who also delivered the intervention components.\n\nOnce randomized, a patient's predicted risk of future nonpersistence to insulin or continued use of insulin was calculated by applying a proprietary regression-based algorithm to Horizon's enrollment data and pharmacy and medical claims data.  21, 22 In brief, this algorithm uses demographic and clinical information from enrollment data and claims as predictors and indicated high model accuracy (>75% overall accuracy at predicting nonpersistence).  14, 21 These predicted risks and patients' glycemic control were used to identify which patients would be targeted for intervention in each arm, described below and in the Figure . In arm 1 (untargeted low intensity), 100% of patients were assigned to a low-intensity intervention. In arm 2 (partially targeted moderate intensity), 60% of patients were assigned to a moderate-intensity intervention based on their future risk of insulin nonpersistence. We selected patients with a risk of nonpersistence predicted to be between 10% and 90% to focus on individuals who were most likely to benefit.  14 This threshold was chosen because patients with very high-predicted adherence would not need intervention and those with extremely low-predicted adherence have often completely stopped the therapy for clinically appropriate reasons. In arm 3 (highly targeted high intensity), 40% of patients were assigned to a high-intensity intervention based on both their risk of future nonpersistence (between 20% and 80%) and baseline HbA 1c level (ie, whether they had a value and the actual value).  14 Individuals were assigned to the intervention if their HbA 1c level was 8% or more, the minimum threshold recommended by the American Diabetes Association,  23  or if they had missing HbA 1c values, because these patients are often poorly engaged in care, therefore requiring intervention.  14 These thresholds were chosen to balance costs across arms."

Although the type of outreach and solutions were similar across the arms, they differed in the number of patients receiving the intervention and intensity of the interventions, ranging from low intensity in arm 1 to high intensity in arm 3 (eAppendix 1-4 in Supplement 2). Before study launch, all pharmacists received training in medication therapy management, motivational interviewing, and specific interventions being provided.  24 Study staff at the pharmacy benefit-management company regularly monitored the delivery of the intervention to ensure fidelity. During the consultations, pharmacists engaged patients in discussions about their individual beliefs and expectations of treatments and barriers to optimal treatment and provided counseling regarding strategies for achieving good control. Additional detail is provided in the trial protocol (Supplement 1) and published protocol.  14  arm 1 (untargeted low-intensity), all patients assigned to the treatment arm received a letter informing them about the pharmacist outreach, a reminder postcard, and a small pillbox. Pharmacists attempted to reach everyone in this arm to provide the consultations using the telephone number on record with Horizon. Patients received up to 2 follow-up calls.\n\nIn arm 2 (partially targeted moderate intensity), the 1200 patients (60%) selected for outreach received the components in arm 1 but could also receive up to 6 follow-up calls and 2 calls with their primary care clinician and/or pharmacy to clarify treatment issues or receive recommendations for therapeutic changes.

Glycemic control, only evaluated in patients with baseline HbA 1c values, was measured as the change in HbA 1c level from baseline to follow-up. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data for glycemic control (382 [19.6%] of patients).  25 Health care utilization was measured using claims data and included all-cause emergency department visits, physician office visits, and hospitalizations during follow-up. There were no missing data on the primary outcome or resource utilization. Follow-up for all outcomes began 1 month after randomization (the earliest patients could receive the intervention because of time required for data processing and mailing), and continued through 12 months after randomization."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this pragmatic trial of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin therapy, we found that increasing the focus and intensity of an intervention for a smaller number of patients based on both the risk of poor adherence and baseline glycemic control did not improve insulin persistence compared with administering a lower-intensity intervention to a larger number of patients.\n\nCompared witth an untargeted low-intensity intervention, a highly targeted high-intensity intervention improved glycemic control by a statistically significant amount. Also, a partially targeted moderate-intensity intervention resulted in a small increase in the risk of hospitalizations and emergency department visits. The interventions did not impact health care spending or office visits.\n\nUsing intention-to-treat principles, we analyzed the effectiveness of the targeted interventions among all randomized patients even though only 28.4% of patients assigned to the intervention accepted the initial consultation. This percentage is similar to that in another telephonic quality improvement study using pharmacists.  12 We chose this approach to evaluate the mean effectiveness of the intervention as it would be administered in a population-based setting and allow for unbiased comparisons.  13 Nevertheless, the acceptance rate was slightly lower than in our initial power calculations, possibly because the rates were based on a slightly different population, and we specifically targeted patients in this trial who could have been more difficult to engage. The persistence measurement could not have been sufficiently sensitive; the 90th percentile threshold may not have detected enough variation in filling and only detected differences in very nonpersistent patients.  30 Moreover, baseline persistence was also fairly high in all 3 arms. Thus, a ceiling effect may have limited any potential benefit from the interventions that we studied. Although we observed small improvements in persistence, we were likely underpowered to see smaller but still clinically significant changes. Finally, whereas the outreach was performed by trained clinical pharmacists skilled at telephonic consultations, these individuals were not a regular part of patients' care teams, which could have reduced effectiveness. In contrast to persistence, in the group that was targeted based on both the risk of nonpersistence and poor baseline glycemic control, we observed significant improvements in glycemic control, ultimately a more meaningful outcome in diabetes care.  31 Although the levels of glycemic control achieved were modest, the improvements were roughly equivalent to those anticipated from the addition of an oral hypoglycemic medication.  23, 32 rgeting a different patient population might have increased the effectiveness of the interventions that we tested. For example, we focused on patients at moderate risk of nonpersistence. It is possible that the intervention could have been more effective if targeted to patients at highest risk rather than those who we hypothesized would be more impactable. In arm 2, we also included patients with good baseline glycemic control, hypothesizing that even they could benefit, although this could have diluted the effect. Similarly, despite being predicted to be nonadherent based on claims data, 64.6% of patients thought they were optimally adherent, suggesting further weakening of effectiveness and that targeting could be further optimized.\n\nThe finding of slightly increased risk of hospitalizations and emergency department visits in the partially targeted moderate-intensity group was unexpected. Unlike the highly targeted highintensity group, interventions were given to patients with good glycemic control; we speculate that that could have potentially led to the increased risk, perhaps through increased hypoglycemia, although we did not observe a significant difference in overall visits.  [33] [34] 4] [35]  In other words, administering interventions to patients who were predicted to be nonpersistent without considering their actual glycemic control could have led to worsened outcomes requiring hospitalization.\n\nPropensity score-matched analyses that identified similar patients in both arms did not observe any differences."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Several limitations should be acknowledged. Our evaluation of glycemic control was limited to patients for whom Horizon had baseline laboratory data available. We also designed the study with 3 active comparison groups to mimic providing some degree of quality improvement outreach to members with diabetes. Without a true control group, we were unable to test for differences between the untargeted low-intensity intervention and no intervention. The prediction model was proprietary, but the overall approach could be replicated. Moreover, any bias resulting from insufficient targeting would be toward the null, because worse predictions would decrease the success of the targeting and have made it less likely to observe an effect. We also could not evaluate the extent to which the nature of conversations or counseling recommendations differed across the arms, because we did not have access to deidentified versions of the pharmacist consultations. The findings from this study may also not be fully generalizable to other populations, such as those with Medicare or Medicaid coverage; however, it is likely that a similar approach could be used within these populations to potentially target interventions."
