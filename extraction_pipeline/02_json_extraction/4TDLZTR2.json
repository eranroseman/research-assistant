      "text": "Rural American communities have higher rates of inactivity-related diseases, such as obesity  (1) , diabetes  (2, 3) , cardiovascular disease  (4, 5) , and cancer  (6, 7) , resulting in an increased risk of premature death  (8) . Lower physical activity levels among rural populations have contributed to the higher rates of these diseases  (9) (10) (11) . Although rural populations have a need for physical activity interventions, only a few of these interventions have successfully increased physical activity levels  (12) .\n\nMen, regardless of geographical region, tend to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and premature mortality  (13, 14) . However, rurality adds to the health risk, such that rural men have a 39% higher age-adjusted mortality rate than rural women, and a 19% higher mortality rate than urban men  (15) . In terms of physical activity, 38% of rural men report no leisure time physical activity and only 26% report meeting physical activity guidelines  (10) . Although rural men seem like a reasonable target population for physical activity interventions, they have been challenging to recruit  (12, 16, 17) . Few physical activity intervention studies targeted to rural communities have included men; of the studies that have, men represent only 20% of the sample and have a higher risk of dropping out  (16, 17) . Low rates of participation in physical activity research could suggest rural men are simply not interested in improving their physical activity behaviors. However, our previous study found that around 80% of rural men reported being interested in a physical activity intervention  (18) . This disconnect between high interest and low enrollment rates indicates a need for new recruitment strategies and tailored interventions, which are known to be more effective than nontailored approaches  (19, 20) .\n\nOne approach to developing tailored behavioral health interventions is the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model  (21) . The ORBIT model uses terminology from clinical trials to define specific benchmarks for the design of behavior-change interventions  (21) . In Phase I, emphasis is placed on the design of the intervention using underlying Introduction: This study aimed to test the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of a physical activity intervention tailored to rural men. Methods: A nationwide sample of rural American men were recruited to participate in a theory-guided, 10-wk, remote physical activity intervention. The intervention was tailored to rural men's preferences based on findings of a needs assessment study. Steps, muscle-strengthening behaviors, muscular endurance, and psychosocial outcomes were measured at baseline and post-intervention. Likert scales, open-ended survey questions, and focus groups were used to assess acceptability. Continuous data were analyzed using a t-test and Wilcoxon signed-ranked test, and dichotomous variables were analyzed using a McNemar test. Results: A total of 27 (39 consented, 27% attrition) mostly White, non-Hispanic rural men completed the intervention. On average, participants completed 8.0 \u00b1 4.4 (out of the 11 provided) modules over the 10-wk intervention period, and 15 participants (56%) completed all 11 modules. The proportion of participants engaging in muscle strengthening behavior increased from 18.5% to 69.2% (P = 0.003). Push-up (P < 0.001), sit-up (P = 0.004), and squat (P < 0.001) tests significantly improved. Behavior regulation (Hedges' g = 1.23, P < 0.05) and physical activity identity (Hedges' g = 0.85, P < 0.05) increased from baseline to 10 wk. On average, all features were rated at least somewhat helpful. Conclusions: The intervention improved rural men's muscle strengthening behaviors, muscular endurance, behavioral regulation, and physical activity identity, but not steps. Future studies can expand on this work by improving intervention features, such as greater accountability, and comparing the intervention against a control group.\n\nbehavior-change principles and theories, and an understanding of the target population. Phase II focuses on evaluating the preliminary efficacy of treatments in proof-of-concept and pilot studies. Finally, Phase III focuses on evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in a large randomized controlled trial. Each phase is defined by critical milestones that must be achieved for a program to continue  (21) .\n\nOur previous work combined with previous literature met the benchmarks of Phase I of the ORBIT model by identifying rural men's preferred behavior change techniques, components, and delivery methods for a physical activity intervention  (18, 22) . We found that rural men prefer physical activity demonstrations (particularly of strength-focused exercises) delivered remotely by exercise professionals  (18, 22) . Rural men also reported wanting content that focused on self-improvement and fitness as opposed to weight loss, which was found to be preferred by rural women  (18, 23) . Other literature has suggested that self-reliance is often crucial to preserving \"manhood,\" which is evident in men's preferences for fast, easily accessible information (e.g., online resources)  (24) (25) (26) . In another study in rural men, mobile apps were found to be a feasible way to deliver weight-loss programs  (27, 28) . Based on guidance from our formative work and previous literature  (20, (27) (28) (29) (30) , an intervention protocol was developed and prepared for testing in the next step of the ORBIT model.\n\nThe next step in the ORBIT model is to determine initial efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of an intervention that is built on the findings in Phase I. During Phase IIa, the main goal is to determine if the protocol is worth further testing by examining whether the intervention results in any preliminary clinically meaningful improvement and to optimize the intervention  (21) . Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the acceptability and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of an intervention tailored to rural men to elicit a clinically meaningful effect. A 1000-step difference, or as few as 15 min\u2022d -1 , is associated with clinically meaningful health effects and matches the effect size reported in similar physical activity interventions for men  (20, 31) . We hypothesized rural men would 1) increase their steps, 2) engage in more muscle-strengthening behaviors, 3) have greater muscular endurance, and 4) improve physicalactivity-related psychosocial outcomes from baseline to postintervention. Additionally, qualitative data were collected to improve the intervention for a future pilot study."

Baseline testing was completed during a second virtual meeting. After participants had worn the Fitbit for 7 d and baseline testing was completed, they received an email invitation to access the intervention.\n\nAt completion of the intervention period (week 10), participants were scheduled for a remote post-intervention assessment visit during which they repeated all baseline assessments. In addition, participants answered acceptability questions on how useful they found specific intervention features.

Finally, the \"Assembly Required\" modules challenged participants to The lesson name, content covered, MPAC construct targeted, and percentage of participants completing each module are shown above.\n\napply their new skills by making their own training plans and setting new goals. Each module included three parts: an educational video (4-6 min long), homework/handouts on Healthie, and video demonstrations. Identified as a preferred delivery method  (22) , YouTube (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA) videos were used to deliver the educational content. The educational videos contained straightforward language and masculine imagery on the topic of the week  (20, 29) . The homework section consisted of handouts and a question to consider related to the topic of the week.

      "text": "Steps per day were averaged during the run-in baseline week (before receiving intervention materials, week 0) and at the post-intervention assessment (week 10). Normality of the data was assessed before conducting statistical tests using graphical representations of the data. A paired t-test was used to determine whether steps changed from baseline to the postintervention assessment. Psychosocial constructs were scored according to recommended protocols, and a paired t-test was used to test whether each facet changed from baseline to the post-intervention assessment  (45) . Paired t-tests were used to compare the muscular endurance test results between baseline and the post-intervention assessment. When assumptions were violated, a nonparametric (Wilcoxon) test was used. The McNemar test was used to determine changes in the number of participants who reported engaging in strength exercises on the MSEQ.\n\nLikert scales for the perceived usefulness (0, not at all useful, to 100, extremely useful) of each intervention feature were analyzed with descriptive statistics to determine acceptability. Content analyses were completed on qualitative questions that asked about the most liked feature and areas that could be improved (e.g., the number of times a feature, such as Fitbit, appeared in the text box in response to most helpful feature). Exemplary quotes were presented as examples to clarify more complex responses. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed (via voice-to-text and cleaned for errors by J.G.). The reviewers followed the procedure described by Braun and Clarke  (56) . Two independent reviewers (J.G. and L.J.C.) read the transcripts of the focus groups. Initially, data were organized by question response (e.g., helpful features, most useful, and areas of improvement) with common responses highlighted. The question organization was then removed to allow an inductive analysis of similar words and phrases, which were placed into categories and condensed into themes across all questions asked. Lastly, specific responses were coded deductively to match constructs in behavior-change theories (e.g., graded tasks). Reviewers compared the overarching themes and arbitrated any discrepancies. Exemplary quotes were selected for each theme.\n\nA clinically meaningful change in activity was defined as an increase of 1000 steps or 15 min\u2022d -1 of self-reported MVPA. A difference of 1000 steps or 15 min of MVPA per day is associated with clinically meaningful health effects and matches the effect size reported in similar physical activity interventions for men  (20, 31) . Significance level was set at 0.1, a less strict criterion due to the early phase and low risk of this study. Accounting for 30% attrition, we aimed to recruit a total of 38 men into the study. This is consistent with other suggestions for adequate sample size to gather preliminary data (including qualitative feedback) for future studies  (57) (58) (59) , and larger than most Phase IIa studies. A dominant-less dominant mixedmethod approach was used to address our hypothesis with an emphasis on quantitative data over qualitative data. Specifically, quantitative data were used to assess outcomes that could be targeted and improved, while qualitative data were used to generate hypotheses on possible improvements from the participants' perspectives and experience  (60) ."

I don't have anything, you know, that I can get to\u2026 if I can have something that says, hey, this is what you can do here.\" Theme 2: Participants reported self-monitoring of step tracking as the most-liked Fitbit feature: \"The step counter motivated me to get out and do more and say, well, OK, I've got X amount of steps today. Let's see if I can beat that tomorrow, you know, kind of thing. Whether it was taking two or three walks around the block or whether it was walking to, you know, down to the corner\u2026store to get a lotto ticket, you know, something like that. But it motivated me to do that.\" Theme 3: When participants were asked about ideas they had to improve the program, they suggested a buddy system that matched them with a motivational partner their age. For example: \"I like the idea of a buddy system because then you've got someone that is not just for competing against one another, but to help encourage each other to stay on track and stay motivated.\" And, \"You know within 5 to 10 years of me, of my age, you know, that kind of thing, someone I could say, you know, 'hey, what did you do today?' or 'are you doing this?' 'did you see it?' 'how you can fix this?' and you can bang heads together.\" Theme 4: One idea proposed was to have a longer intervention period that had more options for other areas of health, such as nutrition, sleep, and mental health. The men emphasized that they believed physical fitness should be the main focus of the program but that graded tasks could expand the program:\n\n\"Provide like an a la carte, 'Hey, I know that these are the areas that I really need to work on and this is my priority order.' But then having it spread out over a year with that shifting focus, where it's kind of like, it's kind of like a math class, right, where every concept is going to build on the concept from the day before\u2026'Hey, we're gonna focus, you know, physical fitness slowly ramping up and sleep 1st and we're gonna focus on that per month because that really is kind of foundational.'\""

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The program had high acceptability with an acceptable attrition rate (<30%) and features that were reported useful. The participants suggested including more social components (e.g., buddy system) and reminders to improve the program. The remotely delivered physical activity program tailored to rural men increased adoption of muscle-strengthening behaviors, muscular endurance, physical activity identity, and behavioral regulation without increasing daily steps.\n\nThe feasibility of recruiting rural men through traditional means of recruitment remained a challenge. Most participants were recruited from ResearchMatch  (32) , a novel way to recruit rural men for physical activity interventions. Only one participant was recruited from social media posts. This parallels previous physical activity interventions that have struggled to recruit more than 20% men  (16, 17) . However, some studies have found success in marketing campaigns through sporting organizations and worksites  (29, 62, 63) . Our needs assessment study indicated that YouTube might be a way to reach rural men for recruitment  (18, 22) , but this approach was not utilized due to budget restrictions. Although tailored methods of recruitment hold promise, the best practices and methods to recruit rural men warrant further formal investigation.\n\nThe adherence rate (50% of participants completed all 11 modules and over 70% completed 8 modules) matched or exceeded other similar interventions tailored to men. For example, in a weight loss intervention with 12 weekly sessions delivered in person, 78.9% of participants attended at least half of the sessions, but only 20% of participants attended all 12 sessions (63). These findings suggest that an online physical activity intervention may offer high levels of accessibility, particularly in rural communities, resulting in high adherence rates. Likewise, program features, such as the Fitbit (rated highest), were rated as helpful. However, participants thought the program could be improved with greater accountability (e.g., buddy system). Social groups were successfully implemented in other tailored interventions for men, such as Football Fans in Training  (29, 63) . Future research should explore the best ways to implement social elements in rural settings, particularly in tailoring to rural men.\n\nStep counts at baseline (8713 steps per day) indicated that many participants were already achieving a high daily step count  (64) , which may suggest a ceiling effect. Another possible explanation for the lack of step count changes is seasonality. Post-intervention assessments were completed during December and January, a time of year known to have 1000-2000 fewer steps per day  (65, 66) . In contrast, selfreported MVPA increased and sitting time decreased. This significant finding could be a result of measurement error or responder bias (e.g., social desirability bias). Alternatively, it is possible that MVPA increased but light-intensity activity decreased, resulting in a constant total activity level (step count). Fitbit data do not support this hypothesis, but the Fitbit has unclear categories of intensity, which is not validated to detect intensity differences. Intensity of activity is important because greater intensity is associated with greater benefits  (67, 68) .\n\nOnly 18% of participants were engaging in any form of muscle strengthening at baseline, but 70% were engaging in muscle strengthening at the post-intervention assessment. Presumably, these changes in muscle-strengthening behaviors were responsible for the large increases in muscular endurance (77% increase in push-up, 43% sit-ups, and 27% squats). Our findings are significant because muscular strength and endurance can reduce muscle mass loss with aging and, as a result, reduce the risk of frailty, dependent living, falls, early mortality, and cardiovascular disease  (40, (69) (70) (71) (72) .\n\nThe success in changing muscle-strengthening behaviors and muscular endurance demonstrates that muscle strengthening may be \"low-hanging fruit\" for health behavior programs targeted to rural men. Our previous work suggested that rural men may be more interested in strength training than aerobic activity  (18, 22) . This might present an opportunity to recruit rural men to participate in health promotion interventions. For example, future programs might consider beginning with a focus on muscle-strengthening behaviors and gradually adding other activities and behaviors (e.g., aerobic behavior or healthy eating). In our focus group, participants suggested a similar approach using a la carte options to explore other areas of health, such as healthy eating or better sleep habits, and how those behaviors might impact fitness. These health behaviors have been largely unexplored or difficult to target in rural men  (73) (74) (75) , yet our formative work and focus groups both suggested that rural men may be interested in these topics  (18) .\n\nThe alignment of masculine norms, such as self-reliance, physical fitness, and strength, suggests that physical activity identity (i.e., how important physical activity is to self-perception) in men may be a malleable target for physical activity interventions tailored to rural men. In previous work, men with higher masculine identities have been found to be less likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors, such as regular doctor visits or healthy eating  (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) . However, this does not appear to be true for physical activity, particularly as men age  (81, 82) . Findings from in-depth interviews and focus groups suggest that men are more health conscious as they age, and motivated to stay strong and independent as they grow older  (30, 82) . As a result of these previous studies and our formative work  (18, 22) , this intervention was tailored specifically to address how physical activity can improve strength and independence while aging. The alignment of identities may explain how even a 10-wk intervention can increase physical activity identity in rural men. This work will need to be expanded in future research. The intervention improved strength-training behaviors, muscular endurance, and psychosocial constructs of behavioral regulation and physical activity identity. The improvements in these outcomes should be further tested in a two-arm (control and intervention group) Phase IIb pilot study. Improvements to intervention features, such as more accountability, should be made to elicit changes in step counts. Study design changes, such as including a control group and better measures of MVPA, are warranted to determine the intervention's effect on step counts.\n\nOur findings come with some limitations. First, our participants were less ethnically diverse and more educated than national averages for rural communities. There was no control group, so temporal and testing effects cannot be separated from the intervention's effects. Fitbits were used to collect step counts, but Fitbits do not provide an accurate measure of MVPA. Future studies should consider using a validated, objective measure of MVPA. Muscular strength and endurance were assessed over Zoom and not in a laboratory setting, which limits the type and quality of the assessments; however, this is an innovative approach to assess muscular endurance without needing to be physically present in a lab space with an evaluator. Because this was a proof-of-concept study, multiple comparisons were not controlled for, but when applying a Bonferroni correction, only the self-reported MVPA and MET minutes were no longer significant. We recruited mostly from ResearchMatch, and it is unclear whether ResearchMatch participants are representative of the broad population, particularly in terms of interest and participation in a physical activity intervention.\n\nA major strength of this study is the systematic development of the intervention using the ORBIT model. Using previous research on preferences of rural men for a physical activity intervention, we were able to develop an intervention specifically tailored to rural men. Another strength of our study is that we recruited a nationwide sample. This demonstrates the potential to deliver and scale remote interventions to a wide audience at a low cost. The mixed-method approach allowed us to examine the efficacy and areas to improve for future studies.\n\nA nationwide, remotely delivered 10-wk physical activity intervention tailored to rural men had an acceptable attrition rate with participants rating the features at least somewhat useful. Most men completed a majority of the program. In addition, significantly more rural men adopted strength-training behaviors but not higher step counts. Future studies can expand on this work by adding a control group and improving intervention features, such as greater accountability."
