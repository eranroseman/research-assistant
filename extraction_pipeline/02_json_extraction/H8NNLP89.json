  "title": "Evaluation of Digital Mental Health Technologies in the United States: A Systematic Literature Review and Framework Synthesis",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital mental health technologies (DMHT) have the potential to enhance mental healthcare delivery. However, there is little information on how DMHT are evaluated and what factors influence their use. Objective: A systematic literature review was conducted to understand how DMHT are valued in the United States (US) from user, payer, and employer perspectives. Methods: Articles published after 2017 were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, the Health Technology Assessment Database, and digital and mental health congresses. Each article was evaluated by two independent reviewers to identify US studies reporting on factors considered in the evaluation of DMHT targeting mental health, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, or attention deficit hyperactive disorder. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Qualitative and Cohort Studies checklists. Studies were coded and indexed using the American Psychiatric Association's Mental Health App Evaluation Framework to extract and synthesize relevant information. Results: Of 4,353 articles screened, data from 26 unique studies from patient, caregiver, and healthcare provider perspectives were included. Engagement style was the most reported theme (n=23 studies), with users valuing DMHT usability, particularly alignment with therapeutic goals through features including anxiety management tools. Key barriers to DMHT use included limited internet access, poor technical literacy, and privacy concerns. Novel findings included discreetness of DMHT to avoid stigma. Conclusions: Usability, cost, accessibility, technical considerations, and alignment with therapeutic goals are important to users, although DMHT valuation varies across individuals. DMHT apps should be developed and selected with specific user needs in mind.",

In line with the thematic framework synthesis objective, theoretical valuation factors were defined as user or DMHT attributes that impact interaction with or perception of DMHT; therefore, studies only reporting efficacy outcomes, such as mental illness symptom improvement, were deprioritized for full-text review. Secondary research was also deprioritized for full-text review. Studies that reviewed a select app against a framework and studies only reporting outcomes specific to a select app were deprioritized for data extraction. For example, a study reporting the usability of a specific app's features would have been deprioritized, while a study reporting what types of features increase MH app usability in general would not."

      "text": "A framework synthesis approach was undertaken to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data identified from the SLR. In line with the \"best fit\" framework synthesis approach, data were indexed deductively against an existing framework where possible, and novel themes were added inductively as needed  [9, 10] . The American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Mental Health App Evaluation framework was considered the most appropriate framework to address the research objectives of this SLR because its key valuation themes:\n\nwere developed using psychiatrist and patient input, are broadly shared by other evaluation frameworks, are widely acknowledged in the literature, and have been described as durable and adaptable  [11] [12] [13] .\n\nThe APA model follows a hierarchical and chronological order whereby the evaluator moves through the framework using prompting questions (e.g., \"Does the app work offline?\"). For this SLR, these questions were either thematically grouped into subthemes or left as prompting questions, as appropriate. The framework was therefore ultimately adapted into three levels: themes, subthemes, and more granular valuation criteria (Table  1 ). It should be emphasized that this SLR did not aim to formally develop an updated framework to be used in practice by HCPs and their patients, but rather was used to form a theoretical basis for understanding DMHT valuation factors, for which novel themes were expected to emerge.\n\nA data-based convergent approach was used to synthesize quantitative and qualitative data  [14] . Data were initially indexed deductively against the prespecified themes within the data collection instrument, then further synthesized within Docear, a mind-map software used to organize and connect data and concepts. Indexing was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second, independent reviewer. New themes and subthemes that emerged from the literature through inductive coding were added post-hoc to the thematic framework, with all extracted data then considered against both the prespecified and novel themes. Evidence identified for each theme was synthesized narratively, taking into consideration the context and design of each study. and criterion Subtheme Criteria [study reference]\n\nEngagement Style Short-term usability Ease of use  [5, [15] [16] [17]  Available engagement styles  [15, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24]  Long-term usability Alignment of app with needs and priorities  [5, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36]  Forgot or unmotivated to use  [5, 15, 18, 19]  Customizability No further stratification  [16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28]  Background and Accessibility"

Across nine studies, quantitative and qualitative findings demonstrated high interest in anxiety management features like relaxation tools, breathing exercises, and mindfulness/ meditation activities, and ten studies identified interest in mood, symptom, or sleep tracking (Table  3;   Table 4 ). While most studies focused on MH, patients with epilepsy also reported high interest in features to record seizure dates and types  [25] . Importantly, users in two studies emphasized the need for developers to tailor DMHT to the needs and priorities of the target population (Table  3 )  [19, 26] . Relatedly, mixed attitudes were reported towards positive affirmations and words of encouragement, with many users expressing interest but others emphasizing the value of a human component to DMHT or cautioning against blanket encouragement and automated messages that could feel insincere  [15, 19, 32] . Both patients and caregivers expressed interest in psychoeducational content that aligned with their needs and priorities. When surveyed, more than 60% of veterans with anxiety or major depressive disorder (MDD), patients with epilepsy, young adults with psychosis, and essential and furloughed workers during the COVID-19 pandemic expressed interest in relevant psychoeducational content  [24, 25, 28, 29] . In contrast, only 4% of college students in another study reported using an MH app for information about MH, although an MH diagnosis was not required for study participation  [27] .\n\nCaregivers of young adults with psychosis, caregivers of children with ADHD, and spouses/partners of people with bipolar disorder (BD) were all interested in information related to caring for the individual with the given disorder, such as information on psychological and pharmacological treatments, symptoms and symptom changes, and the MH system  [20, 23, 33] . Comparatively smaller, but still notable, proportions of caregivers of patients with psychosis were interested in caregiver-focused information; for instance, 62% to 69% were interested in relaxation exercises, stress/mood management, and community events for caregivers, while 85% to 90% were interested in the aforementioned patient- Social interaction promoted long-term engagement. Qualitatively, three studies found that users valued learning about similar experiences from others via social media-like features, which normalized their experiences and could provide new symptom management strategies (Table  3 )  [19, 26, 30] . Similarly, 67% of both young adults with psychosis and deaf or hard-of-hearing survey participants (N=9) reported interest in peer support via chat features  [24, 32] . However, a comparatively smaller proportion of veterans with anxiety or MDD were interested in peer support (48.3% of the full cohort, 51.3% of the smartphone user subgroup)  [28] . 3 )  [20, 35] .\n\nHowever, one oncology HCP cautioned that, similar to support groups, \"very strict guidelines of what is said\" should be implemented to manage potential risks from shared social media-like content, although little additional context was provided  [26] .\n\nSpouses/partners of people with BD also suggested both in-app information on accessing professional resources and direct counseling for the patient at times where other support might be inaccessible  [20] . More than half of all workers, employed or unemployed during the COVID-19 pandemic, likewise endorsed links to resources, counseling, and crisis support as DMHT features and 81.6% of young adults with psychosis endorsed a feature to communicate with professional experts  [24, 29] . Importantly, patients attending private psychiatric clinics expressed a higher comfort level for in-app communication with HCPs compared with patients attending public clinics, suggesting demographic differences in the valuation of access to professional support through  DMHT [36] .\n\nNine studies reported on interest in DMHT reminders and notifications. Across three studies, >70% of patients or caregivers were interested in appointment reminders  [23] [24] [25] . Additionally, 73% and 68% of patients with epilepsy reported interest in reminders for medication refills and adherence, respectively  [25] .\n\nJune 2024 developed in consideration with patients' social, cognitive, and environmental needs to avoid overwhelming users  [35] . Specifically, two studies reported language as a barrier. Deaf or hard-of-hearing participants recommended visual content presentation, such as videos and icons, alongside text and American Sign Language translations where possible  [32] . Similarly, when discussing English-only apps, one provider stated: \"language is a barrier for some\n\n[patients]\"  [5] . Mobility issues related to MH symptoms or other conditions and technical literacy, such as difficulties remembering passwords and navigating smartphones or apps, created accessibility barriers as well (Table  3 )  [5, 15, 26, 38] . Additional concerns included apps that restricted use based on geographic location  [32] ; user difficulty in how to find relevant, useful apps  [28] ; and limited mobile device memory for downloading apps  [5, 32] .\n\nOffline functionality, reported by six studies, was also captured under the technical considerations subtheme. A majority (56%, N=9) of participants included in the Borghouts et al. 2022 study expressed concern about their mobile data plans when using their devices  [32] . Correspondingly, \"availability of WiFi\" was noted as a top barrier to use for apps for depression by  Stiles-Shield et al. 2017  and several veterans in another study reported that home Wi-Fi connectivity facilitated app usage by eliminating cellular data fees  [15, 18] .\n\nQuotes from patients and HCPs echoed concern about apps without offline functionality (Table  3 )  [21, 37] .\n\nData fees were also captured under the costs subtheme, with hidden or additional costs described as a barrier to app use by two studies  [18, 33]    3 )  [21] ."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "This SLR aimed to identify and synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence on how DMHT are valued by users, payers, and employers in the US. Evidence from users with or without diagnosed relevant disorders, caregivers, and HCPs was captured across a wide range of demographics. No study reported evaluated an app from a payer or employer perspective. Further, all but one included study focused on mobile apps.\n\nNo relevant appraisals of DMHT were identified from the FDA website searches; however, eight relevant FDA approval labels or notifications for MH apps or guidance documents for industry and FDA staff were identified. Assessment of these materials showed overlap with some valuation factors identified in this SLR, including evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, app maintenance, and privacy and security. Engagement style, although not covered by the FDA materials, was the most reported theme by studies included in the SLR and was found to overlap heavily with other themes. Engagement may be a key consideration for app developers, as app user retention can be low: one study showed that more than 90% of users abandon free MH apps within 30 days of installation Background and accessibility findings also identified up-front and hidden costs as barriers to DMHT use, with willingness-to-pay varying among individuals. This has important implications for app development considering that many MH apps currently on the market are direct-to-consumer and require out-of-pocket payment. App developers often take this approach as it does not require the accumulation of formal evidence of clinical benefit for FDA approval  [44] , but it may present a financial barrier to use for consumers.\n\nPrivacy and security, reported by 13 studies, was a prevalent theme, with users primarily concerned with data and PHI security within apps. This finding reflects wider research; a 2019 review of 116 depression-related apps retrieved from iTunes and Google Play stores in 2017 found that only 4% of identified apps had acceptable transparency in privacy and security, with many completely lacking a privacy policy  [45] . Similarly, 39% of MH apps recommended by college counseling centers had no privacy policy, and of those with a policy, 88% collected user data and 49% shared that data with third parties  [4] . Most evidence identified in this SLR under this theme, as well as findings previously published in the wider literature, focus on these remote privacy risks. However, local privacy concerns are also important to users. In particular, inconspicuous naming and the ability to hide sensitive modules within MH apps were rated as June 2024 highly important by both patients and HCPs to maintain user privacy. Users emphasized a desire to avoid stigma associated with mental illness, which was also reflected by findings in the engagement style theme: more young adults with psychosis were more interested in in-app messaging with other patients in psychosis recovery (67.1%) than a provider and family member together (47.3%) or their personal support network (59.8%)  [24] . Similarly, youths were interested in apps that could be used discreetly in school or other public settings to avoid potential MH stigma. This is a key, novel finding of this SLR, considering many app or DMHT components on the market are named after their target disorder.\n\nThe use of DMHT to achieve therapeutic goals was discussed from patient, caregiver, and HCP perspectives, all of which valued DMHT that had evidence of efficacy, presented clinically actionable information, and facilitated the patientclinician relationships. Of the five studies that explored how HCPs value DMHT in clinical practice, two were restricted to the oncology or ASD settings and were not readily generalizable to wider MH settings  [22, 26] . In other studies, providers reported interest in using DMHT to facilitate asynchronous communication with patients and their caregivers, promote patient skill practice, and improve care for children through use of games and visuals  [21, 33] . However, while HCPs overall believed that DMHT improved care, some believed that their clinical training allowed for care personalization beyond what DMHT could provide. Feature customizability and receipt of input from HCPs and users during app development and testing may be a way to mitigate these concerns, as well as concerns about safety and efficacy, as many available apps do not appropriately address user health concerns  [46] . Findings additionally suggested that training and resources on DMHT would be beneficial to ensure that HCPs were equipped to integrate DMHT into their practices  [5] . Collaboration between DMHT specialists and HCPs, along with a shift from randomized controlled trials to effectiveness-implementation hybrid trials, may be a way to streamline the integration of DMHT into clinical care and provide more training and resources for HCPs  [21, 47] ."

Keywords: mental health; mHealth; digital health; digital therapeutics; systematic review; framework synthesis; mixed methods INTRODUCTION Background Digital health is comprised of a broad range of technologies, including mobile health, health information technology, wearable devices, and personalized medicine, which serve as tools to enhance health care delivery. Recently, several digital mental health therapeutics, a category of digital mental health technologies (DMHT), have received United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease based on evidence from superiority trials and compliance with technical guidelines [1,2]. However, the majority of DMHT, particularly apps, fall outside FDA jurisdiction because they are not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease, and because they are \"low risk\" in that they would not cause harm in the event of malfunction [3]. Due to this lack of regulatory framework, few DMHT are supported by published efficacy studies. One study found that only 16% of mental health (MH) apps recommended by college counseling centers were supported by efficacy studies published in peer-reviewed journals [4]."

In addition to hidden costs, this quote identifies up-front app costs as a barrier. Quantitatively, over half of a general population of surveyed college students expressed that cost was a top concern for use of MH apps [16]. Qualitative findings from two additional studies likewise identified cost as a barrier to DMHT use [15,38]. Three novel cost attributes were identified by this SLR: willingness-to-pay, insurance restrictions, and cost saving compared with professional care. Four Value of DMHT Systematic Review 21 June 2024 preferred MH app use over seeing an MH professional due to anonymity or reduced stigma [27]. One participant in a study of VA health service users described access to professional care via MH apps as convenient because they could avoid disclosing their use of MH services to explain leaving work early for an appointment [15]. In line with overarching concern about PHI privacy and security, users valued app security measures. Schueller et al. 2018 reported that 74.2% of users rated data encryption as \"important\" or \"very important\" [17]. Users in another study perceived the level of privacy protection as highest for apps utilizing a combination of a generic app name (i.e., not reflecting the indicated MH disorder); easily hidden modules; and secure, user-authenticated Web portals for making module changes [39].

Engagement is also a key clinical concern in terms of DMHT efficacy; one meta-analysis of 25 studies showed that increased use of DMHT modules was significantly associated with positive outcomes regardless of the target MH condition [41]. The findings of this SLR may therefore be informative to both DMHT designers and HCPs who integrate DMHT into clinical care by providing insight on DMHT valuation, and thus how use and benefit can be improved. For instance, users valued DMHT that were easy to use and aligned with their needs and priorities, particularly through Value of DMHT Systematic Review 21 June 2024 features that supported their therapeutic goals. Additionally, content presented through multiple delivery modes, such as both text and visuals, promoted engagement as well as accessibility. However, engagement and feature preference varied across populations. For instance, DMHT valuation was affected by technical literacy, which may relate to user demographics; in this SLR, veterans repeatedly emphasized technical literacy as a barrier to DMHT use [15]. Similarly, offline functionality may be more important for some users. Despite 85% of the total US population owning smartphones, only 59% of Medicare beneficiaries have access to a smartphone with a wireless plan. Moreover, beneficiaries who are older, less educated, disabled, or Black or Hispanic have even lower digital access [42,43]. These findings emphasize the importance of customizability and suggest that app development and selection in the clinical setting should consider the demographics of the target population, particularly in relation to ease of use and offline functionality."

Willingness-to-pay varied based on user preference; some surveyed college students and smartphone users among general populations valued free apps due to financial restrictions or uncertainty around app effectiveness, even though one student commented that the quality of free trials may be inferior  [16, 17] . Some smartphone users also voiced a limit on how much they would be willing to spend for an app subscription (Table  3 )  [17] .\n\nForma et al. 2022 found that caregivers were willing to pay $255.04 (95% CI: $123.21, $386.86) more per month for a pill with an ingestible sensor that tracked medication adherence, physical activity, and rest, and could connect to an app that also collected self-reported mood data. Moreover, the caregivers were willing to pay $124.50 (95% CI: $48.18, $200.81) more per month for an app-connected pill organizer alone compared with a non-digital pill organizer  [34] . In contrast, some veterans expressed total disinterest in paid apps, with one user citing poor technical literacy (\"don't have the knowledge\") in addition to cost as affecting willingness-to-pay  [15] .\n\nIn another novel finding, a speech-language pathologist working with children with ASD preferred a single app including multiple features over separate apps for particular features due to insurance restrictions: \"I agree that teaching Apps should be an in-App feature versus their own app because sometimes insurance doesn't allow us to open the iPads purchased through insurance\"  [22] . Although no further detail was provided for this finding, it suggests that there may be restrictions on the use of other apps on devices purchased under insurance, which may have implications for DMHT use in formal care settings due to the lack of financial support.\n\nIn a third novel cost-related finding, a small number of participants from a general population of students (3.6%) in one study preferred using an MH app over seeing an MH professional due to cost savings  [27] .\n\nTwo studies reported on the theme of app stability and technical difficulties, with Quantitative and qualitative findings from the general privacy (i.e., evidence not categorized under any specific subtheme), data collection and storage, and privacy policies subthemes revealed heterogeneous concern (Table  3 ). A total of 74% of a general population of college students reported privacy as a top concern for MH apps, although further detail on the specific area of concern was unclear  [16] . In Stiles-Shields et al. 2017, participants were highly concerned with data access, but less so with general privacy  [18] . Echoing concern about data collection and storage, 59.1% of veterans with anxiety or MDD in one study were concerned about in-app PHI protection  [28] ; however, a different, qualitative study in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol use disorder, or MDD reported that a relatively small number of participants expressed privacy concerns. In the latter study, reasons for concern included distrust in Veterans Affairs (VA), belief that digital data is inherently not confidential, and fear of phone hacking  [15] . From an HCP perspective, 0% of surveyed behavioral health HCPs agreed with the statement \"My patients are concerned about data security,\" despite multiple patients within the same study reporting privacy concerns  [5] .\n\nStill, privacy policies were important overall, with 70.5% of smartphone MH app users rating having a privacy policy as \"very important\" or \"important\"  [17] . instance, 53% of a general college student population believed that the potential to share information with their clinician was \"one of the top benefits\" of using  DMHT [16] . Additionally, many HCPs reported active use or interest in use of DMHT in clinical practice to facilitate asynchronous communication and increase patient engagement with treatment outside of formal appointments; however, some preferred traditional care strategies for their personalization and flexibility (Table  3 )  [5, 21, 33] ."

For instance, trust in HCPs and rates of longstanding relationships between patients and primary care providers are lower in the US compared with many European nations  [49, 50] , which could impact the type of support users want from DMHT (i.e., engagement style) or interest in DMHT integration with therapeutic goals.\n\nIn addition to the prespecified eligibility criteria, deprioritization strategies were implemented due to the large volume of identified evidence and may have resulted in relevant articles being missed. In particular, deprioritization of secondary research and opinion pieces likely led to the exclusion of relevant discussion around payer perspectives and reimbursement, for which no evidence was included in this SLR. Furthermore, although unlikely, there may have been reporting biases in the included studies due to missing results, which this SLR was not able to assess.\n\nNo evidence was identified by this SLR for two subthemes included in the APA framework: business model (background and accessibility), which covers DMHT funding sources and potential sources of conflict; and data ownership, access, and export (therapeutic goal), which includes sharing data with electronic health records or wellness devices (for example, Apple HealthKit \u00ae , Fitbit\u2122).

Novel findings included discreetness of DMHT to avoid stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Usability, cost, accessibility, technical considerations, and alignment with therapeutic goals are important to users, although DMHT valuation varies across individuals. DMHT apps should be developed and selected with specific user needs in mind. Keywords: mental health; mHealth; digital health; digital therapeutics; systematic review; framework synthesis; mixed methods INTRODUCTION Background Digital health is comprised of a broad range of technologies, including mobile health, health information technology, wearable devices, and personalized medicine, which serve as tools to enhance health care delivery. Recently, several digital mental health therapeutics, a category of digital mental health technologies (DMHT), have received United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease based on evidence from superiority trials and compliance with technical guidelines [1,2]. However, the majority of DMHT, particularly apps, fall outside FDA jurisdiction because they are not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease, and because they are \"low risk\" in that they would not cause harm in the event of malfunction [3]. Due to this lack of regulatory framework, few DMHT are supported by published efficacy studies. One study found that only 16% of mental health (MH) apps recommended by college counseling centers were supported by efficacy studies published in peer-reviewed journals [4]."

Only one study, which examined ingestible sensor pills and smart pill dispensers to track adherence, investigated a DMHT that was not an app [34]. Most frequently, studies focused on indications for mood, anxiety, or psychotic disorders (n=15) with other indications of focus including ADHD (n=2), ASD (n=1), and epilepsy (n=1). No relevant studies focused on Alzheimer's were identified. Eight studies assessed the perspectives toward DMHT of general population participants, who were not necessarily diagnosed with relevant conditions [16-Value of DMHT Systematic Review 21 June 2024 18,26,27,29,30,32]. Of these populations, several were identified as having an increased risk of MH conditions, such as cancer patients [26], college students [16,27], deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals [32], and people who were unemployed or furloughed during the COVID-19 pandemic [29]. Additionally, one study included a mix of patients who were above and below referral criteria for psychotherapy for depression [18]."

      "description": ". Parents of children with ADHD reported that difficulty paying phone bills could result in their phones being shut off, limiting DMHT use; one MH clinic administrator stated: \"We often encounter parents' phones being shut off because they haven't paid their bill\u2026 If the app were free or low cost, I imagine it could be very helpful\"[33]. In addition to hidden costs, this quote identifies up-front app costs as a barrier. Quantitatively, over half of a general population of surveyed college students expressed that cost was a top concern for use of MH apps [16]. Qualitative findings from two additional studies likewise identified cost as a barrier to DMHT use [15,38]. Three novel cost attributes were identified by this SLR: willingness-to-pay, insurance restrictions, and cost saving compared with professional care. Four Value of DMHT Systematic Review 21 June 2024 preferred MH app use over seeing an MH professional due to anonymity or reduced stigma [27]. One participant in a study of VA health service users described access to professional care via MH apps as convenient because they could avoid disclosing their use of MH services to explain leaving work early for an appointment [15]. In line with overarching concern about PHI privacy and security, users valued app security measures. Schueller et al. 2018 reported that 74.2% of users rated data encryption as \"important\" or \"very important\" [17]. Users in another study perceived the level of privacy protection as highest for apps utilizing a combination of a generic app name (i.e., not reflecting the indicated MH disorder); easily hidden modules; and secure, user-authenticated Web portals for making module changes [39]. Behavioral health clinic staff echoed the importance of discreet MH app names (Table"

      "description": "[40]. Engagement is also a key clinical concern in terms of DMHT efficacy; one meta-analysis of 25 studies showed that increased use of DMHT modules was significantly associated with positive outcomes regardless of the target MH condition [41]. The findings of this SLR may therefore be informative to both DMHT designers and HCPs who integrate DMHT into clinical care by providing insight on DMHT valuation, and thus how use and benefit can be improved. For instance, users valued DMHT that were easy to use and aligned with their needs and priorities, particularly through Value of DMHT Systematic Review 21 June 2024 features that supported their therapeutic goals. Additionally, content presented through multiple delivery modes, such as both text and visuals, promoted engagement as well as accessibility. However, engagement and feature preference varied across populations. For instance, DMHT valuation was affected by technical literacy, which may relate to user demographics; in this SLR, veterans repeatedly emphasized technical literacy as a barrier to DMHT use [15]. Similarly, offline functionality may be more important for some users. Despite 85% of the total US population owning smartphones, only 59% of Medicare beneficiaries have access to a smartphone with a wireless plan. Moreover, beneficiaries who are older, less educated, disabled, or Black or Hispanic have even lower digital access [42,43]. These findings emphasize the importance of customizability and suggest that app development and selection in the clinical setting should consider the demographics of the target population, particularly in relation to ease of use and offline functionality."
