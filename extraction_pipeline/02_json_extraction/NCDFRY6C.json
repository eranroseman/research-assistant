  "title": "Incidence of food allergic reactions among adolescents engaged in food allergy management",
  "abstract": "Background: Although fatal food-induced anaphylaxis is rare, adolescence is the period of highest risk. However, we lack strong estimates of the incidence of food allergic reactions among adolescents. Objective: To estimate the incidence of food allergic and anaphylactic reactions among adolescents with food allergy who have a prescription for epinephrine. Methods: As part of a cohort study that was embedded in a randomized trial to promote safe food allergy management, we followed adolescents aged 15 to 19 years with food allergy and a current prescription for epinephrine for a period of 15 months in 2019 to 2020. At monthly intervals, participants were asked, through text message check-ins, whether they had experienced a food allergic reaction due to accidental exposure to food allergens in the past month. Results: Among the cohort of 131 adolescents, 112 answered at least 1 of the 15 monthly check-ins. Together, these respondents contributed 742 person-months of follow-up data of a total possible 1680 person-months. In the 15-month study period, the incidence of food allergic reactions among adolescents with food allergy was 34.0 events per 100 person-years (95% CI: 21.0-51.9). The incidence of food allergic reactions meeting the criteria for anaphylaxis was 16.2 events per 100 person-years (95% CI: 7.8-29.7). Conclusion: Data on the incidence of food allergic reactions can help set expectations for safe food allergy management for adolescents and their families, and can help inform discussions between patients, families, and physicians regarding different treatment options available and their associated risks and benefits.",

      "text": "The prevalence of food allergy is high and increasing among children and adolescents in the United States. Studies have reported that between 4% and 8% of children and adolescents have at least 1 food allergy, defined as an IgE-mediated immune response to food.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4]  A food allergy diagnosis is often accompanied by lower patient and parental psychosocial well-being and quality of life,  [5] [6] [7] [8]  likely because of concern regarding potentially serious reactions. Reactions are typically accidental (as opposed to during an oral food challenge in a clinic setting) and caused by human error, poorly labeled packaged food, cross-contact during food preparation, or undisclosed ingredients.  9 The severity of a food allergic reaction can be unpredictable. Anaphylaxis, the most severe form of food allergic reaction, often presenting as acute illness with impaired airways and decreased blood pressure, can lead to death.  [10] [11] 1] [12] [13]  Fatal food-induced anaphylaxis is rare,  13, 14  but adolescence is the period of highest risk.  15, 16 stimates of the incidence of food allergic reactions are primarily derived from cross-sectional or retrospective studies with long recall periods (eg, 1 year), and they typically focus on a single food trigger and outcome (eg, anaphylaxis and fatal anaphylaxis).  2, [17] [18] 8] [19]  One systematic review of food allergic reactions in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years found that the incidence of anaphylaxis ranged from 1.23 to 8.85 events per 100 person-years across 7 studies that each focused on a single food allergen (peanut, tree nut, milk, or egg).  18 For anaphylaxis secondary to accidental exposure to peanuts specifically, incidence ranged from 11.94 to 14.34 events per 100 person-years.  18 A meta-analysis of food-induced anaphylaxis found that, across 10 studies, the self-reported incidence in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years was 4.93 events per 100 person-years, with a high level of heterogeneity between studies.  19 The incidence of food-induced anaphylaxis attended to medically was far lower, at 0.20 events per 100 person-years, perhaps reflecting that many people do not seek medical care during a food allergy adverse event, despite potentially serious consequences.  19 ore recently, Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE)-a food allergy advocacy group-initiated a national Patient Registry that surveyed participants about their food allergies and food allergic reactions.  20 Using a cross-section of these data from 2019, Fierstein et al  21  found that 46% of parents/guardians of children and young adults aged 25 years and younger reported that their child had fewer than 1 food allergic reaction per year, 14% reported 1 reaction per year, and 30% reported more than 1 reaction per year. Half of the reactions (50%) occurred at home. A population-based study of adolescents in Australia found that 44% of adolescents aged 10 to 14 years with possible IgE-mediated food allergy reported an allergic reaction in the past year and 34% reported more than 1 reaction.  22 Close to half of the reactions (46%) occurred at home.  22 ur objectives in this study were to estimate the incidence of food allergic reactions and to characterize the nature of those reactions among a cohort of adolescents with food allergy followed for 15 months."

      "text": "This cohort study was part of a randomized trial using text message prompts and incentives to promote safe food allergy management (see Dupuis et al for additional details regarding the trial).  23 We used a cohort multiple randomized trial  24  design to follow a group of adolescents with food allergy in a 2-year period and test 2 sequential interventions intended to increase epinephrine carrying among adolescents at risk for anaphylaxis. At approximately monthly intervals, we queried the cohort study participants by text message, using the Way to Health platform at the University of Pennsylvania,  25  to inquire about any adverse food reactions they experienced in the past month. No additional contact attempts were made if a participant did not respond to this query. At baseline, participants indicated what days (weekday vs weekend) and times they could be reached. Participants received 15 queries between April 2019 and July 2020. If they responded that they had a reaction, we asked participants to complete a survey with details about the reaction, including their location at the time of the reaction, the food they had eaten, whether the food was packaged and labeled, the symptoms they experienced, and how they treated the reaction. A pediatric allergist on the study team followed up with every participant who reported a food allergy adverse event to discuss symptoms, determine whether symptoms had resolved, and confirm they had received appropriate treatment. Any additional details gathered during this phone call were added to the information provided by participants in the initial survey, and the data were stored on the Way to Health platform. During the study period, participants were compensated for completing 3 additional surveys and a debriefing interview, but they did not receive compensation for completing the adverse food reaction surveys.\n\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."

At each of the 15 monthly check-ins, participants could answer yes/no to the question, \"In the past month, have you had an allergic reaction?

We excluded 6 reactions that were due to clinical care (ie, oral food challenge) or participation in another clinical trial (eg, testing a food allergy treatment). The secondary outcome was the number of food allergic reactions meeting the criteria for anaphylaxis, assessed by reviewing participant self-reported symptoms (hives, rash, skin redness, itchy mouth or ears, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, and/or other) and notes made by the pediatric allergist after the follow-up call.\n\nWe categorized the severity of all reactions using the Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) Grading Scale for Systemic Allergic Reactions version 3.0. 12 CoFAR grades range from 1 (mild) to 5 (death). Two pediatric allergists on the research team independently reviewed data regarding each reaction, graded reaction severity using CoFAR criteria, and assessed whether symptoms were consistent with anaphylaxis using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease criteria for diagnosis.  11 Coding disagreements were resolved by reviewing symptoms and justifying rating until consensus was reached."

      "text": "Among the cohort of 131 adolescents participating in the randomized controlled trial, 112 answered at least 1 of the 15 monthly queries. Together, these 112 respondents contributed 742 personmonths (61.8 person-years) of data of a total possible 1680 personmonths, averaging 5.66 months of follow-up per participant (see distribution of person-time contributed in eFig 1). Mean age of the respondents was 16 years; 81.2% identified as White, 96.4% as non-Hispanic, and 52.7% as female. More than two-thirds (70.2%) of the respondents reported having experienced at least 1 food allergic reaction before the study (Table  1 ). There were some differences between more frequent (>5 months of data reporting, above the average of 5.66 months) and less frequent (\u22645 months of data reporting, at or below the average of 5.66 months) respondents. For example, a larger proportion of infrequent respondents were male (50.0% vs 44.6% frequent respondents); had allergy to milk (20.8% vs 12.5%) or had multiple food allergies (77.1% vs 69.6%); and had ever had an allergic reaction before this study (77.1% vs 64.3%). We also observed some differences between respondents and nonrespondents (eTable 1). Compared with the respondents, a larger proportion of nonrespondents were male, reported ever having a food allergic reaction before the study, and had allergy to peanuts. In addition, a smaller proportion of nonrespondents identified as White; had allergy to sesame, shellfish, soy, or another food; and reported multiple allergies compared with the respondents.\n\nOverall, 19 participants (17%) reported 21 allergic reactions to food, including 10 anaphylactic reactions, after accidental exposure during the study period. One participant reported 3 reactions; all others reported only 1 reaction. The participant who reported more than 1 event had reported allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, milk, egg, shellfish, sesame, and other foods and had previously experienced a food allergic reaction before the study. The incidence of food allergic reactions (primary outcome) during the study period was 2.83 reactions per 100 person-months (95% CI: 1.75-4.33), equivalent to 34.0 reactions per 100 person-years (95% CI: 21.0-51.9) (Table  2 ). The incidence of food allergic reactions that met the criteria for anaphylaxis was 1.35 reactions per 100 person-months (95% CI: 0.65-2.48), equivalent to 16.2 reactions per 100 person-years (95% CI: 7.8-29.7).\n\nOn the basis of the reported symptoms for each reaction, 11 (52.4%) were classified as grade 1, 8 (38.1%) were classified as grade 2, and 2 (9.5%) were classified as grade 3 according to the CoFAR grading scale (Table  3 ). The most common symptom was a dry, itchy rash, One participant who reported seeking help from a friend also reported taking no steps after their reaction. which was experienced in 66.7% of the reactions, followed by hives in 42.9% of the reactions. Epinephrine was available for all but 1 reaction. Among the 10 reactions that met the criteria for anaphylaxis, only 6 (60.0%) were treated with epinephrine. Only 1 reaction that did not meet the criteria for anaphylaxis was treated with epinephrine. The most common treatment used was antihistamines (90.5% of the reactions). Participants identified the culprit food that triggered the reaction in 18 of the 21 reported reactions (eTable 2)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the incidence of food allergic reactions in a cohort of adolescents aged 15 to 19 years with food allergy using timely (monthly) queries. We found that adolescents experienced 2.83 reactions per 100 person-months (34.0 reactions per 100 patients per year). We also found that adolescents experienced 1.35 reactions meeting the criteria for anaphylaxis per 100 person-months (16.2 events per 100 patients per year).\n\nGiven the overall limited number of studies, the variability in ascertainment of reactions, and the range of study populations evaluated, comparisons across studies of food allergic reactions in adolescents are difficult. A recent (2024) study by Hsu et al  27  among pediatric patients with food allergy used a prospective design and queried, on a monthly basis, the parents of patients with food allergy to assess whether they had experienced a food allergic reaction in the past month. They found that, among the 196 participants aged 2 months to 18 years, the annualized rate of food allergic reactions was 0.76 reaction per person-year (or 76 reactions per 100 personyears),  27  a higher incidence than the one we report (34.0 reactions per 100 person-years). However, a systematic review of 4-to 17year-olds found that the incidence of food-induced anaphylaxis in children and adolescents with food allergy ranged from 1.23 to 8.85 events per 100 person-years,  18  substantially lower than our estimate (16.2 events per 100 person-years). Possible explanations for the range of different estimates are that our sample included only adolescents aged 15 to 19 years prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector, which may have a different risk profile than populations in other studies, and the different study designs and recall periods. For example, in the study by Hsu et al,  27  participant mean age at enrollment was 5.55 years, which is much younger than the mean age at recruitment for the participants in our study (16.53 years), and the distribution of food allergies is different between both studies (eg, 7.7% reported a shellfish allergy and 32.7% reported an egg allergy in the study of Hsu et al 27 compared with 18.3% and 16.3%, respectively, in our study).\n\nEpinephrine is the preferred treatment for anaphylaxis.  28 The proportion of food allergic reactions that met the criteria for anaphylaxis (47.6%) in our study was higher than the proportion of reactions treated with epinephrine (33.3%), indicating a potential treatment gap. Recognizing the signs of anaphylaxis can be difficult, especially given the variety of definitions and variable clinical manifestations, including within individual patients across episodes.  28 Even among trained emergency medical services providers, epinephrine administration for the treatment of anaphylaxis in the prehospital setting ranges from 2.4% to 69.2% of cases of anaphylaxis.  29 In a recent analysis of data from the FARE Patient Registry, Fierstein et al  21  found that 23.1% of the most recent food allergic reactions experienced by children and young adults (aged 0-25 years) were treated with an epinephrine autoinjection and 39.8% were perceived as severe or very severe. Lower rates of epinephrine treatment in the FARE Patient Registry population compared with ours might be due to our inclusion of adolescents that were prescribed epinephrine and who were embedded in a larger trial focused on encouraging epinephrine carrying. One plausible explanation for the reaction treated with epinephrine that did not meet the criteria for anaphylaxis is that adolescents with severe food allergies may be directed by their provider to treat any reaction with epinephrine to preemptively avoid more severe symptoms that may lead to anaphylaxis.  30 here are multiple benefits of having solid estimates of food allergic reaction incidence for children, adolescents, and families. Food allergy is associated with negative quality of life and high levels of anxiety among children with food allergies and their caregivers.  5, 6, 31, 32 The uncertainty that accompanies a food allergy diagnosis and the unpredictability of food allergic reactions are some of the factors contributing to these poor psychosocial outcomes. Our estimates for the incidence of food allergic reactions among a cohort of adolescents prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector may help set expectations for safe food allergy management. In addition, the relative infrequency of food allergy adverse events among affected individuals presents a behavioral challenge. Given that each affected person is likely to experience an adverse event only once every 3 years, it may be particularly difficult to sustain attention and vigilance regarding preventive behaviors, including allergen avoidance and epinephrine carrying. Sustained attention to risk may be particularly challenging for adolescents. Finally, knowing the incidence of reactions can help inform discussions between patients, families, and physicians regarding different treatment options available (such as desensitization through oral immunotherapy or omalizumab) and their associated benefits and risks.  33, 34 ur study has multiple strengths and limitations. In addition to following adolescents with a range of food allergies and including food allergic reactions of varying severity, this is 1 of 2 studies, to our knowledge, that used an active approach to collecting data on food allergic reactions at frequent time intervals. Unlike studies typically asking patients to recall allergic reactions that occurred in the past year, we prompted adolescents to report food allergic reactions monthly by text message, reducing potential recall bias.  35 In addition, adverse events were reviewed and graded for severity by 2 pediatric allergists.\n\nThere are limitations to the generalizability of the results from this sample. We followed a relatively homogeneous group of adolescents in terms of age, race, and ethnicity, all of whom were required to have a prescription for epinephrine to participate in the trial; many of the patients were also receiving care from a pediatric allergy specialist, indicating high engagement with food allergy management and possibly a history of more severe food allergic reactions. Our estimate for the incidence of food allergic reactions may be different from one derived from the full population of adolescents with food allergies. Another limitation is the relatively small sample size, incomplete participation, and the relatively short follow-up period of 15 months. It is possible that there was self-selection both into the cohort study initially and with respect to active participation, as participants contributed less than 6 months of data, on average, of a possible 15 months, and we observed differences in demographic characteristics between respondents and nonrespondents. Longer and larger studies using a similar active approach are needed. Our study relied on self-reported reactions to foods, which may raise concerns around reliability and validity. Participants did, however, report the foods they had eaten, the symptoms they experienced, and the treatments they administered for each reaction, and all reactions were independently reviewed by 2 pediatric allergists. In addition to attrition and intermittent missing data, estimates of both the incidence of food allergic reactions and the proportion meeting criteria for anaphylaxis may be overestimated if we assume that adolescents were more likely to respond to the adverse event text message prompt in a month during which they experienced any food allergic reaction (compared with no reaction) or anaphylaxis (compared with a mild reaction).
