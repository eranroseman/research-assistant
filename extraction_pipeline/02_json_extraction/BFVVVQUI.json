  "title": "The effect of physical activity on mortality and cardiovascular disease in 130 000 people from 17 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries: the PURE study",
  "abstract": "Background Physical activity has a protective effect against cardiovascular disease (CVD) in high-income countries, where physical activity is mainly recreational, but it is not known if this is also observed in lower-income countries, where physical activity is mainly non-recreational. We examined whether different amounts and types of physical activity are associated with lower mortality and CVD in countries at different economic levels. \n Methods In this prospective cohort study, we recruited participants from 17 countries (Canada, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland, Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Colombia, Iran, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe). Within each country, urban and rural areas in and around selected cities and towns were identified to reflect the geographical diversity. Within these communities, we invited individuals aged between 35 and 70 years who intended to live at their current address for at least another 4 years. Total physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPQA). Participants with pre-existing CVD were excluded from the analyses. Mortality and CVD were recorded during a mean of 6\u20229 years of follow-up. Primary clinical outcomes during follow-up were mortality plus major CVD (CVD mortality, incident myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure), either as a composite or separately. The effects of physical activity on mortality and CVD were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and other risk factors taking into account household, community, and country clustering. Findings Between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2010, 168 916 participants were enrolled, of whom 141 945 completed the IPAQ. Analyses were limited to the 130 843 participants without pre-existing CVD. Compared with low physical activity (<600 metabolic equivalents [MET] \u00d7 minutes per week or <150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity), moderate (600-3000 MET \u00d7 minutes or 150-750 minutes per week) and high physical activity (>3000 MET \u00d7 minutes or >750 minutes per week) were associated with graded reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0\u202280, 95% CI 0\u202274-0\u202287 and 0\u202265, 0\u202260-0\u202271; p<0\u20220001 for trend), and major CVD (0\u202286, 0\u202278-0\u202293; p<0\u2022001 for trend). Higher physical activity was associated with lower risk of CVD and mortality in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. The adjusted population attributable fraction for not meeting the physical activity guidelines was 8\u20220% for mortality and 4\u20226% for major CVD, and for not meeting high physical activity was 13\u20220% for mortality and 9\u20225% for major CVD. Both recreational and non-recreational physical activity were associated with benefits. Interpretation Higher recreational and non-recreational physical activity was associated with a lower risk of mortality and CVD events in individuals from low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. Increasing physical activity is a simple, widely applicable, low cost global strategy that could reduce deaths and CVD in middle age.",

      "text": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide 1 and a major economic global burden.  2  Despite reductions in CVD mortality in high-income countries, global CVD mortality increased by 41% between 1990 and 2013, largely driven by rises in lowincome and lower-middle-income countries.  3 Indeed, 70% of global CVD deaths come from low-income and middle-income countries, where it is the commonest cause of death.  4, 5 23% of the world's population is estimated to be insufficiently active  6  and WHO has recommended a decrease in insufficient physical activity of 10% (of the aforementioned 23%) by 2020.  7 any studies from high-income countries have reported significant inverse associations of physical activity with mortality and CVD morbidity,  8  but such data from low-income and middle-income countries are sparse and limited to a few small studies.  [9] [10] 0] [11]  Moreover, studies of physical activity have focused primarily on recreational physical activity (which is common in high-income countries but less common in poorer countries),  8, 11  with less evidence on the benefits of other forms of physical activity such as during transportation,  12  housework, and occupational physical activity.  13 n the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiologic (PURE) study done in 17 countries of various income levels, we examined whether physical activity is associated with lower risk of mortality and CVD in countries at varying economic levels and whether these associations differ by type of physical activity."

The choice and number of countries selected in PURE reflects a balance between involving many countries at different economic levels with substantial heterogeneity in social and economic circumstances versus the feasibility of centres to successfully achieve long-term follow-up.\n\nWithin each country, urban and rural areas in and around selected cities and towns were identified to reflect the geographical diversity of the countries. Communities were defined based on the geographical clustering of common characteristics (sharing culture [as people of a similar culture reside in close geographical proximity]; socioeconomic status; and use of amenities, goods, and services) such as through a set of contiguous postal code areas or group of streets or a small village. The number of communities selected in each country varied. In some countries (eg, India, China, Canada, and Colombia), communities from several states and provinces were included to capture diversity, socioeconomic status, culture, and environments. In other countries (eg, Iran, Poland, Sweden, and Zimbabwe), fewer communities were selected. This strategy facilitated recruitment of individuals from different economic, cultural, and geographical settings (rural and urban) around the globe.\n\nWithin each defined community, households were approached and individuals aged 35-70 years who intended to live at their current address for at least another 4 years were invited to participate in the study. The method of approaching households differed between countries based on feasibility but was consistent across sites within each country. For example, in rural areas of India and China, a community announcement was made to the village through contact of a community leader, followed by inperson door-to-door visits of all households. In Canada, initial contact was by mail followed by telephone invitations to attend a central clinic. For each household at least three attempts at contact were made. All eligible residents of the household were invited and those who provided informed consent were recruited. Household participation rate was 86%. Recruitment started in a vanguard phase in Karnataka, India in January, 2003; however most communities recruited between January, 2005, and"

In low-income and middle-income countries, physical activity is predominantly from non-recreational activities such as transportation, occupation, and housework, and therefore findings in high-income countries might not apply to other countries. A few studies have reported on the role of physical activity in low-income and middle-income countries, but these were cross-sectional or used inconsistent methods and are therefore not robust.

The greatest reductions occurred at the lowest and continued to be present at very high levels of physical activity with no indication of a ceiling effect. In addition, both recreational and non-recreational physical activity were associated with lower risks. Physical activity is a low-cost approach to reducing deaths and cardiovascular disease that is applicable globally with potential large impact.\n\nDecember, 2010 (appendix). The study was approved by local institutional research ethics boards.\n\nSociodemographic factors, medical history, lifestyle behaviours, and risk factors were recorded using standardised measures and procedures.  11 1-week total physical activity was assessed using the long-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)  15  and calculated as a total of occupation, transportation, house work, and recreational activity reported in metabolic equivalents (MET) \u00d7 minutes per week. Physical activity was also reported in minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity using the equation where minutes reported in each physical activity domain on the IPAQ by the participant are weighted relative to moderate intensity physical activity:\n\nTotal physical activity was categorised as low (<600 MET \u00d7 minutes per week), moderate (600-3000 MET \u00d7 minutes per week), and high (>3000 MET \u00d7 minutes per week) physical activity, corresponding to less than 150 minutes per week, 150-750 minutes per week, and more than 750 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity. Physical activity was also dichotomised as meeting or not meeting current physical activity guidelines (\u2265600 MET \u00d7 minutes per week as per the IPAQ  15  or physical activity \u2265150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity as per WHO  16  ) with periods of less than 10 minutes of physical activity not included as per the IPAQ guidelines.  15, 16 We further categorised the high physical activity category into lower-high physical activity and an upper-high physical activity by the median value of the high physical activity category of 6453 MET \u00d7 minutes per week to investigate whether the effect of very high physical activity was graded. Physical activity was categorised into recreational physical activity and non-recreational physical activity (occupational, transportation, and housework)."

In most low-income and middleincome countries there was no central system of death or event registration. We therefore obtained information on history of illness and medically certified cause of death where available, and recorded best available information from close family or friends to arrive at a probable diagnosis or cause of death. Death certificates (available in 100% of deaths), medical records (percentage of availability of medical records for the following conditions: myocardial infarc tion 49\u20224%, stroke 80\u20228%, and heart failure 76\u20222%), household interviews, and other sources of information were used. We also used verbal autopsies to ascertain cause of death in addition to medical records that were reviewed by a health prof essional.  17 To ensure a standard approach and accuracy for classification of events across all countries and over time, a selection of cases from each country annually was adjudicated both locally and also by the adjudication chair, and further training was provided if necessary."

The primary analyses were done excluding participants who reported having CVD at baseline. Baseline characteristics were described for the entire cohort and stratified by low, moderate, and high total physical activity. Total and domain-specific physical activity values were not normally distributed and are presented as median and IQR.  18 The Kruskal-Wallis test and Jonckheere-Terpstra test  19, 20  were used to test the heterogeneity and trend across the four country income levels (high-income countries, uppermiddle-income countries, lower-middle-income countries, or low-income countries), respectively. For the two categorical physical activity variables: total physical activity and whether meeting physical activity guideline, we calculated frequencies and compared their difference and trend across the country income levels using the \u03c7\u00b2 test and Cochran-Armitage test,  21, 22  as appropriate.\n\nAge-sex-standardised incidence rates for all outcomes were calculated for total physical activity and whether meeting physical activity guidelines.  23 To examine the association between physical activity variables and outcomes, we used the marginal Cox proportional hazard model.  24, 25 Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, country income level, residency (urban vs rural), family history of CVD, and smoking status (current or ever smoker vs never smoker; cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking) taking into account three levels of clustering. We did further analyses using wealth index and household income (in separate models) in place of education but these did not change the results. We further adjusted for body-mass index (BMI).\n\nAdjusted population attributable fractions that were related to not meeting physical activity guidelines and not achieving high physical activity were calculated to quantify the benefit of physical activity, using the method developed by Chen and colleagues.  26 To minimise the potential for reverse causation, we did sensitivity analyses by excluding participants who had CVD events in the first 2 years of follow-up. Additional analyses were also done including PURE participants who had CVD at baseline (n=141 945), which yielded similar results. We estimated the effect of total physical activity on the outcomes by country income level; sex; age (<50 or \u226550 years); BMI (<25 kg/m\u00b2 or \u226525 kg/m\u00b2); waist-to-hip ratio (above 0\u202285 for women and girls, 0\u202290 for men and boys); and smoking, hypertension, and diabetes.\n\nSee Online for appendix Min per week = 0\u2022825 \u00d7 walking min + 1 \u00d7 moderate min + 1\u2022375 \u00d7 garden min + 1\u20225 \u00d7 cycling min + 2 \u00d7 vigorous min Overall (n=130 843) Low physical activity* (n=23 631) Moderate physical activity \u2020 (n=49 348) High physical activity \u2021 (n=57 864) Age (years) 50\u20222 (9\u20227) 51\u20220 (10\u20221) 50\u20225 (9\u20227) 49\u20227 (9\u20225) Male 54 621 (41\u20227%) 11 080 (46\u20229%) 18 224 (36\u20229%) 25 317 (43\u20228%) Urban resident 69 993 (53\u20225%) 12 983 (54\u20229%) 28 525 (57\u20228%) 28 485 (49\u20222%) Country income level High 13 546 (10\u20224%) 1435 (6\u20221%) 4991 (10\u20221%) 7120 (12\u20223%) Upper middle 34 625 (26\u20225%) 7479 (31\u20226%) 11 922 (24\u20222%) 15 224 (26\u20223%) Lower middle 53 841 (41\u20221%) 8620 (36\u20225%) 22 648 (45\u20229%) 22 573 (39\u20220%) Low 28 831 (22\u20220%) 6097 (25\u20228%) 9787 (19\u20228%) 12 898 (22\u20224%) Education None, primary, or unknown 54 635 (41\u20229%) 10 642 (45\u20222%) 19 085 (38\u20228%) 24 908 (43\u20221%) Secondary 50 500 (38\u20227%) 9035 (38\u20223%) 19 746 (40\u20221%) 21 719 (37\u20226%) Trade, college, or university 25 396 (19\u20225%) 3885 (16\u20225%) 10 412 (21\u20221%) 11 099 (19\u20222%) Family history of heart disease or stroke 36 812 (31\u20223%) 4911 (23\u20225%) 13 605 (30\u20225%) 18 296 (35\u20220%) Hypertension 47 752 (39\u20220%) 9053 (42\u20226%) 18 364 (39\u20227%) 20 335 (36\u20229%) Diabetes 12 740 (9\u20227%) 2898 (12\u20223%) 5102 (10\u20223%) 4740 (8\u20222%) Smoker (current and former) 40 955 (31\u20225%) 7093 (30\u20223%) 13 695 (28\u20220%) 20 167 (35\u20220%) Alternate Healthy Eating Index score 35\u20221 (8\u20220) 34\u20229 (7\u20226) 35\u20225 (7\u20229) 34\u20228 (8\u20223) Body-mass index (kg/m\u00b2) 25\u20227 (5\u20221) 25\u20229 (5\u20224) 25\u20229 (5\u20220) 25\u20224 (5\u20221) Data are mean (SD) or n (%).

Table  1  presents participant charac teristics stratified by low, moderate, and high physical activity. Participant characteristics were not materially different in most features across the three groups with the exception of a lower proportion of males in the moderate physical activity group compared with the others and a greater proportion of family history of CVD in the high physical activity group.

Based on data for 115 436 participants with complete data. Low physical activity (<600 MET \u00d7 min per week) is the reference group. Moderate physical activity=600-3000 MET \u00d7 min per week. High physical activity=>3000 MET \u00d7 min per week. PA=physical activity. HR=hazard ratio. MET=metabolic equivalents. BMI=body-mass index. WHR=waist-to-hip ratio (high WHR was defined as above 0\u202285 for women and girls and above 0\u20229 for men and boys).\n\nin place of education, HRs did not change (appendix). High physical activity was associated with a lower HR than was moderate physical activity for all outcomes. Dichotomising high physical activity above or below the median value in this group of 6453 MET \u00d7 minutes per week did not show further reductions in risk (appendix). Higher physical activity was also associated with lower HRs in CVD mortality, non-CVD mortality, and myocardial infarction (appendix). With further adjustment for BMI, the HRs were slightly attenuated but remained significant (appendix). Excluding participants who had a CVD event within the first 2 years of follow-up (to account for potential reverse causality if sick individuals were less active), the results were consistent for all outcomes (appendix).\n\nSurvival curves for low, moderate, and high physical activity for our three primary outcomes of mortality plus major CVD, mortality, and major CVD indicated a lower risk as physical activity increased (p<0\u20220001; appendix).\n\nThe 5-year adjusted population attributable fraction of not meeting the physical activity guidelines was 5\u20223% for mortality plus major CVD, 8\u20220% for mortality, and 4\u20226% for major CVD (appendix). These values were higher (10\u20223% for mortality plus major CVD, 13\u20220% for mortality, and 9\u20225% for major CVD) in participants who did not achieve high physical activity (appendix).\n\nIncreasing physical activity was associated with lower risk of mortality in a range of subgroups (figure  2 ).

      "text": "In this study involving three high-income countries, seven upper-middle-income countries, three lowermiddle-income countries, and four low-income countries, higher physical activity was associated with a lower risk for mortality and incidence of major CVD. This lower risk was present even at moderate physical activity compared with low physical activity, and was more marked at higher physical activity. The benefit of physical activity was independent of the type of physical activity (recreational or non-recreational), a range of Country income level HIC+UMIC LMIC+LIC 0\u20225 Hazard ratio (95% CI ) p for interaction=0\u20220012 ). Hazard ratios (and 95% CI) were adjusted for age, sex, education, country income level, urban or rural residency, family history of CVD, and smoking status taking into account household, community, and country clustering. Low physical activity (<600 MET \u00d7 min per week) is the reference group. CVD=cardiovascular disease. MET=metabolic equivalents. *CVD mortality plus incident myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure. \u2020Moderate physical activity=600-3000 MET \u00d7 min per week and 150-750 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity. \u2021High physical activity=>3000 MET \u00d7 min per week and >750 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity.\n\nTable 4: Summary of risk of mortality and major CVD events stratified by country income level and physical activity\n\nsocioeconomic and CVD risk factors, and was similar in various countries with differing income levels.\n\nIn our study participants who reside in predominantly non-high-income countries, meeting the WHO guideline of 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity of physical activity was associated with a 22% lower risk for all-cause mortality plus major CVD, 28% lower risk of mortality, and 20% lower risk of major CVD, resulting in adjusted population attributable fractions of 5\u20223% for all-cause mortality plus major CVD, 8\u20220% for mortality, and 4\u20226% for major CVD. These attributable fractions are similar to those reported by Lee and colleagues:  9  9\u20224% for mortality and 5\u20228% for CVD in high-income coun tries. We observed a graded effect, such that participants with higher physical activity had a lower risk than those participants engaging in moderate physical activity. For example, compared with people at moderate physical activity, high physical activity conferred an additional reduction in risk of 15% for mortality plus major CVD, 19% for mortality, and 12% for major CVD. This benefit plateaued only at very high physical activity (approximately 1250 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity). Similar to previous studies of recreational physical activity in high-income countries,  28, 29  we did not observe any adverse effects of physical activity on our outcomes even in the approximately 9000 participants who reported over 2500 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity (equivalent to 17 times that of physical activity guidelines). Therefore, participating at even low physical activity confers benefit (30 minutes per day for 5 days a week), and the benefit continues to increase up to high total physical activity. The affordability of other CVD interventions such as consuming fruits and vegetables,  30  and generic CVD drugs is beyond the reach of many people in low-income and middle-income countries; 31 however, physical activity represents a lowcost approach to CVD prevention .\n\nWhen stratified by country income level, there was a consistent reduction of risk with increasing physical activity. In high-income countries, meeting the physical activity guidelines was associated with a 30% lower risk for mortality, which is lower than the 11% reported in a meta-analysis of walking from a study done predominantly in high-income countries.  12 However, this earlier study did not include participants in the high physical activity range (>3000 MET \u00d7 minutes per week), in whom we found a continued benefit with increasing physical activity. Studies in Iran and China  32, 33  also reported physical activity to be significantly associated with lower mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, Matthews and colleagues  33  reported an HR of 0\u202261 (95% CI 0\u202251-0\u202273) at the highest physical activity of the Chinese women, which is similar to our HR of 0\u202265 (0\u202260-0\u202271). These findings are consistent with what we found in the lower-middle-income category of countries, of which Iran and China accounted for by far the most participants in our lower-middle-income countries.\n\nHigher physical activity was associated with a lower risk of mortality plus major CVD in higher-income and uppermiddle-income countries compared with lower-middleincome and low-income countries for both total and recreational physical activity; differences with respect to non-recreational physical activity were less clear. It is unclear why recreational physical activity might be less effective in the lower-middle-income and low-income countries; however, few participants from the countries participated in any recreational physical activity and so these findings could be swayed by a few participants who are atypical of the general populations in poorer countries.\n\nFew studies have assessed the association of nonrecreational physical activity with outcomes. The available studies are small and report inconsistent results.  12, [34] [35] ] [36] [37] [38]  Higher recreational and non-recreational physical activity were independently associated with lower risk with our composite of all-cause mortality plus major CVD, indicating that physical activity of any type is beneficial. Of note, high physical activity was only possible in those individuals participating in non-recreational physical activity. Indeed, only 2\u20229% of our study population participated in high physical activity (\u22653000 MET \u00d7 minutes per week or \u2265750 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity) that derived exclusively from rec reational physical activity compared with 37\u20229% of participants who attained this through non-recreational physical activity. This reflects the challenges inherent with participating in high recreational physical activity in that it is, by definition, done during discretionary hours of the day outside of occupational and domestic duties. By contrast, incorporating physical activity into a daily lifestyle whether through active transportation, occu pation, or domestic duties has the potential to achieve higher physical activity that is associated with even lower risk for mortality and CVD events.\n\nTo address concerns related to reverse causality, we excluded individuals with known CVD and then did a sensitivity analysis further excluding those who had events within the first 2 years of follow-up. Our results were unchanged for our main study outcomes. We also did subgroup analyses stratified by sex, age, BMI, smoking, presence of hypertension, and presence of diabetes, and observed consistent results. We also observed that increasing physical activity was associated with reduced CVD and non-CVD mortality. Regular physical activity is associated with lower mortality from some cancers  28, 34, 36, 39  and respiratory conditions.  40 With continued follow-up, we anticipate accruing enough events to reliably investigate the effects of physical activity on specific categories of non-CVD mortality.\n\nOur study had several limitations. Although physical activity defined from the self-reported IPAQ modestly overestimates physical activity, it demonstrates good reliability and moderate validity compared with accelerometers such that higher IPAQ values correspond to higher physical activity measured by accelerometers, thus providing good internal validity.  15, 41, 42 If physical activity is overestimated by the IPAQ, then the potential benefits of physical activity could be more marked and might occur at lower physical activity than reported here. The IPAQ has been tested across a range of countries similar to the PURE study  15  and the use of self-reported measures for assessing physical activity in large studies is considered acceptable in low-resource settings.  43 lthough it was not feasible to collect a proportionate sampling of the world's population, our selection of countries and communities ensured that our population was typical of the regions from which participants were recruited with only modest differences compared with national data (appendix).  44 Although we did not recruit a random sample of individuals, our approach minimised biases in selection of individuals once the communities were identified. Given the range of countries across five continents at different economic levels, the large number of communities, and the large size of our study, our results are globally applicable. Given our method of event ascertainment, it is possible that some events might have been misclassified. However, we believe this potential misclassification to include few events, as most events were ascertained using supporting documents, standard definitions, and adjudication using standard definitions providing high confidence in the validity. Lastly, in such a large study, it is not uncommon to report low p values that might not be clinically rele vant, therefore p values should be interpreted with caution unless they are extreme (p<0\u2022001). Given the magni tude and consistency of the effects observed across the different analyses, we are confident in our main findings.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that physical activity (both recreational and non-recreational) is associated with a lower risk for mortality and major CVD events, which was independent of the type of physical activity and other risk factors. This finding was seen in all major regions of the world and various country economic levels. In particular, we demonstrate that increasing physical activity is associated with lower risk in lower-middleincome countries and low-income countries. Even meeting the physical activity guidelines such as walking for as little as 30 minutes on most days of the week had a substantial benefit, and higher physical activity (up to and beyond 17 times the recommended physical activity guidelines) were associated with even lower risks. As participating in physical activity (esp ecially in daily life) is inexpensive, physical activity is a low-cost approach to reducing deaths and CVD that is applicable globally with large potential effect. The results of our study provide robust evidence to support public health interventions to increase all forms of physical activity in countries of different socioeconomic circumstances.  45 ntributors SAL wrote the analysis plans and had the primary responsibility for writing this paper.
