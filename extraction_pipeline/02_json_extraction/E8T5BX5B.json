  "title": "Educational Intervention Using WhatsApp on Medication Adherence in Hypertension and Diabetes Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Low adherence to pharmacological therapy by patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension is frequent and represents a worldwide challenge. Introduction: This study examined the effect of an educational intervention using WhatsApp \u00d2 messaging on medication adherence of patients with hypertension and diabetes. Materials and Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed with 403 patients who had diabetes and/or hypertension and who had enrolled in the 33 Basic Health Units of Maringa \u00b4-PR, Brazil. The patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 203), which received usual care (multi-professional educational appointments according to each Unit schedule) plus 55 audio, image or text WhatsApp messages about health care promotion, with an emphasis on medication adherence, or the control group. The control group (n = 200) only received usual care. Medication adherence, as measured by the Morisky-Green Test, was compared through the chi-square test after 16 weeks. Relative risk (RR) was used as a measure of effect size. Results: After the follow-up period (4 months), 67.5% of the patients in the intervention group were adherent versus 58.5% in the control group (RR: 1.15, 95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.34, p = 0.077). Discussion: Although the effect of the intervention was not statistically significant, there was a clinically significant impact associated with a 15% increase in medication adherence. \n Conclusion: Given the complexity of adherence to the use of antidiabetic and antihypertensive medications, educational interventions using WhatsApp could be useful as a reinforcement to increase adherence to medication.",

      "text": "oncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs) cause 38 million deaths worldwide each year. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension are highly prevalent and NCDs associated with chronic complications that are frequently asymptomatic.  1 In Brazil, about 36 million people had hypertension and *14.3 million had DM during 2015.  2, 3 ntihypertensive and hypoglycemic medications are provided by Brazil's Unified Health System.  4 Given the impacts of diabetes and hypertension on the Brazilian population, in 2002 the Ministry of Health created the System for Registration and Monitoring of Hypertensive and Diabetic Patients (Hi-perDia)  5  to monitor the conditions and reorient pharmaceutical care to a continuous and free supply of prescribed medication.  6, 7 espite the availability of drugs through the Unified Health System, adherence to pharmacological treatment by these patients is frequently low, which is also considered a problem throughout the world. Overall, the rate of pharmacological adherence by patients with chronic diseases is low, by an estimated average of 50%,  8  contributing to higher public costs associated with increased use of health care services, decreased productivity, and long-term treatment chronic complications.  2  A recent meta-analysis shows that interventions aimed at increasing adherence to pharmacological treatment should focus on behavioral strategies, especially those aimed at changing habits.  9 In this context, considering the ubiquity of smartphones in people's daily lives, there is potential for mobile health (mHealth) tools  10  to facilitate adherence to chronic disease treatment.  [11] [12] 2] [13]  A systematic review including 107 studies found that short-message services were the most commonly used to promote adherence, accounting for 40.2% (43 of 107), in comparison to apps or phones plus specific software.  14 However, studies that use the multimedia tool WhatsApp \u00d2 (Facebook, Inc.)\n\nwere not mentioned, even though the app was launched in 2009 and sold to Facebook, Inc., in 2014. When apps are described, they are typically installed on the patient's mobile phone to remind them to check symptoms, maintain a food diary or to connect patients to DM educators in real time. None used WhatsApp even with its potential to send multimedia messages.\n\nMessaging applications such as WhatsApp have become popular, with approximately one billion active users. Its advantages are: It works on multiple platforms (Android, IOS), is free and interactive, and allows sending real-time messages to multiple recipients, and the messages can be customized.  15 Some studies show that mobile apps and mHealth interventions can positively motivate and influence attitude toward change  12, 16  ; however, gaps in knowledge remain, including a lack of comparison between the effect and types of interventions.  17 Consequently, this study examined the effect of an educational intervention using WhatsApp messaging on medication adherence by patients with hypertension and diabetes."

The length of follow-up was based on results from previous publications on mHealth interventions, diabetes,  21, 22  and hypertension.  17, 23 he audio messages were recorded in an audio studio for good sound quality, and the images and illustrations were made in Adobe Illustrator graphic software by a graphic artist.\n\nThe messages were sent through the Bulkservice \u00d2 platform, an online application for managing marketing campaigns.

(2) Are you careless at times about taking your medications? (3) When you feel better, do you sometimes stop taking your medications? and (4) Sometimes, if you feel worse when you take your medications, do you stop taking them? The possible answers to all questions are ''yes'' or ''no.'' Each negative response is attributed one point. Patients with a score of 4 are considered adherent, whereas scores of 3 or less characterize the patient as nonadherent.  28"

The researcher who made the telephone contacts with the participants to evaluate the outcome was blinded to the patient group. Figure  1  shows the sample selection process.\n\nA total of 496 patients who participated in the study were included, of whom 57 (11.49%) had only diabetes, 278 (56.05%) had only hypertension, and 161 (32.46%) had both diseases."

Sixteen weeks after baseline evaluation, medication adherence of patients in the intervention and control groups increased from 38.3% to 67.5% (29.2% increase) and from 39.1% to 58.5% (19.4% increase), respectively. However, there was no statistically significant difference in medication adherence between the groups ( p = 0.077) (Table  2 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The baseline medication adherence rate was less than 40%. Even though higher than a study carried out in another Brazilian city with 120 hypertensive patients in 2007 in a primary care unit, which had an adherence rate of 31.2%,  29  the objective is to achieve 100% adherence. Some patient demographics may have contributed, such as low education and low family income, that are associated with low health literacy.  30 In addition, the number of medications to be taken daily makes the routine complex, which can be another barrier to adherence.  31 Reducing the number of pills taken daily would help to promote adherence. 32  After the 16-week follow-up period, the adherence rate increased in both intervention and control groups. Increased adherence may be attributed to the Hawthorne effect, a motivational response to the attention received by participating in a study.  33 This phenomenon can also be explained by ''social desirability,'' a type of response expressed by respondents who report characteristics or behaviors that they believe are desirable.  34 The most positive answers regarding medication adherence can be attributed to the patients \u00b4need to acknowledge the care provided and the dispensation of free medication. These aspects may have influenced the participants, who might have involuntarily opted for the answers they considered most acceptable.  35 Social desirability is relevant in health education interventions for individuals with chronic diseases. Individuals participating in scientific studies are inclined to report health behavior more positively.  34 he control group's adherence increase approached being statistically significant. Moreover, if not statistically significant, the 15% increase in the likelihood of adherence by the control group is clinically significant. Medication adherence among patients with chronic diseases is known to be associated with the perceived need for medication, the tangible feeling that the medication is contributing to immediate and positive outcomes.  36 Thus, one of the factors that may have contributed to the lack of statistical significance in our study is the asymptomatic character of hypertension and diabetes, which reduces patients' motivation to use prescribed medication.  [37] [38] ] [39]  In addition, fast technological changes and the continuing need for learning about new technologies is a challenge for individuals older than 50 compared with younger subjects  [40] [41] [42]  and the continued development of new, smaller, and more complex smartphone models exacerbates the problem.  41, 42 The mean age of study participants was 56.9 years. Even though the number of elderly people who have access to WhatsApp has increased in recent years, the elderly use digital media less.  43, 44 his problem is greater in Brazil in comparison to more developed countries where access to technologies and digital literacy is greater.  45 Although messages were viewed by the participants, it is unclear how much of the content was understood.\n\nOther factors related to treatment adherence that were not investigated in the study and that may have affected results are the patient's perception of their disease and treatment efficacy, the relationship with the health care service, disease symptomatology, adverse effects of treatment, perceptions about the care provided at the Unit, level of confidence in the health care professional, and location of the health facility.  46 he four-question version of the MGT was used in this study, but the eight-question version with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 would be more reliable and should be employed in the future. Also, differences in the frequencies of medication between type 1 and type 2 diabetes were not considered, which may have affected the results. Another suggestion for future research would be to allocate the patients into groups according to their initial adherence scores.\n\nBy using a Bulk Service to automatic messaging tool, it was possible to follow the delivery and reading of the messages, but the users were not able to communicate with the researchers. More bidirectional communication might enable evaluating patient reception and reaction to messages.\n\nIt is difficult to compare this study's results with previous studies, because they did not use WhatsApp. A similar study using WhatsApp evaluated the short-term impact of patient education regarding glycemic control that found improved knowledge and reduced acute complications. However, the patients were young (median age 19) and the study did not directly address medication adhrence.  47 Another study described an intervention that consisted of personalized, individual face-to-face consultations by dietitians, the use of pedometers, and monthly WhatsApp messages.  48 However, the nature and frequency of the content sent and whether this medium, in comparison to others mentioned, was effective in increasing physical activity in adults with type 2 diabetes were not clear. A study in Saudi Arabia concluded that educational messages running for 8 weeks using WhatsApp significantly increased knowledge about diabetes, self-efficacy, and awareness among the Saudi population.  49 However, that study had only female users, with sociodemographic aspects different from those in this study, and it offered free health care. The intervention was designed for bidirectional communication, making it difficult to measure how many messages they could sent. Lastly, in Malaysia, daily information was sent for 1 month by using WhatsApp to patients with coronary artery disease. The study showed a significant and positive effect on the patients' knowledge of coronary artery disease risk factors and improved the patients' adherence to a healthy lifestyle.  16 he MGT test is a self-reporting medication-adherence test, and this can also be a complicated feature to measure.  50 Also, as highlighted by Zullig et al.,  51  appropriate measurement will depend on the context, intended purpose, available resources, time, and phase of interest. A future study should go beyond self-reporting and include actual measures of blood pressure for hypertensive patients and the determination of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) for diabetics."
