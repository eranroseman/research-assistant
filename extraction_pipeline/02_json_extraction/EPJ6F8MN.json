  "title": "Rheumatology in the digital health era: status quo and quo vadis?",
  "abstract": "Rheumatology faces a critical shortage of health-care professionals, exacerbated by an ageing patient population and escalating costs, resulting in widening gaps in care. Exponential advances in digital health technologies (DHTs) in the past 5 years offer new opportunities to address these challenges and could contribute to overall improved health care. However, keeping pace with innovations and integrating them into clinical practice can be challenging. This Review explores the transformative potential of DHTs for rheumatology in reshaping the entire patient pathway and redefining the roles of patients and providers, and discusses the potential barriers to DHT integration. Key technologies, such as large language models, clinical decision-support systems, digital therapeutics, electronic patient-reported outcomes, digital biomarkers, robots, self-sampling devices and artificial intelligence-based scribes, can be implemented along the patient pathway. A digital-first hybrid stepped-care patient pathway could combine in-person and remote care, enabling personalized and continuous monitoring through a digital safety net. The potential benefits and risks of transforming the traditional patientprovider relationship into a digital health triad with technology are discussed. Collaborative efforts are needed to navigate the evolving digital health landscape and harness the potential of DHTs to improve rheumatology care.",

Symptom checkers offer standardized symptom assessments and are accessible anywhere and anytime, providing disease suggestions and recommended actions on the basis of the input provided. Although symptom checkers are well received, their diagnostic accuracy remains limited  5, 9, 10  , ranging between 52% and 63% in a first multicentre evaluation study  5  . Data from one study showed that only 14% of experienced rheumatologists could provide an accurate diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on the basis of medical history alone  11  . To address these limitations, symptom checkers could be improved by integrating additional objective data alongside subjective symptoms in order to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable cross-verification. The true value of symptom checkers could be their capacity to streamline automated history taking, thereby saving time and allowing for more in-depth, future patient-clinician dialogue. The incorporation of AI-based software, including LLMs, can further augment traditional history taking. LLMs have demonstrated the ability to detect subtle nuances in pain expression, which can be particularly effective in identifying conditions such as fibromyalgia  12  . A preliminary study found that an AI-based symptom checker could make the correct diagnosis more frequently (54% versus 32%) than rheumatologists (the information given to clinicians was limited to basic health and symptom-related medical history)  13  . In a direct comparison using the same patient vignettes from the previous study, the LLM ChatGPT-4 listed the correct diagnosis as one the top possibilities at a rate comparable to rheumatologists (35% versus 39%)  14  ."

      "text": "The growing scarcity of rheumatologists, escalating costs and ageing of the patient population exacerbate the strain on health-care systems and accentuate existing care deficits. The assessment of often unspecific but potentially rheumatic symptoms is characterized by prolonged waiting times for specialist consultations, causing irreversible damage accrual and diminished cost-effective treatment options. Despite new promising therapeutic approaches, conventional treatment is largely dominated by a trial-and-error and non-personalized approach. Patient monitoring seems inflexible, incomplete and limited to brief, burdensome periodic face-to-face consultations. The lack of a comprehensive picture of disease activity, lack of decision support and a disjointed flow of information often results in duplicative efforts and can substantially influence health outcomes.\n\nIn the pursuit of bridging these care gaps, digital health enables enhanced, continuous and flexible patient care that can broadly be defined as \"the convergence of science and technology with health, health care, living, and society\" 1 . Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, the number of available tools and corresponding literature has seen an unprecedented increase, making it hard to stay up to date.\n\nIn this Review, we depict the potential and barriers of digital health technologies (DHTs) in enhancing the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, we examine the implications of DHTs for rheumatology education and research. Key technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), clinical decision-support systems, digital therapeutics, electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs), wearables, robots, patient self-sampling devices and artificial intelligence (AI)-based scribes, are examined. We outline an anticipated vision of a digital-first hybrid stepped-care patient pathway. The integration of DHTs could improve access to care, foster evidence-based medicine and catalyse a shift"

DDSSs are tailored for professional use, provide support and often incorporate broader data sets, including laboratory and imaging results, which enhances diagnostic precision. The potential of DDSS-aided diagnosis is not new and the discussion around this topic started more than three decades ago  17  . Yet, despite the increasing number of DDSSs for rheumatology, integration into clinical practice remains limited  18  . Using DDSSs to assist with diagnosis can enhance physician accuracy without demanding extra time or reducing patient satisfaction  19, 20  and could also reduce time to diagnosis for several rare rheumatic diseases (such as antisynthetase syndrome and Felty syndrome)  21  . Isabel  22  and FindZebra  23  are examples of DDSSs that are designed for the diagnosis of rare diseases. Furthermore, integrating DDSSs into the rheumatology diagnostic process could help ensure that no potential diagnoses are missed. Critical evaluation of DDSS output is crucial to avoid the blind adoption of potentially erroneous suggestions  24  . LLMs are becoming increasingly powerful DDSSs, capable of interpreting multimodal data, including images, videos, laboratory results and previous medical reports  25, 26  . Interaction with LLM chatbots is more user-friendly compared to traditional DDSSs, enabling clinicians to pose custom queries, such as 'Is this patient more likely to suffer from antisynthetase syndrome or inclusion body myositis and why?'. Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs is still limited, this type of DDSS could aid physicians, especially in the diagnosis of rare diseases as shown in a preprint published in 2024 (ref. 27)."

Although asking patients to provide information from home (such as medical history taking and self-sampling) has only become more regular in rheumatology since the COVID-19 pandemic, decentralized remote diagnostic assessments have been commonly used in other areas for some time such as in the diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases  30  .

DHTs empower patients to autonomously collect, interpret and act on medical information, thereby catalysing effective self-management. Digitally supported patient self-management could contribute to overcoming care gaps while simultaneously alleviating the burden on the health-care system. This shift towards patient self-management exemplifies the increasing democratization of care, thereby mitigating information asymmetry and diminishing medical paternalism. Augmented patient autonomy and decentralized care delivery might reduce the current burden of care by alleviating constraints such as travel time, costs and response time.\n\nInsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus provides an example of advanced technology-supported self-management, whereby patients use continuous glucose monitors and automated insulin delivery systems to safely and effectively improve the percentage of time that individuals with diabetes stay within their target blood sugar range  37  . Creating a closed-loop system for patients with rheumatic diseases is still at the early stages of development. Nonetheless, a study assessed a wearable device that was capable of detecting inflammation via impedance sensing in Sprague-Dawley male rats; upon detection, the device initiated a synergistic treatment regimen combining subcutaneous methotrexate and electrical stimulation  38  . The promising results observed in this preclinical model warrant further investigation to evaluate the potential of such advanced technologies in clinical applications."

A randomized controlled trial carried out in 2024 demonstrated substantially higher self-efficacy and similar knowledge, health literacy and quality of life in patients who completed an online education course compared with face-to-face education  41  . However, patients typically have to search for information themselves and older patients in particular have limited access to online health education resources and can struggle to find valid information  42  . The ongoing expansion of digital information makes it increasingly challenging to distinguish between reliable and misleading content, as the volume and pace of changes continue to grow. The brief nature of doctor visits often limits effective advice regarding disease management, leaving many patient questions unanswered. LLM-based chatbots could provide patients with access to answers to a lot of their questions and are always available. Preliminary studies that assessed ChatGTP responses to questions from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) yielded promising results, indicating that ChatGPT responses were often deemed of higher quality and more empathetic than those from SLE experts, according to both specialists and patients  43, 44  . To achieve clinical implementation, rigorous validation, along with the assurance of data privacy and security, must be accomplished  45  ."

Digital therapeutics have the potential to address geographical, temporal and capacity-related barriers by providing automated, evidence-based treatment options that are accessible at any time and location. Core osteoarthritis management strategies (such as patient education, exercise, physical activity and dietary weight management) might be effectively supported by digital therapeutics. A landmark multicentre trial this year demonstrated the non-inferiority of physiotherapy delivered by video-consultations compared to in-person care for chronic knee and back pain  46, 47  . Back pain digital therapeutics showed a greater reduction in pain compared to the gold standard of face-to-face physiotherapy, likely owing to patients exercising more frequently with the aid of their smartphones at home  47  . The level of guidance for digital therapeutic-based physiotherapy varies from simple video instructions to motion capture-based  47  or wearable-based real-time tracking and feedback.

This traditional approach leads to frequent, unnecessary clinical visits without adjustments to treatment, while changes in disease activity between appointments often go unnoticed, resulting in missed opportunities for treatment optimization. The conventional patient follow-up approach seems outdated, not based on patient needs and not flexible enough to enable a steady assessment of new patients and continuous follow-up care. Patient-initiated follow-up is a care delivery model in which patients reach out to the clinic as needed, rather than attending regularly scheduled follow-ups. This model is currently mainly used for patients with less complex diseases and stable disease activity  [59] [60] [61] [62]  . Incorporating digital health could enhance safety, ensure continuity of care and support this proactive, patient-centred and need-adapted approach to patient follow-up  63  . A shift towards remote care not only reduces the burden for patients with low disease activity but also frees up capacity to treat new patients and those with severe, active disease. Additionally, remote care holds the potential to enhance the work experience of HCPs, many of whom face long commutes and appreciate the increased flexibility to balance work and family life."

As part of this pathway, patients were offered a smartphone app to complete electronic patient-reported outcomes (Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index and self-reported Disease Activity Score-28 for Rheumatoid Arthritis using C-reactive protein), which clinicians reviewed asynchronously via a web-based portal. Clinicians then sent letters to patients in remission with satisfactory and up-to-date blood monitoring data summarizing the review. Reviews were conducted either at the default 6-month interval or sooner if requested by a clinician or patient (expedited review). Face-to-face appointments were available as needed (escalated review) and an in-person review was required every 3 years. Within the first year, this initiative saved over 140 h of clinic time and approximately \u00a380,000 in unnecessary appointment costs. Patient surveys indicated high satisfaction, with more than 90% of patients expressing a preference to continue with non-face-to-face appointments.

At the core is a digital safety net based on passive, continuous sensor-based monitoring (level 1) and on-demand self-assessments (level 2), where AI models can provide instant automated feedback to patients and trigger monitoring alerts for HCPs. Monitoring alarms and chat-based queries can trigger virtual visits (level 3) and asynchronous feedback by HCPs. Virtual visits to review RA flare questionnaires and CRP results by nurses or rheumatologists every 3-4 months enabled a safe reduction of face-to-face visits  83, 84  . Notably, no differences were observed between rheumatology nurses or rheumatologists performing the remote monitoring of patients. A similar study in patients with axSpA investigated a fully remote approach, incorporating self-sampling to remotely generate an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with CRP, which was reviewed in conjunction with more frequent questionnaires (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity bi-weekly and weekly flare questionnaire). This approach facilitated a safe reduction in face-toface visits and was highly accepted by patients  85  . Two large randomized controlled trials are currently under way to assess the efficacy of remote monitoring in patients with axSpA  62, 86  . Remote monitoring might also foster a treat-to-target approach and accelerate disease remission.

Moreover, face-to-face care will likely predominantly involve patients with complex refractory diseases and high disease activity  59  , with successfully treated patients being mostly monitored virtually. This shift could also lead to an increase in rheumatologists providing a combination of in-person and remote care.

Digital technologies enhance the objectivity of these examinations, possibly also rendering traditional functional capacity questionnaires obsolete. Measurement of spinal mobility is, for example, heavily affected by variability and subjectivity. Automated motion capture systems, such as the University of Cordoba Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, provide precise and objective assessments  94  . Medical documentation could be immensely facilitated by artificial intelligence-powered ambient virtual scribes such as Ambience or Nuance DAX, which instantly generate structured summaries of patient-provider interactions. A first real-world pilot study revealed a statistically significant yet clinically negligible average time-saving effect of less than 1 min per patient  95  ; however, this technology does enable physicians to redirect their attention from screens to patients  95, 96  . Greater integration of LLMs into clinical workflows can also help to improve other administrative tasks such as appointment scheduling and correspondence with insurance companies."

      "text": "Reviewing the scientific literature can be a time-consuming process. Free tools such as AI-based Elicit can streamline this task by allowing straightforward questions, such as 'Is remote monitoring safe for patients with rheumatic diseases?', to be asked. Short summaries of the literature and customizable overviews of the research make it easier to gain insights efficiently. Rheumatology research is often held back by slow and expensive clinical trials, fragmentation of data and siloed research teams. Decentralized clinical trials can facilitate patient recruitment by eliminating the need for travel and reducing patient burden and costs  97, 98  . The increasing online presence of patient support groups has furthered patient recruitment, co-design between patients and HCPs, and overall patient involvement in research projects. Collaborative online studies offer a new frontier in medical research (particularly for rare diseases) by facilitating large-scale, patient-focused research that integrates patient perspectives as equal stakeholders and valued partners in the study of their conditions, ultimately improving clinical care  99  . This approach could be particularly valuable for individuals with rare diseases who are faced with unforeseen circumstances such as establishing the safety of vaccines during a global pandemic 100 .\n\nRemote monitoring technology leverages outcome assessments and enables rich trial data. Free but powerful web applications, such as REDCap, bring patient cohorts together and generate new clinical knowledge, for example, the reliability of antisynthetase antibodies 101 . Disease activity scoring is often a tedious, labour-intensive task, which requires special training and often results in deviating scores due to high inter-rater reliability. AI promises to overcome these limitations, even in rare diseases. A study evaluated the performance of the LLM Claude-2 in assessing disease severity in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies using the Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool-Visual Analogue Scale, compared with the scores of three human assessors. The results showed good reliability between Claude-2 and human assessors, with an average intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.94) and strong positive correlations between the global assessment of Claude-2 scores and those of experienced assessors. The Claude-2-generated scores were on par with those of skilled assessors and outperformed inexperienced scorers 102 . Hence, this tool could be used to accelerate the identification of patients with severe disease while negating the need to scan records for suitable participants and potentially to manually rate disease activity."

To this effect, RheumMadness, a bracket-style online competition, featuring rheumatology concepts as 'teams', fostered a community of enquiry through social media discussions, multimedia resources and prediction brackets, facilitating social constructivist learning about the field. The programme expanded its participant base and engagement from 2021 to 2022, particularly among early learners who credited the programme for increasing their interest in rheumatology and fostering a sense of belonging in the rheumatology community through the collaborative learning approach 105 . Educational content can be delivered more vividly compared to traditional textbooks using new technologies such as virtual reality 106 and chatbots  24  , facilitating the training of HCPs and increasing the interest of medical students in rheumatology  106  . LLMs represent a paradigm shift in medical education by offering on-demand, flexible tutoring that enables queries such as 'What are the typical symptoms of antisynthetase syndrome?'. Blended learning approaches, similar to hybrid care (also known as blended care), combine the strengths of face-to-face and digital learning environments, allowing greater flexibility, and are particularly useful for teaching practical skills such as ultrasound  107  ."

Dedicated funding of digital health research and DHT reimbursement is also crucial to fostering implementation into routine care. Rheumatologists are unlikely to adopt remote care if video-consultations and virtual visits result in net losses. The USA billing codes for remote therapeutic monitoring provide a model for incentivising such services. Similarly, German legislation has introduced Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen (DiGA), regulated digital health applications that can be prescribed by physicians and are fully reimbursed. Implementation of a pay-for-performance for digital therapeutics approach could foster digital therapeutics cost-effectiveness 114 .

Medical data collected by both patients and HCPs will be stored in data lakes (centralized repositories that store vast amounts of raw data) and AI models will constantly generate decision-support data and utilize this data for continuous model improvement. However, the effect of AI can be double-edged and potential risks need to be considered such as AI bias, blind trust in AI recommendations and the danger of AI paternalism, where HCPs and patients have to justify decisions that diverge from AI-generated suggestions 117 . The performance of LLMs is constrained because of limited access to large, high-quality medical data sets for training  26  . To mitigate algorithmic biases, which frequently result from models trained on small, homogeneous patient populations, it is essential to include participants from diverse backgrounds 118 . The factuality and safety of LLMs can be improved by the restructuring of clinical queries into 'search' and 'retrieval' tasks and subsequent knowledge distillation (performed by the LLMs) from the retrieved documents  119  .\n\nEnsuring data privacy, security and transparency in data usage and algorithms is essential, and regulators must carefully balance fostering innovation with maintaining these standards 120 . The EU Artificial Intelligence Act, the world's first comprehensive legal framework specifically addressing AI, has a pivotal role in guaranteeing the safe and ethical use of AI. However, this legislation also introduces greater complexity and costs, which are likely to disproportionately affect smaller enterprises, including those offering open-source products, potentially weakening their market position  45  . Moreover, the rapid evolution of the AI health-care market and the lack of regulatory enforcement in the European Union and USA raise doubts about the actual influence of any regulations  120  .

DHTs can be implemented along the entire patient pathway to improve diagnostics, treatment and monitoring and to empower patients. AI-based automation of workflows has the potential to substantially reduce bureaucratic burdens for all stakeholders involved, decrease screen time and promote more meaningful human interactions. Implementation of a digital-first hybrid stepped-care strategy and decision-support systems promise to facilitate a shift towards a more personalized, predictive and participatory health-care model. However, the successful integration of these technologies into routine clinical care will require overcoming substantial barriers, including regulatory hurdles, reimbursement, and the need for widespread professional training and patient education. By sharing lessons learned and fostering collaboration, rheumatologists can accelerate the transition and fully harness the potential of digital health to meet growing demands.\n\nPublished online: 31 October 2024"
