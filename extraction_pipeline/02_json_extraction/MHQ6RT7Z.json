  "abstract": "Background: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience significant medical and psychological stressors that affect their mental health, well-being, and disease outcomes. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used in other patient populations and has demonstrated clinical benefits. Although evidence-based, nonpharmacological interventions for pain management are widely used in other populations, these treatments have not been well studied in SCD. Currently, there are no adequately powered large-scale clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and dissemination potential of behavioral pain management for adults with SCD. Furthermore, some important details regarding behavioral therapies in SCD remain unclear-in particular, what works best for whom and when. Objective: Our primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of two smartphone-delivered programs for reducing SCD pain symptoms: digital CBT versus pain and SCD education (Education). Our secondary goal is to assess whether baseline depression",

      "text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy disorder that predominantly affects those of African descent in the United States  [1, 2] . Adult patients living with SCD have acute and chronic complications, including daily chronic pain and recurrent, unpredictable, vaso-occlusive episodes of pain, which often require immediate medical attention  [3] . These complications have a significant impact on patients' daily functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and mental health  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In addition, acute and chronic pain as well as depression have been associated with increased health care use and/or premature death  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\n\nCurrent standards for pain management in patients with SCD are inadequate  [13, 14] . There is a general overreliance on the use of opioids for pain management among providers and patients, despite the known physical and psychological consequences  [15] [16] [17] [18] . It is estimated that up to 87% of adults and 44% of children aged younger than 6 years with SCD are prescribed opioids  [19] , despite the lack of data to support their long-term efficacy. The chronic use of daily opioids is associated with side effects and hyperanalgesia, which in turn likely contribute to increased pain  [20]  and worse HRQoL  [21] . There is a pressing need for effective, nonpharmacological interventions to optimize chronic pain management in patients with SCD  [22] .\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used in other patient populations, resulting in clinical benefits  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, even with the broad use of CBT in other pain populations, its use has not been incorporated into pain management plans for individuals with SCD. Multiple barriers have prevented patients with SCD from receiving quality CBT pain services, including a lack of access, limited local availability, expected cost or copayments, and the stigma associated with seeing a mental health provider or specialist.\n\nAdvances in technology have had a major impact on the delivery of psychosocial treatments. Although limited access to the internet among minority populations has been problematic in the past, the emergence of mobile technology has helped bridge the digital divide. Many patients with SCD have reported wide access to or ownership of personal or mobile devices  [28, 29] . There has also been growing evidence to support the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of mobile health interventions in patients with chronic medical conditions  [30] [31] [32] , including SCD  [33] . For all these reasons, patients with SCD may greatly benefit from digital behavioral interventions that can be accessed on computers or mobile phones  [34, 35] .\n\nDespite the potential benefit of integrating digital CBT into routine SCD care, there are currently no large-scale trials demonstrating the benefits of this intervention approach in this population. In fact, no adequately powered clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness and dissemination potential of any behavioral pain management approach for adults with SCD  [22, [36] [37] [38] . There is also limited evidence to guide health care providers on which nonpharmacological pain management strategies are feasible, acceptable, and effective for adult patients with SCD. Therefore, there is a need for an adequately powered pragmatic study to evaluate whether digital behavioral pain treatment strategies are effective and can be implemented at scale into routine SCD care in real-world settings."

      "title": "Objectives",
      "text": "The primary objective of the CaRISMA (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real-time Pain Management Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications) trial is to compare the effectiveness of two mobile phone-delivered programs for reducing SCD pain symptoms at the 6-month follow-up: digital CBT versus pain and SCD education (Education). We will also evaluate the sustainability of the intervention effects at the 12-month follow-up. The secondary objective is to assess whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain outcomes. We hypothesize that digital CBT will confer greater improvement in pain interference, pain intensity, and depressive symptoms at 6 months compared with Education. We also hypothesize that digital CBT will confer a greater reduction in health care use (eg, opioid prescriptions or refills or acute care visits) over 12 months compared with Education."

      "text": "CaRISMA is a multisite, randomized, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial that will be conducted at 6 comprehensive sickle cell centers and 4 community-based organizations (CBOs). A total of 350 adults with SCD who report chronic pain and/or use long-acting or daily opioids will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a digital CBT program tailored for adults with SCD (CBT) or pain and SCD education (Education) on their mobile phones for 12 weeks. Both programs will use identical mobile-based technology platforms, with the only difference being the content provided. The focus of the digital CBT program is to teach behavioral coping skills through participants' seeing and doing, whereas the pain education arm focuses on improving self-management through participants' learning and knowing more about pain and SCD."

As the intervention content and presentation were specifically designed for adults, age was restricted to individuals aged 18 years or older. Patients who do not meet the chronic pain criteria or simply do not want to participate in an intervention arm of the study have the option to complete the battery of questionnaires at baseline and each time they return to the clinic for a routine follow-up visit. This convenience sample of nonintervention patients will be used for exploratory comparisons and is not included in the target sample size of 350. Individuals with cognitive dysfunction or low literacy may not benefit from all components of the intervention. During the electronic consent process, potential participants will be required to answer six consent comprehension questions correctly. These questions aim to ensure that all enrolled participants understand the study protocol and have the appropriate level of literacy and cognitive functioning to benefit from the intervention. Any participant who fails the consent comprehension assessment will be excluded from participation at the time of screening but may be rescreened in 3 months.\n\nA smartphone is required for participation. Otherwise, eligible patients who do not own a smartphone will be provided one with cellular and data service for 12 months as part of the study."

The recommended progression is one module per week over 12 weeks, which will give participants time to practice the techniques they learn in each module. At 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, participants will receive a link to a web-based survey tool to complete the study assessments, including Painimation, the Sickle Cell Self-Efficacy Scale (SCSES), Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures, Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System measures, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD  -7 ). Between these follow-up assessments, participants will be expected to continue reporting their daily pain intensity diaries through a web-based survey tool that they can access on their smartphone app. A summary of the key study measures and outcomes is presented in Table  1 .\n\nTable  1 . Schedule of study outcomes. For intervention participants, in addition to the quantitative assessments, the University of Pittsburgh Qualitative, Evaluation, and Stakeholder Engagement (Qual EASE) Research Services will conduct a set of qualitative interviews at the end of the study. The goal of these interviews is to further understand the lived experience of patients in the trial and determine which intervention works best for whom and when. Qual EASE Research Services will select and interview 24 patients in each treatment group, stratified by high or low depression scores, for a total of 48 interviews (ie, 12 digital CBT patients with a PHQ-9 score \u226410, 12 digital CBT patients with a PHQ-9 score >10, 12 digital Education patients with a PHQ-9 score \u226410, and 12 digital Education patients with a PHQ-9 score >10). This distribution will allow us to qualitatively compare the experiences of patients with different depression levels and explore quantitative findings related to intervention efficacy in patients with various levels of depression severity. The patient sample size has been selected to allow for a high likelihood of reaching thematic saturation regarding patient experience  [41] ."

All of the video content on the CBT arm is co-designed with, delivered by, and features adults living with SCD. The digital CBT arm emphasizes skills acquisition and learning through practice; thus, the program involves homework assignments and challenges as well as continued check-ins with a health coach who helps reinforce CBT skills and encourages practice and program engagement. The digital CBT program also gives users access to a study-associated Facebook page where they can discuss with other patients the issues that they faced and what skills were or could be used to address them.

All of the education program content is developed and delivered by SC101 and features their community members, adults with SCD. This program is consistent with the education that patients and families would receive with a patient educator or what is currently provided via the web and social media through two of our community partners, SCWarriors and SC101.

The number of health coaches is expected to vary throughout the 3-year study, with 3-5 coaches active at any given time, some of whom will be adults with SCD. All health coaches undergo approximately 8 hours of training in CBT, motivational interviewing, acceptance and commitment therapy, problem-solving techniques, general counseling strategies, and advanced education on SCD. In addition to the initial training, over the course of the study, health coaches will attend a weekly XSL \u2022 FO RenderX group supervision that includes role-playing and review of interactions (phone or text message) with participants and weekly one-on-one supervision sessions, with a clinical psychologist.\n\nThe primary function of the health coach is to provide emotional and informational support on a weekly basis. The health coach will reinforce the use of skills and interventions learned within the program. The health coach will touch base with participants once a week, ideally over the phone, but texting will also be acceptable. In addition, health coaches may send personalized texts in between weekly meetings to help participants stay motivated. After 12 weeks, participants will no longer be required to engage with their health coach; however, if they would like to remain in contact with their health coach, they will be able to reach out and make an appointment.\n\nTo maintain intervention continuity and fidelity, health coaches will participate in weekly supervision sessions led by a masters-level psychologist and the study principal investigator (PI) for review and discussion of participant interactions. Telephone calls will be periodically recorded, at random, for audits and reviews during supervision sessions. All text message communications will be sent from a common account, and the content of these messages is monitored and periodically audited."

Examples include increased anxiety during CBT training or being embarrassed by revealing negative thoughts and insecurities to the health coach. Adverse events could also reveal negative effects directly attributable to treatment, providing our team and other researchers with information on possible mechanisms underlying these negative effects. The health coaches will routinely assess for increasing negative affect, and the GAD-7 will be administered at 3, 6, and 12 months to assess for increasing anxiety. In addition, we XSL \u2022 FO RenderX developed a suicide risk management protocol to illustrate risk triggers, assessments, and determinations (Figure  4 )."

Otherwise, if the missingness can be characterized as nonignorable (not missing at random), we will use approaches such as joint modeling or shared parameter models to produce unbiased estimates of treatment effects. All reasons for dropout or other missing values will be entered by the research staff or community groups (if encountering the patient during community activities) and will be tabulated and summarized, and results will be reported using the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) diagram.

Once the codebook is finalized, 2 data analysts from Qual EASE will be trained using the codebook, following which both coders will independently code 25% of the transcripts. Coding will then be compared to calculate Cohen \u03ba intercoder reliability scores. Any coding discrepancies identified during this comparison will be adjudicated until full agreement is achieved.

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "Patients living with SCD have several complications, including daily chronic pain and recurrent, unpredictable vaso-occlusive episodes that often require immediate medical attention  [3] . These complications lead to significant impairment in patients' HRQoL across their lifespan, particularly mental and psychosocial well-being. Current standards for pain management in SCD are unsatisfactory and primarily focus on opioids, with little evidence for nonpharmacological interventions in this population  [27, 28] . The increasing use of opioids has led to several physical and psychological consequences, and the development of effective, nonpharmacological interventions is essential to optimize pain management in adults with SCD  [22] .\n\nBehavioral interventions have been shown to be efficacious  [54] [55] [56] , but the lack of widespread availability of therapists and CBT-trained clinicians has made implementation into routine care challenging, especially in minority populations, such as patients with SCD. Despite strong evidence supporting the efficacy of digital CBT  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , its use remains limited in SCD. With the growing access to mobile and personal technology  [28, 29] , digital CBT has great potential to address patients' need for evidence-based, user-centered, and rigorous behavioral programs  [34, 35] .\n\nCaRISMA is a large-scale, multi-institution, adequately powered pragmatic study in partnership with CBOs aimed at comparing the effectiveness of two evidence-based behavioral approaches to pain management: CBT and Education. This study will ultimately determine how digital behavioral pain treatment strategies can be effectively implemented at scale in routine care for adults with SCD in real-world settings. CaRISMA has the potential to inform behavioral nonpharmacological pain management approaches with strategies that are feasible, acceptable, and effective, which medical providers can offer to their adult patients with SCD  [22, [36] [37] [38] ."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "The CaRISMA trial will fill a knowledge gap in the SCD literature by evaluating the effectiveness of two remotely delivered pain management programs for adults with SCD: digital CBT and digital Education. In this trial, we will also evaluate the sustainability of intervention effects over time and other related key aspects of pain management, such as depression and emotional and psychosocial well-being. Addressing these questions will be essential to inform future research directions of digital behavioral interventions, not only for adults with SCD but also for children and adolescents with SCD as well as other chronic pain populations. If digital CBT demonstrates effectiveness in this trial, future dissemination and implementation efforts will be critical to ensure that this intervention is widely available and used by many adult patients with SCD in the United States and worldwide."
