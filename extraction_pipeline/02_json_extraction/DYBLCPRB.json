  "title": "Impact of text message reminders on immunosuppressive medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients: A randomized controlled study",
  "abstract": "Background: One of the most common problems encountered in transplant patients is nonadherence with immunosuppressive drugs, one of the most important reasons for graft rejection. Objective: The study aimed to assess the impact of text message reminders on medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients. Design: A randomized controlled trial. \n Participants: The study was conducted from January to October 2021. This study included a total of 100 patients receiving a kidney transplant, 50 in the intervention group and 50 in the control group. Measurements: Patients in the intervention group were sent text message reminders four times a day during the 6th-9th months after transplantation. Control patients received no such intervention. Tacrolimus concentrations in the bloodstream were monitored for all participants through measurements taken at Months 7, 8 and 9. Data collection tools included Sociodemographic Form and Immunosuppressive Medication Adherence Scale. Results: Patients were homogeneously distributed among the groups. Sending daily text message reminders to transplant recipients caused an independent positive effect on medication adherence scale scores at the end of the study. Mean pretest medication adherence score of all patients was 45.18 \u00b1 4.22 and posttest score was 47.4 \u00b1 3.6. The intervention group exhibited a significantly higher mean posttest adherence score compared to controls, with values of 48.68 \u00b1 2.58 and 45.62 \u00b1 4.42, respectively (p < 0.001). Findings demonstrated a substantial improvement in the final medication adherence scores of transplant patients when they received daily Short Message Service reminders, acting as an independent factor (\u03b2 = 0.356, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Sending text message reminders to kidney transplant recipients is a statistically and clinically effective intervention to improve immunosuppressive medication adherence.",

      "text": "Kidney transplantation, one of the renal replacement therapies, is the most effective treatment modality in chronic renal failure since it not only improves the quality of life but also ensures the lowest morbidity and mortality rates. Transplant recipients must use immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives to prolong their survival and improve quality of life, preserve functions of the transplanted kidney and prevent complications such as rejection.  1 The side effects of lifelong immunosuppressive drug therapy can have a major impact on an individual's daily life.  2  In patients undergoing kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs prevent graft rejection by inhibiting activation of immune responses.  3 Graft rejection is the most prevalent complication observed in renal transplant recipients, with nonadherence to immunosuppressive drugs being a primary contributing factor to such rejections.  1  Identifying factors causing poor compliance and planning effective interventions are key to improving adherence. Various sociodemographic characteristics, including age, gender, marital status, education level, employment and socioeconomic status influence nonadherence to immunosuppressant regimens. Additionally, factors such as medication side effects, time elapsed after transplantation, complexity of drug regimen, frequent outpatient clinic visits, lack of belief in treatment and forgetfulness also contribute to such nonadherence.  4, 5 Balakrishnan et al. reported that kidney transplant patients with inadequate health literacy, high levels of depression and poor general health experienced serious challenges with adherence to prescribed medication. The authors also discovered that an increased number of medications was a crucial risk factor associated with noncompliance.  6 eir lifelong use of immunosuppressive drugs renders transplant recipients even more susceptible to frequent infections and development of neoplastic diseases. Such medications may cause adverse side effects, including but not limited to hypertension, diabetes, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and mood disorders.  7 The organ transplant team is responsible for monitoring and assessing the side effects of immunosuppressive medications and evaluating how the ongoing therapy affects the patient's daily activities. Nurses, as members of the organ transplant team, have crucial duties in ensuring the success of immunosuppressive drug therapy.  3 They play a key role in evaluating patient compliance, identifying and addressing barriers to adherence and implementing interventions to enhance patient adherence. Additionally, nurses are integral to the healthcare team as they provide education and counselling to recipients throughout the treatment process, ensuring their adherence to the prescribed therapy.  3, 8 e use of mobile health tools in renal transplant recipients affords an alternative solution in encouraging patient selfmanagement in daily life.  9 Short Message Service (SMS) reminders, implantable electronic devices, mobile applications and systems that allow patients to record data over the internet are recommended as innovative means to support health.  10 Sending text message reminders has become an increasingly common method to maximize patient adherence.  11 Kidney transplant recipients exhibit a generally positive attitude toward the use of cell phones during posttransplant care practices. They also believe that such interventions offer convenient self-care measures and assist healthcare providers in medical care management.  12 Three randomized controlled trials have used mobile health services and smartphone apps to improve immunosuppressive drug adherence after kidney and lung transplants.  13, 14 Their findings suggest that sending short reminder text messages to recipients could help improve adherence to such medications as prescribed. To date, there has been no research conducted in Turkey to explore the influence of text message reminders on the adherence of kidney transplant recipients to their immunosuppressive medication. Hence, this study aimed to fill this gap and make a significant contribution by promoting improved adherence to immunosuppressive drugs, facilitating better control of tacrolimus plasma levels and potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with hospitalization. The main focus of this study was to investigate the impact of sending text message reminders to kidney transplant recipients on their adherence to the prescribed immunosuppressive drug regimen. The study sample was determined based on the sampling formula for known population. Given that the total number of patients who underwent kidney transplant between January 2019 and December 2019 was 235, the sample size for the study, with a 5% error margin and 95% confidence level, was determined to be n1 (intervention) = 45 and n2 (control) = 45. To account for potential risks and ensure adequate statistical power, the sample size was adjusted to n1 (intervention) = 50 and n2 (control) = 50, resulting in a total sample size of n = 100 individuals, was made to enhance the reliability and validity of the research findings.\n\nBefore concluding the data collection phase, the sample size was recalculated on the G*Power 3.1.9 software package. The minimum sample size required for the study to achieve 95% statistical power and a margin of error of 0.05 was determined to be 49 patients in total. The study observed a difference in mean medication adherence scores between the pretest and posttest at 3.94 \u00b1 4.03 in the intervention group and 0.5 \u00b1 4.91 in the control group. Based on these results, the calculated statistical power at the end of the study was 98% for an effect size of d = 0.766 and a margin of error of 0.05."

Blood samples were collected 12 h after each dose to measure drug levels in the bloodstream.\n\nBiological evaluation involved analyzing blood samples at the 7th, 8th and 9th months after the initiation of immunosuppressants.\n\nThe individual levels of tacrolimus in plasma were recorded on the Biological Evaluation Form during the specified time points, and the mean tacrolimus plasma concentrations were calculated based on these recordings.\n\nIn the literature, different evaluation models regarding biological evaluation are applied. In the study of Schafer-Keller et al., the therapeutic dose was accepted as 100-150 ng/mL for cyclosporine and 5-10 ng/mL for tacrolimus and sirolimus. In the same study, the percentage of each patient receiving a value below or above this therapeutic dose was examined in the compliance evaluation.  17 In the centre where the research was conducted, the normal value range for tacrolimus is 5-10 ng/mL. Therefore, in this study, 'Medication nonadherence' was defined tacrolimus level <5 from >10 ng/mL."

Daily SMS reminders were sent to patients in the intervention group. The mean age of patients was 41.83 \u00b1 12.69 years, with ages ranging from 19 to 67 years. Majority (79%) of the patients were male and 72% were married. A total of 59 patients (59%) lived in provincial cities, 47% of the patients were primary school graduates, 33% high school graduates and 20% university graduates. A total of 46 patients (46.5%) had income equal to expenses, while 36 patients (36.4%) had income less than expenses. Only 20 patients (20%) lived with their spouse, 52 patients (52%) with their spouse and children, 21 patients (21%) with their parents and 7 (7%) with other people. Before transplantation, 58 patients (58%) were actively employed, 23 patients (23%) were not working and 19 patients (19%) retired.\n\nThe following details pertain to the transplant-related characteristics of patients. Vast majority (97%) received a transplant from a living donor. The most common primary diseases leading to transplantation were hypertension (26.5%), unknown causes (22.4%) and other causes (21.4%). A total of 75 patients (75%) had a waiting period of <1 year before transplantation. A total of 57 patients (57%) were diagnosed with hypertension and 15 patients (15%) diabetes.\n\nThe most commonly used drug combination was Tacrolimus + Mycophenolate mofetil (74%). The median number of drugs used was 10, ranging from 5 to 21. Only nine patients (9%) reported having someone who would remind them to take the prescribed drugs.\n\nThe sociodemographic characteristics of the control and intervention groups were similar. The mean age of patients in the control group was 42.86 \u00b1 13.67, and the mean age in the intervention group was 40.8 \u00b1 11.67.

      "title": "| DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This study, therefore, aimed to explore the impact of sending SMS reminders to kidney transplant patients on immunosuppressive medication adherence, and the findings are discussed in relation to the relevant literature.\n\nThe lowest possible score on the IMAS is 11 and the highest is 55. A higher score obtained from the scale indicates better adherence to immunosuppressants. In our study, the mean IMAS score of kidney transplant recipients was 45.18 \u00b1 4.22 in the pretest and 47.4 \u00b1 3.6 in the posttest. In a study conducted by K\u00f6ken et al. the mean IMAS score of transplant recipients was 48.10 \u00b1 6.61.  20 Another study found the mean IMAS score as 48.33 \u00b1 3.21.  21 Weng et al. reported that kidney transplant recipients had high levels of compliance with immunosuppressive drugs in their study using a different scale from what we used.  22 On the other hand, there are some reports suggesting that the level of compliance with immunosuppressant is still relatively low.  23, 24 Nonadherence to immunosuppressive drugs in transplant recipients, especially kidney transplant recipients, is still a problem.\n\nIn this study, no significant difference was found in terms of pretest medication adherence mean scores in both groups.

It was observed that the mean posttest medication adherence score of the intervention group was significantly higher. This finding showed that text message reminders improved medication adherence and confirmed hypothesis H1 (Sending text message reminders increases immunosuppressive medication adherence in kidney transplant recipients). A systematic that assessed the efficacy of interventions to enhance drug compliance found that adherence to prescribed immunosuppressants increased significantly in the intervention groups in comparison to the controls. 25 Reese et al. reported that interventions such as phone calls, SMS reminders and emails promoted greater compliance with\n\nimmunosuppressive drugs. They also concluded that reminder apps are promising in helping patients achieve better medication adherence but suggested that this strategy should be evaluated in research to identify differences in clinical outcomes.  26 In three randomized controlled trials, mobile health services and smartphone applications were used to improve adherence to immunosuppressive medication in kidney and lung transplant patients.  13, 14 McGillicuddy et al. found that the mobile health tool they developed greatly increased medication adherence and blood pressure control in kidney transplant recipients.  27 De Bleser et al.  28  examined the effectiveness of interventions that improve drug compliance in organ transplant recipients and found that interventions could be beneficial in the long term if they were implemented in combination with a team approach.  28 A review by Eslami et al. found that mobile health tools can help kidney transplant recipients manage their health more effectively and adhere to their treatment plans. The review authors suggested that these tools should be used both before and after transplantation.  9 In a study by Israni et al., all participants expressed an interest in using reminder tools, also highlighting some potential obstacles to ensuring the long-term use of these tools, which include reminders becoming annoying after a while, or the phone remaining switched off at certain times  29  At the end of this study, the mean medication adherence score of the control group increased by 0.5 \u00b1 4.91 points, while it improved by 3.94 \u00b1 4.03 points in the intervention group. The increase observed in patients receiving reminders was significantly higher than that of controls. There was no significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores in the control group, but the mean posttest score in the intervention group (48.68 \u00b1 2.58) was significantly higher than the mean pretest score (44.74 \u00b1 4). Foster et al. attempted to improve adherence to immunosuppressive medication by using an application featuring reminders and reported a significant increase in the medication adherence score of the intervention group, but no increase in the control group.  30 Contrary to our results, some research has also reported no significant difference in the improvement of medication adherence scores in both intervention and control groups. However, they also determined that recipients who used the mobile app tended to remember their immunosuppressive drugs at a greater frequency.  31  significant relationship was found between the difference in pretest and posttest medication adherence scores, and age, number of children and total number of medications used. Our findings align with the studies conducted by Weng et al., as they also found no significant relationship between age and medication adherence.  22 On\n\nPretest and posttest drug compliance scores of transplant patients according to study groups.

The rate of nonadherent patients according to blood levels was 39.5% in the control group and 16.7% in the intervention group, and the rate of nonadherent patients was significantly higher in the control group.\n\nMonitoring drug blood levels in a patient's blood and urine can serve as a valuable tool to validate drug compliance. Given the necessity for dose adjustments following transplantation and regular outpatient visits, the measurement of tacrolimus levels was deemed optimal for our study. In a similar vein, Cukor et al. also assessed tacrolimus in the bloodstream as a secondary measure to enhance medication adherence among renal transplant recipients in their study, aligning with our research approach. While there was no significant difference between the groups before the intervention, medication adherence was found to be higher in the intervention group according to blood levels.  33 Contrary to our study, there are also studies that found no statistically significant difference in tacrolimus blood levels.  25, 31 No significant correlation was found between the mean tacrolimus concentrations and medication adherence scores. The reason for the lack of a significant result in our study may be that recipients generally pay more attention to their drug intake before clinical control.\n\nDrug concentrations in plasma can also be influenced by the patient's diet, other medications and laboratory conditions. 16,34"

The centre where the research was conducted is one of the few transplant centres in the world with multiorgan and composite tissue transplants. The centre, which has been performing transplantation since 1982, performs outpatient clinic follow-ups of kidney transplant patients every weekday. The inclusion criteria were (1) age 18 years or older; (2) being a recipient of a kidney transplant for the first time; (3) being a kidney transplant recipient at posttransplant Month 6 with scheduled follow-up until Month 9; (4) ongoing immunosuppressive drug therapy; (5) absence of any disability that hinders communication; (6) no diagnosis of psychological and mental problems; (7) being an active cell phone user; (8) ability to read and write; (9) voluntary participation in the research. Participants were excluded for the following reasons: (1) history of combined or dual organ transplantation."

The application offered options for scheduling future messages, allowing us to choose the desired month, day, year, hour and minute for sending, as well as some functionality to edit or delete scheduled messages before the submission date. At the baseline of the study (6th month posttransplant), the Sociodemographic and Descriptive Characteristics Form and IMAS were administered to patients in the intervention and control groups as a pretest. Short text messages to remind the use of immunosuppressive medication and educational text messages were sent to patients in the intervention group four times a day, every day for 3 months. The control group did not receive any such intervention. The message times and contents sent to the intervention group were as follows: 1st message content sent at 07.00: 'Please don't forget to take your medication this morning! Use your medication regularly as recommended by your doctor'. 2nd message sent at 09.00: 'Please do not forget to take your full dose of medication this morning! Use your medication regularly as recommended by your doctor'. 3rd message sent at 19.00: 'Please do not forget to take your medication this evening! Use your medication regularly as recommended by your doctor'. 4th message sent at 21.00: 'Please don't forget to take your full medication tonight! Use your medication regularly as recommended by your doctor'. The intervention group also received educational text messages 3 days a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, in addition to such text message reminders. The details of the messages were as follows: Message 1: 'You must take immunosuppressive drugs at the recommended dose at regular times for the health of the transplanted kidney. Otherwise, your body may reject the transplanted kidney'. Message 2: 'Consumption of grapefruit is strictly forbidden. Because it can cause significant increases in the levels of immunosuppressive drugs in your blood'. Message 3: 'Do not use herbal remedies or drink herbal teas after transplantation. It may harm you by affecting the absorption of the drugs you are taking. Avoid using any medicines and herbal treatments other than those prescribed by your doctor (http://www."

Continuous variables were presented as means, standard deviations, median values, minimum and maximum levels. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Mann-Whitney U tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare continuous variables between independent groups when the variables were not normally distributed. Independent t tests and one-way analysis of variance were used when the variables were normally distributed. Differences between the pretest and posttest medication adherence scores were analyzed by paired t tests. Pearson and Spearman correlation tests were used to assess the relationships between medication adherence scores and other variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the independent factors that affected medication adherence scores. Results of tacrolimus blood tests measured for 3 months were averaged and evaluated. All analyses were performed on IBM SPSS 23.0 software package (IBM Corp.), and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant."
