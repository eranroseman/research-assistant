  "title": "Trend in data errors after the implementation of an electronic medical record system: A longitudinal study in an Australian regional Drug and Alcohol Service",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate trends in data errors over the 40 months after the implementation of an electronic medical record (eMR) system in an Australian regional Drug and Alcohol (D&A) Service. Methods: One hundred and twenty three error reports and data on occasions of service were obtained from the D&A Service. Statistical analysis was conducted to describe types of errors, to compare distribution of error types among different documentation forms, D&A Service sites and job roles. Error rates were also analysed. Results: In the 40 months after the implementation, a total of 18,549 errors occurred. These errors were grouped into four types: mismatched data fields (54.5 %), duplicate medical record (1.8 %), date/time error (8.2 %) and blank field (35.4 %). The distribution of error types differed in the forms being completed, the sites and the job roles. Quarterly error rate increased from 28.8 errors per 100 occasions of service in Year 1 Quarter 1-40.6 in Quarter 3, then decreased to 18.1 in Quarter 4. It dropped to 6.6 in Year 2 Quarter 2 and continued to decrease to 2.5 in Year 4 Quarter 1. Monthly error rate was the highest at 44.6 in Month 8, fell to the lowest at 1.0 in Month 18 and remained at under 7.3 from Month 19 to Month 40. Conclusions: After the implementation of the eMR system, the error rate increased in the first three quarters before decreasing. It reached stability about one and a half years after implementation. There were significant differences in the error distribution among the documentation forms, sites and job roles. The findings of this study could be used by eMR trainers to tailor training sessions for specific sites and job roles. These findings might also be useful for managers of other D&A Services to plan for the implementation of new electronic documentation systems.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "To improve quality of care, patient safety and efficiency of service delivery, electronic medical record (eMR) systems have been implemented in many healthcare settings including Drug and Alcohol (D&A) Service  [1] . These systems have made large, longitudinal data available for use in clinical and operational decision making, research and funding allocation  [1] [2] [3] .\n\nWith the ever-growing amount of clinical data, data errors are common  [4] , impeding the realisation of improved record quality. An American study conducted in an emergency department found that even small data errors had measurable effects on the department's ability to determine its operational performance  [2] . In a study conducted in the UK, researchers deliberately seeded errors in a large database of 17,600 congenital heart operations to examine the impact of these errors on the estimation of mortality rates  [5] . They found that the estimated mortality rates could be more than double the true value using the error-seeded data  [5] . An Australian study using longitudinal primary and ambulatory eMR data to estimate the duration of drug therapy highlighted the risk of underestimation when using erroneous data  [6] . In another Australian study conducted in a hospital surgical unit, researchers found that erroneous data affected approximately 16 % of inpatient cases during a six-month time period, resulting in a $575,000 underpayment to the hospital  [7] .\n\nRecognising the importance for healthcare organisations to develop error-reduction strategies, many studies have investigated the types and causes of data errors in eMR systems. A systematic review of 34 studies identified eight key themes of prescribing errors associated with the use of a computerised provider order entry system  [8] . One of the themes was misinterpretation, for example, users misinterpreted the meaning of the text 'total volume' in the system. They thought it was the total volume of dose that should be administered, but the system meant the total volume of an individual bag of fluid. As a result, they entered wrong information  [8] . This misinterpretation issue was not uncommon, as a later study also identified it as a cause of data errors  [9] .\n\nThese findings indicate that system designers lack a good understanding about how healthcare professionals work. A systematic review on the impact of system design on usability identified a drop-down menu selection error  [10] , a type of error that has been frequently reported by studies on computerised provider order entry systems  [8, 11] . Causes of this error included lengthy lists of items in the menu  [10]  and inadvertent mouse wheeling to unknowingly choose an incorrect item  [12] . It was also found that higher rate of the drop-down menu selection error was associated with single mouse click and urgent clinical situations  [13] . Other types of errors identified by previous studies included time stamp error, missing data, duplicate records and inconsistencies between data fields  [2, 9, [14] [15] [16] [17] .\n\nTo date, there is limited longitudinal research investigating trend in data errors after the implementation of an eMR system. This study was conducted in a D&A Service in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. It first described types of data errors that occurred in the eMR system. It then compared the distribution of error types among different documentation forms, D&A Service sites and job roles. Lastly, it examined the longitudinal trends in the amount and type of errors over the 40 months associated with the system."

      "text": "The D&A Service had used a community-based electronic documentation system since 2007. A drawback of that system was that it did not allow staff to view clients' hospital records. For better continuity of care, an integrated eMR system was implemented in December 2014, allowing staff to view clients' records in both inpatient and community settings.\n\nThe eMR system contains three types of documentation forms-intake form, assessment form and clinical note. These forms are used by staff during a client's 'encounter', i.e. from intake, assessment, treatment to discharge (Fig.  1 ). A client's encounter may have one or more service episodes, each focusing on a specific treatment service e.g. withdrawal management. One episode may include several occasions of service and each occasion of service generates one documentation in the intake form, assessment form or clinical note. In a form, one or more errors could occur. Fig.  1 . A client's encounter in the Drug and Alcohol Service and the relevant eMR documentation."

Documentation of reporting data are mandatory in the eMR intake form, assessment form and clinical note. To ensure the data are of acceptable quality, they are extracted by performance unit staff from the eMR system and uploaded to a Web NAP (WebNAP) system to check quality against a set of validation rules (e.g. the service end date/time must be later than the service start date/time)  [19] . The WebNAP system then generates error reports for a Health Information Manager to identify and correct these errors in the eMR system. The corrected data will then be extracted by the performance unit staff for reporting for funding purpose."

After the implementation, 123 WebNAP error reports containing errors that occurred between December 2014 and April 2018 were collected. Although they may not include all possible errors (e.g. errors in free-text documentation) in the eMR, these reports captured the errors of the compulsory data items for claiming funding.\n\nThe error report is an excel file containing the following information: clinic name, healthcare professional's name, client name, client medical record number, appointment date/time, service date/time, referral date/time, referral receipt date/time, job roles, setting type, modality of care (e.g. face to face or telephone), type of documentation form (i.e. intake, assessment or clinical note), financial class, Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) card type and DVA card number, and error type. Each row of data in the excel spreadsheet represents an error identified in a documentation form.\n\nTo protect the privacy of clients and healthcare professionals, these items -clinic name, healthcare professional's name, client name and client medical record number-were removed before analysis.\n\nTo allow estimation of error rate, the occasions of service data were also collected. These data were from January 2015 to April 2018 and did not include December 2014 as in the error reports. As each occasion of service generated one documentation form, the total number of occasions of service would be the same as the total number of documentation forms completed."

      "text": "The outcomes of interest included (1) overall distribution of types of data errors; (2) distribution of error types in different documentation forms, D&A sites and job roles and (3) error rates by site, job role, quarter and month. It was not possible to calculate error rate by documentation form due to a lack of data about the numbers of three types of forms in the occasions of service.\n\nThe 123 WebNAP error reports contained duplicates. This is because when an error report was generated, it contained not only the new errors occurred since the last report, but also errors that had not been corrected. To allow accurate count of unique errors, these reports were amalgamated and duplicates were removed before analysis.\n\nData analysis was conducted in Microsoft Excel and R 3.6.1  [20] . The error reports contained coded errors. These coded errors were further grouped into four types: mismatched data fields, duplicate medical record, date/time error and blank field (Table  1 ). The definition of each error type has been described in  [9]  (also see Supplementary material Appendix A). Descriptive analysis was conducted on these four error types.\n\nA chi-square test was conducted to test the independence of variables. A Z test was conducted for pairwise comparison of the distribution of error types (i.e. percentage of errors made in each type) among the three types of documentation forms. The same tests was conducted for the four clinics and centralised intake and for the job roles. Bonferroni correction was applied when comparing more than two groups. Statistically significant differences were assumed when the p value was <0.05.\n\nError rate at each site was estimated by dividing the total number of errors by the total number of occasions of service provided at that site. Using the same method, error rates by job role, quarter and month were also calculated."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "Accurate healthcare data are essential for healthcare organisations to provide safe, high quality and efficient patient care and to obtain government funding under the activity-based funding model. The use of the eMR system has made large data available, but the accuracy of these data relies on the end users, healthcare professionals, who enter data into the system. Using secondary data collected from an Australian regional D&A Service, this study generates knowledge about longitudinal trend in data errors after the eMR implementation.\n\nThe error reports analysed in this study only identified salient errors of the compulsory data items for claiming funding. They may only reflect 'the tip of the iceberg' of all the possible errors in the eMR. A lack of underlying data that could produce the denominator of the error rate for each documentation form made it impossible to compare error rate across these forms, nor at the individual client level; albeit only numbers or distributions are not as informative as a rate. This could have limited the possibility of drawing meaningful inferences. As many studies, this study also used p value, of which the usefulness in quantifying the strength of evidence has long been debated  [21, 22] . Therefore, caution needs to be taken when interpreting and generalising the results of this study.\n\nAmong all types of errors, service option error accounted for more than half. This error occurred when the combination of job role, modality of care and setting type did not match with the rules. For example, when a D&A Service doctor provided specialist care to a client in a hospital, the doctor might incorrectly select 'hospital' for the 'setting type', instead of selecting 'community' which was the all-time correct selection for the D&A Service to obtain funding. However, it probably made sense for this doctor to select 'hospital', as the person misinterpreted 'setting type' as the location of care. Misinterpretation of terms used in eMR systems could cause data errors  [8, 9] . As it is common for D&A Service staff to provide care in hospitals, it is important for eMR trainers to emphasise the meaning of 'setting type'. As 'setting type' was selected from a drop-down menu, there was a possibility that mouse wheeling also contributed to this error  [8, 11] . System designers might consider disabling mouse wheeling in the drop-down menu. As a study suggests that single mouse click is associated with higher rate of drop-down menu selection error  [13] , the system could also mandate double click to improve the accuracy of item selection. As 'community' should always be selected for the D&A Service, 'community' has been made default in the eMR system examined in this study to reduce errors.\n\nThe errors described in this study could have been prevented with forcing functions or minimised with real-time error messages in the eMR system, rather than waiting for a validation process to be run in the separate WebNAP system. The eMR system should have been designed to prevent or reduce errors from occurring in the first place.\n\nCompared with intake and assessment forms, the clinical note was more likely to contain the blank field error. Most of the blank field errors were blank job role and were not caused by staff. Blank job role often meant the Health Information Manager or the performance unit had not aliased the staff member in the eMR system correctly or at all.\n\nThe centralised intake team was more likely to make mismatched data fields error, whereas Site 4 was more likely to generate blank field error. The differences might be a reflection of the clinical activities conducted at these sites. The centralised intake team only conducts the intake activity to register the clients, whereas Site 4 provide a specialised opioid treatment service. When designing eMR training sessions, a Fig.  2 . Distribution of the four types of errors in the intake form, assessment form and clinical note. trainer may need to consider these differences to achieve effective training outcomes.\n\nSignificant differences in the error distribution were identified among the job roles. Aboriginal health worker was 10-50 % more likely to make mismatched data fields error than all the other types of providers (Fig.  4 ). The differences might be due to the variation in how clinical activities were conducted e.g. face-to-face in a clinic room or on the phone, and how the activities were documented e.g. during the conduct of the activity or after its completion. Qualitative research is needed to investigate the actual reasons for these differences.\n\nTrend analysis shows that there was a surge in the number of blank field error between Year 1 Quarter 3 and Year 2 Quarter 1 after the eMR implementation. According to the then Health Information Manager, this surge was caused by the eMR system, not the healthcare staff. Future research may need to pay attention to system-generated errors, investigate why and how this type of error occur, how it was detected and remediated, and how the system malfunction over many months could be avoided. Overall, the error rate showed an increasing trend in the first three quarters before decreasing in the fourth quarter. This trend might reflect the learning curve experienced by the healthcare staff in adapting to use the eMR system after its initial implementation. Ongoing training and hands-on support were provided to help staff to learn to use the new system, which appeared to reduce the error rate. One and a half years after the implementation, error rate dropped back to the similar level of 7.5 % that was recorded in an audit conducted one month before the eMR implementation in this D&A Service  [1] . This finding might suggest that 1.5 years was taken for the healthcare staff to adapt to using this new electronic documentation system. This is useful knowledge for managers of any health services in planning for the implementation of new electronic documentation systems."
