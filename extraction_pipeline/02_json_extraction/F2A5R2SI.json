      "title": "The Past",
      "text": "The concept of theory-based evaluation has been around for over twenty-five years. In the spring-summer 1996 issue Evaluation Practice published two early paper-excerpt from my 1972 book Evaluation Research and Fitz-Gibbon and Morris (1975)-along with a historical introduction by Blaine  Worthen (1996) . I have been trying to go back further. In his 1967 book Evaluative Research, Edward Suchman referred several times to the notion of programs' theories. Suchman discussed two kinds of reasons for an unsuccessful program: failure of the program to put the intended activities into operation (implementation failure) and failure of the activities to bring about the desired effects (theory failure). My 1972 book offered the first discussion Worthen and I have found of the central idea of basing evaluation on the program's theory I included a diagram of several alternative theories on which a program of teachers' home visiting might be based. See Figure  3 .1. I called the subject a \"process model,\" and I urged that the evaluator collect data on the posited links.\n\nIn succeeding years there were a few papers on the subject. Joe Wholey's work on evaluability assessment stressed the need to find out whether the implicit theory underlying a program made sense  (Wholey 1979 (Wholey , 1983 ). Wholey's idea was that prior to the start of a formal study, the evaluator positive benefits. Evaluations will provide even more valuable information when they address the mechanisms that mediate between processes and outcomes. Theory-based evaluations attend not only to what programs do but also to how participants respond. Such evaluations are not easy to do, but there are circumstances in should proceed in that direction, As a starting point, we need plausible theories. We need to make the maximum use of logical reasoning, practitioner wisdom, prior evaluations, and social science research to generate program theories and then use our collective evaluation work to test them under realistic operating conditions."
