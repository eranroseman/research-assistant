  "abstract": "The authors examined whether using home BP measurements collected via a custombuilt bi-directional-texting platform incorporated into patients' electronic medical records would lead to treatment calibration and improved BP management. Patients were randomized to either the intervention group and collected home measurements based on reminders and reported via bi-directional texting, or to the control group, with home BP measurement reporting via standard practice (eg, phone, electronic medical record portal) and instructed to return 7 morning and 7 evening BP measurements. Outcomes included number of BP measurements submitted, the number of medication changes, reduction in BP, and BP control. 72% of the intervention group submitted at least 14 readings, compared with 45% of the control group. BP control improved in both groups. However, the authors found no statistically significant difference in BP or the number of BP-medication changes at 1, 3, or 6 months compared with the control group.",

      "text": "Having patients take their own BP at home can facilitate the timely diagnosis and appropriate management of HTN by reducing diagnostic uncertainty.  1  In fact, home BP measurements are at least as reproducible as clinic readings.  2 Home measurements are a better indicator of stroke and cardiovascular mortality than clinic measurements  [3] [4] [5]  and are also more closely correlated with end-organ damage from HTN than clinic measurements.  6, 7 The availability of home BP measurements may also help physicians overcome barriers related to clinical inertia, where HTN remains untreated even in the face of repeated elevated measurements.  8 atients' self-monitoring of BP is cost-effective and well-tolerated.  9 However, using home BP measurements requires careful follow-up on the part of both patients and health care providers.\n\nPatients must take, record, and communicate their BP measurements, either on paper or, more recently, through web-based interfaces, either of which may present significant challenges for the elderly or medically underserved populations. Thus, there is a critical need for an easier and more reliable means to accurately record and communicate home BP measurements between patients and health care providers.\n\nTo facilitate HTN diagnosis and treatment, we developed an mhealth solution, a custom-built bi-directional SMS-based (short message service or texting) platform. In previous work, we have shown that bi-directional texting is effective for collecting home BP measurements.  10 In this study, we examined whether using the home BP measurements collected via bi-directional texting and subsequently incorporated into patients' electronic medical records would lead to treatment calibration and improved BP management."

A randomized trial of a pharmacist-delivered intervention suggests a 12-month reduction in SBP between the intervention group, and usual care is approximately 5.7 mm Hg with a standard deviation of approximately 18 mm Hg.  11  Based on these values, to have 80% power at 95% confidence for a two-sample t test, we would need 157 participants per group. Because our study is comparing BP at 6 months and not 12 months, we increased this number by 10% to account for a potentially smaller change in BP during the shorter interval and by an additional 20% to account for dropout and loss to follow-up. These adjustments indicated approximately 430 participants would be required."

Reply to this message with your BP and time it was taken.\" The patient returned a short text with his/ her BP measurements and the time they were taken: for example, \"150/90 and 145/88 7am\" If the patient did not respond to 7 morning and 7 evening BP requests, reminders were sent to the patient until 2 weeks elapsed.

In addition, 72% of the intervention group submitted at least 14 readings, compared with only 45% of the control group. However, we found no evidence of increased BP-medication changes or improved BP management in the intervention group. Specifically, we found no statistically significant difference in the mean number of BP-medication changes at 1, 3, or 6 months compared with the control group nor did we detect any statistically significant difference in BP management.\n\nAlthough we did not observe a difference in BP control between groups, BP improved for patients in both the control group and the intervention group, and these changes were clinically significant.\n\nSBP among the intervention group was reduced from a mean of 150 mg Hg systolic that made them eligible for the study, to a mean of 136 mg Hg taken from the electronic medical record 6 months later. For the control group, SBP was reduced from a mean of 152 mg Hg that determined eligibility to 135 mg Hg at 6 months. These findings suggest that self-measurement of BP alone may be sufficient to activate patients to change behavior and possibly seek additional care from their physician.\n\nThere are at least three potential reasons the control group experienced an improvement in BP.\n\nFirst, the control group was not truly standard of care. Patients randomized to the control group were enrolled in a BP study and signed the same consent form prior to randomization. As a result, this process may have helped patients understand the importance of BP control, monitoring, and treatment and resulted in behavior change.

In fact, 42% of patients in the control group returned the requisite number of BP measurements, and 52% sent at least one measurement. From anecdotal reports, this appears to be a large increase over standard of practice (although there is no way to establish such a baseline retrospectively). Finally, simply conducting this study likely affected clinic physicians by increasing the emphasis on BP. Because physicians had patients in both arms of the study, they may well have paid more attention to BP in patients assigned to both the control and intervention groups. In support of this informal hypothesis, we observed that patients in both groups had similar numbers of visits after enrollment: 3.7 in the control group and 3.8 in the intervention group. Also, most patients had BP medication changes during the study period. However, we cannot determine whether these numbers are different from historical levels of patient visits and medication changes. Home-measured BP may have led to improvements in both groups. Home BP readings to supplement clinic readings may help overcome clinical inertia. 8 McManus and colleagues (2005) found that home self-monitoring itself redued systolic BP for 6 months by 4.3 mm Hg, 9 and these results are similar to ours. There have been many previous SMS-or telehealth-based hypertension studies, but most have used a team-based approach including a nurse or pharmacist. Team-based interventions have been successful, 14-16 but non-team-based interventions have had mixed results. For example, in a study of hypertension and telehealth by Green and colleagues (2008), there were three groups: usual care, home BP with a dedicated website, and home BP with a dedicated website and pharmacist intervention. The resulting increase BP control in the first two groups was similar (31% vs. 36%), but in the pharmacist group, BP control increased by 56%. 17 In our intervention group, BP control increased by 23%, which is lower than that of Greene's telehealthonly group.

This study was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (#201509761). A CONSORT diagram for this study is shown in Figure 1."

      "text": "ZAHR et Al. (2008), where patients were instructed to text their BP measurements. However, providers had to login to a separate website to obtain the measurements. They found that systolic BP decreased by 15.5 mm Hg in the texting group versus 11.9 in the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant.  18 Systolic BP in our study decreased a little more than in Carrasco, but our results, like theirs, were statistically insignificant.\n\nOur results are subject to limitations. Beyond our control group not representing standard of care, our pragmatic approach did not require patients to return for a final research-related interview. Thus, we were limited to using only BP measurements from the patients' medical records. Accordingly, we did not get 6-month clinic-based BP measurements for many patients (only 64 patients in the intervention group and 60 patients in the control group had BP measurements recorded between 150 and 180 days after enrollment). Thus, by relying on usual care for follow-up, we effectively reduced our sample size and our ability to detect a difference in BP control. Additionally, the reports were returned soon after the patient's clinic visit, and most patients did not return to the clinic soon after the readings were recorded in the chart. So, the report may not have been at the forefront of the physician's mind when the patient returned for a follow-up appointment, and our 6 months of follow-up might not have been long enough to measure many medication changes. Also, although all patients had elevated BP, many were close to control. Future research should include only patients with uncontrolled BP on the baseline visit who require the most intense interventions. Finally, this study was conducted before the new AHA/ACC guidelines were published so providers were not as likely to focus on a goal BP <130/80 mm Hg.  19  These lower BP goals will require additional strategies to achieve BP control.\n\nOur bi-directional-texting intervention successfully collected BP measurements and sent them to the patients' physicians. BP reduction occurred for both the intervention and control groups during the study period. However, BP was not reduced more for the intervention group, nor were they more likely to be controlled or have medication changes than the control group. Thus, even minimal interventions-loaning patients' home BP monitors and instructing them to return their measurements-may improve BP control."

Patients signed consent forms and were enrolled in private clinic rooms. Patients were randomized by choosing one of two envelopes, with group assignment obscured. Half were randomized to the intervention group, who collected home measurements based on reminders and reported via bi-directional texting, with the remaining half randomized to the control group, with home BP measurement reporting via MyChart (an Internet-based web-portal connected to the patient's electronic medical record), mail, phone, or fax. Patients in both groups were provided a home BP monitor (Omron Upper-Arm BP Monitor, Series 5) and were shown how to use it. All were asked to return the BP cuff at the end of the study and were compensated $20 when the cuff was returned. This study was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (#201509761). A CONSORT diagram for this study is shown in Figure 1."
