  "title": "Comparison of small-sample standard-error corrections for generalised estimating equations in stepped wedge cluster randomised trials with a binary outcome: A simulation study",
  "abstract": "Generalised estimating equations with the sandwich standard-error estimator provide a promising method of analysis for stepped wedge cluster randomised trials. However, they have inflated type-one error when used with a small number of clusters, which is common for stepped wedge cluster randomised trials. We present a large simulation study of binary outcomes comparing bias-corrected standard errors from Fay and Graubard; Mancl and DeRouen; Kauermann and Carroll; Morel, Bokossa, and Neerchal; and Mackinnon and White with an independent and exchangeable working correlation matrix. We constructed 95% confidence intervals using a t-distribution with degrees of freedom including clusters minus parameters (DF C-P ), cluster periods minus parameters, and estimators from Fay and Graubard (DF FG ), and Pan and Wall. Fay and Graubard and an approximation to Kauermann and Carroll (with simpler matrix inversion) were unbiased in a wide range of scenarios with an independent working correlation matrix and more than 12 clusters. They gave confidence intervals with close to 95% coverage with DF FG with 12 or more clusters, and DF C-P with 18 or more clusters. Both standard errors were conservative with fewer clusters. With an exchangeable working correlation matrix, approximated Kauermann and Carroll and Fay and Graubard had a small degree of under-coverage.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Many small sample corrections are available for generalised estimating equations  1  (GEE) with the sandwich standard-error estimator,  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  but there has been limited research on which are appropriate for use in stepped wedge trials (SW-CRTs) with a binary outcome.\n\nAn SW-CRT is a type of cluster randomised trial (CRT). Groups of individuals, known as clusters, are randomised to different sequences. The sequence dictates the time at which clusters will switch from a control condition to receive the intervention (Figure  1 ). In practice, SW-CRTS often collect binary outcomes and randomise a small number of clusters: a recent systematic review indicated that 75% of trials randomised 23 or fewer clusters.  8 nalysis of SW-CRTs requires consideration of the correlation between observations in each cluster. The strength of correlation may depend on the timing of observations within clusters, for example correlation can be stronger between observations from the same cluster collected closer together in time. 9 GEE, which estimate population average effects, together with the sandwich standard-error estimator account for this correlation and are asymptotically robust to misspecification of correlation structures.  1, 10 This is useful in a trial setting, where analysis methods must be prespecified often with little information to guide the choice of correlation structure.\n\nWith a small number of clusters, the standard-error estimates from GEE with sandwich standard-errors are biased, and the variability in the estimated standard errors means than confidence intervals are too narrow when constructed using a normal distribution.  11 A rule of thumb for parallel CRTs is that 40 clusters are required to avoid these issues,  12  and this limits the utility of GEE for CRTs.\n\nMany corrections have been developed to improve estimation of sandwich standard-errors in finite samples,  [2] [3] [4] [5] 7  and confidence intervals can be estimated using a t-distribution rather than a normal distribution to allow for the standard-error variability; several suggestions for the degrees of freedom (DF) have been published.  3, 6  The performance of these corrections is an area of active research in the context of longitudinal data,  13, 14  parallel CRTs,  15, 16  and SW-CRTs,  17, 18  and many of these papers have shown that GEE can be used with as few as 10 clusters using these corrections. However, research gaps remain for SW-CRTs, such as performance of the corrections with a binary outcome and varying cluster size.\n\nIn this paper, we begin by reviewing the literature studying several of the corrections suitable for SW-CRTs. We report the results of an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of these standard-error corrections and several DF estimators in the context of SW-CRTs with a binary outcome. We also assess whether GEE are robust to misspecification of the working correlation structure in this context. We provide guidance on which are suitable methods in this setting and demonstrate use of the methods under study in an illustrative example."

The performance is similar regardless of working correlation matrix.  13 C has been found to give standard errors with little bias in longitudinal data settings,  14  CRTs,  23  and SW-CRTS.  17 Type-one error and confidence interval coverage have been well maintained with DF C-P , including variable cluster size with a coefficient of variation up to 0.6.  15, 18 Type-one error has often been inflated with the use of DF  Inf 13, 15, 17, 23  and DF PW,  13  but type-one error has sometimes been maintained with DF Inf with common cluster size.  24 Performance is similar regardless of working correlation matrix.  13, 17 We also identified variation in the expression  17  and implementation  [25] [26] [27]  of this correction, with approximations being used by some.  14, 28 cott et al. show that FG is a simplification of KC.  17  The performance of FG has been less clear. FG has been shown to give standard errors with low bias for SW-CRTs,  17  but to overcorrect standard errors in a longitudinal setting with small cluster size.  14 For SW-CRTs, type-one error and confidence interval coverage have been well maintained with DF C-P and DF FG .  17, 18 For CRTs, type-one error and confidence interval coverage have been well maintained with DF Inf  24  and DF C-P ,  15  but conservative with DF FG .  16 For longitudinal data, DF PW and DF Inf have both resulted in inflated type-one error.  13 Performance is similar regardless of working correlation matrix.  13, 17 D has consistently been found to over correct the standard errors in longitudinal data,  19, 29  CRTs,  23, 30  and SW-CRTs.  17 Generally, p-values and confidence intervals constructed with DF Inf  15, 17, 18, 23, 24, 30  and DF PW 13,14,30   have had close to the correct size, although there have been exceptions to this.  13  Conservative type-one error and confidence intervals have been observed with DF C-P .  15, 18, 30 Performance may be improved with use of an independent working correlation matrix.  19 BN has been found to overcorrect standard errors for SW-CRTS.  17 Type-one error remained inflated and confidence interval coverage remained low with DF Inf .  13, 17, 24, 31 Other DF have led to conservative type-one error in longitudinal settings.  13, 14 In the CRT settings, Li and Redden 15 found that DF C-P gave conservative type-one error with common cluster size, and inflated type-one error with varying cluster size.

In phase two, we simulated trials with 6, 12, 18, 24, 42, 48, and 54 clusters; this allowed us to explore the performance of the corrections with a range of small trials and explore the behaviour of uncorrected GEE for larger trials.\n\nIn both phases, we simulated trials with common and varying (coefficient of variation (CV) \u00bc 0.4) cluster size. Varying cluster size was sampled from a negative binomial distribution with the required mean and standard deviation so that each measurement occasion had a minimum of two observations for each cluster. In phase one, we simulated clusters with 24 or 60 observations per cluster; where clusters varied in size, this was the mean. A cluster size of 24 corresponds to four observations in each measurement occasion, and a cluster size of 60 corresponds to 10 observations in each measurement occasion.

Despite this, confidence interval coverage was close to nominal levels when the correlation structure was correctly specified (4/186 [2%] scenarios had under covered confidence intervals with DF FG ). However, confidence interval coverage was slightly low in scenarios with reduced correlation between control and intervention observations (13/168 [8%] scenario with low coverage, Supplementary Figures  15  and  16 ).

      "title": "6.. Illustrative example",
      "text": "To explore the impact of choice of analysis, we will look at an example trial analysed with each method investigated in this study. Trajman et al.  39  conducted a trial comparing a new TB diagnostic test Xpert MTB/RIF to the commonly used smear microscopy test. We will focus on the impact of the type of test on the proportion of cases with a laboratory confirmation of diagnosis, which was a secondary outcome of the trial. This is an example of a continuous recruitment design with individuals sampled throughout the trial and one outcome collected from each.  40 The trial randomised 14 laboratories (clusters) into seven sequences. In the first month of the trial, all laboratories were using smear microscopy. Then each month, two laboratories switched to using the new tests, so that all laboratories were using the new diagnostic test in the eighth month of the trial. There were a total of 3924 observations, with a mean of 136 observations per cluster and CV in cluster size of 0.48.\n\nTable  3  shows the results of this trial analysed with all GEE analyses considered in this simulation study. Each model included a categorical variable for month to adjust for time and a variable for intervention status.\n\nStandard error inflation by the small sample corrections reflected the results of the simulation study. FG standard errors with an exchangeable working correlation matrix gave the smallest correction (7% inflation of the uncorrected standard errors). The largest correction was by the KC standard errors with an exchangeable working correlation matrix (75% inflation of the uncorrected standard errors) demonstrating the overcorrection of standard errors observed in the simulation study. The KC approximation gave a smaller inflation (14% increase from the uncorrected standard errors). MW standard errors were also large compared to the other corrected standard errors.\n\nThe most conservative DF are given DF C-P (DF C-P \u00bc5). Consistent with the simulation study, DF FG were slightly larger (DF FG \u00bc7.6 with an independent and 10.5 with an exchangeable working correlation matrix). All other DFs were larger; most were over 70.\n\nTable  3  also shows confidence intervals and p-values with the methods found to work consistently well by the simulation study (FG and KC-approx standard errors, with DF FG and DF C-P ) and with no small-sample correction. The uncorrected analyses conclude that there is strong evidence that the new test increased the odds of a confirmed diagnosis (p \u00bc 0.003 and p < 0.001 with an independent and exchangeable working correlation matrix, respectively). With an independent working correlation matrix, all corrected methods lead to similar conclusions (0.03 p 0.06) with confidence intervals with a similar width. With an exchangeable working correlation matrix, all methods led to some evidence of an effect, DF FG leading to greater evidence (p \u00bc 0.02 with DF C-P and p \u00bc 0.007 for FG and p \u00bc 0.009 for KC-approx with DF FG ) ."

      "title": "7.. Discussion",
      "text": "We found that, with as many as 54 clusters, uncorrected sandwich standard errors were smaller than the standard deviation of the intervention effect estimates across simulations leading to lower than nominal 95% confidence interval coverage. KC and FG standard errors performed well to mitigate this bias when used with an independent working correlation matrix, and results were robust to misspecification of the working correlation matrix. Use of a t-distribution with DF FG gave consistently good confidence interval coverage with at least 12 clusters, and DF C-P gave similar results with at least 18 clusters. Both DF became conservative with fewer clusters. Interpretation of results with an exchangeable working correlation matrix is less clear. KC standard errors required use of an approximation. A small amount of bias remained with FG standard errors leading to coverage less than 95%. An exchangeable working correlation matrix gave higher power than an independent working correlation matrix with 300 observations per cluster, but similar power with smaller clusters.\n\nWe found that KC standard errors were unbiased when used with an independent working correlation matrix with cluster size from 24 to 300, CV of cluster size 0 to 0.4, ICC from 0.01 to 0.1, across different true correlation structures, with 3 or 6 sequences, and with as few as 12 clusters. These findings are consistent with previous research that reported good overall performance.  13, [16] [17] [18] 18] 24  With an exchangeable working correlation matrix, we found that KC were highly variable in some scenarios due to instability in the matrix inversion required by this correction.  14, 28 The approximation we tested, also used in xtgeebcv in Stata,  28  corrected this instability, with a small cost to bias correction: similar to the FG standard errors, a small bias remained with 24 clusters or fewer. Other CRT and SW-CRT simulations have not encountered the problem of instability with similar cluster size and ICC without describing the use of alternative calculations,  18, 23  although this could be due to differences in implementation that have not been reported. Our results highlight the importance of the implementation of this correction. Other solutions to the complex inversion such as singular value decomposition (used by the SAS glimmix procedure  26  ) may have better performance than the methods we explored.\n\nWe found that FG standard errors were unbiased with an independent working correlation matrix with cluster size from 24 to 300, CV of cluster size from 0 to 0.4, ICC from 0.01 to 0.1, across different true correlation structures, with three or six sequences, and with as few as 12 clusters. We observed a small bias in standard errors when used with an exchangeable working correlation matrix leading to a small degree of under coverage of confidence intervals. Previous studies have concluded that FG standard errors perform well in similar scenarios.  13, [16] [17] [18] 18] 24  The small size of this bias and impact on confidence interval coverage is likely why the under correction has not previously been reported. Consistent with our findings, Scott et al. and Leyrat et al. observed conservative confidence interval coverage and type-one error, respectively, with FG and DF FG and a very small number of clusters  16, 17  in SW-CRTs and CRT, respectively.\n\nOur finding that KC and FG provide more consistent standard error estimates with an independent working correlation matrix is novel in the literature. We also found that this had limited impact on power for KC with any cluster size, and FG with median to small cluster size, but a large impact on power for FG with large clusters. The KC findings are contrary to the literature on GEE with sandwich standard errors that suggest power will be higher the closer the working correlation structure is to the true correlation structure.  41 These comparisons of power should be viewed with some caution, as some of the difference will be mediated by the bias in standard errors with an exchangeable working correlation matrix. The drawback to assuming independence is that a separate analysis is required to estimate the correlation parameters, which CONSORT guidelines recommend reporting.  42 vercorrection of MD, MW, and MBN standard errors has also been reported elsewhere.  15, 17, 23, 24 Where others have found appropriate type-one error and confidence interval coverage using MD, this may be explained by the choice of DF  Inf 15, 17, 18, 23, 24, 30  and DF PW .  13, 14, 30 Our findings do not support the use of an average of KC and MD standard errors as suggested by others 14 : our results imply that this would result in standard errors that are too large. For MBN and MW standard errors, contrary to findings for parallel CRTs,  15, 22, 24  we observed overcorrection with common cluster size as well as varying cluster size, and moreover, the bias was larger with common cluster size.\n\nWe have also given a detailed comparison of the performance of DF FG and DF PW in comparison to simpler estimators based on the trial design.\n\nDF PW performed poorly: we found large variability in the estimates, a property that has not been examined in other simulation studies that have included this method.  6, 43 F FG gave less variable estimates than DF PW and provided the most robust confidence interval coverage of the DF we considered. Others have also found that this method performs well. 3, 17  We found that DF FG were similar to DF C-P with 18 or more clusters and so lead to similar coverage. With fewer than 18 clusters, DF FG was larger than DF C-P and had closer to 95% coverage. Other than by number of clusters, the difference in performance varied little between the scenarios we considered including common and varying cluster size."

      "text": "The strengths of this study are in the comprehensive range of scenarios considered (nearly 700 in phase two), the wide range of small sample corrections included, and the use of methods that generate correlated data from marginal effects.\n\nThere are several corrections that we did not consider, which may have superior performance to the corrections we used.  6, 14, 19, 20 However, software availability for varying cluster size currently limits the utility of these additional corrections for CRTs. Our approach has been to identify methods that performed well across a broad range of scenarios; an alternative correction may have better performance in a particular scenario than those we have concluded were robust overall. We only considered a common outcome, and we have focused on a binary outcome, where GEE estimate marginal, or population average, effects: researchers should consider whether this is the effect of interest in their setting.  44 Our simulation study used an SW-CRT design with no baseline period. However, our results are consistent with other simulation studies that included a baseline period.  17, 18 The working correlation structures we considered (exchangeable and independent) did not incorporate the timing of observations within clusters. We have shown that this did not affect the confidence interval coverage, but as is typically the case with GEE, power may be improved by choosing a working correlation matrix that more closely follows the true structure. For example, the working correlation matrix could allow correlation to decay with distance between observation periods.  45"

      "text": "We have shown that GEE with small sample corrections are a robust method of analysis in a range of settings where SW-CRTs are commonly used. When there are fewer than 50 clusters, we recommend the use of KC, KCapprox, or FG standard errors with an independent working correlation structure, KC-approx standard errors with an exchangeable working correlation structure if clusters are large, or FG standard errors with an exchangeable working correlation structure if clusters are large and ICC is low. A t-distribution is also required with DF FG , although DF C-P is sufficient for trials with 18 or more clusters."
