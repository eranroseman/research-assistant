  "abstract": "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews minutes across studies. We judged four of the 37 studies to be at low risk of bias, and 11 to be at high risk, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk did not significantly alter results, apart from in one case -our analysis comparing higher to lower intensity MI. We found low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision, comparing the effect of MI to no treatment for smoking cessation (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; I 2 = 0%; adjusted N = 684). One study was excluded from this analysis as the participants recruited (incarcerated men) were not comparable to the other participants included in the analysis, resulting in substantial statistical heterogeneity when all studies were pooled (I 2 = 87%). Enhancing existing smoking cessation support with additional MI, compared with existing support alone, gave an RR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.36; adjusted N = 4167; I 2 = 47%), and MI compared with other forms of smoking cessation support gave an RR of 1.24 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.69; I 2 = 54%; N = 5192). We judged both of these estimates to be of low certainty due to heterogeneity and imprecision. Low-certainty evidence detected a benefit of higher intensity MI when compared with lower intensity MI (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; adjusted N = 5620; I 2 = 0%). The evidence was limited because three of the five studies in this comparison were at risk of bias. Excluding them gave an RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.54; I 2 = n/a; N = 482), changing the interpretation of the results. Mental health and quality of life outcomes were reported in only one study, providing little evidence on whether MI improves mental wellbeing. \n Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not MI helps people to stop smoking compared with no intervention, as an addition to other types of behavioural support for smoking cessation, or compared with other types of behavioural support for smoking cessation. It is also unclear whether more intensive MI is more effective than less intensive MI. All estimates of treatment effect were of low certainty because of concerns about bias in the trials, imprecision and inconsistency. Consequently, future trials are likely to change these conclusions. There is almost no evidence on whether MI for smoking cessation improves mental well-being.",

      "text": "The concept of motivational interviewing (MI) evolved from experiences in treating alcohol abuse, and was first described by Miller in 1983. It is defined as \"a directive, client-centred counselling style for eliciting behaviour change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence\"  (Miller 1983) . The four guiding principles: (a) expressing empathy, (b) developing discrepancy, (c) rolling with resistance, (d) supporting self efficacy, have been detailed elsewhere  (Miller 2002) .\n\nThe MI process is a brief psychotherapeutic intervention intended to increase the likelihood that a person will make an attempt to change their harmful behaviour. Adaptations of MI have ranged from brief 20-minute office interventions (motivational consulting) to Motivation Enhancement Therapy (MET), a multisession course of treatment, including a lengthy assessment, personalised feedback and follow-up interviews  (Lawendowski 1998; Rollnick 1992) . MI has also been provided by telephone consultations and in a group format. MI and its various forms have been applied both as a stand-alone intervention or with other treatments, and in a range of settings. These include health settings such as general hospital wards, emergency departments, and general medical practice  (Britt 2002) ."

    {
      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "Miller 1994 suggests that motivation may fluctuate over time or from one situation to another, and can be influenced to change in a particular direction. Thus, lack of motivation (or resistance to change) is seen as something fluid, that is open to change. Therefore, the main focus of MI is facilitating behaviour change using a directive approach, by helping people to explore and resolve any ambivalence they may have toward this change  (Rollnick 1995) , and in turn making them more likely to choose to change their behaviour in the desired direction. In this case, that behaviour is smoking and so the goal of MI is to increase motivation to quit, making smoking cessation more likely. Rollnick 1995 also suggests that adopting an aggressive or confrontational style is likely to produce negative responses from people (such as arguing), which may be interpreted by the practitioner as denial or resistance. MI guides people to explore and confront their behaviour, instead of telling them what to do."

      "title": "Why it is important to do this review",
      "text": "MI has been used primarily for the management of health behaviours in those with behavioural disorders, such as alcohol abuse, drug addiction, weight loss, and treatment compliance, as well as for smoking cessation. Systematic reviews have shown some beneficial effects of MI on these behaviours  (Cheng 2015; Cowlishaw 2012; Foxcro 2016; Gates 2016; Heckman 2010; Hettema 2010; Klimas 2018; Mbuagbaw 2012; Morton 2015; Smedslund 2011 ). However, these effects are minimal or nonexistent at long-term follow-up and included studies are generally deemed to be of limited quality, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. For example, Morton 2015 concluded that the design of many studies -incorporating multi-component interventionsmade it very difficult to isolate the effects of MI. The previous version of this review (Lindson-Hawley 2015) resulted in a modest but significant increase in quitting smoking when MI was used in comparison to brief advice or usual care. However, this review encountered the same challenges described by Morton 2015 above, pooled studies with a range of different comparator types, and only included studies that reported providing a form of MI fidelity monitoring. This may have biased the inclusion of studies and thus the results. Therefore, inclusion criteria for this version of the review have been revised to reduce bias (although still control for fidelity monitoring), attempt to isolate the effects of MI, and to be mindful of the comparator group when pooling studies, to allow a range of useful comparisons."

We included studies testing interventions that claimed to be based on both MI and another theoretical approach to counselling, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

      "text": "MI has been linked to self-determination theory. Markland 2005  proposed that MI can provide the circumstances under which people can initiate and action their own behaviour through 'self-determination'. Self-determination theory hypothesises that this self-determination can lead to positive consequences, such as enhanced well-being  (Ryan 2000) . This suggests that MI may increase well-being as well as promote behaviour change. Therefore, we attempted to collect data on the following secondary outcomes:\n\n\u2022 Mental health and well-being. Any measure of mental health and well-being as defined by included studies \u2022 Quality of life (QOL). Any validated QOL scale reported in included studies. For example, the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS)  (Burckhardt 2003) ; the Euro-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D) (EuroQol Group 1990)\n\nWe considered including adverse events as an outcome but decided against this. MI and comparator interventions comprise talk about smoking, which rarely gives rise to strong emotions and attendance for counselling is voluntary. Thus, it is unlikely that people who find such talk distressing will attend MI. As a result, we believe that few or no trials will have assessed adverse events, making assessment impossible."

Eleven of the 37 included studies  (Butler 1999; Catley 2016; Cook 2016; Davis 2011; Dem\u00e9trio Faustino-Silva 2018; Ellerbeck 2009; Hollis 2007; NCT02645838; Soria 2006; Vidrine 2019; Wu 2009 ) recruited from the general population, through advertisements, attendance at primary care or other community venues, or through calling a smoking quitline. However, the majority of studies in this review recruited from specialist populations:\n\n\u2022 Adolescents or young people (eight studies;  Audrain-McGovern 2011; Colby 2005; Colby 2012; Harris 2010; Helstrom 2007; Kelly 2006; Tevyaw 2009; Woodruff 2007) . One of these studies specifically recruited adolescent offenders (Helstrom 2007).\n\nParticipants had been arrested or given notice to appear in court for a variety of offences and had been given the option for a diversionary program, but were not incarcerated.\n\n\u2022 People with substance abuse problems (three studies): Rohsenow 2015 recruited people with a range of substance abuse issues, whereas Rohsenow 2014 specifically recruited people with alcohol dependency and Stein 2006 recruited opoid dependent people receiving methadone treatment. \u2022 People attending, or who had attended screening, for smokingrelated cancers (two studies): Marshall 2016 recruited people who were being screened for lung cancer, and McClure 2005 recruited women who had attended for cervical screening, and had been told that they had an elevated risk of cervical cancer. \u2022 Patients with a variety of acute health problems (eight studies): In four studies, participants were being treated as hospital inpatients, for unspecified, varied health issues (De Azevedo 2010; Lewis 1998; Sherman 2016) or operative fractures (Matuszewski 2018). In the remaining four studies, patients were attending the emergency department for chest pain (Bock 2008), or receiving outpatient treatment for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Battaglia 2016), HIV (Lloyd-Richardson 2009), or tuberculosis (Louwagie 2014). \u2022 African-American/black light smokers: defined as smoking ten or fewer cigarettes per day (Ahluwalia 2006) \u2022 Incarcerated men in a prison in India (Naik 2014) \u2022 Homeless adults recruited from homeless shelters (Okuyemi 2013) \u2022 Friends and family of people who had been diagnosed with lung cancer (Bastian 2013) \u2022 People with a low income: defined as primary care patients who were uninsured or receiving healthcare benefits (Bock 2014)\n\nThe majority of the included studies (29 of 37) did not recruit participants specifically based on their motivation to quit at baseline, i.e. there was not an eligibility criterion that specified that participants needed to be motivated to quit or not; however five studies only recruited participants motivated to quit  (Ahluwalia 2006; Dem\u00e9trio Faustino-Silva 2018; Hollis 2007; Lewis 1998; Vidrine 2019)  and three studies specifically recruited participants who were not motivated to quit  (Catley 2016; Cook 2016; Davis 2011) . The studies that recruited people motivated to quit had an eligibility criteria specifying that participants had to be willing to quit smoking within a specific time period (e.g. the next two weeks, within a month); recruited people based on their willingness to receive smoking cessation treatment; or recruited people because they had expressed an interest in quitting. The studies that recruited people not motivated to quit advertised for participants who were not ready to quit smoking; had an eligibility criterion specifying that participants should have no interest in quitting over the next month; or participants were not told that the aim of the study was smoking cessation and, when asked about their quitting plans, were excluded if they said they were ready to quit."

Three studies reported that the counselling in the intervention arm was based on another theoretical approach in addition to MI: Bastian 2013 combined the principles of MI with adaptive coping skills, and both Lewis 1998 and Vidrine 2019 combined MI with principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Another study combined the adolescent participant MI intervention with a parent MI intervention in the intervention arm only (Colby 2012).\n\nResearchers discussed participants' quit attempts and supporting it with their parents, using MI principles.This study was borderline for inclusion as one of our eligibility criteria was to exclude studies where extra non-MI components were not matched between study arms. However, we decided to include this study, as the extra component complied with the principles of MI, and we went on to test whether its exclusion impacted upon the results of metaanalysis using sensitivity analysis."

This usually comprised one or a range of the following methods: the observation of all or a subset of sessions by clinicians or the study lead; rating sessions on their adherence to MI using fidelity scales, such as the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) code (Pierson 2007) or study specific scales; supervision meetings with counselling providers to reflect on practice and learn and improve based on these experiences. Only ten of these 21 studies then went on to report on the results of this fidelity monitoring (Audrain-McGovern 2011; Catley 2016; Colby 2005; Colby 2012; Davis 2011; Harris 2010; Lloyd-Richardson 2009; Rohsenow 2014; Rohsenow 2015; Tevyaw 2009).

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy",
      "text": "Twenty of the 37 studies offered or recommended the use of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation to all, or a subset of participants, in the study groups of interest for this review.\n\nThis was typically nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) only (Ahluwalia 2006; Bastian 2013; Bock 2008; Bock 2014; Cook 2016; Hollis 2007; Lloyd-Richardson 2009; Okuyemi 2013; Rohsenow 2014; Rohsenow 2015; Sherman 2016; Stein 2006; Vidrine 2019; Wu 2009), however one study offered bupropion only (Soria 2006), and some studies provided a choice of pharmacotherapies from two or all three of the following: NRT, varenicline or bupropion (Battaglia 2016; Catley 2016; Ellerbeck 2009; Harris 2010; McClure 2005). In all cases, pharmacotherapy was offered or recommended in all relevant trial arms, and so the use and type of pharmacotherapy was not being tested. Where included studies did have trial arms testing additional components to MI, these study arms were not included in analyses (Ellerbeck 2009; Lewis 1998). Modality MI was delivered in face-to-face sessions in 17 of the 37 studies; in another 12 studies, the counselling was delivered in a combination of face-to-face and telephone sessions, usually with an initial session or sessions conducted face-to-face, followed by follow-up counselling over the phone. Six studies provided counselling over the phone only (Bastian 2013; Battaglia 2016; Ellerbeck 2009; Hollis 2007; McClure 2005; Sherman 2016); a further study had an MI intervention group that received calls and text messages based on CBT and MI and another MI group that received text messages only (Vidrine 2019), and a final study provided MI counselling for adolescents in an online virtual environment (Woodruff 2007). Participants were represented by an avatar in the online world and received MI group counselling with other participants and a counsellor within a virtual shopping mall. Intensity Nine studies provided a single session of MI in at least one of the MI intervention groups (Butler 1999; Davis 2011; Helstrom 2007; Kelly 2006; Louwagie 2014; Marshall 2016; Matuszewski 2018; Rohsenow 2014; Vidrine 2019); the number of sessions offered ranged from one to 12 across studies. Some studies had more than one MI intervention group of different intensities (Ellerbeck 2009; Hollis 2007; Matuszewski 2018; Rohsenow 2014; Sherman 2016; Vidrine 2019). These studies compared a lower intensity MI intervention comprised of one to two sessions to a higher intensity MI intervention which ranged from two to 11 sessions. The total duration of MI interventions varied greatly across studies, from five minutes to 315 minutes; however length of sessions was not reported in a minority of cases. For further detail on the content and intensity of interventions, see Table 2. Provider MI was delivered by physicians (Butler 1999; Marshall 2016; NCT02645838; Soria 2006), nurses (Battaglia 2016; Davis 2011; Lewis 1998), counsellors/psychologists (Ahluwalia 2006; Audrain-McGovern 2011; Bastian 2013; Bock 2008; Bock 2014; Catley 2016; Colby 2005; Colby 2012; Cook 2016; Ellerbeck 2009; Harris 2010; Kelly 2006; Lloyd-Richardson 2009; McClure 2005; Okuyemi 2013; Rohsenow 2014; Rohsenow 2015; Sherman 2016; Stein 2006; Tevyaw 2009; Vidrine 2019; Woodruff 2007; Wu 2009), some of whom were described as specialist smoking cessation advisors (De Azevedo 2010; Dem\u00e9trio Faustino-Silva 2018; Hollis 2007; Matuszewski 2018), and lay healthcare workers (Louwagie 2014). Helstrom 2007 and Naik 2014 did not specify the type of provider delivering support. Comparator We grouped studies dependent on the nature of the relevant comparator. Comparators either consisted of no smoking cessation interventions (Cook 2016; Harris 2010; Naik 2014; Tevyaw 2009; Woodruff 2007), a non-MI smoking cessation intervention (Ahluwalia 2006; Audrain-McGovern 2011; Bastian 2013; Battaglia 2016; Bock 2008; Bock 2014; Butler 1999; Catley 2016; Colby 2005; Colby 2012; Cook 2016; Davis 2011; De Azevedo 2010; Dem\u00e9trio Faustino-Silva 2018; Helstrom 2007; Kelly 2006; Lewis 1998; Lloyd-Richardson 2009; Louwagie 2014; Marshall 2016; Matuszewski 2018; McClure 2005; NCT02645838; Okuyemi 2013; Rohsenow 2014; Rohsenow 2015; Soria 2006; Stein 2006; Tevyaw 2009; Vidrine 2019; Wu 2009), or another MI intervention of lower intensity (Ellerbeck 2009; Hollis 2007; Matuszewski 2018; Rohsenow 2014; Sherman 2016; Vidrine 2019). Some studies had multiple study arms and so fell into more than one category. We further split the studies with a non-MI smoking cessation intervention into two groupsthose where the MI interventions stood alone and were directly compared with the other cessation interventions, and those where the intervention groups received the MI interventions in addition to the non-MI smoking cessation interventions, which were also offered in the comparator groups. No smoking cessation treatment comparator Three of the five studies that compared MI to no smoking cessation treatment provided no intervention (Cook 2016; Naik 2014; Woodruff 2007). Participants were simply followed up to assess the outcome. Naik 2014 offered participants in the comparator the opportunity to receive the MI intervention following the initial treatment period. Two of the studies provided participants with a 'dummy' intervention designed to match the intensity of the MI smoking cessation intervention. In Harris 2010, this was MI counselling focussed on increasing participants' fruit and vegetable consumption; both study arms received counselling over four sessions for an average duration of 100 minutes. In Tevyaw 2009, participants in the comparison group received 'progressive muscle relation training' over three sessions for an overall duration of 120 minutes. Non-MI smoking cessation intervention comparator In the minority of cases (7 of 31; Ahluwalia 2006; Catley 2016; Davis 2011; Dem\u00e9trio Faustino-Silva 2018; Helstrom 2007; Kelly 2006; Wu 2009), the comparator group (or one of the comparator groups in the study) received smoking cessation counselling that was matched in intensity to the MI counselling in the intervention group. This was either described simply as smoking cessation counselling with information giving or advice, or as a specific approach, i.e. prescriptive interviewing (Davis 2011), CBT (Dem\u00e9trio Faustino-Silva 2018), or the psychoeducation model (Kelly 2006). Wu 2009 provided participants in the comparator group with general health Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews education counselling, which covered smoking cessation, as well as nutrition and exercise.\n\nIn most cases, the support provided in the comparator group was of lower intensity than the MI intervention arm and consisted of brief advice on cessation, self-help materials (such as printed materials and contact details for smoking cessation services or quit-lines), or both. In one study, one of the comparator interventions was more intensive than the MI intervention  (Cook 2016) . Cook 2016 was a 16-arm factorial trial where some study arms were provided with a behavioural smoking reduction intervention. This reduction intervention was delivered over seven sessions with a total duration of 80 minutes, whereas the MI intervention was delivered over four sessions with a total duration of 50 minutes.\n\nTwo studies offered half of their participants payments contingent on them being abstinent from smoking  (Rohsenow 2015; Tevyaw 2009) . In both cases, these contingency payments were matched in the intervention arm."

It was possible to use biochemically validated (using expired carbon monoxide or urinary/salivary cotinine) cessation rates for 22 of the 37 studies. We were unsure whether the rates reported in Naik 2014 and Dem\u00e9trio Faustino-Silva 2018 were biochemically verified. The Naik 2014 study report stated that carbon monoxide was measured; however, it was unclear whether this was used to motivate participants, verify cessation rates, or both. Only one study measured one of our secondary outcomes -mental health. Battaglia 2016 recruited veterans with PTSD attending Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare clinics and investigated the effect of integrating MI smoking cessation counselling into the standard telehealth programme already provided (which included access to pharmacological and behavioural smoking cessation treatments). Throughout the study, PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (range of 17 to 85 with a score > 50, indicating PTSD diagnosis), depression was monitored using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF), where a score greater than 6 indicated probable depression, and suicidal thoughts were assessed every 30 sessions via a single question. Some of the other studies measured markers of mental health or well-being at baseline or reported mental health at follow-up overall; however, only Battaglia 2016 measured mental health at follow-up and presented the results by study group."

We contacted the authors a second time to verify whether the intervention was delivered to the comparator group a er the six-month assessment time point and received no further reply.

Cook 2016 was a factorial trial with four factors: 1) MI/no MI; behavioural reduction counselling/ no behavioural reduction counselling; nicotine gum/no nicotine gum; and nicotine patch/no nicotine patch. The authors reported an unexpected interaction between MI and nicotine gum, where the combination of the two resulted in lower quit rates than any other interventions or combinations.

However, heterogeneity was substantial (I 2 = 87%; Analysis 1.1), and so we did not deem it appropriate to present the pooled result of this analysis.\n\nExamining the forest plots, individual RRs and 95% CIs provided evidence that this heterogeneity was due to the large positive effect of MI in Naik 2014 (RR 8.00; 95% CI 3.48 to 18.41; N = 600). This was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis removing Naik 2014 (Analysis 1.2; I 2 = 0%). None of the four remaining studies (Cook 2016; Harris 2010; Tevyaw 2009; Woodruff 2007) demonstrated a clear benefit of MI, as the confidence intervals spanned both clinical benefit and harm (pooled RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; I 2 = 0%; adjusted N = 684). The heterogeneity introduced by Naik 2014 can potentially be explained by the nature of the population recruited, which differs substantially to the populations studied in Cook 2016, Harris 2010, Tevyaw 2009 and Woodruff 2007. Naik 2014 recruited incarcerated male smokers and, as a result, took place in a prison setting where participants were potentially unable to drop out, and also very unlikely to try to quit smoking in the no treatment group; whereas Cook 2016 recruited adults in a primary care setting, Harris 2010 and Tevyaw 2009 recruited young college and university students (aged 18 to 24 years) and Woodruff 2007 recruited adolescents (aged 14 to 19 years). Harris 2010 cluster-randomised 30 university fraternities and sororities rather than individuals. They reported an ICC of 0.003, allowing us to adjust for this in our analysis. Cook 2016 was a four factor, 16-arm, factorial RCT included in this comparison, as well as comparisons 2 and 3. Please refer to the Characteristics of included studies table for full details of how this study was included in all analyses.\n\nRemoving the two studies judged to be at high risk of bias in the pooled analysis (Cook 2016; Woodruff 2007) changed the direction of the pooled estimate so that it was in favour of motivational interviewing; however, confidence intervals still incorporated evidence of both benefit and harm, and so this did not change our interpretation of the result. The estimate resulting from this sensitivity analysis should be treated with caution as it was based on only two studies (Harris 2010; Tevyaw 2009) and there was substantial imprecision due to a paucity of participants and events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 10.14; I 2 = n/a; adjusted N = 434).\n\nWe did not carry out any subgroup analyses on the presented pooled analysis (Analysis 1.2) as there were insufficient data to draw meaningful conclusions."

Thus, this study investigated the intensity of MI counselling as well as MI in addition to another type of smoking cessation intervention. Analysis of study data was completed at the end of 2018 and has not yet been published. However, results were presented at a conference in 2018. The conference abstract stated that at six months, 35% of the comparison group had quit, and 21% and 30% of the lower intensity and higher intensity MI groups had quit respectively, with no evidence of differences between these groups.

Five of these trials compared MI to no smoking cessation intervention, 12 provided MI in addition to another smoking cessation intervention and compared this to the same intervention without MI, and 19 compared MI to another smoking cessation intervention. Five studies compared a more intensive MI intervention to a lower intensity one. One study could not be included in meta-analyses.\n\nPooling all available studies comparing MI to no smoking cessation treatment resulted in substantial heterogeneity between studies caused by one study carried out in incarcerated men. As this study differed considerably from the other included studies, we excluded this study from the analysis and pooled the remaining studies carried out in adults and adolescents representing the general population. This resulted in a pooled RR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; I 2 = 0%; adjusted N = 684). The pooled estimate was in favour of no treatment; however the CIs incorporated the possibility of both benefit and harm. This estimate was judged to be of low certainty as it was imprecise, and all studies were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias. When studies at high risk of bias were removed, the point estimate changed to be in favour of MI; however, the CIs were still imprecise and spanned one; suggesting the possibility of both harm and benefit. The comparison between MI plus another smoking cessation intervention and that smoking cessation intervention alone (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.36; I 2 = 47%; adjusted N = 4167), and the comparison between MI and another smoking cessation intervention (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.69; I 2 = 54%; N = 5192) also produced CIs incorporating both benefit and harm. Concerns about unexplained inconsistency and imprecision resulted in low certainty relating to both of these estimates. We investigated the impact of studies at high risk of bias, the impact of face-to-face contact, fidelity monitoring, and participant motivation to quit. Across these sensitivity and subgroup analyses, there were some differences splitting by subgroup, but no consistent pattern emerged across the body of evidence.\n\nFive trials examined the effectiveness of more intensive compared with less intensive MI smoking cessation interventions and produced an RR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; adjusted N = 5620; I 2 = 0%) in favour of more intensive MI. However, this analysis included three studies at high risk of bias and removing these produced an RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.54; I 2 = n/a; N = 482). We judged the overall summary estimate as having low certainty because of this.\n\nOnly one study investigated the effect of an MI smoking cessation intervention on the well-being of participants  (Battaglia 2016) . Battaglia 2016 studied participants with PTSD, and found modest benefits of MI on PTSD and depression scores at final follow-up, compared with a usual smoking cessation care group. However, due to the paucity of evidence, no conclusions can be drawn on"

      "text": "The studies identified for this review were mainly conducted in the USA; most others took place in other high-income countries, though some were conducted in middle-income countries. In addition, the majority of studies were carried out in specific populations rather than recruitment being carried out in the general population.\n\nThe diversity of populations studied may have contributed to the moderate to substantial heterogeneity observed across all comparisons. We did not plan to, and therefore did not look for evidence that population characteristics (other than participants' baseline motivation to quit) modified the effectiveness of MI.\n\nTypically, the specialist populations studied represented what may be referred to as 'hard to reach' groups (people with substance use disorders, adolescents, offenders, hospital inpatients and outpatients) and this should be considered when interpreting results; however, where the characteristics of a population have led to low quit rates in the intervention arm, this is also likely to have affected quit rates in the comparator arm, and this may not have affected the relative effectiveness of MI.\n\nThe significant heterogeneity detected within analyses is likely to also have been influenced by considerable variation across the characteristics of both the intervention and comparator arms.\n\nDespite dividing studies into separate comparisons for this update and conducting preplanned subgroup analyses in an attempt to reduce and explain some of this variation, key differences remained in the components of the MI and more general smoking cessation support provided. Studies typically provided only limited explanation of the content of the MI interventions; most specifying simply that MI techniques were adhered to, but giving sparse description of the counselling overall. This made it hard to differentiate between studies based on the nature of the MI support provided, which could have given further insight into why heterogeneity existed between studies. There was substantial variation in the intensity of the support in both intervention and comparator groups, which we did attempt to control for. However, it would have been impossible to control for all possible sources of variation across studies and this means that although we can hypothesise about the causes of this heterogeneity, this remains largely unexplained.\n\nMI can be a difficult technique to learn and enact and therefore monitoring the fidelity of the intervention can give assurance that MI was delivered as intended and was consonant with Miller and Rollnick's key principles  (Miller 2002; Miller 2013) . Jelsma 2015 gave guidance on why this is important and how trialists can ensure that they satisfy this suggested requirement. Scales have been developed, such as the motivational interviewing treatment integrity (MITI) code  (Pierson 2007) , in order to measure adherence to MI consistently. However, most of the studies in this review did not attempt to monitor and/or improve the fidelity of MI interventions; and when monitoring was reported, they o en did not report the results of that monitoring. The inconsistency of monitoring techniques and standards to define acceptable fidelity across studies means it was impossible to report overall fidelity of implementation. This, in turn, makes it difficult to determine whether the minimal beneficial effects detected in this review were due to a genuine lack of MI efficacy, or whether the included studies were not delivering MI as intended.\n\nFinally, MI is an intervention designed to help people change their behaviour by increasing motivation to quit; however, only a minority of the included studies specifically recruited smokers who were not motivated to quit  (Catley 2016; Cook 2016; Davis 2011) . Five studies specifically recruited smokers motivated to quit and the remainder did not specify that they had recruited based on motivation at baseline and, thus, we assume these were populations of mixed motivation. That said, it is likely that only people somewhat motivated to quit would join a study about smoking cessation and it is likely that most studies in this review presented themselves to potential participants in this manner. It is plausible that, if MI is effective, it would be more helpful for people with low motivation. However, there was no evidence of this in this review as too few studies have recruited this population."

      "text": "Of the 37 studies included in this review, we judged four to be at low risk of bias for all domains, and 11 to be at high risk in one or more domains. In many cases, we had to rate studies at an unclear risk, because they did not report key information. In these cases, it is impossible to know whether these studies were at any risk of bias or whether the information was simply not reported. To investigate the potential impact of studies that we judged to be at high risk of bias on results, we removed studies judged to be at high risk of bias in sensitivity analyses. In most cases, this did not materially change the estimates of effect. However, removing the three studies judged to be at high risk of bias from the analysis of higher versus lower intensity MI did affect the results, changing the summary estimate from clear evidence of modest benefit to no evidence of benefit.\n\nWe assessed the certainty of the evidence by creating 'Summary of findings' tables for all four comparisons and carrying out GRADE ratings for the smoking cessation outcome for each (Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2; Summary of findings 3; Summary of findings 4). For the MI versus no treatment comparison, we judged the certainty of the cessation evidence to be low. We downgraded the evidence as all of the included studies were at high or unclear risk of bias and the pooled estimate was imprecise, as the upper and lower limits of the CIs included both meaningful benefit and harm. We also judged the cessation evidence to be of low certainty for all of the remaining comparisons. When investigating MI in addition to another type of smoking cessation treatment or versus another type of smoking cessation intervention, this was due to imprecision, but also unexplained variation in effect size between studies. We judged the evidence contributing to the 'intensity of MI' comparison as low certainty because of the 'Risk of bias' assessment, where three of the five studies were at high risk of bias.\n\nAs previously discussed, removing these studies in a sensitivity analysis changed the interpretation of the effect, so that the confidence intervals encompassed both appreciable benefit and harm of higher intensity motivational interviewing for smoking cessation.\n\nWe generated funnel plots for the two comparisons that included over ten studies ('MI in addition to another form of smoking cessation treatment' or 'MI versus another non-MI smoking cessation intervention') in an attempt to identify any differential reporting of studies finding negative effects of MI. In neither case did these plots provide evidence of publication bias (Figure  3 ; Figure  4 )."

For outcome assessment, we followed the standard methods used for Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group cessation reviews. Our search strategy included the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register and we also searched trial registries in an attempt to capture unpublished and ongoing studies. There may be unpublished data that our searches did not uncover; however funnel plots suggested that this is unlikely to bias results for the two relevant comparisons. For this update of the review, we modified the inclusion criteria and therefore conducted a full search of the literature (rather than just updating the searches run previously). As a result, we included 16 new studies and excluded ten previously included studies and two ongoing studies. We introduced an exclusion criterion to exclude studies that incorporated additional non-MI components in the MI intervention arm but not the comparison arm (nine previously included/ongoing studies have been now excluded for this reason). It is plausible that the apparent effect of MI seen in the previous review may have been partly because the interventions incorporated these other active elements. We excluded quasirandomised studies at this update as non-randomised studies are of lower quality and the larger body of randomised trials allowed us to draw conclusions on the best quality evidence (we excluded one previously included study for this reason). We also excluded one previously included study that tested an MI intervention to encourage people to participate in the trial rather than to aid them to quit smoking, and another study that was based primarily on the stages of change theory. We believe that these changes have reduced biases that previously existed in the review."

      "text": "Two previous reviews of MI for smoking cessation  (Heckman 2010; Hettema 2010 ) provided evidence of a very modest effect of MI at long-term follow-up (six months or more). Our own effect estimates are compatible when comparing MI (on its own or in addition to other smoking cessation care) to another form of smoking cessation treatment, with point estimates suggesting very modest benefit but, unlike the previous reviews, our summary estimate CIs incorporated potential harm of MI as well as benefit.\n\nA key difference is that these other reviews pooled together all comparisons whereas we separated ours into four based on the type and intensity of the comparator groups. Our findings reflect the findings of the MI literature more generally, across a variety of health behaviours  (Cheng 2015; Cowlishaw 2012; Foxcro 2016; Gates 2016; Klimas 2018; Mbuagbaw 2012; Morton 2015; Smedslund 2011) . These systematic reviews typically found modest effects of MI that were not sustained at long-term follow-up. As in this review, these reviews o en detected moderate unexplained heterogeneity, possibly relating to substantial differences between the intervention and comparator, other than the presence or absence of MI across the included studies.\n\nHettema 2010 found evidence that the baseline motivation of participants recruited moderated the effect of MI.

      "text": "\u2022 There is insufficient evidence to assess whether MI to promote smoking cessation increases cessation compared with no intervention, and further evidence may change our estimate of the effect. \u2022 MI may modestly increase the likelihood of long-term smoking cessation when used in addition to other smoking cessation intervention components or when compared with non-MI smoking cessation interventions; however, there is also the possibility that MI may reduce quit rates relative to other smoking cessation interventions. Further evidence is likely to strengthen or weaken this effect. \u2022 There is no clear evidence to suggest that the effect of MI is moderated by the intervention provider, age of participant, participants' motivation to quit at baseline, whether MI is delivered face-to-face or whether MI fidelity monitoring takes place. \u2022 Higher intensity MI may increase smoking cessation rates relative to lower intensity MI, however, due to risks of bias in the existing studies, further research could strengthen or weaken this effect."

      "text": "\u2022 Greater clarity and consistency of study methods, components and counselling techniques would improve comparability between trials. \u2022 Trials should aim to reduce confounding by minimising the number of co-interventions when testing MI, and where cointerventions are used, match these in the comparator arm. \u2022 Future studies of MI should aim to maximise the fidelity to MI, consider independent monitoring of the fidelity of intervention delivery, and report these data. Standardising methods used to monitor fidelity would allow easier comparisons across studies. \u2022 Future research should attempt to identify which core components of the motivational interviewing approach successfully help people to quit smoking, and whether modifying them enhances or reduces the likelihood of quitting. \u2022 Future studies should monitor the well-being of participants throughout the study and at follow-up, reporting results by trial arm, to investigate whether MI for smoking cessation improves the well-being of smokers attempting to quit. \u2022 Trialists should consider testing the effects of baseline motivation to quit when investigating MI interventions and recruiting participants where motivation could benefit from improvement.

Participants received the counselling over six 20-minute sessions (three in-person visits and three telephone calls). During HE sessions, trained counsellors used the 'KIS II Quit Smoking Guide' (a 36-page booklet developed for African-American light smokers) and semi-structured scripts to review the addictive nature of nicotine, health consequences of smoking and benefits of quitting, and provided concrete strategies on developing a quit plan and identifying alternatives against triggers to smoke. Participants were provided with an eight-week supply of 2 mg nicotine gum.\n\nControl 2: Health Education plus placebo gum (HE + PG): As control 1, however participants received placebo gum rather than 2 mg nicotine gum.\n\nIntervention 1: Motivational Interviewing plus 2 mg nicotine gum (MI + NG): MI counselling was provided by trained counsellors over six 20-minute sessions (three in-person visits and three telephone calls).\n\nCounsellors followed semi-structured scripts that explored the pros and cons of smoking/quitting, and motivation and confidence to quit. A values clarification strategy based on the work of Miller & Rollnick was used. Participants also received the 36-page 'KIS II Quit Smoking Guide'.\n\nIntervention 2: Motivational Interviewing plus placebo gum (MI + PG): As intervention 1, however participants received placebo gum rather than 2 mg nicotine gum.\n\nProvider: trained counsellors (counsellors participated in two days of in-service training). All counsellors participated in weekly group supervision to ensure the integrity of the respective counselling protocols.\n\nIntensity: counselling took place during six 20-minute sessions (3 face-to-face and 3 telephone) over 16 weeks in all study arms.\n\nWas MI fidelity monitored?: Yes. Each session was tape-recorded to maintain fidelity and consistency throughout the study. A subset of audiotapes were rated by investigators for adherence to MI principles using a modified version of the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (results not reported). MI counsellors and supervisors reviewed audiotapes and discussed current issues at their weekly meetings."

To ensure HE was distinct from MI, counsellors followed a script and presented information via a computer during in-person visits.\n\nIntervention 1: Motivational Interviewing (MI): \"The MI sessions were unscripted and counselors used the style (e.g. empathic, collaborative, and autonomy-supportive) and methods (e.g. open-ended questions, affirmations, and reflections) of MI. Counselors encouraged patient engagement in the conversation by exploring patient ambivalence regarding smoking cessation; developing discrepancy between the client's goals/values (e.g. health) and current behaviors (i.e. smoking); and increasing \"change talk\" while avoiding arguing or disputing \"sustain talk.\" Provision of information was minimized and offered only when judged necessary. For participants who expressed an interest in quitting, the MI counselor worked to strengthen the commitment for change and used an MI style to complete the guideline-based quit plan and follow-up sessions as described above.\"\n\nAll participants who expressed any interest in quitting were offered a self-help guide and, for those who set a quit date, free pharmacotherapy (varenicline and NRT offered)\n\nProvider: counsellors Intensity: four sessions over a 6-month period Was MI fidelity monitored?: \"Each counselor delivered all three treatments. This avoided confounding counselor and treatment effects.\n\nTo prevent treatment contamination, the HE and BA arms were scripted and stringent measures were implemented to ensure fidelity. Training, practice, and supervision for each of the interventions continued until counselors met fidelity criteria for three consecutive sessions (training hours per counselor were 96 for MI and 28.5 for HE). Counselors then began counseling enrolled participants and received regular group supervision of a randomly selected recent audio recording from separate expert clinicians for each of the interventions (weekly for MI, every other week for HE, and monthly for BA). Study-specific rating scales were completed to verify fidelity. To verify treatment integrity, the duration of sessions was assessed and randomly selected 10% of regular sessions (i.e. excluding quit plans and follow-ups) for evaluation (38 MI and 37 HE), using the MI Treatment Integrity Code by an independent expert coding group blind to group assignment. The Code yields ratings of counselor adherence to MI, including overall ratings of the session (e.g. expression of empathy) and behavior counts (e.g. frequency of open-ended questions).\" Outcomes Definition of cessation used: 7-day point prevalence Length of longest follow-up: 6 months Validation: saliva cotinine Was mental health and/or well-being measured at follow-up?: no Was quality of life measured at follow-up?: no Funding source \"This study was supported by a grant (R01 CA133068) from NIH, National Cancer Institute.

An interaction between the MI and nicotine gum factor was reported by the authors. Rather than exclude data from this trial from analyses, which we believe would introduce bias we accounted for the risk of bias potentially introduced by this interaction in our 'Risk of bias assessment' below and carried out sensitivity analyses removing it from analyses alongside other studies judged to be at high risk of bias.\n\nFor the MI versus no treatment analyses, we compared the one study arm with MI and no other smoking cessation treatment (behavioural reduction, gum and patch) to the one study arm with no MI and no other smoking cessation treatment. For the analyses comparing MI plus other SC treatment to other treatment alone, we compared any study arms receiving MI plus reduction and/or nicotine gum, and/ or nicotine patch to study arms receiving reduction, and/or nicotine gum, and/or nicotine patch with no MI. For the analyses comparing MI to another form of smoking cessation treatment, we compared the one study arm receiving MI and no other smoking cessation treatment (behavioural reduction, gum and patch) to all study arms receiving reduction and/or nicotine gum, and/or nicotine patch.\n\nWhere relevant (analyses 2 and 3), we have ensured that study arms that received nicotine gum have been entered into analyses separately to study arms that did not receive nicotine gum."

The first 3 sessions occurred approximately every other week following baseline and the fourth approximately 4 weeks after session 3. Sessions were typically 20 to 30 mins. For students who became motivated to change during the sessions, counsellors used a MI style to follow the outline of a 'plan module' in which cognitive-behavioural principles were used to develop a change plan. A selfhelp guide on quitting was also given to participants.\n\nAll students who smoked at a high level were encouraged to use pharmacotherapy obtainable through the university and other resources.\n\nProvider: clinical or counselling psychology students (counsellors)\n\nIntensity: 4 x 20 to 30-min sessions over 7 weeks Was MI fidelity monitored?: \"We assessed fidelity to MI using supervisors' rating of counselors' in-session proficiency on 18 items, including reflective listening, asking permission, and MI spirit, used in prior studies\".

Intervention: MI: explored the meaning of smoking in participants' lives, the positives and negatives of smoking/quitting, the impact of smoking on self-concept, health goals, and identification of obstacles to goal attainment. The intervention included information only where relevant to the participant's direct experiences (e.g. effects of smoking on respiration if breathlessness in sport was reported).

In the last session there was discussion addressing the transition away from the contingency payments provided in the study.\n\nControl 2: brief advice with contingency vouchers: as control 1, however the payments participants could earn were awarded for providing reduced CO breath samples rather than just for providing samples.\n\nIntervention 1: motivational interviewing with non contingent vouchers: As control 1, however participants received motivational interviewing rather than the brief advice intervention. \"The initial session (45 minutes) involved discussing pros and cons of smoking, the health risks associated with their carbon monoxide (CO) level, the costs of smoking relative to their income, their smoking rate compared to state and national norms, the relationship of smoking to alcohol use and to sobriety, and their barriers to change with corrective information (since more barriers are associated with lower motivation). Patients chose goals and methods from a menu of suggestions, and were provided with their choice of a variety of smoking cessation pamphlets. At additional sessions at 7, 14 and 19 days after the first session (15-30 minutes each), patients were asked about progress toward their own stated goals, barriers and ways to overcome barriers, successes (focussing on self-efficacy), and revised goal preferences.\"\n\nIntervention 2: motivational interviewing with contingency vouchers: as control 2, however participants received motivational interviewing rather than the brief advice intervention.\n\nAll participants received free access to NRT (patch or gum), smoking cessation pamphlets and hard candy."

First, each telephone call will include an initial period of engagement. Then, motivation and confidence to change smoking behavior will be assessed separately using scales from 1 (not at all motivated/confident) to 10 (extremely motivated/confident). Next, the counsellor will focus the discussion using the \"5Rs\" to increase the participants' motivation for change and eventual odds of cessation. The 5Rs will provide opportunities to elicit information from participants. At the end of each session, a summary of the discussion will be provided, and motivation and confidence to change smoking behavior will, again, be assessed. Should the participant wish to quit at any point during the sessions, the interventionist may assist in creating a participant-centred cessation plan, but no specific skills will be provided in this condition (e.g. \"it seems like distraction and exercise could help you quit\").
