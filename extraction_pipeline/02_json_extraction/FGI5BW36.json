      "title": "GAPS IN CLINICAL INTEGRATION",
      "text": "Lack of integration can affect the effectiveness of DHTs, particularly in the postmarket phase. The tendency for each new \"app\" to exist as a standalone product or point solution without integration into a coherent base of technologies or unified applicably at the point of care creates an enormous barrier to uptake and leads to skepticism among clinicians, health systems, and payers. Many stand-alone DHTs may be unlikely to provide definitive diagnostic information or be comprehensive enough to provide holistic disease monitoring. There is a vast plethora of apps or DHTs that do not operate on a unified platform.\n\nIndeed, developers often build solutions that are wholly incompatible with current data standards in health care such as HL7 or Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. Integration into existing clinical workflows is specifically complex and involves entire technology stacks, including hardware, software, and networking components, to meet the specific needs of the clinical workflow. Therefore, specific data integration tools may be needed to optimize communication between and among DHTs and other consumer-oriented tools or to enable a clinical team to make use of disparate data sources, formats, and standards. Application programming interfaces may be needed between different software applications to enable data exchange. Remote devices, such as remote patient monitoring tools, may use an entire telecommunications infrastructure including broadband, Wi-Fi connectivity, and mobile communications to support reliable data communication. Secure cloud computing platforms may be important for storing data or running real time analytics such as in clinical decision support tools. INTEGRATION AMONG CONSUMER TECHNOLOGIES, MEDICAL DEVICES, AND AI. Consumer technologies such as smart watches and exercise monitors have become more sophisticated. Many products are moving into FDA-regulated areas like detecting cardiac rhythms as \"hybrid\" applications in which medical software intended for clinical applications are added to a consumer product. Combining data collected by these devices with other data from the patient could produce better longitudinal insights.\n\nThis development approach, however, has led to preferential adoption by consumers with higher levels of income and health literacy. Although usability, as assessed through metrics such as net promoter score, is critical for the scaled effectiveness of DHTs, it would be optimal if this was paired with evidence of a beneficial effect on health outcomes if applicable to the use case.\n\nAdditionally, AI holds the promise of integrating disparate data from such consumer products and presenting it back to people using systems like large language models (LLMs). As AI is built into both consumer and medical applications, a major thrust will almost certainly be to provide users and clinicians with comprehensive information to enable actions that could lead to better health outcomes.\n\nAlthough such a technology is yet to be fully developed or authorized to go to market, LLM-wearable integration has been shown to be capable of developing a closed-loop coaching and feedback system.  13 w individual DHTs will be integrated into this more comprehensive information source remains to be determined. Optimizing human-machine integration and interfacing will also be needed to mitigate emergent risks associated with LLMs (eg, data drift, hallucinations, and systematic bias)."

      "title": "DEVELOPING A VALUE PROPOSITION FOR DHTs",
      "text": "The prime deficiency of most DHTs is a lack of evidence showing their use leads to health benefits for patients, improved care management for clinicians, and economic value to payers. Careful testing and validation has been used for decades by manufacturers of drugs, devices, and biologics, resulting in great success for manufacturers, the health system, payers, and the public. This results in an ecosystem wherein manufacturers have incentive to innovate, and health systems, payers, and the public rely on the system of evaluation. The system is built on the blueprint that investment in research and development to produce reliable evidence that benefits outweigh risks will yield attractive return on investment. This construct has not been fully realized for DHTs.\n\nThe first step in DHT development remains analytical validation: does the technology reliably, reproducibly, and accurately, perform as intended (Figure  2 )? For DHTs, protocols for data drift, safety, security, and privacy could be carefully considered and implemented. It is important for DHTs to be tested at an early stage with their intended users (ie, patients, clinicians, or both) for usability and accessibility.\n\nOne means by which developers can increase the accessibility, particularly among disadvantaged groups, is leveraging existing frameworks to optimize implementation of DHTs for cardiometabolic disease. 17 Factors that increase patient engagement with DHTs include a credible source of health information, social support, prompts and cues, graded tasks, goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, human coaching, and personalization components.  18 dressing these digital determinants of health is likely to improve the probability of success if the approach is a core tenet of development rather than an afterthought.\n\nDHTs may also be challenging to integrate into diagnostic or therapeutic protocols given the newness of these tools.

One important goal is ensuring that the DHT user interface is designed to minimize errors.\n\nTo facilitate better integration of DHTs in the patient's home environment, the FDA is helping support the development of user friendly and effective platforms with its \"Home as a Healthcare Hub\" initiative.  19 Using intentional architectural design and virtual reality technology, the initiative will produce models that can inform integrating technology with the physical environment to maintain and improve health. This project could help stimulate the industry into developing approaches, possibly including common interchangeable platforms, that present data and information to patients and clinicians in a manner that is attractive, integrated, and includes coherent, project led by NASA.  24 Before this project, the airplane cockpit was loaded with independent instruments that required considerable pilot concentration to integrate their outputs while flying the plane. This project, built on user experience and human factors studies with pilots, led to the conversion to integrated digital instruments arranged to optimize the pilot's ability to safely fly the plane.\n\nLast, clinicians and health systems will need to play a central role in postmarket monitoring and evaluation, which is critical to continually optimize technology as it is introduced into clinical practice.\n\nAn important attribute of AI clinical algorithms, especially using generative AI, is that they are highly dependent on context of use, therefore necessitating FDA Perspective on Digital Health Technologies recurrent assessment of their operating characteristics. This is true of algorithms that are intended to predict outcomes, motivate healthy behaviors, or improve health outcomes. As with the initial studies needed to market a DHT, if the tool is updated using only data from adherent populations, it will lead to biased algorithms that will likely increase disparities and may not improve outcomes. The technology industry, in close collaboration with health systems and clinicians, needs to lead postmarket monitoring to allow DHTs to continue to improve in practice."

      "text": "The FDA continues to attempt to stimulate a positive environment for the development of DHTs for the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, such as cardiometabolic disease. However, the FDA is one part of the entire ecosystem that will need to collectively step up to ensure that DHTs that lead to improved clinical outcomes are developed, tested, and integrated into the health care system in a manner that enables them to serve as vital instruments to prevent and manage cardiometabolic disease. We also believe strengthening the DHT evidence base and improving clinical integration could increase payor coverage and patient access. Payers might consider guiding manufacturers by developing and sharing minimum evidentiary standards for coverage consideration. These steps are essential for DHTs to move beyond consumer-oriented applications to becoming instruments that substantively contribute better health outcomes for the public."

Class 3 devices are subject to premarket approval, which is the most stringent type of premarket submission.

      "text": "Perspective on Digital Health Technologies adoption of these technologies, going beyond what might be necessary for FDA authorization for a particular intended use. GAPS IN EVIDENCE A major limitation inhibiting widespread adoption of DHTs is the lack of evidence of a causal link between recommendations to use particular DHTs, actual use, and improved clinical outcomes in the population for whom the DHT is recommended. Although studies have shown that the detection of cardiometabolic disease by DHTs can be successfully validated relative to measures like blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c, it remains unclear whether their use makes a difference in the clinical status of those exposed to the DHTs. Even for traditional measures of cardiometabolic disease, it has not been definitively demonstrated whether the conceptual advantage of monitoring more continuously with particular DHTs actually improves long-term outcomes or just adds more measurements without a link to effective behavior change. There is also uncertainty about whether benefits observed from providing access to a DHT could be largely attributable to the \"healthy adherer\" effect in which those who adhere to use of DHTs have lower baseline risk or have a propensity for behavioral adherence, a characteristic that has been shown to lead to better outcomes even with placebo. 8 In contrast, those who need intervention the most may not be impacted or may deteriorate simply because they are unable to use the technology effectively. Engagement with DHTs developed for cardiometabolic disease is particularly important because many rely on changing behaviors and lifestyle. Of 4 high-quality, randomized, controlled trials for digital interventions targeting behavior change in patients with diabetes included in a systematic review, only 1 showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c. 9,10 Widespread adoption of DHTs for the screening and detection of cardiometabolic disease without linkage to interventions that improve outcomes could result in overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased expenditures without improvement in health. The long and complicated history of CGMs provides an example of a DHT now beginning to achieve successful adoption, including through completion of both technology development and evidence generation steps needed to meet criteria for clinical practice guideline recommendation and reimbursement."

A recent meta-analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes included 26 randomized controlled trials and found a modest reduction in HbA1c for participants randomized to either continuous or intermittently scanned glucose monitors. 11 Recently, interoperable components have also been developed and authorized by the FDA, including an open-access, patient-led automated insulin delivery algorithm. 12 However, even with CGMs, gaps remain; the same meta-analysis did not show improvement in key measurements like weight, lipids, and blood pressure, with few trials at low risk of bias or lasting more than 6 months. As CGMs become more sophisticated, the variety of potentially useful measurements they make far exceed the evidence of their value. Further, the connection of CGMs to behavioral change, while promising, remains short of needed evidence for broader adoption. Last, evidence generation for DHTs has often been limited by gaps in attention to details of measurement and basic tenets of clinical research. Issues pertaining to artifact, missing data, and operating characteristics of algorithms remain in need of further development. For many DHTs intended to stimulate positive health behaviors, significant periods of missingness and artifact could lead to errors with health consequences."

Once integrated, it is important for DHTs to be validated using sufficiently large cohorts of patients that represent the diversity of the population for whom the DHT is intended in relevant clinical settings. Longitudinal follow-up and outcome assessment of cohorts can establish the predictive validity of digital biomarkers, and the therapeutic potential of DHT-derived treatments. Although cohorts like those of the Health eHeart study are promising, 20 the majority of DHTs have not yet been evaluated in these types of studies. Large simple randomized controlled trials with complete follow-up of the entire cohort including those who do and do not adhere can be areliable means to answer questions about efficacy.Because studies showing better outcomes in those who adhere do not answer the fundamental question as to whether the DHT has a causal effect on better outcomes, studies using the intention-to-treat principle with complete follow-up of those who \"drop out\" are necessary to determine whether recommending a specific DHT causes an improvement in clinical outcomes.THE ROLE OF CLINICIANS AND HEALTH SYSTEMSClinicians can play critical roles in ensuring DHTs are designed and tested in ways that streamline clinical workflows and ensure best outcomes for patients.One barrier to clinician engagement has been lack of reimbursement pathways for these technologies in clinical practice. The recent proposed revision of the physician fee schedule rule by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid includes codes for DHTs for mental health, including payment for time allocation to assist the patient in dealing with the DHT. 21 Further, the American Medical Association recently updated CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes to include digital therapeutic interventions for remote therapeutic monitoring, and revised codes to include device supply for data access or data transmissions to support remote monitoring of patients. 22 Improved evidence generation and the demonstration of costeffectiveness is also likely to facilitate greater payor coverage. Some manufacturers are taking the lead in designing rigorous studies for DHTs, such as a phase 3 sham controlled trial of an app providing behavioral therapy for patients with fibromyalgia, which showed significant benefit vs the sham control app. 23  Clinician adoption may be improved through user experience testing and user-friendly design specifically within the context of highly complex clinical workflows. This involves manufacturers working in concert with clinicians, patients, and health systems, not only in pilot testing and deployment, but as early as ideation and product wireframing. Health systems too can work toward implementing a workflow that allows for integration of DHTs and considers the wide array of clinical touchpoints involved in long-term patient care. To ensure that DHTs are integrated into clinical workflows, and digitally derived endpoints are appropriately validated, it will be essential to integrate health systems into the development process, including by linking to the electronic health record. Although challenges related to data standardization remain, the increasing consensus about the critical adoption of data standards based in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources could accelerate the integration of DHTs with electronic health record data. Manufacturers need to work with patients and clinicians to develop coherent platforms that reduce friction and disconnection among different DHTs, the patient, their caregivers, and the clinical team. Mitigation strategies could resemble the \"glass cockpit\""
