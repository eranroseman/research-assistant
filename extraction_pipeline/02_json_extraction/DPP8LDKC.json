  "title": "Usability and Utility of a Mobile App to Improve Medication Adherence Among Ambulatory Care Patients in Malaysia: Qualitative Study",
  "abstract": "Background: To date, several medication adherence apps have been developed. However, the existing apps have been developed without involving relevant stakeholders and were not subjected to mobile health app guidelines. In addition, the usability and utility of these apps have not been tested with end users. Objective: This study aimed to describe the usability and utility testing of a newly developed medication adherence app-Med Assist-among ambulatory care patients in Malaysia. \n Methods: The Med Assist app was developed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Nielson usability model. Beta testing was conducted from March to May 2016 at a primary care clinic in Kuala Lumpur. Ambulatory care patients who scored \u226540% on the electronic health literacy scale, were aged \u226521 years, and were taking two or more long-term medications were recruited. Two rounds of in-depth interviews were conducted with each participant. The first interview, which was conducted upon participant recruitment, was to assess the usability of Med Assist. Participants were asked to download Med Assist on their phone and perform two tasks (register themselves on Med Assist and enter at least one medication). Participants were encouraged to \"concurrently think aloud\" when using Med Assist, while nonverbal cues were observed and recorded. The participants were then invited for a second interview (conducted \u22657 days after the first interview) to assess the utility of Med Assist after using the app for 1 week. This was done using \"retrospective probing\" based on a topic guide developed for utilities that could improve medication adherence. Results: Usability and utility testing was performed for the Med Assist app (version P4). A total of 13 participants were recruited (6 men, 7 women) for beta testing. Three themes emerged from the usability testing, while three themes emerged from the utility testing. From the usability testing, participants found Med Assist easy to use and user friendly, as they were able to complete the tasks given to them. However, the details required when adding a new medication were found to be confusing despite displaying information in a hierarchical order. Participants who were caregivers as well as patients found the multiple-user support and pill buddy utility useful. This suggests that Med Assist may improve the medication adherence of patients on multiple long-term medications. \n Conclusions: The usability and utility testing of Med Assist with end users made the app more patient centered in ambulatory care. From the usability testing, the overall design and layout of Med Assist were simple and user friendly enough for participants to navigate through the app and add a new medication. From the participants' perspectives, Med Assist was a useful and reliable tool with the potential to improve medication adherence. In addition, utilities such as multiple user support and a medication refill reminder encouraged improved medication management.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Medication adherence is defined as the \"extent to which a person's behaviour-taking medication, following diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider\"  [1] . Unintentional nonadherence to medications is an important issue that needs to be addressed among ambulatory care patients, as they are responsible for the procurement and correct administration of their own medication(s)  [2] . Nonadherence to medications not only affects patient clinical health outcome, but also patient safety, health care costs, and health care service utilization  [1] . In the United States, 50%-71% of ambulatory care patients have two or more chronic diseases, which increases their risk of medication administration errors  [3]  such as taking unauthorized medications, taking an extra dose or the wrong dose, taking medications at the wrong time or frequency, or omitting a dose  [4, 5] . The prevalence of nonadherence to long-term medications in developed countries ranged from 50% to 70%  [1, 3] , while in developing countries, the rate of nonadherence ranged from 40% to 80%  [1, 6, 7] . Studies in Malaysia reported that 47%-53% of patients were nonadherent  [8, 9] . Most errors that occur in ambulatory care setting are preventable  [10] , and medication administration-related errors represent the largest component of preventable medication errors  [11] . However, little is known about the extent of medication administration-related errors in the ambulatory care setting, as most studies were conducted in an inpatient setting  [1, 12, 13] .\n\nSeveral interventions have been developed to improve medication adherence and reduce medication administration-related errors  [14, 15] . However, these interventions have varying success rates. These interventions usually involve a health care professional (doctor, pharmacist, or nurse) in preparing the patient's pillbox, providing patient counselling and education  [16, 17] , simplifying the medication regime  [18] , involving the patient in shared decision making  [19] , or improving patient-provider communication  [14, 15] .\n\nIn recent years, mobile health (mHealth)-defined as \"medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants, and other wireless devices\"  [20] -has provided a new platform that could improve a patient's medication adherence  [21]  (defined as \"the extent to which a person's behaviour-taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes corresponds with the agreed recommendations from a health care provider\")  [1] . Mobile apps have the potential to improve medication adherence and management of medications  [22, 23]  through an active reminder system  [24] .\n\nTo date, several smartphone medication adherence apps have been developed  [25] . However, existing apps were developed without involving relevant stakeholders (such as health care professionals or patients)  [24, 26]  and were not subjected to mobile health app guidelines  [23, 27] . This may have resulted in some apps being \"sub-standard\"  [27] [28] [29] . Some existing apps are also commercial in nature, requiring a subscription fee; are available only in one operating software platform; or can only be used in countries where it was developed  [25] . Usability is defined as \"the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use\"  [30] . Utility is defined as the functionality of the app and how useful it is to users  [31] . To the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the usability and utility of a medication adherence app once it has been developed."

We decided to develop our own framework, as we wanted to incorporate both the usability and utility of Med Assist. Additionally, our framework also included factors that could affect medication adherence. The design of Med Assist was also based on the utilities requested by the steering committee (Table  1 ).

In-depth interviews were conducted so that we could explore the views of participants regarding the usability and utility of Med Assist when using it for the first time. We asked participants to \"concurrently think aloud,\" so that their impressions and difficulties encountered could be recorded on the tape recorder. We also supplemented this interview process by observing the participant and documenting these observations as field notes. This allowed us to understand if they encountered any difficulties and whether they liked or disliked the utility. In-depth interviews allowed us to focus on the individual, assist the individual in using Med Assist, and create an environment where the individual would be able to express his/her views without being influenced by others."

For those who agreed to participate, written informed consent was obtained. Participants were then asked to fill in the demographic form and the eHEALS.\n\nEach participant was interviewed twice. During the first interview, participants were encouraged to \"concurrently think aloud\"  [35] . This method was employed so that the \"first impression\" of using Med Assist would be captured  [35] . This enabled the researcher to capture any possible navigation issues that may arise from the end users' perspective. The researcher took detailed notes and observed for nonverbal cues during each interview. Facial expressions and body language that were portrayed subconsciously by the participants were noted down by the researcher. Participants were encouraged to voice their first impressions and opinions about the app  [36] .\n\nParticipants were \"probed retrospectively\" during the second interview  [35] . This was done by prompting participants with questions regarding the utilities of Med Assist. The researcher took detailed notes and observed for nonverbal cues.

Four transcripts were first coded using the interpretive-descriptive approach that was based on the Nielson usability model and the utility model. This was done independently from the research team. SC also referred to the field notes for reflections, facial cues, and body language observed during the interviews. The research team then met to discuss the coding of the transcripts. Any coding discrepancies were resolved through discussion until a consensus was reached. Coding of the transcripts was performed using NVIVO v10 (QSL International Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia).

      "text": "From this study, three themes emerged from the usability testing of Med Assist, while another two themes emerged from the utility testing of Med Assist. Med Assist was designed and developed using the waterfall lifecycle software model. This model comprised five phases: users' requirements, design, development of the software (Med Assist app), testing of the software app, and its release. The requirement phase was based on utilities that could improve medication adherence. This led to the design and development of Med Assist until the steering committee was satisfied with the prototype. The final prototype (version P4) was used for the beta testing of Med Assist. This paper focuses on the usability and utility (beta) testing of Med Assist where ambulatory care patients were recruited to use the app and provide feedback. Med Assist was designed for both iOS and android operating software systems. Med Assist was developed to be compatible with the technology (hardware and software) available in smart devices at the time of this study.\n\nThe steps to add a medication were simplified and displayed in a hierarchical order to prevent cognitive overload  [39] . However, some participants struggled when adding a new medication due to the complexity of this task. Data input into a small device is challenging, as it requires the user to navigate through the app on a small screen  [40] . In addition, the information displayed in a smaller screen device is crucial and needs to be in a hierarchical order  [41] . This will ensure that users are able to process information without being overloaded or losing navigational direction when using the app  [39, 41] . Despite the challenges encountered by patients, the process of adding a new medication \"manually\" benefited patients with regard to their medication knowledge. Participants had to \"learn\" the generic name of their medications, administration frequency, and the purpose of their medication. In Malaysia, mandatory generic substitution is practiced by all public hospitals. Hospital outpatient pharmacies are required to only dispense generic medications regardless of the brand prescribed. At the time of this study, there were no published studies that reported the findings on medication data entry in an adherence app. Further research needs to be performed to fill this gap, as complex data entry can deter users from using the app  [42] .\n\nThe terms used in a medication adherence app should be self-explanatory. Although health care providers were involved in the design of Med Assist, the terms used in Med Assist confused participants. The term \"timing\" confused participants, as they thought that they had to enter the time that they took their medications. \"Variable dosing\" was added to offer flexibility to patients who were prescribed medications with variable dosing (eg, metformin). Individuals with lower literacy may require assistance when encountering such complex terms. This may lead to incorrect medication data entry, which compromises patient safety, leading to medication error and increased health care service utilization such as hospitalization and costs. One solution to improve the usability of Med Assist would be to have a \"question mark icon\" over the term, so that users could tap on the icon, which would then provide a brief explanation. The simplicity of the icon needs to be recognizable at a glance  [43]  and improve the user's experience  [40] .\n\nTo our knowledge, no other study has reported the experiences of participants when using a medication adherence app. Participants also reported that the medication summary page, which was accessible through tapping on the medication icon on the homepage of Med Assist was useful, as it provided a concise overview of their medication details. This would further enhance the usability of Med Assist, as it would be more patient centered and more likely to be adopted.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that behavioral change is achievable through active reminders, which reinforces the benefits of medication adherence apps  [24, 44] . A review in 2016 found that only 56% of medication adherence apps accommodate flexible scheduling for medication reminders  [29] . Medication reminders with flexible scheduling (where users may opt for alternate days or weekly medication reminders) allows for personalization of the app to suit their individual needs. Participants also reported that they had a better understanding of the medication regime frequency and the indication of the medication, which appeared on the alarm reminder, thereby improving their medication knowledge. Improved patient knowledge is known to improve medication adherence and patient clinical health outcome  [45] . However, areas involving strategies to improve patients' medication knowledge requires further research  [45, 46] . Another useful utility was the multiple user support. Participants who were caregivers found this utility useful, as they were able to keep a separate profile and individualized a patient's medication regime on the profile without affecting their own medication regime.\n\nA review on mHealth apps found that most apps were based on a one-way reminder system (which sent reminders to users to take their medications)  [32] . Med Assist offers a \"snooze option,\" which allowed users who were unable to take their medications at that point of time to take their medications later (ie, a two-way alarm reminder system). Med Assist required users to acknowledge the reminder that, theoretically, would make users more conscious of their adherence to their medications  [32] . The medication alarm reminder actively prompted participants to take their medications correctly and on time. However, users who were aware of the adherence scoring system missed acknowledgement on the medication reminder. This resulted in their low adherence scores.\n\nThe adherence score serves as a gamification process (a process where the user is rewarded upon achieving the goal of the app)  [47] , which engaged users. Participants who knew about this feature were pleased that they were able to keep track of their adherence to their medication regime. A study on the design of an mHealth app for type 1 diabetes found that engaging users through a gamification process improved patient mediation adherence behavior  [48] .\n\nIn the Asian community, it is common for working adults to look after their elderly parents  [49] . For younger individuals who still live with their elderly parents, the multiple user support function was a utility that enabled a separate profile to be created in addition to the patient's own profile. Many working adults migrate to bigger cities to seek employment. Therefore, being present physically to ensure that their parents take their medications becomes difficult  [50] . The pill buddy system allowed individuals to remotely check on their elderly parents' medication adherence behavior. Although external monitoring utilities such as multiple user support and pill buddy system enable a third party to be more involved in patient care, a review in 2018 found that such functions were underutilized  [46] . Future research could assess the external monitoring utilities, as they have the potential of improving patient medication adherence and its impact on patient clinical outcome."

      "text": "This study used a two-phase in-depth interview for the data collection process, which allowed us to explore patients' and caregivers' experience and perspectives in using the app for the first time and its utility after a period of using the app. To the best of our knowledge, no other medication adherence apps have conducted a similar study  [46] . The usability and utility testing of Med Assist allowed us to understand the needs of ambulatory care patients and caregivers better and tailor Med Assist to suit their needs. This ensured that Med Assist would be a more patient-centered app and more likely to be used  [31] .\n\nIn addition, the wide demographic range of participants of this study provided experiences of both young and old users.\n\nThe generalizability of this study is limited by the use of a local hospital medication database. Although this simplified the entry of new medications into Med Assist (as a drop-down menu would appear and link to the indication of the medication), it limited the use of Med Assist to the local health care setting. There were several utilities of Med Assist that were not explored due to the short period between the two-phased in-depth interviews, such as medication refill reminders and the option to email health care professionals (ie, doctor, pharmacist). Future studies should have a longer time frame between the usability and utility testing to fully explore end users' perspectives and experiences when using a medication adherence app. All participants recruited were from Kuala Lumpur (ie, a major city in Malaysia). A wider participant recruitment process should be carried out to explore the experiences and perspectives of rural end users. Due to time constraints, we were unable to incorporate the perspectives of the users in beta testing to modify Med Assist and retest Med Assist before progressing to the release phase."

      "text": "Our study found that the overall design and layout of Med Assist was simple and user friendly enough for participants to navigate and complete certain tasks. However, the process of adding a new medication was confusing for some participants and may require assistance features; The flexible medication alarm reminder and pill buddy system encouraged a positive change in patients' medication adherence behavior. In addition, participants reported that the multiple user support and medication refill reminder encouraged better medication management. Our study suggests that Med Assist could aid ambulatory patients who are on long-term medications to improve medication adherence through active reminders."
