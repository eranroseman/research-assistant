  "title": "How Penn Medicine Reimagined Breast Reconstruction, Shifting the Balance of Postoperative Care from Clinic to Home",
  "abstract": "In June 2019, Penn Medicine launched the Connected Approach to Recovery (CARe) program within the autologous breast reconstruction patient population. CARe demonstrated that outpatient postoperative specialty care, including the removal of surgical drains, could be delivered safely via a digitally enabled home-based strategy that shifted the balance of care from the clinic to the home in the first 30 days following discharge. This program challenged a long-standing status quo that required patients to commute to and from the clinic for drain management and removal. High patient satisfaction scores reflected not only this convenience, but also a design that reimagined the delivery of education and clinical services while ensuring a more patient-centric return to independence. CARe, which, in a Covid-19 environment allowed patients to reliably receive uninterrupted postoperative care safely in their homes, has been expanded to additional surgical patient populations across multiple hospitals and home health agencies. \n KEY TAKEAWAYS \u00bb Continually seek opportunities to reimagine care for higher value, not volume. Embrace value-based payment contexts as ripe environments for innovation and transformation. Eliminating clinic visits, for example, which could face resistance in a fee-for-service model, can be supported readily under a global payment model.",

Typically, the process of scheduling a visit for surgical drain removal, involving clinician verification and multiple phone calls, is cumbersome from a patient perspective. In addition to the physical demands of attending an inperson clinic visit, patients, and the support network they engage for assistance, are faced with the logistical burdens associated with commuting to a busy metropolitan area; such barriers include travel time, parking at and navigation of complex academic centers, time away from work, clinic delays, and managing family responsibilities.\n\nPenn Medicine is a Philadelphia-based academic medical center that includes six acute care hospitals and hundreds of outpatient locations throughout the region, which includes southeast Pennsylvania and southwest New Jersey.

In the spring of 2019, a frontline PRS resident physician identified and alerted his leadership to the oft-unrecognized and significant patient burden and the specialty resources required to safely manage patients postoperatively via their traditional high-touch clinic-based care paradigm. The PRS resident and his leadership team simultaneously recognized an increasing patient demand for alternative digital modalities to communicate with their clinicians and for remote care. To better serve their patient population, the PRS team needed and wanted to transform their care model. PRS was concerned that incremental change, such as making the scheduling process and the visits themselves more efficient, would not address the fundamental shortcomings of the patient's recovery experience under the status quo. As such, PRS engaged Penn Medicine's Center for Digital Health via their health system-wide call for proposals and, together, sought to adopt a transformative approach under the value-based global payment model, which discounts volume in favor of outcomes."

In addition to the physical, financial, and logistical complexities, our diverse patient population encounters challenges associated with health literacy and numeracy when caring for multiple surgical drains following a major surgery. The traditional approach of upfront education in the preoperative setting can be overwhelming and discordant under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines,  8  given all the new information the patient must process in preparation for this major surgery. Moreover, we recognized that, in the traditional model of care, the identification and support of struggling patients is often delayed and heavily reliant on the patient to self-identify their need."

      "text": "Through our in-depth assessment of the stakeholders and processes that make up a patient's recovery, we noted a significant imbalance in responsibility across clinic nurses and home health nurses. The clinic retained the majority of high-touch responsibility, despite being stretched for staff and at capacity for procedures. As a result, questions, and even routine wound care, in addition to specialty procedures such as drain removals, were being routed back to the clinic. Home health care workers played a limited role despite their ability to do more under their scope of practice, and they struggled to connect with patients meaningfully given this heavy dependence on the specialty clinic team.\n\nOur team posited that clinic visits that were primarily registered nurse-and advanced practice practitioner-driven for outpatient drain removal could be eliminated if, instead, the removals could be incorporated into the home health nursing visits that were already occurring. Recognizing that clinic drain removal visits also served as critical touchpoints for postoperative education, routine wound checks, symptom management, and relationship building, our team engaged key clinical and operational leaders from both PRS and home health at the outset in challenging the longstanding status quo as we began incorporating those elements into the design of a coordinated home-based recovery model.\n\n\"\n\nWe initially believed that traditional drain education, care, management, and removal were fairly simple matters for patients to handle; however, as we embarked on this redesign effort, we found that it can be quite the opposite for patients, clinicians, and staff in the postoperative setting.\"\n\nTo transition drain removal from the clinic to the home, we first had to make all stakeholders comfortable with this fundamental shift in responsibility. Surgeons worried that a shift in care might result in early drain removals, leading to increased seroma formation and risk of infection. They also raised concerns that patients would be dissatisfied with their decreased clinic-based touchpoints and have their overall experience negatively impacted. The home health team, too, worried about the level of support that would be required to ensure the proper training of their staff."

Additionally, the team supplemented the training with robust clinical protocols, safety checklists, and clear escalation parameters to ensure that home health nurses would have the expertise and confidence required to provide the same reassurance and guidance being delivered during the traditional clinic visits. This training has since been incorporated into standard onboarding and training procedures for new nursing hires. Leveraging our \"learning fast at low cost\" innovation methodology, our team also designed silicone anatomical models, using material from the hardware store, to help nurses build confidence quickly by practicing simulated drain removal.\n\nTo further alleviate concerns about disrupting the long-standing care paradigm, we created temporary supervisory redundancies during the training sessions and home drain removal visits by involving both surgical and home health clinicians in the initial rollout. In the same vein, the home health team first engaged their specialized WOCN-certified nursing team to perform separate home drain removal visits, supplementing their existing home health nursing visits. This led to an initial increase in overall home health nursing visits, which is expected to dissipate over time as our home health team fully cross-trains its direct care registered nurse workforce next, followed by its licensed practical nurse workforce. By defining and then regularly sharing key performance indicators showing uncompromising patient experience and clinical outcomes (e.g., seroma formation, ED visits, and readmissions), the team was able to reassure and further engage both leadership and frontline clinical stakeholders in adopting the Connected Approach to Recovery (CARe) program as the default pathway for patients who undergo free flap reconstruction and are receiving home health services. The balanced and coordinated partnership allowed both PRS and home health to present themselves as a united front, ensuring that gains in patient care, experience, and relationship-building were shared."

      "text": "Because of complexities in both tracking outputs from multiple drains and the removal criteria, the traditional scheduling process for drain removal visits requires multiple phone calls, including one from a clinician for output verification. In prior years, PRS had tried to incrementally improve the process by removing this clinician verification step altogether but noted it led to an uptick in premature visits and understandably frustrated patients. A key challenge in transitioning drain removal to the home would be to decrease this friction, which benefits both the patient and the home health care team, because the latter did not have the resources to support this traditional clinic-based scheduling and verification workflow.\n\nNotably, the removal criteria and verification process were algorithmic and prime for automation. We designed a program using automated text messages to help patients report their total drain outputs, on a daily basis, as a supplement to their paper-based drain log used to capture hourly outputs; the automated messages also serve to deliver just-in-time education via short text messages and links to clinical videos in concordance with recommended CDC best practices.  8 The program also validates patient responses in real time and allows home health schedulers to asynchronously schedule timely appointments when a patient's drain meets the criteria for\n\nNEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 10 NEJM Catalyst is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

The texting program is powered by Way to Health,  6, 7  an automated platform created in 2010 with National Institutes of Health funding to facilitate patient engagement strategies. All patients explicitly consented to text messaging, its associated fees (if any from their cellular service provider), and the novel CARe program. Examples of Text Message Modules from the Connected Approach to Recovery (CARe) Program The first and second images (left and middle) portray the just-in-time educational module that consenting patients start to receive the day following surgery; it provides guidance on the CARe program and links to timely video-based education and engaging patient education resources. The third image (right) portrays the drain output monitoring module; following discharge, patients receive daily text messages that prompt them to reply with their total number of drains in place and indicate whether any of them meet the criteria for removal. If the patient reports drains ready for removal, then they are subsequently asked to report the output volume over the last 2 days for their lowest outputting drain. The system validates the criteria and then automatically notifies home health schedulers, prompting them to respond directly to the patient with a confirmed date and assigned clinician for the drain removal.

Reflective of this feedback, the texting program was characterized by patient-friendly language, as well as playful emojis, in an effort to humanize the automated program. By starting with a \"fake backend\" 9 (i.e., initially sending texts to patients manually), our team was able to quickly pivot and update language and structure before fully automating the program. The team also recognized that despite its best efforts to simplify the protocol, a small minority of patients still exhibited some difficulty engaging with the automated messaging prompts. To help address this challenge, we iterated. We leveraged automated real-time notifications that monitor for consecutive nonresponsive check-ins and consecutive invalid replies that route directly back to the clinic's electronic medical record messaging portal for further triage. Depending on the nature of the issue, the clinical team now reaches out directly to the patient and/or engages home health to provide a more customized approach to education, support, and monitoring. Via this iteration, the texting program now facilitates early identification of patients experiencing difficulty with postoperative self-care responsibilities, whereas in the traditional setting, patients who are often struggling would not otherwise be identified until their clinic visit."

Debilitated by the multiple tentacles in placea term coined by patients to describe their numerous and cumbersome surgical drainspatients reported significant discomforts and challenges performing everyday tasks such as using a seat belt and showering. Often, only after the challenges arose postoperatively, patients would ask their care team questions like, \"How do I protect my surgical sites when I put on a seatbelt?\" or \"What do I do with my drains when I am in the shower?\" Many patients found themselves searching for and relying on guidance sourced from online forums, friends, and social media as they encountered these debilitating nonclinical challenges firsthand. Through extensive interviews with prior patients, we identified solutions to these challenges. We found that simple low-cost products, such as a shower drain bag holder that quickly dries and a wraparound seat belt pillow with hook-and-loop closure, could make the return to independence that much more manageable.\n\nWe then vetted the patient-sourced solutions with the specialty providers. In doing so, we implemented a patient-facing resource that allowed specialty clinicians to preemptively address the common, nonclinical recovery challenges that their patients encounter and then offer patient-and provider-approved solutions.\n\n\" Our team worked closely with patients with breast cancer and their support networks to understand the emotional and physical complexities impairing their return to independence so that we could design a model that went beyond the traditional scope of care.\"\n\nCATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 12 NEJM Catalyst is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

      "text": "In June 2019, for patients of the original three participating surgeons receiving Penn Medicine Home Health services, CARe became the default pathway for free flap breast reconstruction at a single hospital. Patients and/or providers were free to opt for the traditional clinic-based care model for any reason, but few did so. Fully 94% of patients (101 out 107) were enrolled in the CARe program, while just 2% of patients (two out of 107) were excluded because we did not yet have enough trained home care nurses for the patients' service area, and the opt-out reasons for the remaining 4% (four out of 107) were evenly distributed between individual provider and patient preference for clinic-based care. There were no reported cases of technical challenges or barriers as reasons for opt-out, and all patients possessed a valid mobile number on file.\n\nFollowing CARe's introduction and through October 2020, PRS saw a 58% decrease (3.1 vs. 1.3 [95% confidence intervals (CIs) 2.8, 3.4 and 1.1, 1.5]; pre-CARe introduction, n = 136; post-CARe introduction, n = 107) in mean PRS clinic visits per patient occurring within the first 30 days following discharge (Figure  5 ). We saw no significant changes in mean oncologic surgery visits per patient occurring within the first 30 days following discharge (0.55 vs. 0.56 [95% CIs 0.43, 0.67 and 0.42, 0.70]) for patients receiving concomitant care via an oncologic surgeon within our institution, alleviating the concern that fewer clinic visits in one specialty might lead to an uptick in another. Mean overall home health visits increased by 14% (8.6 vs. 9.8 [95% CIs 7.9, 9.3 and 8.9, 11]); an increase was anticipated given that the home health team initially engaged a subset of their trained nurses to perform drain removals separately from the standard postoperative home care visits. Over the past year, the home health team has begun to gradually and systematically cross-train their remaining nursing fleet to incorporate drain removal into the scope of a routine home care nursing visit. Patients also experienced a 60% reduction in mean estimated round-trip commuted miles (110 vs. 44 [95% CIs 92, 130 and 36, 53]) as measured using Google Maps' driving distances using recovery residence and clinic ZIP Codes. There were no significant differences in the age-and race-adjusted analysis of additional 30-day clinical outcomes including time to last drain removal, seroma formation, infected seromas, ED visits, and readmissions between pre-and post-CARe introduction groups. There were also no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, race, estimated median household income, financial class, and history of breast cancer or radiation. The study compared pre-CARe data from patients of the original three participating surgeons, who were"
