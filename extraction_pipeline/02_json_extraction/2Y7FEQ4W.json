  "title": "A meta-analysis of the use of electronic reminders for patient adherence to medication in chronic disease care",
  "abstract": "We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to January 2014 which evaluated the effects of electronic reminders on patient adherence to medication in chronic disease care. A random-effects model was used to pool the outcome data. Subgroup analyses were performed to examine a set of moderators. Data from 20 studies, representing 22 RCTs, were synthesized. Thirteen trials utilized short message service (SMS) reminders, three used pager reminders and six employed electronic alarm device-triggered reminders. The meta-analysis showed that the use of electronic reminders was associated with a significant, yet small, improvement in patient adherence to medication (pooled Cohen's d \u00bc 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.18, 0.41). The effect was sensitive to sample size, type of disease and intervention duration. The frequency and type of electronic reminders appeared to have no moderating effect on medication adherence. The use of electronic reminders seems to be a simple and potentially effective way of improving patient adherence to chronic medication. Future research should concern the optimum strategies for the design and implementation of electronic reminders, with which the effectiveness of the reminders is likely to be augmented.",

      "text": "Adherence to long-term treatment regimens is a prerequisite for effective chronic disease care. However, many patients, especially the chronically ill, encounter difficulties in adhering to recommended treatment regimens.  1 oor adherence and non-adherence to treatment regimens have long been a widely reported problem in various health conditions.  [2] [3] 3] [4] [5] [6]  Evidence shows that a quarter of patients in general do not adhere to their treatment regimens.  5 Treatment regimens, even if effective, are poorly implemented at the practical level, resulting in undertreated patients. In addition, low adherence is likely to compromise the effectiveness of medication treatment and consequently leads to poor health outcomes and waste of health care resources.  4, 7, 8 lthough there is a substantial literature on the development of psychological, behavioural or educational adherence-enhancing interventions, these interventions are less effective than expected,  9, 10  and are largely constrained by their heavy demands on time and labour, and by their limited coverage of patients. Another response to patients' poor adherence is the introduction of electronic reminders, which are automatically sent reminders without personal caregiver-patient contact in the delivery process.  11 The principles behind reminders can be explained by the behavioural learning theory,  12  which suggests that patients' non-adherent behaviours can be converted into adherent ones if the patients are sufficiently exposed to repeated external stimuli (e.g. reminders). In clinical practice, electronic reminders, such as short message service (SMS) reminders and electronic alarm device-triggered reminders, are used to prompt patients to follow medication recommendations due to their advantages of saving time and labour, and of being easily delivered to a wide range of patients.  13, 14 hile promising, results from previous reviews regarding the efficacy of electronic reminders are mixed.  11, 13, 15, 16 oreover, these reviews either failed to provide quantitative evidence regarding the effectiveness of electronic reminders;  11, 13, 15  or included a diverse range of health conditions (e.g. both chronic and non-chronic);  16  or based their results on a number of low quality studies.  15 he objective of the present study was to conduct a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed electronic reminders in chronic disease care and to determine their effects on patient adherence to medication."

Two adherence measures were reported in the trials and were coded for the meta-analysis: the proportion of medication taken as prescribed and the proportion of adherent patients. We adopted original definitions of adherent patients for trials that reported this measure.

For trials reporting multiple adherence measures, we chose the one more likely to be objective and reliable (e.g. assessed by electronic monitoring over pill count and self-report; continuous scale over dichotomized scale). This approach has been widely adopted in previous meta-analyses on patient adherence to medication.  9, 25 e also calculated an average effect size for each of these trials and used the average effect size in sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our effect size calculation method. The average effect size approach was also a widely accepted solution to guarantee the independence assumption in meta-analysis.  8, 19"

The effect of electronic reminders on patient adherence to medication did not change when we used average effect sizes for nine trials (eight studies)  11, 30, 31, 34, 37, 39, 40, 43  with multiple outcome measures (d \u00bc 0.28, 95% CI \u00bc 0.16, 0.39); when we excluded seven trials  29, 30, 36, 37, 40, 42, 46  with sample attrition rates of 20% or  more (d \u00bc 0.28, 95% CI \u00bc 0.15, 0.41; and when we excluded six trials (five studies)  29, 33, 36, 41, 44  with low study quality (d \u00bc 0.29, 95% CI \u00bc 0.15, 0.43). in our study was also similar to previously reported effect sizes in meta-analyses of psychological, behavioural or educational adherence-enhancing interventions, e.g. the study by Kahana et al. 10 (d \u00bc 0.34, 95% CI \u00bc 0.30, 0.38) and by Conn et al. 9 (d \u00bc 0.33, 95% CI \u00bc 0.22, 0.45).\n\nHowever, the small effect detected in our study, although significant, fell below the threshold of a clinically satisfactory improvement in medication adherence for the majority of the trials analysed. This may be because, as noted by Haynes et al.,  47  many chronically ill patients tend to consider their conditions incurable, thus being less motivated to persist in taking long-term medication. Therefore, further work is required to reinforce patients' belief in the efficacy of taking medication and to augment the effectiveness of the reminders in improving patient adherence to medication."

      "title": "Moderators on the use of electronic reminders",
      "text": "Subgroup analysis showed that the effect of electronic reminders was sensitive to sample size, type of disease and intervention duration, while the effect did not change with respect to age, type of outcome measure and type of outcome assessing method. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously, because of the small number of included studies, the associations among the moderators and the substantial heterogeneity within subgroups.\n\nThe trend towards a larger effect in small sample trials appeared to show a possible pattern of small sample trial effect, which suggests that small sample trials are more likely to detect larger intervention effects and are therefore more likely to be published.  48 In addition, this finding may confound the effect sizes in relation to other moderators. We noted that small sample trials contributed to a disproportionate number of trials examining patients with asthma (3 out of 4, 75%), and of trials with a short-term intervention duration (10 out of 14, 71%). Therefore, future studies should consider the interrelationship among the moderators when disentangling the moderating effects. Large sample size studies are also preferable in future evaluations of electronic reminders.\n\nOur analysis indicated a higher medication adherence for patients with asthma compared to patients with other types of diseases. However, it is not clear whether this effect was truly disease specific or due to other reasons, such as small sample trial effect. In addition, we noted that a larger proportion of trials on asthma delivered enhanced reminders, containing not only prompt tips for medication intake, but also educational messages about disease management and advice on behavioural change, compared with trials on other conditions (75% for asthma,  36, 40, 44  50% for cardiovascular diseases  37, 39  and diabetes,  32  and 20% for HIV  41  ). The enhanced reminders might also have contributed to the larger effect for patients with asthma. This suggests the possibility of combining electronic reminders with educational and behavioural interventions in order to produce greater benefit.\n\nThe finding that the effect of electronic reminders appeared to diminish over time echoed the conclusion of a previous review, which found only short-term effectiveness of the use of electronic reminders.  11 This has important clinical implications, since it is premature for any statement to be made about the long-term effectiveness of electronic reminders. However, this finding runs counter to our expectations. The primary purpose of reminders is to help patients take prescribed medication at the right time and to reinforce their adherent behaviours so that adherence to medication, in the long-term, can be a routine, or even a habituation in chronic disease care. Therefore, a long-term effect on medication adherence is probably an essential prerequisite for such behavioural changes, although it awaits confirmation in future studies.\n\nDesign and implementation strategies, such as the content, type, frequency and delivery time of electronic reminders, have been less investigated in previous reviews  11, 13, 15, 16  despite their potential importance in determining the efficacy of electronic reminders. In contrast, our study examined the type and frequency of reminders, but found no significant difference in medication adherence in relation to the two moderators. More research should be carried out to examine the under-investigated moderators so that electronic reminders can be better developed for and tailored to specific circumstances. However, it should be noted that reminders by SMS and alarm devices did show a trend towards better medication adherence compared to pagers. The use of pagers seems to have decreased, while SMS has become ubiquitous, and alarm devices are designed to be more user-friendly in home care environments. We speculate that SMS reminders are likely to confer more benefits to active mobile phone users, and alarm devices are probably preferable for house-bound patients.\n\nOur analysis did not find any discernible effect on medication adherence in relation to the type of outcome measure and type of outcome assessment method. Regarding the type of outcome measure, the proportion of adherent patients seems to be a more clinically meaningful measure in illustrating reminder effect compared with the proportion of medication taken as prescribed. This measure, however, is likely to underestimate the effect. For example, a patient could be labelled as non-adherent, because the improved adherence may still fail to attain the threshold of being defined as an adherent patient. For outcome assessing methods, previous studies have argued that selfreporting is likely to overestimate adherence compared with methods such as electronic monitoring and pharmacy dispensing records.  49, 50 However, this argument cannot be confirmed by our findings. Possible explanations may be that the number of trials in the subgroups was too small to detect a significant difference; and that the lack of sufficient data in the trials did not allow us to compare the outcome assessing methods within the trials. While the evidence regarding these moderating effects is unclear, future studies are recommended to incorporate the two outcome measures and multiple outcome assessing methods for adherence measurement when possible, to produce more data for further examination.\n\nElectronic reminders have advantages in timeliness and salience. They can be delivered or triggered at a specified time when patients need to act on medication regimens and in a way that the patients' attention can be attracted by them (e.g. by ringtones or alarms). However, electronic reminders in any form as adherence-enhancing strategies work only for unintentionally non-adherent patients, rather than for patients who ignore them. None of the trials reported that they had specifically examined unintentionally non-adherent patients. Therefore, the effect of electronic reminders detected in our study may have been underestimated due to the possible inclusion of both intentionally and unintentionally non-adherent patients."

      "text": "The present study has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to employ a meta-analysis to assess the effect of electronic reminders on medication adherence in chronic disease care. Second, we performed subgroup analyses in response to the between-study heterogeneity, and examined a set of moderators that have been little investigated previously but are critical to the design and implementation of the reminders. Finally, we tested the robustness of our results in sensitivity analyses with factors (i.e. study quality, attrition rate and effect size calculation method) that are likely to bias the results.\n\nHowever, the study also has a number of limitations. First, the small number of trials included placed limitations on the subgroup analyses, which means that the findings cannot be considered conclusive. Second, pooling different adherence measures may represent a methodological drawback, although we calculated Cohen's d to standardize these measures and pooled the effect sizes using an appropriate meta-analysis method. Third, several moderators examined in the subgroup analyses may be confounded with each other, so that their effects should be interpreted with full recognition of their interrelationship."

We found that electronic reminders, regardless of their types, were associated with a significant, yet small, improvement in patient adherence to medication, compared to non-use of reminders, with a pooled effect size of 0.29 (95% CI \u00bc 0.18, 0.41).\n\nThe meta-analysis result was consistent with findings of previous reviews,  11, 16  which showed favourable effects of electronic reminders.  11, 16 For example, Fenerty et al. found that technology-based reminder systems yielded a significantly higher treatment adherence rate compared with usual care (67% in reminder group versus 55% in control group) in various health conditions.  16 Vervloet et al. found that the use of electronic reminders appeared to lead to short-term effectiveness in increasing adherence to chronic medication.  11 The effect of electronic reminders"
