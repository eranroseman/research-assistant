      "text": "edentary aging is strongly associated with deleterious changes in cardiovascular function, including an increase in left ventricular (LV) stiffness.  1 Sedentary seniors have small stiff LVs, which are comparable to patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  2  In contrast, competitive Masters athletes have large, compliant LVs equivalent to much younger individuals,  3  suggesting that exercise training, performed at a very high level over a lifetime, may counteract the detrimental effects of aging and inactivity on the LV.\n\nAlthough competitive Masters athletes are a useful model for characterizing the upper limits of cardiovascular protection from prolonged exercise training, the volume of training performed by these individuals (\u22656 days/wk plus competitions) is not feasible for the general population. Although it appears that 4 to 5 days of committed exercise training over decades is adequate to achieve most of this benefit,  4  it is unclear whether exercise training can restore or improve LV compliance in previously sedentary individuals, and if so, when is the optimal stage of life to intervene.\n\nEpidemiological studies show that a measurement of fitness in middle age is the strongest predictor of future heart failure.  [5] [6] 6] [7]  Moreover, in observational studies, the dose of exercise associated with reduced heart failure incidence is much higher than that associated with reduced mortality.  8 However, if exercise is started too late in life (ie, after 65 years) in sedentary individuals, there is little effect on LV stiffness. 9,10 Thus, a lifetime of sedentary aging is associated with a reduction of cardiac plasticity, which cannot be overcome with a year of moderate-intensity exercise training. We recently documented that this LV stiffening begins to be identifiable during middle age with a leftward shift in the LV end-diastolic pressure volume curve.  11 We hypothesize that middle-aged hearts retain some degree of cardiac plasticity and may represent a more optimal time to intervene with aggressive lifestyle modification aimed at improving cardiac stiffness.\n\nBased on these observations and the growing body of literature on the benefits of high-intensity interval training,  12, 13  we hypothesized that an optimized exercise prescription (\u22654 days/wk including high-intensity interval training) initiated in middle age may be an effective strategy to prevent LV stiffening, a key pathophysiologic characteristic of HFpEF. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of 2 years of supervised exercise training on LV compliance and distensibility in previously sedentary, middle-aged individuals."

Sixty-one healthy, sedentary middle-aged (45-64 years) participants were recruited from the Dallas Heart Study,  14  employees at Texas Health Resources and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and through local media. For the latter, emails and electronic newsletters were distributed to staff at Texas Health Resources and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. In brief, Texas Health Resources has \u224820 500 employees. Emails were sent to all employees in a staggered fashion (ie, the first half or the alphabet followed by the second half of the alphabet \u22481 month later). Three rounds of emails were sent between September 2012 and February 2014. Employees from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center responded to a call for participants posted in a weekly institute-wide email circulated to all staff and students. In addition, local newspapers and online media published articles on the benefits of exercise that referred to the trial and included contact information for interested readers. Two hundred sixty-two individuals expressed interest in participating in the study and underwent screening (Figure  1 ). After obtaining informed consent, all participants were rigorously screened for comorbidities, and were excluded if any of the following conditions were present: hypertension (use of antihypertensive medication or ambulatory systolic blood pressure >135 mm Hg), body mass index \u226530 kg/m 2 , untreated hypo-or hyperthyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tobacco use during past 10 years, coronary artery disease, or structural heart disease.

Sample size calculations were based on the difference between individually calculated mean stiffness constants of our previous work, which characterized the effects of aging on LV stiffness.  11 Based on these findings, we assumed a significant difference in stiffness constant of 24 U with a standard deviation of 30 U, and a within-participant correlation of \u03c1=0.6 in a 2-factor (intervention and evaluation time) mixed-model repeated-measures design (intervention is the betweengroup factor, time is repeated) from before to after 2 years of training. Based on the required between-groups difference and assuming that there would be no change in LV stiffness in controls, with an \u03b1-error of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, we required 21 participants per group to be adequately powered to address our hypothesis."

      "text": "The ExT program followed a periodized approach, where increases in training frequency, duration, and intensity progressed over time.\n\nEach participant was provided with an individualized training plan. Exercise physiologists met with participants monthly throughout the intervention. The majority of monthly meetings were conducted in person; however, if this was not logistically possible, meetings were conducted electronically. During the initial training phase, exercise physiologists directly supervised many exercise sessions with the goal of educating participants about the different type of sessions and providing support and guidance to build self-confidence, develop self-efficacy to facilitate the independent completion of the exercise program. During monthly consults, exercise physiologists discussed the individual's progress, reviewed adherence to the intervention, and noted any issues (eg, musculoskeletal injuries, acute illness). The majority of exercise sessions throughout the training program were not supervised, although every session was carefully tracked using heart rate (HR) monitors. To individualize training intensity, the maximal steady state (MSS) zone was first determined from the ventilatory and lactate thresholds measured during the maximal exercise test as previously described. 15 Based on the MSS HR and peak HR (HRpeak), 4 training zones were established for each participant: (1) MSS; (2) base pace (1-20 beats below Figure 1. Enrollment, randomization, and retention of study participants randomly assigned to the exercise training or control group. MSS); (3) interval (>95% HR peak); and recovery (<base pace). The early training phase (month 1-2) focused on establishing an endurance base and regular exercise routine with participants performing 3, 30-minute base pace sessions per week. As participants acclimated to the training, MSS sessions were added starting with 2 sessions per month during the second month and increasing to 3 sessions in month 3. In the third month, aerobic intervals consisting 4\u00d74 interval sessions (4 minutes of exercise at 95% peak HR followed by 3 minutes of active recovery at 60%-75% peak HR, repeated 4 times) were incorporated. 16 A recovery day consisting of 20 to 30 minutes of walking or light aerobic activity followed each interval day. By the sixth month, participants were training 5 to 6 hours per week, including 2 interval sessions, and 1 long (at least an hour) and one 30-minute base pace session each week. This training load was maintained for 4 months. After completion of the 10-month progression, exercise capacity was retested and then participants began the maintenance training phase. Training zones were adjusted to reflect the results of the most recent exercise test. During this period, participants performed only 1 interval session per week plus continuous training. Participants were encouraged to use a variety of exercise equipment (eg, stationary cycle ergometer, treadmill, elliptical trainer) or perform exercise sessions outdoors (eg, running on trails, cycling, swimming) to ensure participant enjoyment and to avoid overuse injuries. To supplement the endurance training, 2 weekly strength training sessions were prescribed. These sessions were designed to focus on whole body functional and core strength to complement the endurance training."

This prescription allowed for a similar level of interaction with research staff between both groups.\n\nTo that end, each participant (ExT group and control group) was assigned an exercise physiologist who monitored their training compliance throughout the 2-year intervention. An exercise log and heart rate monitor (Polar) were used to monitor training compliance. Training load was quantified by the training impulse.  17 Specific training impulse calculations for continuous and interval training were used.  18 The mean monthly training load is presented in Figure I in the onlineonly Data Supplement."

Modeling was performed for each individual participant, at baseline and repeated after 2 years. The averages of the individual LV chamber stiffness constants for all the participants within each group are reported and denoted as individual stiffness. To characterize the overall groups in terms of pressure-volume curves prior to initiating either intervention and after completion of 2 years follow-up-post intervention, a single curve was also fit to the data that were derived from the means of each loading condition, which are referred to as group curves. Because external constraint influences ventricular volumes and pressure, LV end-diastolic transmural pressure-volume relationships were constructed using estimated transmural pressure (PCWP-right atrial pressure).  27 Transmural stiffness constants were modeled as described above. PCWP and SV data were used to construct Frank-Starling relationships. The SV, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and 3-dimensional LVEDV data were used to construct preload recruitable stroke work relationships (PRSW=[SV\u00d7MAP]/LVEDV).

      "text": "This study is the longest, prospective randomized controlled trial that has documented the physiological ef-fects of supervised, structured ExT in a group of sedentary but healthy middle-aged adults. The key finding is that 2 years of exercise training performed for at least 30 minutes, 4 to 5 days per week, and including at least 1 high-intensity interval session per week results in a significant reduction in LV chamber and myocardial stiffness. The use of high-resolution, invasively measured LV pressure-volume curves and comparison with an attention control group enhances the confidence in this conclusion. This study also demonstrated that ExT can be adhered to by middle-aged adults over a prolonged period, suggesting that this may be an effective strategy to mitigate the deleterious effects of sedentary aging on the heart and forestall the development of HFpEF."

In response to this training stimulus, we observed a classical physiological response, where maximal oxygen uptake was markedly increased, resting HR was reduced, and LVEDV was expanded. Epidemiological evidence suggests that each 1-metabolic equivalent increase in exercise capacity is associated with a 13% and 15% reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.  32 Furthermore, higher fitness levels in middle age are associated with a reduced risk of heart failure.  [5] [6] [7] 7] 33  Lower resting HR is also associated with reductions in mortality, independent of objectively measured fitness levels.  34 Thus, 2 years of exercise training at a frequency of 4 to 5 days per week had considerable cardiovascular benefits and may improve longevity and prevent the development of heart failure. We used a mixture of continuous moderate-intensity ExT combined with high-intensity training, which has been demonstrated to have superior cardiovascular benefit in comparison with moderate-intensity exercise alone.  35 The possible enhanced efficacy of highintensity interval training and threshold training is likely attributable to the complex integrative physiological response required to perform high-intensity work. The high intensity interval training protocol used in this study required participants to exercise at 90% to 95% of HR maximum for 4 minutes, followed by a 3-minute active recovery period, repeated 4 times, termed the 4\u00d74 by the Norwegian group.  35 During the 4 minutes of intense exercise, there is a large increase in Qc to meet the increased demand for oxygen delivery and utilization within the skeletal muscle. The near-maximal Qc and repeated exposure to this intense stimulus are the likely drivers of the ventricular remodeling and resultant increase in Vo . 2 max. Our study provides compelling evidence of the powerful cardiovascular benefits of highintensity training in humans and provides a rationale that the improvements are in part attributable to enhanced diastolic function."

With the use of our repeated-measures, parallel control design, we can address several recent concerns that have arisen regarding interindividual variability in the exercise training response.  36 For example, many of the studies reporting on training variability lack a comparative control group, calling into question the reported wide variability in the response to training and the concept of the nonresponder.  37 In our present study, we observed a very small change in Vo . 2 max in the control group at 9 months (-0.11 [range, -6.5 to 5.4] mL\u2022kg -1 \u2022min -1 ), with an additional reduction from month 10 to 24 (-0.58 [range, -3.4 to 7.0] mL\u2022kg -1 \u2022min -1 ). In contrast to this clear lack of change in controls, we observed virtually no nonresponders in our ExT group. This near-universal response to ExT in these middleaged subjects may have been attributable to the high levels of adherence, the long duration of the intervention, or the intensity of the training stimulus. Although, of course, there was some individual variability in the ultimate responses, our data support other recent observations that, given an adequate training stimulus, the vast majority of individuals will have a clear physiological response to exercise training.  38"

      "title": "Exercise Commenced in Middle Age Alters Cardiac Compliance and Is a Reasonable Target to Prevent HFpEF",
      "text": "At present, spironolactone is the only treatment strategy recommended (class II recommendation) to counteract the debilitating effects of HFpEF.  39 Thus, establishing additional effective prevention strategies is key, especially in light of the aging population and growing levels of sedentary behavior, 2 leading risk factors for the development of HFpEF.  40 Exercise training has been demonstrated to improve fitness and quality of life in patients with HFpEF  41  and in those at risk of developing HFpEF.  42 Yet, the effects of training on LV function when assessed noninvasively via echocardiography indices are less clear; with 1 study demonstrating improved E/e\u02b9 and reduced left atrial volume,  43  whereas others report no change in mitral inflow or early deceleration time.  44 It is important to note that 2 key characteristics of patients with HFpEF are abnormal active relaxation and markedly elevated passive LV stiffness in comparison with controls,  45  such that increases in ventricular filling pressure result in very few changes in ventricular volume,  46  demonstrating reduced cardiac compliance. This reduction in compliance limits the capacity of the heart to distend during increases in venous return and thus limits exercise tolerance in patients with impaired diastolic function.  47 e have previously shown that 1 year of exercise training in patients with HFpEF and sedentary seniors has little effect on LV stiffness,  9, 48  suggesting an inadequate exercise training stimulus or that older seniors and patients with HFpEF may have limited cardiac plasticity, which inhibits their capacity to respond to exercise training. Previous work from our group demonstrated a proportional relationship between ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE cardiac compliance and sedentary aging that rapidly accelerated after age 65. 11 Subjects who were middle aged, between 45 and 64 years, had cardiac compliance scores between those of younger (<35 years) and senior (>65 years) controls, suggesting a transition phase, or sweet spot in which potential plasticity to reverse age-related stiffening may still be present. Follow-up work from our group showed healthy seniors who exercised habitually for >25 years had cardiac compliance similar to young controls, essentially forestalling age-related changes.\n\nWe demonstrate for the first time that exercise training, predominantly endurance in nature, improves LV and myocardial stiffness in sedentary, but otherwise healthy middle-aged adults. Our findings suggest that intervening earlier in the aging process is necessary to preserve and possibly enhance ventricular compliance. ExT improved both global cardiac compliance in addition to myocardial compliance estimated from the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship derived from transmural pressure. Improvements in cardiac compliance were thus likely driven by 2 independent but cumulative processes, namely attenuated pericardial constraint in addition to myocardial remodeling."

      "text": "Studies investigating the chronic effects of exercise training have been limited by study design, where retrospective cross-sectional studies typically characterize exercise history over years to differentiate between trained and untrained individuals,  4, 49  or supervised training studies are performed for relatively short periods of time, typically 12 to 16 weeks.  12 These study designs limit the ability to provide specific exercise prescriptions for particular outcomes, because the effects of intensity are typically difficult to quantify in cross-sectional studies and the long-term effects are unclear in short training studies. Our exercise prescription, which was evidence based, proved to be highly effective in enhancing cardiovascular structure and function. The periodized design of the training program permitted participants to become accustomed to the frequency of training gradually. In addition, by varying the duration, intensity, and type of training over the course of the week, the training was not onerous and was feasible with excellent adherence to prescribed sessions. The exercise prescription used in this study closely reflects the current population-based exercise/physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes per week of physical activity,  31  albeit with the addition of high intensity interval training. Moreover, a growing body of epidemiological evidence supports the beneficial impact of regularly exercising 4 days per week.  50, 51 We provide contemporary, prospective evidence for the efficacy of this type of exercise training."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "A limitation of our study is that we evaluated LV pressure curves by using mean PCWP as a surrogate for LV end-diastolic pressure. However, we performed rigorous screening for cardiovascular disease and excluded participants who had valvular abnormalities such as mitral valve regurgitation or pulmonary disease, which might alter the relationship between PCWP and LV enddiastolic pressure. We selected volunteers who were willing and able to participate in an intensive exercise regimen; therefore, these results may not necessarily apply to the general adult population. Moreover, our subjects were predominantly white, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other racial groups. Indeed, the effects of race on the response to ExT are controversial, with some studies demonstrating racial differences,  52  whereas others do not.  53 The long-term goal is to establish whether this model of ExT is effective in preventing the development of HFpEF and reducing mortality in this population. This goal is especially relevant in at-risk populations, including women who are disproportionately affected by HFpEF, because the present study was not adequately powered to address this distinction. Future studies will also need to address whether this intervention is efficacious in other populations at increased risk of developing heart failure; for example, those who are sedentary plus have evidence of LV hypertrophy or abnormal cardiac biomarkers (troponin and N-terminal fragment of the prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide).  54"
