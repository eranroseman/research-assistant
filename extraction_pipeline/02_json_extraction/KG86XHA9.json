  "title": "Integrating digital inhalers into clinical care of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",
  "abstract": "Modernizing inhaled medications through digital technology can help address persistent problems of nonadherence and poor inhaler technique in patients with obstructive lung diseases. With a growing body of supportive clinical studies, advances in digital inhaler sensors and platforms, greater support from payers and healthcare organizations, significant growth with these technologies is expected. While all digital (smart) inhalers record adherence, these are distinguished by their compatibility with commercial inhalers, capabilities to guide inhaler technique, use of patient-reported outcomes, and user-friendliness for both the healthcare professional (HCP) and patient. Due to the complexity and novelty of employing digital inhalers, collaboration with multiple entities within health systems is necessary and a well-planned integration is needed. For HCPs and patients, cybersecurity and privacy are critical, it will require review by each healthcare organization. In the US, some payers reimburse for remote monitoring using digital inhalers, but reimbursement is currently unavailable in other countries. There are several models for remote patient care, as employing an active, ongoing digital interface between the HCP and patient or they may choose to only review data at clinical encounters. Personalization of therapies and feedback are key to success. While digital inhaler malfunction uncommonly occurs, patient attrition over a year is significant. Some patients will be challenged to use digital platforms or have the necessary technology. Additional research is needed to address cost-effectiveness, in vivo accuracy of inspiratory measurement capable devices, ability to teach inhaler technique, their application for monitoring lung function, and lastly real-world adoption and implementation in routine clinical practice.",

      "text": "Digital health is rapidly growing, including intensive care telemedicine, virtual outpatient encounters, and remote monitoring using digital solutions. Digital technologies are applied widely for cardiac diseases  [1, 2]  and diabetes mellitus  [3] , but used infrequently for respiratory diseases, with the exception of obstructive sleep apnea  [4] . Many commercial inhalers can be converted to 'smart' or 'digital' inhalers through attachable ('snap-on') or embedded electromechanical sensors to record, store and transmit patient usage  [5] . The incorporation of digital inhalers into routine clinical practice is a paradigm shift in obstructive lung diseases management, especially considering the number of potential patients.\n\nThe rationale for adopting digital inhalers are ongoing medication non-adherence  [6] [7] [8]  and suboptimal inhaler technique  [9, 10] . Among patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), daily use of controllers approaches 50% of prescribed doses  [6]  and inhaler technique is similarly sub-optimal  [9] ; each is associated with poor patient outcomes as inadequate control and more acute care visits  [9] [10] [11] [12] . Patients and healthcare professionals (HCP) often over-estimate medication adherence, leading to unnecessary testing and treatments  [13] [14] [15] [16] . Similarly, improper inhaler technique is inconsistently addressed during office visits  [17, 18]  and if taught, technique wanes  [19]  and patients change devices.\n\nCurrent circumstances favoring smart inhalers include widespread use of technology by patients, payer support  [20, 21] , policy organizations recognizing their importance  [22, 23] , widespread use of quality metrics, and expansion of telehealth. Digital inhaler technology is projected to have a worldwide market in the billions(USD) by 2030  [24] .\n\nHerein, we discuss integrating smart inhalers into patient care. We refer readers to extensive reviews on the scientific evidence for digital inhalers in asthma and COPD  [5, [25] [26] [27] [28] . To provide a proper background, we present the regulatory process to bring these to the market, and an understanding of the digital inhaler health platform, the devices and functions. For the HCP, we address device and patient selection, legal and regulatory standards, cybersecurity, logistics of implementation and use, and financial considerations. From the patient perspective, we discuss privacy, costs, HCP-patient interaction, as well as functionality, acceptability and usability of smart inhalers and platforms."

Additional searches were done employing US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Authority (EMA) websites concerning regulations and policies on digital or smart inhalers. Reimbursement policies were searched on the US Committee on Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website. Clinical studies were included if digital inhalers and related mobile applications were used as part of clinical monitoring intervention and had the primary aim of improving maintenance medication adherence and/or reducing reliever use and were conducted in patients with asthma and/or COPD. Clinical studies were excluded if they did not report results using Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria or similar standardized reporting methods or had follow-up periods less than 12 weeks. Studies were also identified through a manual search of the reference lists of the literature and included input from contributing authors."

      "text": "In many countries, attachable digital inhaler sensors must meet regulatory standards for medical devices (510K in USA), and if the sensing platform is built directly into the inhaler (combination digital inhaler), drug and device regulations apply. However, regulations do not exist in all countries, and in some, medical device regulations are in nascent stages. In addition to device approval, associated software must go through regulatory review. In the US, the Digital Health Center of Excellence is part of the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health, providing regulatory advice and support to the FDA regulatory review of these technologies  [29, 30] . The regulatory process is different between software used for an interface with digital inhaler platforms versus stand-alone smart phone health applications (Apps)  [31] .\n\nThe US FDA and EMA provide guidance on attachable digital inhaler devices as well as combination digital inhalers  [32, 33] . In Europe, software specifically developed for disease diagnosis or treatment falls under the medical device directive  [34] . The US FDA provides specific guidance for premarket submissions of software combined/contained in medical devices  [29] . Attachable sensors must demonstrate device safety including not interfering with inhaler operation, medication delivery, or obstruct the dose counter or label but do not need to prove therapeutic efficacy  [34] . The only human study required for attachable sensors is a rudimentary usability study  [35] .\n\nBuilt-in and attachable electronic monitoring devices for digital inhalers are considered low risk by the US FDA. Digihaler\u00ae  [36] [37] [38]  was approved as a New Drug Application and device through the Center for Devices and Radiologic Health, while other federal agencies were involved in the review process including the mobile App, cybersecurity, and patient-facing materials  [27, 33] ."

      "title": "Platform",
      "text": "The digital inhaler platform (Fig.  1 ), also referred to as digital health solution, typically consists of one or more digital inhalers for the patient, a dedicated mobile App (usually smart phone), cloud server, and dashboards for the patient and HCP. After receiving the sensor(s), the patient downloads the dedicated App, and typically pairs the inhaler with their smart phone. Synchronizing (sync) the device with the smart phone App is best done with supervision so troubleshooting can occur, although one device (FindAirOne\u00ae)  [39]  automatically syncs (Table  1 ). One study reported 17% of COPD patients were unsuccessful in full activation of the device and App in the first 30 days  [40] .\n\nOnce downloaded, the dedicated App prompts the patient to consent to the manufacturer's Privacy Policy and User Agreement. The sensors must be in proximity (<20 m) of their smart phone to transmit data through the Bluetooth\u00ae sensor. To use all functions, patients typically provide demographics, telephone number, email address, and inhaled medication, dose, desired dosing alert times and how and whom to share data. Encrypted inhaler data is transmitted to a secure cloud server (eg Microsoft Azure), and then to the HCP's dashboard portal. Patients may choose to upload their data through their electronic health records (EHR) portal to submit to their HCP."

      "text": "Many commercial prescription inhalers can be digitalized with attachable sensors (Propeller Health\u00ae, Hailie\u00ae, Respiro\u00ae, Enerzair\u00ae, Capmedic\u00ae, FindairOne\u00ae )  [39, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45]  or built-in sensors (Digihaler\u00ae, Amiko MX001\u00ae)  [36] [37] [38] 46] . Table  1  provides an overview of sensor functions for most digital inhalers available in the US and Europe. All can monitor adherence by time stamping actuations. Some pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) sensors have capacity to detect shaking (Hailie\u00ae, Capmedic\u00ae), pMDI upright orientation (Hailie\u00ae, Capmedic\u00ae) and/or measure inspiratory flows to guide proper inhalation  (Respiro\u00ae, Digihaler\u00ae, Hailie\u00ae) . Using pMDIs and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), the ability to measure inspiratory flows is termed inspiratory measurement capable (IC).\n\nWhile there are commonalities among digital inhaler platform functions and capabilities, there are clear differences (Table  1 ). For some, inhaler sensors illuminate to show battery status and when an actuation occurs. Audible or text alerts can be used for scheduled dosing reminders. Depending on the manufacturer's platform, the App can assist with disease management through patient entry of patient reported outcomes (PROs), general respiratory status, receive local air quality messages, receive feedback from the App related to adherence and technique, and alert messages to contact the HCP. Overall, these devise perform well in the majority of patients and for intended uses; additional research and clinical use will provide further insights.\n\nFor drug-device combinations, factors as sensor user-life and medication user-life after package removal are relevant. For the current combination products in the US, Airduo Digihaler\u00ae  [37] , Armonair Digihaler\u00ae  [38]  and Proair Digihaler\u00ae [36] recommended user-life are 30 days, 45 days, and one year, respectively. Attachable sensor user-life is based upon battery life (~1 year). Such factors need consideration by the HCP and patient in terms of obtaining inhaler replacements and costs of repeat prescriptions. The accuracy, reliability and durability of digital inhalers are critical to use. Electromechanical sensors detect inhaler functions through sound, pressure, temperature, and/or gravitational (accelerometer) changes. Published data are sometimes available on the accuracy of measuring inspiratory flows with these devices. IC-digital inhalers (INCA\u00ae -not commercially available, Respiro\u00ae, Digihaler\u00ae) report a strong correlation (>90%) between flowspeak inspiratory flow (PIF) and inhaled volume (Vin) measured by the digital inhalersand in vitro inspiratory flow recorders  [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . The Digihaler\u00ae has validated inspiratory flow accuracy in patients  [47] . In terms of actuation recording reliability, studies report accurate recording  [47] [48] [49] [50] , with only minor issues related to the precise time stamping  [52] . The durability of these devices is less well-studied. A study among children with asthma found about 48% of snap-on devices were damaged or lost over 1 year  [53] ."

      "title": "Privacy, cybersecurity, ethical and legal considerations for the HCP and patient",
      "text": "Sharing sensitive personal and health data on mobile platforms as smart phones and the internet are important concerns  [54] [55] [56] [57] . Transfer and management of health data poses ethical issues; for example, it is important to consider the role of the HCP in managing the patient when  their data shows a drop in adherence and/or change in asthma control, while also respecting patient privacy, autonomy and fostering their ability to self-manage their asthma. The American College of Physicians published a position paper on privacy and security when telehealth is employed; stating health information should be protected from improper access or use and should support an environment of trust while improving care  [57] . Factors affecting an individual's willingness to share personal health data include perceived benefits of use, user's motive, and sensitivity of the information  [58] . Digital inhaler device manufacturers meet privacy standards set forth by regulatory agencies  [29, 32, 33] . The FDA works with other federal government agencies including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, private industry, medical device manufacturers, health care organizations, and patients to increase security features. An updated draft of the FDA's 2014 cybersecurity guidance [59] is under review  [60] . All transfer of data is encrypted and secured according to the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and Security Operations Center. In other countries, similar privacy regulations are in place. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union governs data protection and privacy, and the European Economic Area and New Zealand updated their privacy laws with The Privacy Act 2020 that puts responsibilities on agencies and organizations for protecting personal information.\n\nUser Agreements e-signed by patients address data aggregation and de-identification for use in public health-related and/or scientific research purposes. These must meet HIPAA regulations, whether by a covered (eg. prescriber) or non-covered entity. The Privacy Policy explains how personal and health information is collected, stored, disclosed, and transferred when any element of the digital services is used. Parenteral/guardian consent is required for minors. Employing anonymous identifiers is one option to aid privacy and security.\n\nPatient e-consents address liability concerns for the manufacturer; less clear is the liability to the HCP or their institution. Some HCPs might be reticent to accept the potential liability of real-time, remote access, and critical alerts that could require time-sensitive interventions. One approach to address legal concerns is to provide site-generated patient information describing how smart inhaler technology will be applied.\n\nHealthcare organizations considering digital inhalers need to address cybersecurity early because an in-depth architectural review is usually required. The regulatory review that these devices undergo pre-market help address concerns, but healthcare organizations may have additional requirements including Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) that authenticate web functions."

      "title": "Financial considerations for HCP's and patients",
      "text": "Upfront costs include the effort and resources to incorporate the devices into the practice setting, and then staffing, training and infrastructure to maintain the program. To balance these costs, there are two principal ways that digital inhalers could be cost-effective: decreasing healthcare utilization (HCU) and generating revenue through a fee-forservice model. Not reported is whether patients are willing to bear costs of digital inhalers. One paper reported the annual costs of attachable devices in 2018 to be around $150 USD per patient  [53] , but today costs exceed $200 USD in the US. FindairOne\u00ae (Europe) reports a direct-to-consumer cost of \u20ac59 per device  [39] . With most attachable sensors, the HCP can contract with the manufacturer or distributor to receive the sensor and access the digital health solution functions. For a digital drug combination, the cost is higher than the non-digitalized product (Proair Digihaler\u00ae ~ $180, Proair Respiclick\u00ae ~ $60)  [61] . Access to the Digihaler\u00ae dashboard accompanies the product purchase, whereas with attachable sensors the HCP's dashboard is included in the platform's cost.\n\nIn a modeled cost-effectiveness analysis from the UK, use of smart inhalers in children with asthma led to savings of 96\u00a3/year/patient  [62] . An exploratory study using the INCA device with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol in COPD patients, projected cost-effectiveness was greatest in patients who exhibited irregular use and good inhaler technique (savings 845\u00a3/year/patient) compared to patients with regular use and good inhaler technique  [63] . Costs also increased in patients with frequent inhaler technique errors, even with regular or irregular use, pointing to technique as a factor in cost-effectiveness. Clearly, more data is needed for cost-reduction effects.\n\nIn the US, Remote Physiologic Monitoring (RPM) billing codes were approved by Medicare for digital inhalers in 2019  [64] [65] [66] . (Table  2 ). These are essentially the same codes used with remote digital monitoring of blood glucose for diabetes. Reimbursements vary according to when and what services are provided (~$40 -$65 per encounter up to once every 30 days)  [65] . Measures can not be recorded manually, rather must be digitally collected. For RPM coverage, a physiologic measure is required, as with IC-digital inhalers. In 2021, Medicare approved additional Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM)  [66] , which permits billing for adherence monitoring; the fees are comparable (Table  3 ). Another possible means for reimbursement is through billing for inhaler teaching using IC-digital inhalers. Notably, in the US not all insurers reimburse for RPM, RTM or inhaler teaching.\n\nIn countries outside of the US, there are currently limited reimbursement schemes available to cover the costs of medical devices and costs are being met by patients themselves. In the UK, there is an active research/implementation program ongoing at the severe asthma centers to gain approval by the National Health Service. Such approval will be based on clinical validation with a commercial value.\n\nFor payers, costs associated with digital inhalers are based on HCU, drug costs, and meeting quality benchmarks. These costs are expected to be offset by savings from reduced HCU from acute care visits. Payers may also require documentation of digital data on controller adherence and inhalation quality, and HCP counseling to address potentially modifiable barriers before approval of costly biologic therapies. US insurer payments for patient care are partially dependent on meeting medication quality metrics. For asthma, this is a medication possession ratio (>0.8) and use of inhaled corticosteroids [67], the former readily collected digitally. For COPD, the medication quality metrics are a prescription for a long-acting bronchodilator and use of systemic corticosteroids and inhaled rescue medications for excerbations [67], thus would not be directly impacted by smart inhalers. For US hospitals, if the number of 30-day readmissions for COPD exacerbations exceed"

Active and frequent remote monitoring with digital inhalers needs investigation in post-hospital COPD care. Based on the only post-hospital study in COPD using smart inhalers, we learned that giving the patient a free controller, educating them, and discharging from the hospital with no short-term follow-up (passive monitoring) results in poor adherence and inhaler technique [69]."

      "title": "Digital interface between HCP and the patient",
      "text": "Digital inhaler use impacts the patient, the HCP, and patient-HCP interactions. From the HCP perspective, the greatest value of digital inhalers will be understanding the patient's behavior and adapting treatments thereof. For the patient, they will be better informed of their inhaler use and hopefully more engaged in managing their disease.\n\nPatient interface with the digital platform consists of the inhaler with sensors, dedicated smart phone App, and interface with the HCP. The patient can review inhaler use and self-reported PROs on their dashboard. Patients will want to know how a digital inhaler benefits them, what data will be collected, the costs, how will this information be used by their HCP, who will have access, what happens if a sensor is lost, and if personal or health data will be identifiable, deidentified, or coded.\n\nFor HCPs, the dashboard portal permits them to view lists of enrolled patients, provide feedback to patients at encounters, review and generate reports for documentation and billing. At present, there is little experience with EHR 'builds' with this technology, and reports may have to be manually scanned, similar to spirograms. With some platforms, alerts to HCPs about patient inhaler use can be pre-defined, such as excessive short-acting \u03b2-2 agonist (SABA) use or declining controller adherence. One study reported that a 100% increase in SABA use was a marker of an impending exacerbation  [70] . The App settings should be chosen based on agreed upon goals, recognizing the implications of alert fatigue and medicolegal liability.\n\nFor IC-digital inhalers, it should be recognized that relevant clinical evidence is based on proper inhaler technique (eg optimal PIF 30-60 L/ min for pMDIs and \u226560L/min for most DPIs)  [71] . Using the Capmedic\u00ae and Digihaler\u00ae devices, patients can receive immediate feedback on technique, an important feature.\n\nOverall, patients and HCPs have favorable views of smart inhaler platforms  [70, [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Among 35 patients with COPD using Propeller Health sensors for their SABA, 74.1% reported being very satisfied with the inhaler sensor and 80.8% rated them very convenient to use  [70] . A study in adults with asthma found 79% were very satisfied with Propeller Health sensors  [74] . Interviews of 18 persons with asthma indicated that Hailie\u00ae monitors were easy to use, reminders only occurred with missed doses and reminder alerts were musical  [75] . These findings have been confirmed in more recent studies; a 2019 study in children with asthma reported that parents also were satisfied, including the ability to receive care remotely  [77] , and a 2020 study found that children and their caregivers preferred digital inhalers easy to use and that required minimal effort  [78] ."

Published experience with digital inhalers is in research settings, so staff time and resources needed in a clinic setting are not fully knownlikely the first question the office clinician has. Staff time to teach the patient how to attach the sensor, download the App, consent, and sync the inhaler and smart phone is usually 20-30 min. Typically, only licensed HCPs can perform the remote monitoring independently. When employing RPM or RTM, clinical encounters \u226520 min are required for payment by US Medicare and can occur as often as monthly  [64, 65] .

If the goal is to improve controller adherence, then a platform compatible with a diverse range of inhalers is needed, as no single controller product would suit all patients' needs. Most clinical studies have used both digitalized controllers and SABA in each patient  [53, [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] 88] . A digitalized SABA inhaler alone might be desired in patients where overuse is a marker for uncontrolled disease, in line with global asthma guidelines. This sort of data might be suitable to artificial intelligence application. It may be convenient to prescribe a device dispensed through a pharmacy, rather than by contractual basis as required for attachable sensors.\n\nAttachable inhaler sensors are medical devices that patients typically obtain through their HCP, but may not require a prescription. The HCP could purchase them contractually, then directly dispense or have them mailed to the patient. Combination devices must be prescribed and obtained from a pharmacy. As platforms support patient initiation of device use  [39] , the impacts on HCP resourcing will likely be minimized, which will lend further support to implementation into routine practice."

About 50% of patients with asthma and COPD qualify based on nonadherence, but this is affected by many factors, including the recognition that not all patients need, want, or can afford daily treatment. The consequences of the non-adherent patient (intentional versus non-intentional non-adherence) should be considered  [6, 26, 99] , as personalization using digital inhaler data can better address patient behaviors, drug efficacy and safety  [102, 103] . Digital inhalers have the potential to bring benefits for those intentionally non-adherent as well as those with unintentional non-adherence. For example, some digital inhalers can link with a patient self management App which can send the patient notifications to address or dispel myths or misplaced treatment beliefs, which may be driving intentional non-adherence. On the other hand, digital inhalers can provide audio-visual reminders to help with unintentional non-adherence.\n\nPoor inhaler technique is as common as non-adherence  [9] . Patients may see greater value when monitoring both inhaler technique and adherence."

      "title": "Patient monitoring",
      "text": "The strategy employed for remote monitoring should establish who 'owns' the data and expectations of both parties to manage and respond to digital inhaler data. Data collected and transmitted to the HCPs portal dashboard can be immediate, thus expectations should be set. While close monitoring may be desired such as immediate post-hospitalization, this may not be desired or possible for routine RPM. Some platforms generate messages for patients to contact their HCP with excess reliever use or worsening PROs recorded by the patient in the App. Use of a written action plan or informing patients to seek medical care as they would normally is a reasonable recommendation for most patients. Platforms that integrate action plans do not currently exist. In the future, digital inhalers might rely on the dispensing pharmacy to help monitor adherence and technique, and to provide prescription refills based on cloud access.\n\nSmaller practices or solo clinicians may choose to have sensor data sent only directly to the patient and opt out of or subcontract the remote monitoring functions of the HCP's dashboard. The patient is directly responsible for review of alerts and contacting the HCP to determine care options as needed. Using this approach, the HCP may instruct the patient to bring their digital inhaler and smart phone to clinic visits for data review directly, or HCPs may ask the patient to upload the digital inhaler data prior to the clinic visit using their EHR portal. Adherence and inhalation quality data may be reviewed together by the patient and HCP, along with PROs, and other measures of impairment and risk assessment during office visits.\n\nAn important decision is the duration of monitoring necessary to achieve clinical goals. Clinical studies using digital inhalers have been done over at least 12 weeks and as long as one year  [52,73,79-81,83-85, 92,105] . It is known that both adherence and inhaler technique decline over time. [6, 9]  A minimum of three months of monitoring is likely a starting point to establish adherence and any improvements in inhaler technique, as shown in one study  [106] . Longer periods may be needed, such as assessing treatments."

There are additional issues with digital inhalers: 1) acceptability by patients who may feel their autonomy and privacy are compromised, 2) uncertainty around clinical responsibility for reviewing and acting on these new large-scale continuous data streams, 3) lack of clarity over who will bear the cost, and 4) simply resources. Most perceived and actual barriers can be overcome by highquality research demonstrating the efficacy and effectiveness of digital inhalers in improving inhaler use, disease monitoring, and ultimately health outcomes. Real-world experience is also critical to judging the role and impact of these devices.\n\nNot all patients are eligible, want to enroll or persist with a digital inhaler. Digital inhalers are not an option if an attachable sensor is incompatible with their inhaler(s) or if they routinely rely on nebulized medications. Importantly, attrition to digital device use occurs, with rates as high as 40% of patients in the first six months  [78]  and 55% at one year  [74] . Reasons include device malfunction, loss of interest, intrusiveness, and worsening adherence."

      "text": "Guiding proper adherence and inhaler technique using digital inhalers has great potential to maximize the response to inhaled drug therapies. Despite availability for over a decade and increasing supportive evidence of benefits to adherence and therapeutic outcomes, digital inhalers and associated health management platforms are still perceived as new to many HCP and organizationsthus the learning curve is steep. The ability to monitor appropriate inhaler use either remotely in real-time or at in-person visits yields an opportunity to improve inhalational drug delivery to patients suffering from airway diseases, particularly in this post-pandemic world where remote care delivery is more accepted. Available evidence indicates smart inhalers enhance key aspects of drug therapy management and can guide clinical care in patients with asthma and COPD. The ability of digital inhalers to improve technique and cost-effectiveness of these interventions requires further investigations relevant to policymakers, HCPs, and patients. While many factors influence the extent to which digital inhalers will be adopted, their potential to reduce morbidity and mortality from airway disease should motivate continued investigation and implementation into practice of these novel approaches."
