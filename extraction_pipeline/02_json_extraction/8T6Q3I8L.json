  "abstract": "Background This study aimed to achieve expert consensus regarding key items to be addressed by non-clinical operators using computer-software integrated medical dispatch protocols to manage out-of-hours telephone triage (OOH-TT) services for calls involving older adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care across Belgium. Methods A three-part classic e-Delphi study was conducted. A purposive sample of experts specialized in out-ofhours unplanned care and/or older persons across Belgium were recruited as panelists. Eligibility criteria included experts with at least 2 years of relevant experience. Level of consensus was defined to be reached when at least 70% of the panelists agreed or disagreed regarding the value of each item proposed within a survey for the top 10 most frequently used protocols for triaging older adults. Responses were analyzed over several rounds until expert consensus was found. Descriptive and thematic analyses were used to aggregate responses. Results N = 12 panelists agreed that several important missing protocol topics were not covered by the existing OOH-TT service. They also agreed about the nature of use (for the top 10 most frequently used protocols) but justified that some modifications should be made to keywords, interrogation questions, degree of urgency and/or flowcharts used for the algorithms to help operators gain better comprehensive understanding patient profiles, medical habits and history, level of support from informal caregivers, known comorbidities and frailty status. Furthermore, panelists also stressed the importance of considering feasibility in implementing protocols within the real-world setting and prioritizing the right type of training for operators which can facilitate the delivery of high-quality triage. Overall, consensus was found for nine of the top 10 most frequently used protocols for triaging older adults with no consensus found for the protocol on triaging patients unwell for no apparent reason. \n Conclusion Our findings show that overall, a combination of patient related factors must be addressed to provide high quality triage for adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care over the telephone (in addition to age). However, further elements such as appropriate operator training and feasibility of implementing more population-specific protocols must also be considered.

      "text": "It is well established that the use of out-of-hours telephone triage services (OOH-TT) services has large potential for managing unplanned and OOH healthcare needs presented by the general population  [1, 2] . However, little is known with regards to the quality of these services in more vulnerable segments of the population such as older adults  [1, 3, 4] . Specifically, it is well known that older adults (over the age of 65) are especially difficult to triage over TT services as they frequently present with atypical symptoms of common health concerns. At the same time, these segments of the population not only make up a large proportion of all unplanned care users  [5, 6]  but they are also known to be at the highest risks for experiencing adverse health events and safety incidents due to inappropriate care transfers  [7]  and in cases of inappropriate triage, mis-triage  [8, 9] .\n\nAs a first step towards addressing this issue, a recent publication by  Wardlow et al., (2022)  aimed to better understand how telehealth-based services should be delivered to appropriately meet the needs of older adults seeking care  [10] . However, existing findings have largely focused on provider-focused principles and guidelines for promoting age-friendly telehealth practices  [10] . Furthermore, some additional recent efforts also found that developing or adapting existing protocols to better fit population-specific criteria for triage in older adults may be effective for reducing rates of mis-triage in older adults. To date, these efforts have only been examined in specific and in-person triage tools  [11] [12] [13]  and it is not yet clear how well they may apply within the larger context of medical dispatch protocols used by OOH-TT services.\n\nIn Belgium, there is a national OOH-TT service which aims to provide medical assistance to patients during evenings, weekends and holidays. Depending on the region, patients calling this number are re-directed to the local on-call general practitioner (GP) for an appointment or to a non-medical operator specialized in triage using the Belgian Manual for Medical Regulation (BHMR) for guidance on further medical assistance (more information available at:  www. 1733. be  (Dutch, French, German and English)  [3, 14, 15] . Overall, the use of these medical dispatch protocols have been shown to be safe and effective for use in the general population  [16] [17] [18] . However, lower quality of triage (particularly related to concerns of safety assessed via the frequency of adverse events, errors, and patient hospitalization rates) has been shown to be associated with triaging older adults over the telephone  [19] [20] [21] . One potential problem associated with the use of existing protocols, such as the BHMR is the generic nature of the protocols. It is typically the case that the same protocols are used for triaging all segments of the population (i.e. including children and older adults who are known to be at higher risks for lower quality triage) with some limited considerations of age and medical history for vulnerable segments of the population. However, by incorporating key population-specific items within the protocols, the potential effectiveness, efficiency and overall quality of managing calls involving older adults in the population may be improved. As such, this Delphi study aims to achieve expert consensus regarding key items to be addressed by non-clinical operators using the BHMR medical dispatch protocols to manage OOH-TT services for calls involving older adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care across Belgium."

Specifically, panelists were presented with the list of protocols that are available at the 1733 service and were asked whether they believe the protocol topics considered in the existing list to be sufficient for triaging older adults as well as to selfreport (based on their expert experiences) on any relevant protocol topic they believed to be missing from the existing list. Panelists were then presented with the 10 most frequently used protocols for triaging older adults via the 1733 OOH-TT service between January 1 to December 31, 2019. Complete algorithms, flowcharts, and frequency distributions were made available to enable a detailed analysis of each of the individual protocols (see Table  1 )  [25] .\n\nAfter review of each protocol, panelists were asked to provide their opinion regarding the frequency of use and content of protocols for triaging calls involving older adults seeking unplanned care. Panelists were asked whether each protocol was used as frequently as they would expect and whether they believed that any modifications should be made to the content (i.e. the keywords, interrogation questions, degree of urgency, flowchart, or other factors related to the algorithm) within a specific protocol to improve the management of calls involving older adults."

      "text": "This study presents one of the first scientific efforts to better understand and find expert consensus regarding key items to be addressed by non-clinical operators using computer-software integrated medical dispatch protocols to manage OOH-TT services for older adults seeking unplanned care. Our interdisciplinary expert panel found strong consensus for the majority of the 10 most frequently used BHMR protocols for triaging older adults within the larger 1733 service in Belgium. Findings showed that the majority of experts felt that most protocols used for managing calls involving older adults were used as frequently as they would expect. However, panelists also agreed that some content related modifications should be made for keywords, interrogation questions, degree of urgency and/or flowcharts used for the algorithms of the top 10 most frequently used protocols to improve the overall quality of triage for older adults.\n\nOverall implications of our research suggest that in addition to age of patients, a combination of patient related factors must be addressed to provide high quality triage for adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care over the telephone. Additionally, some further elements such as appropriate operator training and feasibility of implementing more population-specific protocols must also be considered within the call center setting. Such considerations must be thoroughly evaluated before implementation of any new or revised protocols within practice.\n\nSpecifically, our findings shows that overall, a combination of patient related factors must be addressed to provide high quality triage for adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care over the telephone (in addition to age). However, further elements such as appropriate operator training and feasibility of implementing more population-specific protocols must also be considered. This study presents a useful step towards identifying key items which must be targeted within the larger scope of providing non-urgent out-of-hours telephone triage services for older adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care.\n\nDespite known concerns of triaging older adults via OOH-TT services, currently existing methods are still largely catered for providing remote medical assistance to less vulnerable segments of the population. It is not yet clearly known how protocols used across various services may be adapted and/or optimized for use in older adults  [3, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 27] . One plausible explanation for this concern as discussed during the round table consensus meeting is the understanding that it is especially difficult (and perhaps not possible) to create age specific protocols for older adults in a way that is similar to children in which specific ages are often lined with specific pathologies  [28] . The importance of addressing triage for older adults by using methods in which operators prioritize assessing a combination of factors (including patient profiles, medical habits and history, level of support from informal caregivers, known comorbidities and frailty status) rather than solely evaluating differences in patient age was embedded throughout the discussion.\n\nAnother key point that was addressed by panelists is the feasibility of implementing new/revised protocols within real world settings. Panelists were largely opposed to the creation of new protocols for providing OOH-TT services to older adults due to time and clinical restrictions of the telephone operators. While the importance of providing adequate training for operators was largely agreed upon, the key focus mentioned by panelists was to consider the addition and integration of specific questions that may capture different dimensions of triage-related questions for calls involving older adults within currently existing protocols. Despite a lack of existing literature,  [29]  discussions on evaluating quality of training in OOH-TT operators were also highlighted to be important and in line with the surrounding literature base which has shown that operator related characteristics (such as clinical background, length of experience, type of previous experience and flexibility of decision-making regarding level of urgency) may be key factors which influence triage outcome  [3, 4, [30] [31] [32] [33] . It is therefore crucial to ensure that operators are given adequate training which can in turn, ensure consistency and high-quality dispatch of patients using OOH-TT services. Supplementing the right questions alongside well-trained operators who are able to gather the right information during a call was stressed by panelists to be a key combination for enabling the delivery of high-quality OOH-TT services for older adults.\n\nSeveral strengths and limitations must be considered in interpreting the overall study results. First, it is important to note that our conclusions provide insight into discussions and consensus drawn by one particular expert panel and do not necessarily reflect objectively correct answers which must be used for delivering OOH-TT services to older adults. It is also important to note that different reflections and ideas regarding quality of triage may be produced by panelists consisting of other experts  [27, 34] . As such, the results of this study must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, level of consensus in this study was defined to be reached when at least 70% of the expert panel members agreed or disagree regarding the value of a specific item. Although this is within the standard range of measuring consensus  [22] , it must be noted that an alternative definition of level of consensus may yield different results. A key strength of this Delphi study is that the process inherently allows flexibility and enables panelists to assess their judgements through several rounds of the research process  [30] . Furthermore, it also plays a vital role for linking together existing knowledge and areas of agreement and disagreement within this field of research through a structured process that can allow us to ultimately have an impact on improving the quality of OOH-TT protocols for use in older adults  [31, 35] . A limitation that must also be considered is that no views of patient representatives were included. Despite several attempts to reach out to various eligible contacts, we were not able to include any panelists who could represent the views of older adults who have experience with the use of OOH-TT services. Finally, it is important to mention that although we intended for a national representative Delphi panel (and has therefore reached out to panelists from three regions in Belgium -Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels), we were presented with a high dropout rate of French speaking panelists leaving us with a small expert panel of 8 participants for the final consensus round. Furthermore, the study team moderating the development of the questionnaires and consensus meeting were all based in a university and/or clinical settings located in Flanders. As such, the results are therefore biased towards expert views of panelists from the Flemish region (i.e. Flanders) of Belgium. However, given the rather flexible nature of a Delphi study to determine sample size and heterogeneity based on the larger study aim and possible range of opinions, we believe that that concern of mathematical/statistical bias is limited."

This is a useful step towards identifying key items which must be targeted within the larger scope of providing non-urgent out-of-hours telephone triage services for older adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care. We hope that these findings will eventually be used for guiding quality improvements within the BHMR protocols used within the context of the 1733 service but also for similar OOH-TT settings internationally."
