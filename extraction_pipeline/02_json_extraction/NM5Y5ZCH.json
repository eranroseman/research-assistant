  "title": "TEXT4myBACK: A Text Message Intervention to Improve Function in People With Low Back Pain-Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Objective. The authors sought to describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial that will investigate the effects of the TEXT4myBACK self-management text message intervention compared with control in people with low back pain (LBP). Methods. A single-blind (assessor and statistician), randomized controlled trial with economic analysis and process evaluation will be conducted. A total of 304 people with non-specific LBP of less than 12 weeks will be enrolled and randomly allocated either to TEXT4myBACK intervention or control groups. The TEXT4myBACK intervention group will receive 4 semipersonalized text messages per week providing advice, motivation, and information about LBP, physical activity, sleep, mood, use of care, and medication during 12 weeks. The control group will receive 1 text message with a link to a LBP and diet online information package. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome will be function assessed with the Patient-Specific Functional Scale. Secondary outcomes will include pain intensity, physical activity participation, sedentary behavior, global impression of change, health-related quality of life, and eHealth literacy. Data on demographic characteristics, smallest worthwhile change (ie, smallest function scored needed to be achieved at the end of the intervention to consider it to be worthwhile), health care utilization, and adverse events (ie, any new health issue that occurs during participation in the study) will be collected. An economic and process evaluation will also be conducted. Impact. This study will assess if a self-management text message intervention is effective and cost-effective in improving function of people with LBP. This study can inform clinical practice of a simple, scalable, and affordable intervention for managing LBP.",

      "text": "Low back pain (LBP) is the greatest cause of disability worldwide  1  and is associated with great societal and economic burden.  2  Its economic burden is equivalent to the burden of other chronic non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.  3 To illustrate, LBP and neck pain led to approximately USD 134.5 billion in health care expenditures, the highest in the United States in 2016.  4 LBP is also related to greater risks of mortality  5  and higher numbers of comorbidities,  6  which further contribute to its burden.\n\nScientific evidence highlights the need to develop affordable interventions for LBP and to provide advice, education, and self-management as first-line care.  2  Mobile Health could represent innovative and scalable solutions to provide selfmanagement strategies. Text messages are the most studied Mobile Health interventions in promotion, management, and monitoring of health  7  due to their widespread use, minimal costs, and low technology-related knowledge requirements.  [7] [8] 8] [9]  Evidence-based text messages are effective selfmanagement strategies for various health conditions, such as HIV,  10  diabetes,  11  and cardiovascular disease.  12 They also improve behavior and help people to increase physical activity participation,  13  quit smoking,  14  and improve weight management.  15 Text messages are cost-effective  16  and considered useful, engaging, and easy to understand by patients.  17 They could represent a simple and scalable intervention for LBP. However, although previous studies reported some positive effects of digital self-management interventions on pain and other health-related outcomes in people with LBP,  18  only interventions delivered by websites and mobile applications were assessed, and no study investigated the use of text messages. Moreover, a recent systematic review appraised the literature on the effects of text message interventions on musculoskeletal pain, and none of the included studies have included patients with LBP.  19 EXT4myBACK is a self-management text message intervention developed through an evidence-based  20, 21  iterative process involving clinicians, researchers, consumers, and consumer advocates.  22 A preliminary cohort pilot study was conducted with people with LBP seeking care from community pharmacists to assess the feasibility of the methodological procedures and the delivery of the text message intervention to be implemented in a future randomized clinical trial. Ten people with LBP were recruited via community pharmacists (n = 1) and social media advertisements (n = 9). Participants completed the online consent form and online surveys and received the text messages as planned. Recruitment via social media and online consent form and data collection approaches were found to be feasible. The messages were well accepted: 70% of participants considered the messages to be informative, motivational, and educational and would like to receive them again. This study describes the protocol of the randomized controlled trial that will investigate the effects of the TEXT4myBACK intervention compared with control in people with LBP."

The messages were developed through an iterative process previously described involving researchers, health care professionals, consumers, and consumer representatives (being published elsewhere).  22 Message content is based on behavior change methodology,  27  including provision of information and encouragement, prompting about consequences, intention formation, monitoring selfbehavior, barrier identification, advice about setting graded tasks, strategies aimed at relapse prevention, and the use of prompting and cues. This methodology has been used in an effective self-management text message intervention.  28 ome messages will be semi-personalized and include the participant's preferred contact name (Table ). The messages are further personalized by targeting their content using an algorithm derived from the key domains (ie, physical activity, education, sleep, mood, use of care, and medication) and according to symptom duration (0-6 weeks vs 6-12 weeks), presence of sleep issues, volume of physical activity (<150 minutes vs \u2265150 minutes of moderatevigorous physical activity), work characteristics (sedentary vs active), and consumption of medication for LBP at baseline. Messages are sent on randomly selected days including weekends but excluding public holidays at random time slots: 9 am, 12:30 pm, 4 pm, and 6 pm. Sleep-related messages are tagged to be sent at 6 pm and some physical activity messages at 9 am. The message delivery is managed by customized software (TextQStream V4, Python V.3.6) as previously described  29  using REDCap as user interface.\n\nThe messages are designed to be delivered 1-way (to the participant only). Participants can reply to them but are informed that they will not receive a reply in return. Participants can reply \"STOP\" at any time if they wish to stop receiving the messages. If a \"STOP\" message is received, the research team will confirm with the participant if they wish to stop the messages or withdraw from the study."

Automated email reminders are sent, and participants are called at 10 days if the surveys are not completed.\n\nPrimary Outcome 1) Function: Assessed with the Patient-Specific Functional Scale.  31 Participants identify 3 important activities they are unable to do or have difficulty with as a result of their LBP. They will rate each activity using a numerical rating scale of 0 to 10 (0 = unable to perform the activity; 10 = able to perform the activity to the same level as before the injury or/problem).  31 condary Outcomes 1) Average pain intensity during the past week: Participants rate their average pain in the preceding week with a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (0 = no pain; 100 = worst pain possible).  32 ) Physical activity engagement: Participants complete the Active Australia Questionnaire, which contains 8 questions related to physical activity performance in the preceding week. Participants record the number of times and the estimated time spent in each activity.  33 ) Sedentary behavior: Participants answer the Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire, which contains 9 questions relating to time spent in sedentary activities on weekdays, which are repeated for weekend days and scored on a 9-point Likert scale. 34 4) Participant's global impression of change: Participants rate their perceived improvements or deterioration using an 11-point numerical rating scale (-5 = vastly worse; +5 = completely recovered).  35 5) ) Health-related quality of life: Participants complete the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, which is a validated questionnaire  36  to describe and value an individual's health recommended within musculoskeletal populations. 37  It assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and emotional health with 5 response levels to each question. It also rates the individual's perception of their health on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = worst health; 100 = best health).\n\nThe final score provides an overall indicator of healthrelated quality of life.  36 6) ) eHealth Literacy: Participants answer the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire, which is a validated questionnaire that evaluates patients' health literacy gaining a broad profile of their education on health and self-management strategies. The questionnaire consists of 7 different domains, which have 4 to 6 questions each.  38 her Patient Data to Be Collected 1) Descriptive data: demographic characteristics (ie, age, sex, living arrangements, height, weight, employment status, level of education, sleep issues, and medication use), LBP duration, symptom distribution, and comorbidities (Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire  39  ) are assessed at baseline."

It is overviewed by a Steering Committee with a large experience in the conduct of randomized controlled trials. The current protocol is V4 (11/12/2019) and adheres with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council ethical guidelines for human research. Changes to the protocol will be submitted to the ethics committee and approval will be granted before implementation."

      "text": "This manuscript describes the design of the first, to our knowledge, randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a self-management text message intervention for people with LBP. The messages are evidence based, theoretically grounded, and were well accepted and considered useful by consumers in the feasibility study. The methodological procedures were tested and found to be feasible.\n\nGiven that the text messages are in English and will be delivered only to Australians, the generalization of the results to other populations, languages, and cultures is uncertain. Nonetheless, if proven effective, this intervention can be easily implemented in clinical practice. It can also provide scientific support for the future development of self-management text message interventions within the musculoskeletal field."
