  "abstract": "Objective: High variability has been observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) incidence rates (IRs) in childhood. The aim of this study was to characterize DM1 in Arag \u00f3n and to identify variations in the geographical pattern by gender. Methods: A descriptive and ecological study was conducted to determine geographical variations in the DM1 incidence for the period 1991-2009. The source of information was the registry of DM1. To determine data completeness, a capture-recapture analysis was performed. Cases were georeferenced according to the Basic Healthcare Area (BHA) of residence. IRs for both genders, age group, 5 yr of diagnosis, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Geographical pattern was studied applying Bayesian statistical model. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), smoothed SIR, and the posteriori risk probability (PRP) were represented cartographically for BHA stratified by gender. Results: The completeness was 93.5%. The global IR was 19.2 cases/10 5 person-years (95% CI: 17.6-20.8), boys 21.4 (95% CI: 19.0-23.8) and girls 16.8 (95% CI: 14.7-19.1). The age-specific rates were significantly lower in the 0-4 year age group with respect to the groups of 5-9 and 10-14 years. For boys, areas with a statistically significant excess of risk were found in the north [smoothed SIR: 118-167.9 and PRP of what the smoothed SIR would be greater than 100 (PRP) above 0.8] and below average risk in the south (smoothed SIR: 65.9-79.1 and PRP less than 0.2). Conclusions: DM1 IR presented a north-south geographical pattern in boys.",

      "text": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, which triggers an absolute deficit of insulin  (1) (2) (3) (4) . It is the most frequent endocrinological disease in childhood (0-14 yr)  (4) . The highest incidence rate (IR) is in the 10-to 14-yr-old age group, coinciding with the onset of puberty  (1) .\n\nThe IR of DM1 in childhood shows great variability worldwide  (1, 2, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . The highest rates are seen in Finland and Sardinia (Italy) with 40.0 and 37.8 cases/10 5 inhabitants, respectively, and the lowest in Venezuela and China with 0.1 cases/10 5 inhabitants  (1) . The IR varies even within the same country; thus, for example, in Spain, in the Castilla Le \u00f3n region, the IR was 22.2/10 5 inhabitants in the period  2003-2004 (4) , in Madrid, 15.9 cases/10 5 inhabitants in the period 1997-2005  (11) , and in Catalonia, 14.4 cases/10 5 inhabitants during the period 1989-1998  (3) .\n\nIn general, the boy/girl ratio is about 1, although a high prevalence in girls is reported in countries of low incidence and in boys in countries of higher incidence  (1) (2) (3) .\n\nSpatial epidemiology allows us to analyze the geographical distribution of diseases. The geographical area may be considered as a health factor  (12, 13) , because individual determinants and contextual factors are structured at this level. These may be analyzed by means of ecological studies permitting a closer approach than individual studies  (12) . One of the aims of spatial epidemiology is to detect areas with a different risk of disease that allows us to generate etiological hypotheses facilitating the definition of healthcare policies and assignation of resources  (12) .\n\nMultiple studies have been published on the spatial representation of DM1 and some show geographical variations of the IR  (1, 4, 5, 14) . One of the reasons that have been proposed for these variations is the differences in the distribution of genetic risk. Although the proportion of new cases in patients with this risk has diminished (1, 2), there might be environmental factors able to trigger DM1 in genotypes that would not have developed the disease in other areas  (1, 2) . It is thought that DM1 is the result of complex interaction between genetic predisposition, the immunological system, and environmental factors  (15) .\n\nVarious ecological studies relate DM1 to socioeconomic status or to the place of residence, with differences between rural and urban areas  (1, 2, 10, 16, 17) , latitude and UV radiation exposure  (18, 19)  with highest IR in rural areas and in the north, as well as to exposure to infectious agents during the fetal, neonatal, and infancy stages as enterovirus infection, with inconsistent results  (15, 20) . In addition, the case-control studies performed on the association of DM1 with other variables, such as low weight at birth, exposure to viruses and other pathogens during pregnancy or dietetic factors such as the early consumption of cow's milk, do not conclusively demonstrate the influence of the variables on the increase of the risk of suffering DM1  (1, 2, 21) .\n\nArag \u00f3n is a region of Spain, with 1 346 293 inhabitants (January 2011), where 13.7% were children under 15 yrs. It is situated in northeastern Spain, which has a maximum latitude of 42 \u2022 55 30 , corresponding to the municipality of Ans \u00f3, in the north, and the minimum latitude is 39 \u2022 50 42 for the municipality of Abejuela, in the south of Arag \u00f3n (ETRS89 coordinates, with a maximum error of 0.2 s sexagesimal).\n\nApproximately half the population lives in the capital, Zaragoza, and there are only three municipalities with over 30 000 inhabitants.\n\nIn Spain, and Arag \u00f3n, the Basic Healthcare Area (BHA) is the geographical area where the equipment of primary care gives sanitary attention. In January 2009, Arag \u00f3n had 122 BHAs. The population of the BHAs ranged from 909 inhabitants (BHA: Abiego, in the north of Arag \u00f3n) to 38 962 inhabitants (BHA: Sagasta-Ruise \u00f1ores in the Zaragoza city).\n\nIn order to determine the epidemiology and to monitor trends in DM1 in children, in 1991 a population-based registry of DM1 in less than 15-yr-olds was created in Arag \u00f3n.\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the DM1 in children under 15 in Arag \u00f3n with sociodemographic variables from 1991 to 2009 and to represent geographically, identifying possible variations in the geographical pattern by gender.\n\nTo date, few studies have investigated the geographical variation by gender in the world."

      "text": "Two types of studies were conducted: a descriptive study to analyze the sociodemographic variables and an ecological study to determine the geographical variations of incident cases in the period 1991-2009.\n\nThe main source of information used was the Register of Arag \u00f3n of DM1.\n\nThe register collects data from primary sources: endocrinology services (of all the public hospitals of Arag \u00f3n and, on occasions from neighboring regions), and secondary sources: primary care pediatricians, private clinics and mutual health insurance companies, the Society of Endocrinology of Arag \u00f3n, diabetes associations, and summer camps for diabetes patients.\n\nThe case definition followed updated international criteria and included new diagnoses of DM1 in patients under 15 yr of age who had been living in Arag \u00f3n for at least 6 months before the diagnosis  (22) .\n\nThe cases were collected by means of an annual posted questionnaire in fulfillment of the current legislation of data protection.\n\nSince 2005, every year, an active search for cases is performed using the hospital discharge data, selecting those patients who fulfilled the definition of an established case and including them in the register.\n\nIn each case, the variables studied were as follows: gender, age at diagnosis (grouped in 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 yr old), and year of incidence (grouped in 5 yr). The cases were georeferenced to municipality of residence [grouped in urban and rural under 30 000 (inhabitants)] and BHA of residence.\n\nFrom 2005, hospital discharges were added as a new information source. This then made it necessary to explore potentially lost cases up to that year and include them into the register, as done in other countries  (17) . So, to determine the completeness of the registry, a capture-recapture analysis  (23) (24) (25) (26)  was performed between 1997 and 2005. Analysis did not include cases before 1997 because the quality of hospital data was unreliable.\n\nIn the descriptive analysis were calculated: the number of cases in all periods for both genders and stratified on gender; IR in all periods for both genders and stratified on gender, by age group of diagnosis and by 5 yr of incidence as well as 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\nThe person-years included in the study period were 2 765 963 (extracted from User Data Base of the healthcare system of Arag \u00f3n) of which 51.3% were boys.\n\nThe ecological study was made considering the BHA of residence as the unit of analysis. The study was realized for children and then was stratified on gender. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were obtained for each BHA, using the DM1 IR in boys, girls, and both genders under 15 yrs out of the total for Arag \u00f3n during the study period as reference rate. The SIRs are defined as O i /E i \u00d7 100 where O i is the number of cases observed in the BHA i , and E i is the number of cases expected in the BHA calculated by indirect standardization with reference to the IR of Arag \u00f3n.\n\nIn addition, the smoothed SIRs of DM1 in each BHA were calculated and had a 90% credibility interval.\n\nThe great variation of SIRs in low-populated areas bears great influence on the spatial patterns as shown in the disease maps. Hence the Bayesian statistical model was chosen for the calculation of smoothed SIRs of DM1 in each BHA  (27) , using the model proposed by Besag, York, and Mollie (BYM). This method includes two random effects: spatial dependence and heterogeneity  (12, 28, 29) . The BYM model is specified as a generalized linear mixed model with a Poisson response variable considering the expected cases as offset\n\nwhere O i is the number of cases observed in the BHA i , E i is the number of cases expected in the BHA, \u03bc i is the relative risk of the BHA i , v i is the non-spatial random effect, and S i is the spatial random effect.\n\nThe non-spatial random effect is supposed to be distributed normally with mean 0 and constant variance. In the spatial random effect, a conditional autoregressive model  (30, 31)  is used, which approaches spatial dependence as an average of the spatial effect of the neighboring BHAs.\n\nThe estimation of smoothed SIRs was assessed through the mean of the posterior distribution and its 95% credibility interval. This distribution was obtained by using Monte Carlo methods based on the Markov   1  and  2 ) a statistic was added to the models that permitted the calculation of the expected number of BHA with zero observations and a credibility interval of 90% for this number. This additional information allows us to evaluate if the Poisson models used are compatible with the available data or if, on the contrary, there is a problem of 'excess zeros' that invalidates the models  (33) . However, other authors consider the model proposed by BYM as the best model in spite of this problem  (12) . The SIRs and smoothed SIRs were represented on the map divided into septiles with a range of grey colors. The territory of Zaragoza city has been extended in the representation of the maps.\n\nIn order to appreciate the distribution and range of values of the SIRs, the probability density function was"

By capture-recapture analysis 240 cases were calculated with an estimated 95% CI: 238-243 cases. The completeness of recording of diabetes so far was 93.5% and that of hospital admissions was 89.3%. By incorporating both sources of information, we get a completeness of 99.3%.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2009, 535 incident cases were registered, of which 307 were boys and 228 were girls. The IR global was 19.2 cases/10 5 person-years (95% CI: 17.6-20.8). The age-specific rates in the entire period are significantly lower in the 0-4 age group with respect to the groups of 5-9 and 10-14 yrs (Fig.  1 ). In the last period, 2006-2009, rates are higher although not statistically significant (Fig.  1 ).\n\nBy gender, the IR for boys was 21.4 (95% CI: 19.0-23.8) and for girls was 16.8 (95% CI: 14.7-19.1) cases/10 5 person-years. The ratio of boys/girls was 1.26. The IR is lower in girls than in boys (Table  3 ).

Thirty-seven BHAs were found with no cases (30.3%), the majority of which were concentrated in the province of Teruel, in the south of Arag \u00f3n (Fig.  5 ). The credibility interval at 90% of the number of BHA with null cases of posterior distribution ranged from 32 to 46.\n\nThe result of smoothing may be appreciated from the probability density function of the smoothed SIRs (Fig.  6 ).\n\nThe highest values of the smoothed SIRs were found in the northern half of the Community and in some areas of the capital, Zaragoza (West Actur and Oliver). The lowest values were concentrated in the southern half (Fig.  6 ).\n\nThe PRP showed excess risk in 15 BHA: to the north in Jaca, Hecho, Sabi \u00f1anigo, Ainsa, the area of Cinco Villas (S\u00e1daba and Ejea), in the northeast zone surrounding Zaragoza (Zuera, Almudever, Gra \u00f1\u00e9n, Villamayor, Alfajar\u00edn, and Fuentes de Ebro) and Zaragoza: Actur Oeste, Oliver, and Bombarda. It showed risk defect in areas further south and Illueca, Morata, La Almunia, and Cari \u00f1ena (Fig.  7 ).\n\nIn girls, the SIR values ranged from 0 to 1011.2. Forty-one BHAs (33.6%) were found with no cases, distributed all over the region (Fig.  8 ). The 90% credibility interval of the number of BHAs with null cases of posterior distribution ranged from 38 to 54.\n\nThe result of smoothing can be seen from the probability density function of the smoothed SIRs (Fig.  9 ).\n\nThe highest values of the smoothed SIRs were concentrated in Zaragoza and its surroundings (Fig.  9 );  however, no areas were seen with excess or defect risk on performing the PRP (Fig.  10 )."

      "text": "During childhood, a high variability in DM1 IR has been observed, even within the same country. Previous studies have explored DM1 rates for both genders together, probably because DM1 presents a ratio close to 1. There was no consistency in previous works that analyzed it separately. (1, 3, 11)  In our study, IR presents an intermediate value with respect to other European countries and slightly higher than other Spanish regions. An increasing trend during the period of analysis can be observed, although it was not statistically significant. In other studies, trends remain stable, as in the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain) for the period 1997-2005  (11)  as well as in other countries, mainly in northern Europe  (35) , but there are studies that show that the IR is increasing  (9, 15, (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) . The 0-4-year age group presented lower IR than 5-9 and 10-14-year age groups.

It was also observed that, in boys, the DM1 IR presented a clear geographical pattern, decreasing from north to south, with the highest smoothed SIRs in the north of the region. This north-south pattern was not repeated in the case of girls or for both genders considered together. In girls, when both genders were analyzed together, neither geographical pattern, nor areas with low or high risk, could be observed. In a study conducted in Catalonia, areas with an excess of risk were observed for boys and girls without any geographical distribution. An area with low risk for girls was also identified. (3) . One of the strengths of the study lies in the exhaustive collection of DM1 cases, which is why we may assume sSIR [ 65.9, 79.1) [ 79.1, 84.8) [ 84.8, 90.9) [ 90.9, 99.5) [ 99.5,118.0) [118.0,134.0) [134.0,167.9] Density function of the smoothed SIRs 0 50 100 150 200 250 0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 0.020 0.025 sSIR Density Fig. 6.

In Aragon, there is a DM1 Registry since 1991. From 2005, all new cases of DM1 are registered exhaustively, by systematic search. In this work, all cases up to 2005 with no previous registration have been included using capture-recapture methods. Geographical referencing was possible in almost all the cases. This fact demonstrates that the differences found in the disease pattern are not due to disparities in the collection of data  (17) .\n\nSpatial analyses are a powerful tool to develop hypothesis about DM1 risk factors that can be distributed differently in geography. Furthermore, when indirect methods are applied to adjust rates in each BHA, wide CIs are obtained. Bayesian models BYM are a good alternative in these situations. These models allow the identification of geographical PRP [0.0,0.1) [0.1,0.2) [0.2,0.8) [0.8,0.9) [0.9,1.0] Fig.  7 .

With this methodology, smoothed SIRs are obtained, and the significance of the SIR using the posteriori probability risk (PPR) can be observed. In this sense, a PPR > 0.8 indicates an excess of risk and a low risk when PPR < 0.2.\n\nA limitation of the study is the lack of analysis by period of time. However, if shorter periods of time were included, the number of BHAs with zero cases would increase. This means there is a consequent risk of not being compatible with the model used by BYM, because of a possible change in the Poisson distribution. It also should be mentioned that this type of geographical analysis is designed for the study of small areas and BHAs are not the smallest geographical\n\nsSIR [ 86.0, 92.5) [ 92.5, 93.8) [ 93.8, 95.7) [ 95.7, 97.6) [ 97.6, 99.2) [ 99.2,104.8) [104.8,119.6] Density function of the smoothed 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 sSIR Density Fig. 9.

However, there are previous experiences where this unit of study has been used for analysis in cities  (43) . A potential benefit of using the BHA as a unit of study, field of action of Primary Care\n\nTeams, is that it may facilitate the inclusion in the analysis of triggering factors which affect the two genders differently, with higher influence on boys, and which may explain the DM1 IR variation in children under 15 yrs. Also, Primary Healthcare Teams could benefit from the introduction of specific public health programs or healthcare campaigns derived from this kind of studies. This study is the first work developed in Arag \u00f3n, and the first study in Europe where data from so many years have been included. In addition, up to date, no references about the different pattern for boys exist in the literature, which reports the same degree of geographical variation for both genders  (4, 14) , or the existence of grouping cases for girls  (44) .\n\nThe identification of geographical variations in DM1 IRs according to gender, the same as in other pathologies, may not be ignored in later studies which should include it as an essential variable in this type of study. It is necessary to identify and evaluate the possible triggering factors of DM1 and their geographical distribution which would provide evidence for hypotheses that may be presented."
