  "title": "A Randomized Pilot Trial of a Text Messaging Intervention for Sleep Improvement and Weight Control in Emerging Adults",
  "abstract": "Objective: Text messaging is a promising weight loss intervention modality for emerging adults who are overweight, but few studies exist to guide intervention development. Furthermore, sleep is emerging as a salient intervention target for weight management. This study examines feasibility and acceptability of two text messaging interventions for weight control in emerging adults, one of which includes sleep intervention content. Methods: Forty-three emerging adults who were overweight (BMI \u2265 25 , 30; ages 18-21) were randomized to receive either a text messaging intervention focused on diet and physical activity change, or a text messaging intervention designed to modify sleep behavior plus diet and physical activity. The interventions included motivational interviewing, education around health behaviors, physical activity, and dietary goal setting, as well as sleep goals for those in the sleep condition. All participants self-monitored diet, physical activity, and weight via text message for 3 months; those in the sleep intervention monitored nightly sleep duration. Results: Intervention acceptability and engagement were high for both conditions. In exploratory analyses, we observed that body mass index remained stable across assessments, regardless of condition. Participants in the sleep modification condition showed significantly greater sleep duration from pre-to post-intervention than those in the standard intervention. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a weight loss intervention delivered by text messaging, including components designed to improve sleep, is acceptable and feasible for emerging adults who are overweight, and that extended sleep duration may be a benefit of the sleep modification intervention. \n Implications for Impact Statement This study provides support for the feasibility and acceptability of a text messaging intervention combining traditional behavioral weight loss strategies with sleep intervention in emerging adults. Results also suggest that a weight loss intervention targeting sleep improvements may increase sleep duration.",

      "text": "Emerging adulthood, a developmental window including individuals ages 18-25, represents a sensitive period for establishing life-long health behavior patterns which influence risk for weight gain and development of obesity  (Barbour-Tuck et al., 2018) . However, behavioral weight loss interventions for emerging adults have received limited research attention despite the fact that this period represents an optimal time for prevention and intervention given that emerging adults are developing weight-related habits that they generally maintain over the life course  (Nelson et al., 2008) . Preliminary studies suggest that weight management interventions delivered via text messaging are feasible and effective in reducing body mass index among emerging adults  (Laska et al., 2009) . Moreover, text messaging interventions utilizing automatically generated individualized feedback as a part of a weight management program enhance weight loss outcomes above and beyond standard of care interventions and waitlist control  (Jensen et al., 2019; Napolitano et al., 2013) , though this novel intervention approach is just beginning to be examined in emerging adults  (Shoneye et al., 2019) . College campuses are an ideal environment for providing health promotion interventions to this population given that nearly 40% of United States emerging adults are enrolled in post-secondary education (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2022) and risk for weight gain is elevated during college enrollment  (Vadeboncoeur et al., 2015)  A separate literature highlights the association between sleep behaviors and weight outcomes. Specifically, poorer sleep has been consistently associated with obesity risk among adolescents and adults  (Miller et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2014) . Emerging adults who sleep less than 7 hr per night are at increased risk for obesity  (Hart et al., 2013) , while those who obtain adequate sleep are less likely to gain weight during the first-semester at a university  (Ludy et al., 2018; Roane et al., 2015) . This is salient, as up to 60% of college students report poor sleep quality  (Lund et al., 2010) , with two-thirds of the college population sleeping less than 8 hr per night  (Whipps et al., 2018) . No published studies have examined the efficacy of a mobile health sleep intervention for weight loss in an emerging adult population.\n\nThis present study is the first to evaluate two text-message weight loss interventions in emerging adults at high risk for development of obesity. Because the study was conceptualized as an obesity prevention feasibility/acceptability trial, we designed the interventions for emerging adults with overweight rather than for those with obesity. The two intervention conditions included (a) a standard weight loss text message intervention consisting of standard diet and physical activity behavior change components (STANDARD) and (b) a weight loss text message intervention addressing all content presented in the STANDARD intervention plus additional intervention addressing sleep behavior (SLEEP). The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of each intervention modality using both quantitative measures and qualitative interviews. Based on findings from a similar text-message intervention study conducted with adolescents  (Jensen et al., 2019) , we hypothesized that emerging adults would find the text-messaging intervention feasible and highly acceptable. Additional exploratory analyses determined whether each intervention modality was associated with reductions in BMI and/or changes in objective and self-reported measures of sleep duration and quality."

All interventions were provided on a university campus in the Western United States across a 2-year period. All participants completed a pre-treatment assessment including completing all study questionnaires and measuring height and weight. Following this assessment, participants were fitted with an accelerometer (Actigraph GT3x+) and asked to wear the monitor on their non-dominant hip for 5 days, both day and night (only removing the device when swimming or bathing). Data gathered from accelerometers were used to assess baseline sleep parameters. All study procedures occurred during the academic year, not during summer months.\n\nAt the end of the 5-day baseline assessment period, participants attended a single in-person visit with a clinical psychology doctoral student lasting 50-70 min. The visit consisted of a brief motivational interview and a weight control behavior skills development intervention. The motivational interviewing techniques included in the intervention comprised eliciting client motivation for change, assessing potential barriers to behavior change, and amplifying ambivalence about behavior change. The skills building content for weight control behavior change included self-monitoring, stimulus control, reinforcement, and social support. Furthermore, participants received instruction regarding, and were asked to adhere to, Epstein's Stoplight Eating Plan  (Epstein & Squires, 1988) . Additionally, participants were instructed to increase their moderate physical activity to a minimum of 60 min per day. Participants monitored these behaviors via text messaging by reporting four key health behaviors daily: (a) number of servings of Red foods consumed, (b) number of servings of Green foods consumed, (c) minutes of physical activity engagement, and (d) current weight. Research assistants confirmed that the study participants had access to a scale. To provide an incentive to text daily, participants were reimbursed $1.00 for each nightly text they sent."

Additionally, they received three automated text messages per day, corresponding to mealtimes (i.e., 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 5 p.m.), over the course of 3 months. Text messages addressed eating (e.g., \"Eat your vegetables!\" All parents say it. We hate when they're right, but it's true. Fruits and vegetables help fight disease and help you lose weight) and physical activity (e.g., It's much easier to exercise when someone does it with you. Could you ask your mom to exercise with you a few days each week?) behaviors and were selected from a text message library developed by  Woolford et al. (2010)  containing 90 unique messages with evidence-based intervention content that utilize motivational interviewing principles. The automated computer text-messaging system, created by our research team to aggregate self-report data and deliver text messages to participants, used the information that participants texted to determine which of the 90 messages to send to the participant. Using a priori thresholding, we increased the ratio of messages targeting individually identified problem behaviors (e.g., participants who reported low green food consumption received more messages encouraging eating green foods). Text messages were spaced in such a way to avoid immediate repetition."

Specifically, this intervention addressed adhering to sleep hygiene behaviors, establishing consistent sleep and wake times, and creating healthy sleep associations. Participants in the SLEEP condition set the goal to obtain 8 hr of sleep per night. Participants were also instructed to include the number of hours of sleep they obtained the previous night in their daily text message (in addition to the four key health behaviors described above). In addition to the three automated text messages sent per day (corresponding with mealtimes), participants in the SLEEP condition also received one text message each evening including information relevant to sleep behavior change. These text messages were selected automatically from a library of 83 messages developed by study staff using evidence-based sleep improvement strategies but were not tailored based on participant sleep self-reports (see Table  S1  in the online supplemental materials)."

Discrepancies smaller than 60 min were resolved by averaging the in-bed and out-of-bed times between the two initial coders. Data were excluded if no movement was noted throughout the night.

Quantitative study outcomes were relatively normally distributed, and no significant outliers were noted. Missing data were handled with list-wise deletion. For the qualitative analyses, NVivo 12 (Melbourne, Australia) was used. Transcribed interviews were examined by two research assistants for similarities across response types using an open coding system; if several instances of similar response patterns were noted, the responses were then coded within a central theme. We used a grounded theory approach  (Walker & Myrick, 20067)  to allow for participant responses to guide the coding process, rather than use a predetermined coding system. Responses were allowed to be coded under multiple themes. Intercoder reliability was high (Cohen's \u03ba = 0.96). When there were discrepancies between the two coders on a response, the two coders met together to discuss the discrepancy until a mutually agreed upon code was established. In instances where a mutual agreement could not be met, a third coder was used to resolve discrepancies."

In general, there were no differences in treatment satisfaction or engagement with text messaging across the two treatment conditions, with relatively high engagement with the textmessaging system occurring in both conditions. Engagement with the text-messaging system was significantly higher than that observed with adolescent populations  (Jensen et al., 2019 ) and similar to or slightly higher than that observed in older adults  (Napolitano et al., 2013; Shapiro et al., 2012) . Furthermore, this text-messaging intervention appears feasible to administer to an emerging adult population for whom text messaging is a preferred form of communication  (Napolitano et al., 2013) . Findings from the qualitative acceptability analyses suggest that emerging adults generally found the interventions and the daily text messages to be helpful. Some found that the interventions were too difficult or overwhelming, particularly while navigating the early years of college. We received consistent feedback that the participants desired fewer texts per day with more diverse content and greater personalization. In a similar pilot study in adolescents, similar reports were endorsed  (Jensen et al., 2019) . Consistent with Woolford and colleagues' findings (2010), there was a strong desire across both conditions for greater information and resources about nutrition facts, exercise regimens, and meal plans. Almost half of our participants desired more involvement with study staff or other participants.\n\nGiven the results of our qualitative analyses, future interventions may benefit from more appointments with study staff throughout the intervention to increase accountability or using other means (e.g., social media) to foster additional accountability and comradery. Facebook groups in conjunction with text messaging and personalized feedback have been shown to be effective in enabling weight loss in college-aged students  (Napolitano et al., 2013) . Future work on improving the content of text messages is warranted, focusing on increasing personalization as well as providing resources to young adults through text messages."

      "title": "Exploratory Outcomes",
      "text": "Exploratory analyses were undertaken to examine whether a future, fully powered trial is warranted. These analyses should be interpreted with caution given that this pilot trial is not wellequipped to provide a robust test of intervention efficacy. We did not observe significant reductions in BMI in either condition across time. However, it is notable that for both conditions, BMI remained stable across the 6-month assessment period. This finding is encouraging, particularly as we intervened in a population with high risk for weight gain. Overall, our findings suggest that a text messaging intervention may help stabilize weight during a period of high risk for weight gain, though we acknowledge that our study was not initially designed with a weight-gain prevention approach. Furthermore, the sleep modification did not appear to make a difference in weight loss compared to the group without the sleep modification. A study that was similar in size and purpose to our study, but that employed a 12-week educational program rather than a mobile health intervention, found that participants in the sleep modification group lost weight at a faster rate than the group without sleep modification  (Logue et al., 2012) . It is possible 25.5 26 26.5 27.5 28 28.5 29 Pre-Treatment Post-Treatment 6-Month Follow-Up BMI Body Mass Index STANDARD SLEEP 400 420 440 460 480 500 Pre-Treatment Post-Treatment Minutes Sleep Duration STANDARD SLEEP p = 0.90 p = 0.001\n\nthat a simple text-messaging intervention including sleep components might not significantly improve sleep to the level required to subsequently lower weight. Interestingly, we found that sleep modification via a text-messaging intervention had a large effect on improving the sleep duration of emerging adults, with those in the SLEEP condition sleeping over 1 hr more following the intervention; those in the STANDARD condition had no significant change in their sleep. It is worth noting that those in the STANDARD condition did have greater sleep duration at baseline than those in the SLEEP condition (although this difference was not statistically significant), which may have resulted in a ceiling effect for sleep improvement. The improvement in sleep duration we observed in the SLEEP condition is comparable to the self-reported sleep improvement noted in a text-messaging intervention for improving sleep hygiene  (Gipson et al., 2019)  and to improvements in other health domains documented in the mobile health intervention literature  (Murawski et al., 2020) . Simple textmessage interventions appear to serve as a feasible method for promoting sleep behavior modification for emerging adults.\n\nThis study possesses several notable strengths, including a mixed method design allowing for qualitative characterization of acceptability, a novel, ecologically valid approach to intervention delivery, and attention to a relatively understudied population in the obesity prevention/ intervention literature. Conversely, several limitations should be considered when interpreting study findings. First, our sample size was small, which limited our power to detect differences between groups. Second, because feasibility/ acceptability of the STANDARD intervention has been demonstrated with an adolescent population  (Jensen et al., 2019)  we did not include a no-treatment control group in the present study. Similarly, we did not employ a waitlist control group, so we are unable to determine if the changes that we observed are attributable to natural history effects. Third, characteristics of our sample limit generalizability of this study, including the relatively homogenous study sample (i.e., mostly white, female young adults, overweight). Studies that include individuals across a diversity of social identities including race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersections of these identities will be important to assess whether this intervention would be similarly feasible/acceptable for diverse clients. Fourth, the lack of blinding of the interventionists may have impacted treatment delivery. Fifth, while the interview questions were open ended, they were leading, which may have resulted in demand characteristics in the responses. Sixth, we did not assess objective sleep outcomes after the post-treatment assessment, limiting conclusions about maintenance of treatment benefit. Seventh, we used waistworn accelerometers which can approximate total sleep time but may overestimate this variable and are inferior to wrist-worn devices and polysomnography for assessing sleep duration and quality  (Takeshima et al., 2014) ; we also did not control for time of the academic year for sleep assessment, which may have impacted young adult sleeping patterns. Eighth, it is possible that expectancy effects contributed to the finding that participants in the SLEEP condition had increases in sleep duration following the intervention period, given that the treatment conditions were not blinded to participants. Ninth, paying participants to self-report via text message may have produced overestimates of feasibility relative to what would be observed absent financial incentives. Tenth, we did not assess for use of medications which may have influenced sleep behavior. Finally, we did not use sleep diaries to corroborate sleep and wake times, which may have influenced our objective sleep outcomes."

      "title": "Study Implications",
      "text": "Both qualitative and quantitative satisfaction data suggest that emerging adults found the predominantly text message-delivered intervention to be acceptable and useful in their behavior change efforts. Given that emerging adults prefer communicating through text message over any other medium  (Napolitano et al., 2013) , this is an effective method for delivering intervention content. This intervention approach has the potential to increase the dissemination of the intervention because intervention intensity is low and intervention messaging is automated. Relatedly, the computerized delivery of text messages provides for customization of messages in response to behavior change (or lack thereof). Next, our findings suggest that including sleep modification content in our intervention improved sleep behavior. Our study results imply that fully powered studies of tailored text messaging interventions for emerging adults are warranted. Future research may also consider replicating this study for emerging adults who are at high risk for weight gain, but are still normal weight, to examine whether this lowintensity intervention would be effective in preventing weight gain  (Vella-Zarb & Elgar, 2009) ."
