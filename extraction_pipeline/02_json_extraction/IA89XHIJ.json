  "title": "The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews",
  "abstract": "The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.",

      "text": "Systematic reviews serve many critical roles. They can provide syntheses of the state of knowledge in a field, from which future research priorities can be identified; they can address questions that otherwise could not be answered by individual studies; they can identify problems in primary research that should be rectified in future studies; and they can generate or evaluate theories about how or why phenomena occur. Systematic reviews therefore generate various types of knowledge for different users of reviews (such as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers).  1 2  To ensure a systematic review is valuable to users, authors should prepare a transparent, complete, and accurate account of why the review was done, what they did (such as how studies were identified and selected) and what they found (such as characteristics of contributing studies and results of meta-analyses). Up-to-date reporting guidance facilitates authors achieving this.  3  The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement published in 2009 (hereafter referred to as PRISMA 2009)  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  is a reporting guideline designed to address poor reporting of systematic reviews.  11 The PRISMA 2009 statement comprised a checklist of 27 items recommended for reporting in systematic reviews and an \"explanation and elaboration\" paper  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]  providing additional reporting guidance for each item, along with exemplars of reporting. The recommendations have been widely endorsed and adopted, as evidenced by its co-publication in multiple journals, citation in over 60 000 reports (Scopus, August 2020), endorsement from almost 200 journals and systematic review organisations, and adoption in various disciplines. Evidence from observational studies suggests that use of the PRISMA 2009 statement is associated with more complete reporting of systematic reviews,  [17] [18] [19] [20]  although more could be done to improve adherence to the guideline.  21 any innovations in the conduct of systematic reviews have occurred since publication of the PRISMA 2009 statement. For example, technological advances have enabled the use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify relevant evidence,  [22] [23] [24]  methods have been proposed to doi: 10.1136/bmj.n71 | BMJ 2021;372:n71 | the bmj synthesise and present findings when meta-analysis is not possible or appropriate,  [25] [26] [27]  and new methods have been developed to assess the risk of bias in results of included studies.  28 29 Evidence on sources of bias in systematic reviews has accrued, culminating in the development of new tools to appraise the conduct of systematic reviews.  30 31 Terminology used to describe particular review processes has also evolved, as in the shift from assessing \"quality\" to assessing \"certainty\" in the body of evidence.  32 In addition, the publishing landscape has transformed, with multiple avenues now available for registering and disseminating systematic review protocols,  33 34  disseminating reports of systematic reviews, and sharing data and materials, such as preprint servers and publicly accessible repositories. To capture these advances in the reporting of systematic reviews necessitated an update to the PRISMA 2009 statement."

      "title": "Development of PRISMA 2020",
      "text": "A complete description of the methods used to develop PRISMA 2020 is available elsewhere.  35 We identified PRISMA 2009 items that were often reported incompletely by examining the results of studies investigating the transparency of reporting of published reviews.  17 21 36 37 We identified possible modifications to the PRISMA 2009 statement by reviewing 60 documents providing reporting guidance for systematic reviews (including reporting guidelines, handbooks, tools, and meta-research studies).  38 These reviews of the literature were used to inform the content of a survey with suggested possible modifications to the 27 items in PRISMA 2009 and possible additional items.\n\nRespondents were asked whether they believed we should keep each PRISMA 2009 item as is, modify it, or remove it, and whether we should add each additional item. Systematic review methodologists and journal editors were invited to complete the online survey (110 of 220 invited responded). We discussed proposed content and wording of the PRISMA 2020 statement, as informed by the review and survey results, at a 21-member, two-day, in-person meeting in September 2018 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Throughout 2019 and 2020, we circulated an initial draft and five revisions of the checklist and explanation and elaboration paper to co-authors for feedback. In April 2020, we invited 22 systematic reviewers who had expressed interest in providing feedback on the PRISMA 2020 checklist to share their views (via an online survey) on the layout and terminology used in a preliminary version of the checklist. Feedback was received from 15 individuals and considered by the first author, and any revisions deemed necessary were incorporated before the final version was approved and endorsed by all co-authors."

      "title": "Scope of the guideline",
      "text": "The PRISMA 2020 statement has been designed primarily for systematic reviews of studies that evaluate the effects of health interventions, irrespective of the design of the included studies. However, the checklist items are applicable to reports of systematic reviews evaluating other interventions (such as social or educational interventions), and many items are applicable to systematic reviews with objectives other than evaluating interventions (such as evaluating aetiology, prevalence, or prognosis). PRISMA 2020 is intended for use in systematic reviews that include synthesis (such as pairwise meta-analysis or other statistical synthesis methods) or do not include synthesis (for example, because only one eligible study is identified). The PRISMA 2020 items are relevant for mixed-methods systematic reviews (which include quantitative and qualitative studies), but reporting guidelines addressing the presentation and synthesis of qualitative data should also be consulted.  39 40 RISMA 2020 can be used for original systematic reviews, updated systematic reviews, or continually updated (\"living\") systematic reviews. However, for updated and living systematic reviews, there may be some additional considerations that need to be addressed. Where there is relevant content from other reporting guidelines, we reference these guidelines within the items in the explanation and elaboration paper  41  (such as PRISMA-Search 42 in items 6 and 7, Synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guideline  27  in item 13d). Box 1 includes a glossary of terms used throughout the PRISMA 2020 statement.\n\nPRISMA 2020 is not intended to guide systematic review conduct, for which comprehensive resources are available.  [43] [44] 4] [45] [46]  However, familiarity with PRISMA 2020 is useful when planning and conducting systematic reviews to ensure that all recommended information is captured. PRISMA 2020 should not be used to assess the conduct or methodological quality of systematic reviews; other tools exist for this purpose.  30 31 urthermore, PRISMA 2020 is not intended to inform the reporting of systematic review protocols, for which a separate statement is available (PRISMA for Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement  47 48  ). Finally, extensions to the PRISMA 2009 statement have been developed to guide reporting of network meta-analyses,  49  metaanalyses of individual participant data,  50  systematic reviews of harms,  51  systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies,  52  and scoping reviews  53  ; for these types of reviews we recommend authors report their review in accordance with the recommendations in PRISMA 2020 along with the guidance specific to the extension. content in PRISMA 2020 (table 2). A template PRISMA flow diagram is provided, which can be modified depending on whether the systematic review is original or updated (fig  1 ).\n\nWe recommend authors refer to PRISMA 2020 early in the writing process, because prospective consideration of the items may help to ensure that all the items are addressed. To help keep track of which items have been reported, the PRISMA statement website ( http://www.prisma-statement.  org/ ) includes fillable templates of the checklists to download and complete (also available in the data supplement on bmj.com). We have also created a web application that allows users to complete the checklist via a user-friendly interface  58  (available at  https://  prisma.shinyapps.io/checklist/  and adapted from the Transparency Checklist app  59  ). The completed checklist can be exported to Word or PDF. Editable templates of the flow diagram can also be downloaded from the PRISMA statement website.\n\nWe have prepared an updated explanation and elaboration paper, in which we explain why reporting of each item is recommended and present bullet points that detail the reporting recommendations (which we Box 1: Glossary of terms \u2022 Systematic review-A review that uses explicit, systematic methods to collate and synthesise findings of studies that address a clearly formulated question  43  \u2022 Statistical synthesis-The combination of quantitative results of two or more studies. This encompasses meta-analysis of effect estimates (described below) and other methods, such as combining P values, calculating the range and distribution of observed effects, and vote counting based on the direction of effect (see McKenzie and Brennan  25  for a description of each method) \u2022 Meta-analysis of effect estimates-A statistical technique used to synthesise results when study effect estimates and their variances are available, yielding a quantitative summary of results 25 \u2022 Outcome-An event or measurement collected for participants in a study (such as quality of life, mortality) \u2022 Result-The combination of a point estimate (such as a mean difference, risk ratio, or proportion) and a measure of its precision (such as a confidence/credible interval) for a particular outcome \u2022 Report-A document (paper or electronic) supplying information about a particular study.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Use of PRISMA 2020 has the potential to benefit many stakeholders. Complete reporting allows readers to assess the appropriateness of the methods, and therefore the trustworthiness of the findings. Presenting and summarising characteristics of studies contributing to a synthesis allows healthcare providers and policy makers to evaluate the applicability of the findings to their setting. Describing the certainty in the body of evidence for an outcome and the implications of findings should help policy makers, managers, and other decision makers formulate appropriate recommendations for practice or policy. Complete reporting of all PRISMA 2020 items also facilitates replication and review updates, as well as inclusion of systematic reviews in overviews (of systematic reviews) and guidelines, so teams can leverage work that is already done and decrease research waste.  36 62 63 e updated the PRISMA 2009 statement by adapting the EQUATOR Network's guidance for developing health research reporting guidelines.  64 We evaluated the reporting completeness of published systematic reviews,  17 21 36 37  reviewed the items included in other documents providing guidance for systematic reviews,  38  surveyed systematic review methodologists and journal editors for their views on how to revise the original PRISMA statement,  35  discussed the findings at an in-person meeting, and prepared this document through an iterative process. Our recommendations are informed by the reviews and survey conducted before the in-person meeting, theoretical considerations about which items facilitate replication and help users assess the risk of bias and applicability of systematic reviews, and co-authors' experience with authoring and using systematic reviews.\n\nVarious strategies to increase the use of reporting guidelines and improve reporting have been proposed. They include educators introducing reporting guidelines into graduate curricula to promote good reporting habits of early career scientists  65  ; journal editors and regulators endorsing use of reporting guidelines  18  ; peer reviewers evaluating adherence to reporting guidelines  61 66  ; journals requiring authors to indicate where in their manuscript they have adhered to each reporting item  67  ; and authors using online writing tools that prompt complete reporting at the writing stage.  60 Multi-pronged interventions, where more than one of these strategies are combined, may be more effective (such as completion of checklists coupled with editorial checks).  68 However, of 31 interventions proposed to increase adherence to reporting guidelines, the effects of only 11 have been evaluated, mostly in observational studies at high risk of bias due to confounding.  69 It is therefore unclear which strategies should be used. Future research might explore barriers and facilitators to the use of PRISMA 2020 by authors, editors, and peer reviewers, designing interventions that address the identified barriers, and evaluating those interventions using randomised trials. To inform possible revisions to the guideline, it would also be valuable to conduct think-aloud studies  70  to understand how systematic reviewers interpret the items, and reliability studies to identify items where there is varied interpretation of the items.\n\nWe encourage readers to submit evidence that informs any of the recommendations in PRISMA 2020 (via the PRISMA statement website:  http://www.  prisma-statement.org/ ). To enhance accessibility of PRISMA 2020, several translations of the guideline are under way (see available translations at the PRISMA statement website). We encourage journal editors and publishers to raise awareness of PRISMA 2020 (for example, by referring to it in journal \"Instructions to authors\"), endorsing its use, advising editors and peer reviewers to evaluate submitted systematic reviews against the PRISMA 2020 checklists, and making changes to journal policies to accommodate the new reporting recommendations. We recommend existing PRISMA extensions  47 49 50 51-53 71 72  be updated to reflect PRISMA 2020 and advise developers of new PRISMA extensions to use PRISMA 2020 as the foundation document."
