  "abstract": "Background: In clinical setting, current standard-of-care does not include genetic testing for patients with low ( < 50 mg/dL) and extremely low ( < 20 mg/dL) levels of serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). Objective: We aimed identify the underlying molecular cause -both monogenic and polygenic -of low and extremely low LDL-C levels in a cohort of patients presenting to specialty lipid clinics. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was done in patients with low or extremely low LDL-C not due to any secondary causes. Results: Nine patients (4 women), ranging in age from 25 to 63 years old, with low or extremely low LDL-C levels were evaluated. Median LDL-C was 16 mg/dL (range undetectable -43), total cholesterol 82 mg/dL (42 -101), triglycerides 35 mg/dL (19-239), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol 45 mg/dL (24-81). Of nine patients, two carried known pathogenic variants in APOB (one stop-gain, one deletion; LDL-C range undetectable -10 mg/dL); three patients had novel APOB heterozygous mutations (two frameshift deletions and one splice site; LDL-C range undectable-13 mg/dL); two had heterozygous APOB frameshift deletions previously reported as variants of unknown significance (LDL-C 18 mg/dL",

      "text": "Low ( < 50 mg/dL) or extremely low ( < 20 mg/dL) levels of serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) have been associated with mutations in five genes.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  These primary monogenic causes include abetalipoproteinemia due to mutations in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTTP ), chylomicron retention disease caused by mutations in SAR1B ( SAR1B ), familial hypobetalipoproteinemia due to mutations in apolipoprotein B ( APOB ), hypocholesterolemia due to mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ), and combined hypolipidemia due to mutations in angiopoietin-like 3 ( ANGPTL3 ).  [1] [2] ] [3] [4] [5]  The phenotype of patients varies depending on the gene involved and number of affected alleles. Patients with biallelic mutations in MTTP, SAR1B , and APOB present early in life with malabsorption, steatorrhea, failure to thrive, retinal degeneration secondary to vitamin E deficiency, sensory neuropathies, and paresthesias.  1 , 5 Patients with single heterozygous mutations in APOB, PCSK9 , and ANGPTL3 , however, present with very low lipid levels and benefit from protection against the development of cardiovascular disease.  2 , 3  In the clinical setting, current standard-of-care does not include genetic testing for low or extremely low LDL-C levels. Therefore, it remains unclear what are the most common underlying genetic causes for low or extremely low LDL-C in specialty lipid clinics. Furthermore, recent advances in genomics allow the calculation of polygenic risk scores for LDL-C to evaluate potential non-monogenic etiologies related to LDL-C. Here, we use whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the underlying causes -both monogenic and polygenic -of low or extremely low LDL-C levels in a cohort of nine patients presenting to specialty lipid clinics."

Patients with low or extremely low LDL-C levels were identified from referrals to specialty lipid clinics at UTSW (Dallas, TX) or Baylor Scott and White (Waco, TX). Inclusion criteria were an LDL-C level of less than 50 mg/dL. We excluded patients who ever took any lipid lowering therapy and patients with low or extremely low LDL-C due to secondary causes including hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, chronic infections, strict vegetarian/vegan diets, severe liver disease, intestinal fat malabsorption, malnutrition, and active or prior malignancy. Serum samples were obtained after an overnight fast and aliquots of plasma were used to determine routine laboratory testing, including comprehensive metabolic panels, complete blood counts, and thyroid-function studies using standard procedures. Detailed personal and family history was obtained through interviews and a standardized questionnaire form."

Samples were sent to the McDermott Center Next Generation Sequencing Core at UTSW (cases 1 to 7) or to Phosphorus Diagnostics (New York, New York; case 8) or GB Insight (San Diego, California USA; case 9) for WES.\n\nPatients 1 to 7 underwent WES using the SureSelect Human All Exon V4 kit on the Illumina platform. Sequencing read length was paired-end 2 \u00d7 100 bp. Sequences were aligned to the human reference genome b37. The mean coverage of the targeted regions was > 100-fold in all samples with > 98% bases covered by > 10-fold reads in all samples. Genetic variations were called using the Genome Analysis Toolkit 6 and annotated using SnpEff.  7 Variants in candidate genes MTTP, SAR1B, APOB, PCSK9, ANGPTL3 were specifically examined for their pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines.  8 We filtered for candidate variants in these genes by (1) minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.05 in each subpopulation of the 1000 Genomes Project and genome aggregation database (gno-mAD v2.1.1); (2) nonsense, missense, canonical splicing, or frameshift variants; and (3) GERP score greater than 2.0. Additionally, we screened the whole exome for any variant submitted as \"pathogenic\" or \"likely pathogenic\" to ClinVar (  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ). Self-reported race was confirmed by ancestry inference based on the WES data using the 1000 Genomes Project 9 dataset as references.\n\nPolygenic risk scores (PRS) for LDL-C levels were calculated for patients 1 to 7 using LDpred.  10 The LDL-C genomewide association screen summary statistics were from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium.  11 The 1000 Genomes Phase 3  9  data of 503 European individuals were used as the linkage disequilibrium reference panel, as in Natarajan et al .  12 The percentile of each of the 7 low LDL-C level patients was mapped in the PRS distribution of the 114 high LDL-C level ( > 190 mg/dL without mutations in LDLreceptor or APOB) patients who we had previously done WES at UTSW."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In adult patients with low or very low LDL-C seen in specialty lipid clinics, we were able to identify the underlying molecular cause in most patients through WES, with the most common cause being truncating APOB mutations. Though several patients had mutations in other genes (i.e. PCKS9 and ANGPTL3 ), these were far less common than APOB and their pathogenicity was previously reported as benign or uncertain significance. As expected, we found no patients with abetalipoproteinemia or chylomicron retention disease in our cohort of overall healthy adults. Although a prevailing phenotype did not exist among our cohort, both hepatic steatosis and chronic diarrhea were observed in three out of nine patients, and two patients were noted to have a vitamin D deficiency. Hepatic steatosis occurs in these patients since decreased secretion of apoB from the liver results in decreased triglyceride export from the liver, which in turn leads to the development of fatty liver.  4 he results are unique in regard to patient ascertainment (i.e. specialty lipid clinics) and the extremely low LDL-C levels of our patients. Most prior work identifying the molecular causes of low LDL-C have been performed in populationbased studies, which may limit their ability to rule out secondary causes.  3 , 13-15 In some prior studies, half of patients were receiving lipid-lowering therapy and a significant portion of remaining subjects had secondary causes of low and extremely low LDL-C, primarily from various chronic illnesses.  16 n the Dallas Heart Study, sequencing of PCSK9 in patients with LDL-C in the bottom 25th percentile led to the discovery of loss-of-function PCSK9 mutations (Y142X, C679X, and R46L).  15 Although these findings have had great impact for lipid lowering drugs (i.e. PCSK9 inhibitors), the current findings suggest the results of such population-based studies may not inform patient-provider interactions with regards to a diagnosis for their low cholesterol.\n\nMost studies of patients with APOB mutations have LDL-C levels between 20 and 50 mg/dL and have not involved patients with LDL-C levels as low as the current cohort.  16 n a recent study of 29 Japanese families with hypobetalipoproteinemia, heterozygous carriers of APOB mutations had LDL-C levels ranging from 37 to 69 mg/Dl.  17 ith regards to implications for these patients and their families, overall, such low LDL-C levels are likely safe and ASCVD risk is low.  [18] [19] 9] [20] [21] [22]  However, in patients with low cholesterol due to APOB mutations, fatty liver can progress to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.  4 lthough no guidelines exist for routine monitoring, such patients and affected family members should likely be screened with liver enzyme, liver ultrasounds, and/or fibroscans.  4 imitations of our study include the use of the Friedewald equation rather than ultracentrifugation for LDL-C measurement. Ultracentrifugation, however, is not easily available in the clinical setting and given the low and extremely low LDL-C levels in our cohort and the identification of a molecular defect in most patients, the use of ultracentrifugation would not have changed our results. Our sample size is small, which is not surprising given the rare nature of low or extremely low LDL-C. It remains unclear whether the cost of genetic testing is justified for patients with low or very low LDL-C. After ruling out secondary causes, assessing cholesterol levels in family members may be sufficient to presume the underlying molecular cause.\n\nOur findings imply most cases of healthy adults with low or extremely low LDL-C will be due to truncating APOB mutations and likely need no further molecular work-up. It is also not certain that understanding a patient's underlying molecular defect leads to significant change in clinical management, as patients are otherwise healthy.\n\nIn summary, we found truncating APOB mutations to be the most common molecular defect in patients presenting to lipid clinics with low or extremely low LDL-C. Whether clinical genetic testing has any utility -other than diagnostic purposes -for such patients remains unclear. In addition, further efforts may be needed to better reclassify pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance."
