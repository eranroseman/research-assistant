  "title": "Methodological challenges in systematic reviews of mHealth interventions: Survey and consensus-based recommendations",
  "abstract": "Objective: Mobile Health (mHealth) refers to using mobile devices to support health. This study aimed to identify specific methodological challenges in systematic reviews (SRs) of mHealth interventions and to develop guidance for addressing selected challenges. Study Design and Setting: Two-phase participatory research project. First, we sent an online survey to corresponding authors of SRs of mHealth interventions. On a five-category scale, survey respondents rated how challenging they found 24 methodological aspects in SRs of mHealth interventions compared to non-mHealth intervention SRs. Second, a subset of survey respondents participated in an online workshop to discuss recommendations to address the most challenging methodological aspects identified in the survey. Finally, consensusbased recommendations were developed based on the workshop discussion and subsequent interaction via email with the workshop participants and two external mHealth SR authors. Results: We contacted 953 corresponding authors of mHealth intervention SRs, of whom 50 (5 %) completed the survey. All the respondents identified at least one methodological aspect as more or much more challenging in mHealth intervention SRs than in non-mHealth SRs. A median of 11  out of 24 aspects (46 %) were rated as more or much more challenging. Those most frequently reported were: defining intervention intensity and components (85 %), extracting mHealth intervention details (71 %), dealing with dynamic research with evolving interventions (70 %), assessing intervention integrity (69 %), defining the intervention (66 %) and",

      "text": "Mobile Health (mHealth) refers to using mobile devices, such as smartphones, to support medical and public health practices  [1] [2] [3] . mHealth can empower patients, carers, healthcare professionals and the general population  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  by improving health behaviour and adherence to treatment or by delivering interventions (e.g., psychotherapy).\n\nmHealth is a fast-developing field: there are over 350,000 health applications (apps), and there is an exponential increase in mHealth studies  [7] [8] [9] [10] . Although mHealth apps are advertised as improving health and well-being, systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized trials (RCTs) are needed to acquire robust evidence of their effectiveness  [11] . SRs of mHealth interventions (hereinafter mHealth SRs) are also common  [12] . Still, they may have different methodological challenges than SRs of conventional interventions (hereinafter non-mHealth SRs), such as medications. First, drug evaluation methods are only partially transferable to mHealth research. Second, apps can be developed and updated faster than drugs, which challenges SRs to remain current. Third, the evaluation and reporting of mHealth intervention integrity (the degree to which the intervention was implemented as intended) in clinical trials vary. This poses difficulties in SRs because it can lead to biased estimates of intervention effects and limit the ability of SRs to provide reliable evidence  [13] .\n\nIdentifying and overcoming the methodological challenges specific to mHealth SRs is critical to understand the effects of mHealth and, thus, to determine if mHealth can improve health outcomes  [7] . This article has two aims: 1) To identify specific methodological challenges in SRs evaluating the effects of mHealth interventions; 2) To develop guidance to address selected methodological challenges."

The SG chose methodological aspects potentially specific to mHealth SRs based on consensus (complete list available upon request). We created an anonymous online survey with soSci Survey. The SG and two external researchers piloted the survey, which was available in English for one month from 11 October 2022 (Appendix 2). The first survey section listed 24 potential methodological challenges in four groups according to the SR process. Participants were asked how challenging they found each methodological aspect in mHealth SRs compared to non-mHealth SRs. The response options were ranked on a five-category scale: \"much less challenging\", \"less challenging\", \"similar challenges\", \"more challenging\", or \"much more challenging\". The \"I don't know\" option was available. Participants could comment/propose additional challenges. The second survey section characterized the researchers' academic background and SR experience.

The workshop aimed to develop recommendations to address methodological challenges specific to mHealth SRs. The SG chose two topics for the workshop (mHealth intervention integrity and keeping mHealth SRs up to date) for the following reasons. Firstly, these topics were often rated as more or much more challenging by experienced systematic reviewers in the survey. For instance, 88 % of these reviewers identified the task of keeping mHealth SRs current as more or much more challenging. Additionally, aspects related to the integrity of mHealth interventions, especially those associated with data extraction, were deemed more or much more challenging by up to 80 % of the experienced reviewers. Secondly, the ongoing need to update apps is intrinsically linked to the integrity of mHealth interventions. Thirdly, the topic of mHealth intervention integrity was in alignment with a concurrent workshop that addressed methodological challenges in mHealth RCTs (details of which have been submitted for publication elsewhere). Recommendations from the workshop were endorsed by consensus (Appendix 4: workshop slides)."

Consider also using SR software with automation tools for increasing screening efficiency, such as EPPI-Reviewer, DistillerSR, Covidence or Rayyan.\n\nRecommendation 6. Carefully select the sources to search in mHealth SRs.\n\nSearch methods guidance in mHealth SRs is needed to address specific challenges. Examples are diverse evidence dissemination channels, heterogeneous terminology, rapidly evolving field, and irrelevant sources due to the low quality of the studies. Also, mHealth SRs have diverse information needs to support the review process, such as information on the intervention technology, outcomes, or implementation.

As obtaining the overall intervention integrity for the study can be challenging, at least the critical factors should be explicitly reported and judged.

Consider developing living systematic reviews, that is, SRs which are \"continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available\"  [26] . Lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic for updating living SRs may be applicable to mHealth living SRs  [27] .\n\nRecommendation 16. Rapid reviews and evidence maps can provide helpful information in mHealth by offering a quicker evidence synthesis and research gap identification.\n\nRapid reviews and evidence maps are helpful in mHealth, where new technologies are rapidly emerging, and there is a need to keep up with the latest developments.

Recommendations that apply to several review stages Recommendation 17. SRs should try to capture the complexity of mHealth interventions. Factors contributing to the complexity of mHealth interventions include their integration with other health services, interactions between multiple technology components, and user adherence/engagement. Addressing this complexity in SRs is critical to evaluate mHealth interventions' effectiveness. Recommendation 18. Consider using a taxonomy of mHealth interventions to improve the clarity, organization, and evaluation of mHealth interventions in SRs.\n\nUsing a common taxonomy to classify mHealth interventions would make it easier to apply the review inclusion criteria, determine the intervention and comparator in each study, establish meaningful comparisons, organize the information, evaluate the impact of different interventions, communicate more effectively with others, and identify gaps in the field. An example is the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) taxonomy  [30] , which has been used by Cochrane authors in SRs of health systems interventions."

The workshop focused on mHealth intervention integrity and how to keep mHealth SRs current. Based on the workshop and discussion via email, we developed 18 consensus-based recommendations to address these methodological challenges."

    {
      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "We are confident we identified the main methodological challenges specific to mHealth SRs. First, literature searches informed the survey. Second, only two survey respondents pointed to new challenges not listed in our survey: high heterogeneity among mHealth studies and low quality of mHealth trials. However, we consider these additional challenges not specific to mHealth interventions. Third, the survey respondents had authored at least one mHealth intervention SR and another non-mHealth SR, which helped identify challenges specific to mHealth SRs.\n\nThe main survey limitation was its low response rate (5 %), which raises concerns about the representativeness of the challenges and recommendations identified, as they might not fully reflect the experiences of all researchers in the mHealth field. Although contributors to these recommendations are from various regions and cultures, it is important to consider variations in access and use of mobile technology when applying the recommendations. This low response is partially explained by the frequent inoperative emails (13 %). As institutional email addresses can be cancelled very quickly once researchers change institutions, the response rate may increase if SR authors had been contacted via more stable channels, such as ORCID. Other potential explanations for the low response rate are the survey topic specificity and the requirement to have authored at least two SRs (which was not checked before sending the invitations). Moreover, no SR author from Africa or Central/South America participated in the project: we may have missed methodological challenges relevant in these settings."

A recent review of mHealth SRs in chronic disease management concluded that the most significant challenges in mHealth intervention development and evaluation were designing high-quality studies, developing robust interventions in combination with health professional input and identifying tools and methods to improve patient adherence  [31] . These findings align with ours, but we also identified challenges in keeping SRs current."

      "text": "Our study highlights the importance of addressing the methodological challenges related to mHealth intervention integrity in SRs, and calls for collaboration among trialists, systematic reviewers, and guideline developers to achieve this goal. The eighteen recommendations developed in the current study represent a significant asset, but their practical applicability and impact on future mHealth research need to be evaluated.\n\nThere is a need to improve the reporting and evaluation of mHealth intervention integrity in RCTs and SRs. This concept is rarely addressed in RCTs, probably due to a lack of agreed-upon definitions and measurements  [25] . Moreover, current reporting guidelines omit advice on reporting of mHealth intervention integrity  [23, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , and how to handle this information is unclear. Still, SRs should try to judge intervention integrity per study arm and integrate this information into the analyses. Developing a framework for quantitatively assessing mHealth interventions' integrity would facilitate consistent evaluation in SRs. A set of agreed-upon data elements and definitions for extraction of data would be a good starting point towards consistency. The improvement of the evaluation and reporting of mHealth intervention integrity in RCTs and SRs would benefit the broader research community and the quality of synthesized evidence. First, enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of mHealth interventions, by providing clear descriptions of the intervention components, delivery, and adherence. Second, facilitating the comparison of mHealth interventions across different studies and settings, by using standardized definitions and measurements of intervention integrity. Third, assessing the influence of intervention integrity on the outcomes of mHealth interventions, by integrating this information into the analyses of SRs, through techniques such as metaregression. Fourth, identifying the optimal conditions for implementing mHealth interventions, by examining the factors that affect intervention integrity, effectiveness, and sustainability."
