  "title": "Measuring implementation behaviour of menu guidelines in the childcare setting: confirmatory factor analysis of a theoretical domains framework questionnaire (TDFQ)",
  "abstract": "Background: While there are number of frameworks which focus on supporting the implementation of evidence based approaches, few psychometrically valid measures exist to assess constructs within these frameworks. This study aimed to develop and psychometrically assess a scale measuring each domain of the Theoretical Domains Framework for use in assessing the implementation of dietary guidelines within a non-health care setting (childcare services). Methods: A 75 item 14-domain Theoretical Domains Framework Questionnaire (TDFQ) was developed and administered via telephone interview to 202 centre based childcare service cooks who had a role in planning the service menu. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was undertaken to assess the reliability, discriminant validity and goodness of fit of the 14-domain theoretical domain framework measure. Results: For the CFA, five iterative processes of adjustment were undertaken where 14 items were removed, resulting in a final measure consisting of 14 domains and 61 items. For the final measure: the Chi-Square goodness of fit statistic was 3447.19; the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) was 0.070; the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) was 0.072; and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) had a value of 0.78. Conclusions: While only one of the three indices support goodness of fit of the measurement model tested, a 14-domain model with 61 items showed good discriminant validity and internally consistent items. Future research should aim to assess the psychometric properties of the developed TDFQ in other community-based settings.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "The World Health Organisation reports that in 2012 68% of deaths globally were attributed to non-communicable diseases  [1] . Dietary patterns, food habits and food preferences developed in childhood track into adulthood and can impact on the onset of non-communicable disease  [2] . Improving diet in children provides a critical opportunity to improve dietary behaviours in the overall population.\n\nChildcare is a particularly opportunistic setting in which to intervene to improve child dietary intake as it provides access to a large proportion of children at a key developmental period of their lives. Furthermore, children who attend centre-based childcare services consume up to 67% of their daily dietary intake while in care  [3] . In Countries such as the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) approximately one third of children attend some form of centre based childcare. During 2014, 54% of Australian children aged 2-3 years and 83% of Australian children aged 4-5 years attended centre based childcare  [4] .\n\nEnsuring the availability of healthy foods to children through the implementation of menu dietary guidelines by childcare services is recommended as a means of improving the dietary intake of young children  [5] . Evidence from systematic reviews suggests that interventions to improve food provision in childcare centres in line with dietary guidelines are effective in improving children's diet  [6, 7] . However, various studies have reported that the implementation of such guidelines by childcare services is sub-optimal  [8] [9] [10] . For example a review of 118 nursery menus in the UK found that none complied with the menu dietary guidelines  [9] . Similarly, in 2012, 46 menus from centre based childcare services in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales (NSW) Australia were audited and the study concluded that none complied with the menu dietary guidelines  [8] .\n\nTo improve the implementation of such guidelines to enhance child health, a greater understanding of implementation processes is required. While a number of tools have been used in the childcare setting to assess factors associated with implementation, the range of constructs assessed in previous studies has been limited, tending to focus on individual constructs such as staff knowledge and skills and attitudes  [11] [12] [13] [14] . The use of implementation theories or frameworks can be helpful in assessing the determinants of childcare provider behavior to ensure a broad range of factors that may impede or promote implementation are considered. Furthermore implementation frameworks can inform the selection of strategies to support implementation  [15] . While such frameworks exist  [16]  few have comprehensive psychometrically evaluated measures to assess their constructs, limiting their utility.\n\nOne framework for which measures have been psychometrically evaluated is the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The TDF is an implementation framework that aims to synthesize behavior change constructs that may affect (enable or impede) the implementation of evidenced based practices and guidelines  [17] . The TDF was developed using a rigorous consensus and validation process, and represents an attempt to systematically summarize behavior change constructs covered in 33 theoretical models/frameworks. The initial version of the framework described 12 domains; however further construct validation research led to a 14 domain framework that is suggested to more comprehensively describe relevant behavior change constructs  [17, 18] .\n\nThere have been three previous studies that have empirically validated TDF constructs measures. These studies have been conducted with samples of university students and health care professionals. All three studies undertook a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a method that enables a researcher to test whether a hypothesised relationship exists between observed variables and their underlying constructs  [19] . While the psychometric properties of these measures of TDF constructs differed across the three studies, most constructs showed reasonable fit to the model based on CFA  [20] [21] [22] . These studies collectively conclude that methodological improvements are required to enhance the utility of the existing measures including ensuring that at least three items are available per construct and adding additional contextually relevant items applicable to the specific study setting and target audience.\n\nGiven the existing gaps in the literature regarding how to best support the implementation of dietary guidelines in the childcare setting, the importance of context in assessing determinants of implementation and the absence of validated tools which can be applied to professional practice regarding nutrition in the childcare setting this study aims to:\n\n1) Develop and establish content validity for a 14-domain TDFQ that is contextually relevant for the childcare setting to measure the implementation behavior of sector specific menu dietary guidelines; and 2) Undertake a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and examine the psychometric properties of the developed measure (specifically reliability, discriminant validity and goodness of fit)."

Two existing quantitative questionnaires which assessed constructs of the TDF (but had been previously developed for healthcare settings) were adapted for this study. Both of the existing TDF questionnaires were reported to have good construct validity and internal consistency  [22, 25]  and utilised the 14 domain structure, with domains being:1) Knowledge; 2) Skills; 3) Social/professional role and identity; 4) Beliefs about capabilities; 5) Optimism; 6) Beliefs about consequences; 7) Reinforcement; 8) Intentions; 9) Goals; 10) Memory, attention and decision processes; 11) Environmental context and resources; 12) Social influences; 13) Emotion; and 14) Behavioural regulation  [18] . Definitions of the constructs these domains capture can be seen in Table  1 .\n\nModification of the questionnaire items to be relevant to the LDC setting was overseen by the research team, which included: experienced health promotion practitioners; implementation scientists; psychologists; dietitians; psychometricians; and behavioral scientists. Modification was based on feedback from stakeholders and expert opinion. Changes to the questionnaire took into consideration individual factors and other inner setting implementation constructs, such as structural characteristics, networks and communication, and culture, which could impact on implementation behavior in the setting  [26] . An example of how items were modified can be seen in Table  2 .\n\nAll items were modified in a generic format (see Additional file 1), allowing for adaptation of the items to different programs, guidelines, interventions or initiatives that may be undertaken in other community settings. Context specific prompts were included, with six of the questionnaire items to ensure they were interpreted in relation to the LDC setting. Consistent with previous questionnaires, the final items required respondents to answer using a 7-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree).\n\nThe survey was piloted with two LDC service cooks who were not included in the final sample. Piloting indicated that completion of the survey took 25 min; it was well understood and was positively received by the respondents. No amendments were made to the survey following the pilot."

The measurement model hypothesised the relationship between the latent domains and manifest variables that measure these domains. For the CFA, based on previous publications a prior hypothesis was made that each item (n = 75) loaded on only one domain and that a number of domains were potentially correlated (i.e. knowledge and skills; social/professional role and skills) (See Appendix A)  [22] . No directional paths between latent domains were hypothesised. All loadings were standardized (domain means and variances fixed at 0 and 1 respectively). The model was estimated using the full information maximum likelihood method, which used all available  Service cooks ability to self-monitor and action plan to implement the menu dietary guidelines data. Questionnaire items worded negatively (n = 3) were reverse-coded for analysis. The model was assessed for goodness of fit and iteratively revised in an attempt to derive a theoretically meaningful and statistically acceptable model. Items were dropped for the following conditions: 1) the item had a non-significant loading on its factor (p-value > 0.05); 2) the item appeared more than once in the ten highest Lagrange multiplier (LM) estimates on different factors (a high LM estimate indicates a complex item which should be removed); 3) the item had a loading <0.4 on its factor domain  [28, 29] .\n\nAs per recommendations, an attempt was made to include three items per domain to ensure minimum coverage of each construct's theoretical domain.\n\nThe sensitivity of the model was assessed by restricting the number of domain co-variances to the following prespecified domains which the TDF literature suggests are correlated: 1) Domain 1 (Knowledge) and Domain 2 (Skills); 2) Domain 3 (Social/professional role) and Domain 2 (Skills)  [22] .\n\nWhen co-variances between the remaining domains were fixed to zero, the model fit was worse, suggesting that estimating all co-variances between the domains produced a better model."

An SRMR value less than 0.055 is considered ideal  [31] .

Both 12 domain measures displayed a chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio less than 2.0 and an RMSEA score greater than 0.05  [20, 21] .

The administration of the questionnaire via telephone interview, rather than paper and pencil, may have also impacted on the way in which participants responded to the questionnaire items. Further pilot testing of response scales should be conducted prior to administering the TDFQ."

      "text": "Given there were some minor revisions to the original hypothesised model, it is recommended that the fit of this measure be assessed with a larger samples of service cooks in the childcare setting, as well as with other staff providing menu services in similar community settings (schools, sporting clubs). When validating this measure, researchers should undertake a power calculation and aim to reach the appropriate sample size to allow for increased confidence in results. Thorough psychometric testing and reporting (reliability and validity) should be undertaken to increase the empirical evidence available for the use of a TDF measure for intervention development and evaluation of implementation strategies  [36] ."

    {
      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "There are a few limitations to the current study. First, the majority of the respondents were female (93%). While this reflects the demographic for our population of interest (service cooks in childcare settings), this may affect the generalisability of the results to other community settings. Second, a significant proportion of service cooks who were telephoned and invited to participate had not heard of the sector-specific menu dietary guidelines (46%) and were not eligible to participate in this study. The findings of the current study only apply to cooks who were already aware of the guidelines, and as such may have higher intentions of applying such guidelines.\n\nThird, the acceptability of the questionnaire was not specifically measured. However, the average time to complete the telephone interview was 25-40 min, which may represent a significant burden for respondents. This highlights the difficulties in developing a comprehensive questionnaire that satisfactorily measures the 14 TDF domains, while being of reasonable length  [25] . Fourth, only a small sample size was available for the analysis, as only data for respondents who completed all 75 items of the TDFQ were included. The final sample size of 202 may have been inadequate to psychometrically validate the 75 item TDFQ as the ratio of \"five participants per item\" was not achieved (i.e. 375 participants were needed to meet this recommendation)  [32] ."

    {
      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "To our knowledge this is the first quantitative measure of the TDF developed for application in a non-health care setting, specifically the childcare setting. While only one of the three indices support goodness of fit of the measurement model tested, with some minor revisions we arrived at a 61-item model with good discriminant validity, with internally consistent items. Future research should aim to assess the psychometric properties of the developed TDFQ in the childcare setting and other community settings."
