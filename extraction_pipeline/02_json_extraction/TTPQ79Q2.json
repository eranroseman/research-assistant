On a global scale, CVD holds the dubious distinction of being the foremost cause of mortality. As per the WHO, in 2015, approximately 17.7 million individuals succumbed to CVD. In the United States, CVD has consistently ranked as one of the top two leading causes of death since 1975, accounting for 25% of all deaths. In 2015, heart disease claimed 633,842 American lives, emerging as the principal cause of death, followed by cancer  [10] . The global prevalence of CVD has displayed a worrisome upward trajectory, with the number of cases nearly doubling from 1990 to 2019. Concurrently, CVD-related mortality rates have significantly risen during this period  [12] . This public health challenge is further compounded by its substantial economic burden on society. The indirect costs associated with CVD are estimated at $237 billion annually, with projections indicating a surge to $368 billion by 2035  [13] .\n\nDespite advances in diagnostic modalities and therapeutic interventions, the risk of heart disease remains considerable, with an estimated 50% risk by age 45 in the general population  [10] . This risk escalates with advancing age and exhibits gender-specific variations, being higher in males at younger ages but progressively converging in the postmenopausal period  [14] . Hence, addressing risk factors and advocating heart-healthy lifestyles early in life are imperative."
