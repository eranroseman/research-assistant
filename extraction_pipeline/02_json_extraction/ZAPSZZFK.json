  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE A comprehensive lipid panel is recommended by guidelines to evaluate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, but uptake is low. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether direct outreach including bulk orders with and without text messaging increases lipid screening rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted from June 6, 2023, to September 6, 2023, at 2 primary care practices at an academic health system among patients aged 20 to 75 years with at least 1 primary care visit in the past 3 years who were overdue for lipid screening. Data analysis was performed from September 2023 to May 2024. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to usual care (group 1), direct outreach and bulk orders (group 2), and bulk order outreach with additional text message reminders for scheduling assistance (group 3). In group 3, participants received an initial, follow-up, and reminder text message. Patients with electronic portal accounts were encouraged to schedule through them, while others received laboratory contact information. Any participant inquiries were answered either with automated responses for common questions or with study team support. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of patients who completed a lipid panel within 3 months. RESULTS Among the 1000 participants, the median (IQR) age was 38 (28-55) years; 470 (47.0%) were female; and 22 (2.3%) were Asian, 38 (3.9%) were Black, 32 (3.2%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 862 (88.6%) were White (race and ethnicity were based on self-reported data). At 3 months, a lipid panel was completed by 12 of 202 patients (5.9%; 95% CI, 3.4% to 10.1%) receiving usual care (group 1) vs 62 of 394 patients (15.7%; 95% CI, 12.5% to 19.7%) receiving direct outreach and bulk order (group 2), a difference of 9.8 percentage points (95% CI, 4.6 to 15.0; P = .001). The panel was completed by 73 of 404 patients (18.1%; 95% CI, 14.6% to 22.1%) receiving outreach, bulk order, and text message reminders (group 3), for a difference of 2.4 percentage points (95% CI, -3.1 to 7.8; P = .43) vs outreach with bulk order alone (group 2). At 6 months, there were no significant differences in lipid screening between either group 1 vs group 2 or group 2 vs group 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Lipid screening among participants receiving bulk orders and outreach letters increased significantly compared with usual care at 3 months. However, there was no difference at 6 months. More than 80% of patients did not follow through with lipid screening despite the intervention, and there was no additional increase in lipid testing at 3 months among participants receiving bulk ordering and supplemental text messaging.",

      "text": "A therosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Guidelines recommend routinely assessing traditional cardiovascular risk factors every 4 to 6 years for adults aged 20 to 39 years and both routinely assessing traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculating the 10-year ASCVD risk for adults aged 40 to 75 years.  1 For many eligible patients, ASCVD risk cannot be calculated due to a missing comprehensive lipid panel measuring key components for ASCVD risk, such as total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Monitoring of lipid profiles is essential in both primary and secondary prevention strategies. In many populations, a high proportion of patients may not have recent laboratory testing; a study by Gao et al  2  found that overall in the US, 27.5% of patients had not had a cholesterol screening within the last 5 years. To adhere to guidelines, the clinician has to recommend and order lipid screening, and the patient has to follow through and have laboratory samples drawn.\n\nThere are opportunities to overcome this challenge by leveraging insights from the field of behavioral science, as humans have systematic biases or heuristics that impede participation in health prevention activities.  [3] [4] 4] [5]  Behavioral economics use human psychology to develop nudges that change the choice architecture to lead people to make better decisions.  6 or example, shifting from an opt-in approach to opt-out default framing can nudge patients toward preventive screening while maintaining patient autonomy.  7, 8 With bulk ordering of lipid panels for overdue patients of a practice, lipid screening can be presented as the default choice, helping patients to overcome inertia from status quo bias. Including a signed laboratory order also reduces effort from both patients and clinicians. Patients may trust the recommendation of their primary care clinician to overcome hesitance due to the behavioral principle of social norms.  [9] [10] 0] [11]  Finally, including a time-limited component induces a deadline that can enhance moving from intention to action.  12 n addition, text message reminders have facilitated more efficient and equitable outreach by health systems, as most patients have and use a phone with texting capabilities.  13, 14 eriodic prompts and reminders can be an effective method to encourage and reinforce healthy behavior.  15, 16 Furthermore, offering information about the closest laboratory and available walk-in hours might facilitate screening by reducing logistical barriers.\n\nIn this randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of mailed outreach with bulk ordering and the integration of text messaging and scheduling support on completion of lipid screening among primary care patients."

Eligible patients had a primary care physician (PCP) listed in 1 of the 2 primary care practices, had at least 1 visit in the past 3 years, and had health insurance. We excluded patients who did not have a cellular phone number listed in the EHR and patients who had a preferred laboratory outside the health system. We also excluded patients with medical conditions that could markedly diminish the potential benefits of lipid screening, such as those diagnosed with metastatic cancer or currently receiving hospice or palliative care.\n\nSociodemographic data were obtained from the EHR through automated data extraction. Race and ethnicity were based on self-reported data in the EHR and analyzed to understand differential response to interventions since there are known disparities in uptake.

Randomization and text messaging were conducted using the Way to Health (W2H) software platform (Penn Medicine).\n\nPatients in group 1 received usual care with no additional intervention from this study. Patients in group 2 received an outreach letter mailed to their physical address with a physical bulk-ordered laboratory slip signed by the regional medical director and the patient's PCP as the clinician who would receive the results. The outreach letter was sent by the health system and endorsed by the patient's named PCP. It described the importance of cholesterol screening, informed the patient that they were overdue, and invited the patient to use their laboratory slip within 6 weeks at any laboratory of their choice. The letter contained information about how to schedule an appointment through the electronic patient portal or by telephone. It provided specific information about 3 laboratories closest to the patient's primary care practice and walk-in hours, although patients could go to any laboratory.\n\nPatients in group 3 received the same outreach letter and laboratory slip as those in group 2, with additional text messaging. A first text message was sent on day 0 to introduce the outreach and inform the patient that they would receive a laboratory order. Patients could opt out from receiving messages by texting \"STOP.\" A second text message was sent on day 14 to patients who had not yet completed their testing. This text message invited patients with an electronic patient portal account to schedule through their account, and patients without the portal received a link with contact information to the closest laboratories. Patients could start a conversation if they had questions. A third reminder message was sent on day 28 to those who had not yet completed their testing, highlighting the walk-in options available, with the times at the closest laboratories. Patients with questions were informed that their inquiries would be answered within 1 to 3 business days. Automated answers were prepared to answer the most common questions that had been identified in a preliminary study. Other questions were answered by the study team through the backend W2H system.\n\nWe did not monitor for adverse events because the intervention was considered low risk and part of routine clinical practice."

      "text": "In this clinical trial, text bulk ordering and mailed outreach resulted in a statistically significant 9.8-percentage point increase in lipid screening uptake compared with usual care at 3 months, with lipid screening completion rates of 15.7% in the bulk ordering group and 5.9% in the usual care group. Rates of lipid screening at 3 months in usual care were higher than anticipated before the study launch. Adding text messaging to mailed outreach yielded a small and nonsignificant 2.4percentage point improvement in uptake. However, at 6 months, there was no significant difference between bulk ordering and usual care. At 6 months, completed lipid panels enabled the calculation of an ASCVD risk score among older patients, identifying 11 new patients (12.7%) at high risk. Lipid testing was not associated with an increase in prescription of statin medications at 3 or 6 months.\n\nThere are a few reasons that might explain these findings. Lipid screening is a preventive routine check that might not be proposed to patients who otherwise do not show cardiovascular risk factors and who consult their PCP for different and more urgent needs. Bulk ordering for lipid screening facilitates this screening for both the PCP and the patient: it acts as a default on both sides and makes the process of screening by removing the need for a clinic visit. In addition, this trial was informed by prior outreach studies  7  and a smaller pilot study of 100 patients with qualitative feedback that the outreach should include PCP endorsement, a time-limited call to action, a physically mailed laboratory order, and scheduling assistance. Indeed, reaching out to patients via the electronic patient portal may not be as effective as through mailed letters, because even among electronic portal users, some patients are more likely to overlook this information than an official mailed letter or possibly not know how to use an electronic laboratory order. From an equity perspective, mailed letters are the only cost-effective option for patients with limited internet use. However, a notable finding is that the magnitude of the effect from bulk ordering and outreach was lower than in other studies, which found that hepatitis C screening went from 19% for direct outreach alone to 42% with bulk ordering with a similar laboratory slip  8  and that opt-out mailed colorectal cancer screening tripled participation.  7 In this case, even with bulk ordering, more than 80% of patients did not undergo lipid testing after 3 months. This behavioral intervention was intended to facilitate intention and memory and can serve as a low-cost complement to increase lipid screening. However, more work is needed to boost uptake by addressing other barriers for preventive screening. Convincing patients of the importance of screening may require more interaction with a health professional. Practical barriers may also need to be addressed for certain patients, for example, by home testing. Another notable conclusion is that we did not find an effect from bulk ordering and outreach at 6 months. The fact that the intervention was only effective in the short term may suggest that there was some spillover in prescribing of lipid panels by the clinicians or that engageable patients in all 3 groups were reached either by the intervention in the first 3 months or through regular clinical care in months 4 through 6.\n\nAlthough the differences between the outreach, bulk order, and text messaging group and the outreach and bulk order intervention alone were not significant, the text messaging group produced marginally higher lipid panel completion.

The dashed vertical lines represent the overall treatment effect, while the squares represent the subgroup treatment effect and the full line represents the noninferiority margin of 5%. A total of 187 patients aged 40 to 75 years in the bulk order group had a higher likelihood of a positive outcome (odds ratio [OR], 4.5; 95% CI, 1.8-11.0) than 95 patients aged 40 to 75 years in the control group. This difference was not significantly different from the overall treatment effect between the 2 groups (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.62-5.94).\n\ngesting that behavioral text message reminders improve preventive participation, such as for cervical cancer.  17 dditionally, the intervention helped to identify patients with high ASCVD risk scores among patients who completed their lipid panels during the intervention period, suggesting that bulk ordering with mailed outreach not only increases screening rates but also helps identify patients who could benefit from lipid management. However, the fact that few prescription changes were found suggests that additional interventions, targeting specifically high-risk patients, may be necessary for these patients to be treated."

Although the look-back interval was expansive at 3 years, most of these patients were seen by their PCP in the last year and had received lipid screenings in the past, so they were generally well engaged in health care. While we were able to use registry data to track lipid screenings outside our health system, we likely missed some lipid outcomes outside this network. The intervention pursued a paper-based letter and laboratory order strategy, but there may be value in a more tailored outreach strategy based on individual patient communication preferences, for example, using patients' use of their elec-tronic health portal. Also, the study group was insured, predominantly White, and relatively affluent, reflecting the characteristics of the region where the study was conducted. Further research and replication in multicenter studies or community health centers would be necessary to inform the effectiveness of this intervention in population groups who have more limited access to health care."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "In this clinical trial, text bulk ordering and mailed outreach resulted in a significant increase in lipid screening compared with usual care at 3 months. Bulk ordering associated with mailed outreach is a feasible, low-cost modality that can improve uptake of lipid screening. However, we did not find significant further increases in lipid screening by adding complementary text message reminders and scheduling assistance. With these interventions, up to one-fifth of patients who are overdue can be encouraged to have their lipids screened and to be assessed for cardiovascular risk. However, bulk ordering did not significantly increase uptake of lipid screening compared with usual care at 6 months, and more than 80% of patients did not follow through with lipid testing within 3 months despite the intervention. To further narrow the gap and achieve guideline adherence, future efforts should focus on more intensive or tailored outreach and reducing barriers to screening through engagement in primary care practices and for patients who have limited engagement with health care."
