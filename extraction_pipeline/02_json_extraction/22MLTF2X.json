  "title": "Proof of Concept of a Mobile Health Short Message Service Text Message Intervention That Promotes Adherence to Oral Anticancer Agent Medications: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Introduction: This multisite, randomized controlled trial assigned 75 adult cancer patients prescribed an oral anticancer agent to either an experimental group that received daily text messages for adherence for 21 days plus usual care or a control group that received usual care. Materials and Methods: Measures were administered at baseline, weekly (Weeks 1-8), and at exit (Week 9). A satisfaction survey was conducted following the intervention. Acceptability, feasibility, and satisfaction were examined. Primary outcomes were adherence and symptoms. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, cognition, physical function, and social support. Mixed or general linear models were used for the analyses comparing trial groups. Effect sizes (ES) were estimated to gauge clinical significance. Results: Regarding acceptability, 57.2% (83 of 145) of eligible patients consented, 88% (n = 37 of 42) receiving text messages read them most or all of the time, and 90% (n = 38) were satisfied. The differences between experimental and control groups' ES were 0.29 for adherence, 0.21 for symptom severity, and 0.21 for symptom interference, and differences were not statistically significant. Furthermore, perceived social support was higher (p = 0.04; ES = 0.54) in the experimental group. Conclusions: Proof of concept and preliminary efficacy of a mobile health intervention using text messages to promote adherence for patients prescribed oral anticancer agents were demonstrated. Patients accepted and had high satisfaction with the intervention, and adherence improved after the intervention. Text messages show promise. Additional research is needed prior to use in practice.",

      "text": "ith more than 50 oral anticancer agents (OAs) on the market, it is projected that within the next decade, 25% of cancer treatment will be in pill form.  1  Recent reviews on OAs indicate adherence rates are often less than 80%.  2, 3 OAs often come with side effects, which in turn may lead to adverse events and nonadherence.  3 OA treatment requires patients to self-manage side effects from treatment and adherence in the home setting.  4 ost cancer patients are older and also have comorbid conditions and take multiple medications, which likely make symptoms more severe, as well as adherence more difficult.  5 ther known factors that may influence adherence include medication frequency and complexity, adverse effects of the medication, forgetfulness, beliefs about importance of taking the medication, or inability to pay.  6 The available evidence suggests self-management of OAs is a significant clinical problem that may impact treatment success or failure.  7, 8 ell phones have been widely adopted and are rapidly evolving as a cost-effective mode of delivering tailored behavioral interventions.  9, 10 There are more than 285 million cell phone subscribers in the United States,  11  and it is estimated 81% of users send and receive text messages (TMs).  12 vidence is beginning to show that TMs built on Social Cognitive Theory  13  increase self-efficacy and improve health outcomes.  14 TMs have also improved medication adherence in multiple diseases,  6  with one trial finding more correct medication doses taken on time.  15 atients who are prescribed OAs are often vulnerable, as most are older, have comorbidities, or are receiving the OA as a second or third line of cancer treatment over an extended period of time. Thus, OA adherence is challenging. The purpose of this study was to examine proof of concept of a TM intervention and to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of TMs with respect to adherence and symptom severity and interference in adult cancer patients prescribed OAs."

Reply 'OK' after reading this message''), six medication adherence TMs used on a rotating basis (e.g., ''A reminder to take your [drug name] now. Doing so is an important step in managing your cancer. Reply 'Taken' when you've taken it''), and an end-of-study TM (e.g., ''Our study is over. Remember: it is both easy and important to take your cancer pills as prescribed. If you have questions call your clinician. Thank you''). An automated platform delivered the TMs and stored associated data. Patient name, cell phone number, OA medication name, and delivery time for TMs (regimen schedule) were entered in the platform to send the TMs after randomization. The experimental group patients were sent the test TM to confirm the cell phone number and assure they were able to respond by TM. Adherence TMs were delivered at the time of day the OA was to be taken for 21 days.\n\nPatients were asked to respond by TM if the OAs were ''taken.'' Upon completion of the intervention, a final, end-of-study TM was sent. To assure TMs were not sent when patients were not prescribed to take the OA, regimen schedules were confirmed with the recruiter and patient. Patients were also trained to inform the study office of OA changes, such as reduction, interruption, or stoppage of the medication. Patients were also asked to password-protect their cell phone to assure privacy."

The proportions of TMs received and returned were described, as was satisfaction. To determine preliminary efficacy of TMs on adherence, as well as secondary outcomes of symptom severity, depressive symptoms, physical function, cognitive function, self-efficacy, and social support, general linear or mixed modeling was used. The covariates included study group and outcome value at baseline. Value at baseline was not applicable for self-reported adherence measures; thus for those outcomes general linear models included only one explanatory variable, the study group. Effect sizes (ES) were computed as Cohen's d-the difference between group adjusted means expressed in the adjusted standard deviation units (square root of the mean square error)-to gauge clinical significance and inform planning of a larger study.  30, 31 SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for the data analysis."

The control group started with a higher percentage of OA adherence in Week 1 (73.1%, n = 19) compared with the experimental group (66%, n = 31), and as shown in Table  3 , Weeks 2-6 and 8 had higher percentages of OA adherence in the control group. The control group had declining adherence over time, whereas the experimental group had increasing OA adherence over time. Week 7 and exit had higher adherence in the experimental group (70.2% versus 61.5% and 86.7% versus 79.2%, respectively). The mean number of weeks of adherence to OAs in the experimental group was 6.5 (standard error = 0.4) compared with 7.2 (standard error = 0.5) in the control group ( p = 0.26), with an ES of -0.29 (Table  4 ). This difference was not statistically significant with the available sample size. We were unable to calculate relative dose intensity as an objective measure of adherence from medical record and prescription data audits (n = 75), as we did not obtain good agreement of patient self-report and medical record documentation of dose changes, number of refills prescribed, and number of refills reported by patients. For example, of 59 patients with no dose changes documented in the medical records, 5 (8%) said the dose was changed; of 65 patients who did not report any dose changes, 11 (17%) had dose changes documented in the medical records.\n\nThe number of symptoms and summed symptom severity and interference did not significantly differ by study arm (Table  5 ). Table  4  reports on group differences postintervention.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study demonstrated proof of concept of TMs to promote self-management of adherence for patients prescribed OAs. Among the eligible patients, age was not related to willingness to send/receive TMs, whereas females were more likely to send/receive TMs. Patients were multimorbid, with many symptoms that interfered with activities of daily life. In this sample of cancer patients, TMs demonstrated feasibility as an intervention, with most patients reading the TM. Satisfaction was high for medication adherence and monitoring, demonstrating that patients thought TMs were helpful.\n\nDid not help 2 (\n\nHow satisfied were you with text reminders to take your medications? a Not at all 1 (2.6) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 1 (4.2) 0 (0.0) 1 (4. The self-reported medication adherence measure showed improving adherence rates in the experimental group at later weeks, suggesting that a patient may start with good adherence but may need the support of TMs later. Self-report is the most widely used method of assessment medication adherence; however, there are several shortcomings. Self-reporting has the problem of overestimating adherence; inaccuracies can also be caused by recall bias, social desirability bias, and errors in self-observation.  32, 33 rthermore, the time frame of adherence recollection can affect the accuracy of the recall during self-report.  34 TM reminders may sensitize patients to missed doses, and they may be more likely to report missed doses compared with patients not receiving reminders.\n\nWording of questions, the way the medication adherence question is asked, and the skills of the interviewer can either facilitate or be detrimental to obtaining measures of medication adherence.  32 When assessing relative dose intensity, we experienced difficulty obtaining objective data from medical and pharmacy dispensing records to determine if the oncologist had increased, decreased, or stopped OA dosages. Thus, measuring medication adherence remains a challenge for both clinicians and scientists. Finally, although we did not find differences in measures of self-efficacy in this small sample, the scripted TMs based on Social Cognitive Theory were thought to be encouraging and motivating to patients, as shown in patient remarks in satisfaction surveys, and began to show promise at engaging behavior change in the form of improved adherence over the course of the study toward the later weeks."

    {
      "title": "LIMITATIONS",
      "text": "The majority of patients were recruited shortly after they were informed of a new cancer diagnosis or after other treatment failure. Consequently, in either situation, patients may have experienced high levels of stress, which may have led to a difficulty with completing data collection during our weekly assessments (78.9%, or 442 of 560, automated voice response assessments were completed). This study was not powered to detect differences between groups on the secondary outcome measures but to compute ES for a larger study. Challenges in the measurement of medication adherence described above remain a limitation in this study, as well as in many studies of medication adherence. Measuring adherence by self-report is limited by the ability to recall if the medication was taken. Pharmacy dispensing records do not capture all instances of OA dose reductions or temporary stoppages. Medical record audits may be incomplete and may not agree with patient reports. Thus, objective adherence measurement for the sample, as in many medication adherence studies, was challenging.\n\nTM interventions are feasible in cancer patients prescribed OAs for medication adherence and may be effective in helping patients engage in behavior change and improve selfmanagement. Use of cell phones is increasing dramatically, and TMs may be an easy mode of delivering healthcare to large numbers of patients. Future work is needed to examine the efficacy of TMs at improving medication adherence in larger clinical trials across multiple disease conditions and age groups, in particular with technology-based interventions of different types such as TMs, automated voice response, and applications."
