      "text": "A systematic review is the result of a systematic and rigorous evaluation of evidence, and a metaanalysis may or may not be a part of it  [1] . Due to its strict methodology and comprehensive summary of evidence, high-quality systematic reviews are considered the highest level of evidence in the hierarchy of evidence  [2] . They are positioned at the top of the evidence pyramid  [2] .\n\nAdditionally, high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses are often used to support the development of clinical practice guidelines, aid clinical decision-making, and inform healthcare policy formulation  [3] . Currently, the methods of systematic reviews and meta-analyses are also applied in various disciplines beyond medicine, such as law  [4] , management  [5] , economics  [6] , and have yielded positive results, contributing to the continuous advancement of these fields  [7] .\n\nThe process of conducting systematic reviews demands a substantial investment in terms of time, resources, human effort, and financial capital  [8] . To expedite the development of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, various (semi)automated tools, such as Covidence, have also come into play  [9, 10] . However, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly Chatbots such as GPT, presents a set of challenges and opportunities in the realm of systematic review and metaanalysis  [11] . This article conducts a comprehensive review of relevant literature, aiming to investigate the potential for harnessing LLMs to accelerate the production of systematic review and meta-analysis, while also scrutinizing the potential impacts and delineating the crucial steps involved in this process."

      "title": "The process and challenges of conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "text": "The procedures and workflows for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses are wellestablished. Currently, researchers often refer to the Cochrane Handbooks recommended by the Cochrane Library for intervention or diagnostic reviews  [12, 13] . In addition, some scholars and institutions have also developed detailed guidelines on the steps and methodology for performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses  [14] [15] [16] [17] . Generally speaking, researchers should take the following steps to produce a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis: determine the clinical question, register and draft a protocol, set inclusion and exclusion criteria, develop and implement a search strategy, screen literature, extract data from included studies, assess the quality and risk of bias of included studies, analyze and process data, write up the full text, and submit for publication, as illustrated in Figure  1 . These different steps contain many sub-tasks, therefore\n\nLuo et al conducting a complete systematic review and meta-analysis requires fairly complex and timeconsuming work.\n\nFigure  1  The process of conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nAlthough systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been widely applied and play an important role in developing guidelines and informing clinical decision-making, their production process faces many challenges. One of them is the long production time and large resource requirements. Studies suggest that the average estimated time to complete and publish a systematic review is 67.3 weeks, requiring five researchers and costing around $140,000  [18] [19] . For some time, (semi-)automated tools utilizing natural language processing and machine learning have accelerated systematic review and meta-analysis production to some extent  [20] , with studies showing such tools can produce a systematic review and meta-analysis within two weeks  [21] . However, these tools also have some limitations. First, no single tool can fully accelerate the entire production process of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Second, these tools cannot process and analyze literature in different languages. Finally, the reliability of results generated by these (semi-)automated tools needs further validation as they are not yet widely adopted."

      "text": "Chatbots based on LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claud, have become widely applied in medical research. These chatbots prove valuable in tasks ranging from knowledge retrieval, language refinement, content generation, and medical exam preparation to literature assessment.\n\nResearch indicates that ChatGPT excels in accuracy, completeness, nuance, and speed when generating responses to clinical inquiries in psychiatry  [22] . Moreover, LLMs like ChatGPT play a pivotal role in automating the evaluation of medical literature, facilitating the identification of accurately reported research findings  [23] . Despite their significant contributions, these chatbots are not without limitations. Challenges such as the potential for generating misleading content and susceptibility to academic deception necessitate further scholarly discourse on effective mitigation strategies. Standardized reporting practices may contribute to delineating the applications of\n\nChatGPT and mitigating research biases  [24] .\n\nIn the process of conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, ChatGPT demonstrates significant application potential and promise.

At this juncture, it is crucial to ascertain whether comparable systematic reviews and meta-analyses have already been published and to delineate the scope of the forthcoming review and meta-analysis. Generally, for interventional systematic reviews, the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) framework is considered for defining the scope and objectives of the research question  [60] . In this context, ChatGPT serves a dual role. On one hand, it expeditiously aids in searching for published systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to the relevant topics (See Figure  S1  and S2)  [34] . On the other hand, it assists in refining the clinical question that needs to be addressed (See Figure  S3 ), facilitating researchers in promptly determining the feasibility of undertaking the proposed study. However, it is important to be cautious of false literature  [35] ."

For LLMs, generating preliminary registration information and initial proposal content is remarkably convenient and facile (see Figures  S4  and  S5 ).\n\nFor example, ChatGPT can assist researchers in generating the statistical methods for a research proposal  [37] .

      "title": "Develop a search strategy and conduct searches",
      "text": "ChatGPT can assist in formulating search strategies, using PubMed as an example  [40] . Researchers can simply list their questions using the PICO framework, and a search strategy can be quickly generated (Figure  S1  and  S2 ). Based on the generated search strategy, one method is to copy the strategy into the PubMed search box for direct retrieval  [40] [41] . Another approach involves utilizing the OpenAI application programming interfaces (APIs) to invoke PubMed APIs with the search strategy generated by GPT. This allows for searching the PubMed database, obtaining search results, and applying predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, GPT is used to filter the search results, exporting and recording the filtered results in JSON format. This integrated process encompasses search strategy formulation, retrieval, and filtering. However, the direct use of LLMs to generate search strategies and complete the one-stop process of searching and screening may not be mature at present, and poses a significant challenge for generating the PRISMA flowchart.\n\nTherefore, we suggest using LLMs to generate search strategies, which are then optimized and modified by librarians and computer experts (specializing in large language models) before manually searching the databases. Additionally, to use search strategies transparently and reproducibly, detailed prompts should be reported  [40, 42] .these search strategies also need validation, refinement, and modification."

With the emergence of ChatGPT, researchers can now train the model based on pre-defined inclusion criteria. Subsequently, they can utilize ChatGPT to automatically screen records retrieved from databases, obtaining the filtered results .

Additionally, characteristics of the population, such as patient samples, age, gender, and outcome data, including event occurrences, mean change values, and total sample size, are also extracted. Currently, tools based on natural language processing and LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Claude, demonstrate high accuracy in extracting information from Portable Document Format (PDF) documents (Figure  S7 )  [47] [48] [49] [50] .\n\nHowever, it is important to note that despite the promising capabilities of these tools, manual verification remains a necessary step in the data extraction process when utilizing AI tools  [61] .\n\nUsing large language models to extract data can help avoid random errors; however, caution is still required when extracting data from figures or tables  [47] [48] [49] [50] ."

      "title": "Challenges and solutions",
      "text": "While LLMs can assist in accelerating the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in some steps, enhancing accuracy and transparency, and saving resources, they also face several challenges. For instance, LLMs cannot promptly update their versions and information. Currently, ChatGPT 3.5 is trained on data from around 2021. Limitations such as the length of prompts and token constraints, as well as restrictions related to context associations, may potentially impact overall results and user experience  [25] . Although LLM-based autonomous agents have made strides in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, LLMs still face numerous challenges due to issues related to personalization, updating knowledge, strategic planning, and complex problem-solving.\n\nThe development of LLM-driven autonomous agents adept at systematic reviews and metaanalyses warrants exploration  [66] . The use of LLMs as centrally controlled intelligent agents encompasses the ability to handle precise literature screening, extract and analyze complex data, and assist in manuscript composition, as demonstrated by proof-of-concept demos like MetaGPT\n\n[67]. Moreover, as the use of LLMs continues to grow \uff0c ensuring the accuracy of information provided in systematic reviews becomes a significant challenge, particularly if LLMs are indiscriminately overused.\n\nTo better facilitate the utilization of tools such as ChatGPT in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we believe that, first and foremost, authors should understand the scope and scenarios for applying ChatGPT, clearly defining which steps can benefit from these tools. Secondly, for researchers, collaboration with computer scientists and artificial intelligence engineers is crucial to optimize the prompts and develop integrated tools based on LLMs, such as web applications. These tools can assist in seamless transitions between different tasks in the systematic review process. Lastly, for journal editors, collaboration with authors and reviewers is essential to adhere to reporting and ethical principles associated with the use of GPT  [24, 68] . This collaboration aims to promote transparency and integrity, and to prevent indiscriminate overuse in the application of LLMs in systematic reviews and meta-analyses."
