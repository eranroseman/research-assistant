  "abstract": "Physical inactivity is one of the leading modifiable risk factors for global mortality, with an estimated 20% to 30% increased risk of death compared with those who are physically active. The \"behavior\" of physical activity (PA) is multifactorial, including social, environmental, psychological, and genetic factors. Abundant scientific evidence has demonstrated that physically active people of all age groups and ethnicities have higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, health, and wellness, and a lower risk for developing several chronic medical illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, compared with those who are physically inactive. Although more intense and longer durations of PA correlate directly with improved outcomes, even small amounts of PA provide protective health benefits. In this state-of-the-art review, the authors focus on \"healthy PA\" with the emphasis on the pathophysiological effects of physical inactivity and PA on the cardiovascular system, mechanistic/triggering factors, the role of preventive actions through personal, education/environment, and societal/authoritative factors, as well as factors to provide guidance for caregivers of health promotion regarding PA. Sustainable and comprehensive programs to increase PA among all individuals need to be developed and implemented at local, regional, national, and international levels to effect positive changes and improve global health, especially the reduction of cardiovascular disease.

      "title": "DEFINING PI AND PA",
      "text": "Typically, PA is defined as bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle contraction that requires energy expenditure above basal levels. It includes activities related to activities of daily life, such as housekeeping, yardwork, occupational-related, leisure-related, and transportation (e.g., walking/biking to and from work/school). Exercise typically is differentiated from PA in that it is typically planned, repetitive, and structured with the main objective of improving health and fitness. Physical fitness is a state of good health and strength achieved through PA and exercise, and includes both CRF, which is generally emphasized, as well as muscular strength and muscular fitness. Presently, PI defines at least 1 of every 5 adults worldwide  (10)  with an increased prevalence in more developed countries, among women, the elderly, and those with lower socioeconomic status. Furthermore, time spent in SB (e.g., sitting in front of a computer, viewing television, and so on) occupies approximately  54 .9% of time  (7.7  h/day)  (11, 12) . Clearly, PI is extremely prevalent in the United States, where the percentage of SB has increased from 55%  (2003 to 2004)  to 58%  (2005 to 2006)  in recent years  (13) . On the basis of the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which advocate for 150 min of moderate-intensity PA or 75 min of vigorous PA weekly,  56 .5% of respondents to the National Health Survey in 2008 did not meet these criteria  (14) ."

      "title": "ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH PI",
      "text": "Several large studies have demonstrated adverse health effects, including increased mortality, associated with PI/SB/prolonged sitting. A study published in the Lancet in 2012 found that world-wide, PI accounted for 9% (range 5.1% to 12.5%) of premature mortality worldwide and that elimination of PI could increase the life expectancy of the world population by 0.68 (range 0.41 to 0.95) years  (15) . In addition to mortality, PI was found to be independently responsible for several chronic diseases, including 6% (range 3.2% to 8%) of coronary heart disease (CHD), 7% (range 3.9% to 9.6%) of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 10% (range 5.6% to 14.1%) of breast cancer and considerable risk (range 5.7% to  13 .8%) of colon cancer, respectively. Similarly, a large meta-analysis demonstrated significant hazard ratio associations between self-reported SB with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]:  1.240 , 95% confidence interval:\n\n[CI]: 1.090 to  1.410 ), CVD mortality (HR:  1.179 , 95% CI:  1.106  to  1.257 ), CVD incidence (HR:  1.143 , 95% CI: 1.002 to  1.729 ), cancer mortality (HR:  1.173 , 95% CI:  1.108  to  1.242 ), cancer incidence (HR:  1.130 , 95% CI: 1.053 to  1.213 ), and T2DM incidence (HR:  1.910 , 95% CI:  1.642  to  2.222 )  (16) . In  a large meta-analysis reviewing 13 studies (including 1,005,791 subjects) with respect to sitting time and all-cause mortality, the investigators found that compared with the referent most active group (i.e., sitting <4 h/day and performing >35.5 metabolic equivalent [MET]-h/week), mortality rates were highest in those with the least PA (<2.5 MET-h/week and sitting >8 h/day; HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.31) (17). Interestingly, daily sitting time was not associated with increased all-cause mortality in those in the most active quartile of PA (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.10), suggesting that moderateintensity PA may negate the adverse effects associated with prolonged sitting time. For less active adults, replacing 1 h/day of sitting with an equal amount of PA was associated with lower all-cause mortality for both exercise (HR: 0.58 [95% CI: 0.54 to 0.63]) and nonexercise PA (HR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.66 to 0.74]), including household chores, lawn and garden work, and daily walking  (18) , emphasizing the fact that even lower volumes (i.e., less time at lower intensities) of PA have positive CV benefits.\n\nFrom a CVD standpoint specifically, the adverse relationship between PI and the incidence of CVD has been well-established  (19) . In a comprehensive review of 47 studies evaluating this association, the relative risk (RR) of CVD related to PI was 1.9 overall, with higher RRs (up to 2.4) reported in selected series.\n\nIn addition, the RR of PI proved to be similar in Fletcher et al. O C T O B E R 2 , 2 0 1 8 : 1 6 2 2 -3 9 Promoting Physical Activity and Exercise exercise appeared protective (odds ratio: 0.86 for first MI) among men and women of all age groups and ethnicities. Conversely, lack of PA accounted for 12%\n\nof the population-attributable risk of MI  (20) ."

      "title": "BENEFICIAL HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH PA: FROM PHYSIOLOGY TO CLINICAL PRESENTATION",
      "text": "The benefits of exercise have been proven at both biological and disease-specific levels  (21, 22) . At the cellular level, aerobic forms of exercise have been shown to have several beneficial antiatherogenic effects, including a decrease in serum triglycerides, an increase in high-density lipoprotein, and a decrease in low-density lipoprotein  (23) (24) (25) . Markers of inflammation decrease with regular PA and exercise.\n\nIn one study evaluating the effects of a regular exercise regimen in patients at risk for CVD, mononuclear cell production of atherogenic cytokines fell by  58 .3%, and the production of atheroprotective cytokines increased by  35.9% (26) . endothelial function and autonomic function, and have both anti-ischemic and antiarrhythmic effects  (31) (32) (33) (34) . Thus, there are multiple positive biological effects that clearly have a beneficial effect (Figure  1 )  (21, 22, 35) .\n\nRegarding the benefits of exercise at a diseasespecific level, systemic blood pressure (BP) improves with both habitual aerobic exercise and with resistance training. Systolic and diastolic BP decrease as much as 15 and 9 mm Hg, respectively, among patients with mild essential HTN  (36) . Exercise also reduces the risk of ischemic stroke  (37, 38) , improves glycemic control in patients with T2DM, and may help to prevent the development of metabolic syndrome and/or T2DM  (34, 35) . Exercise also has been shown to afford modest protection from a spectrum of cancers, including breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, endometrial, and pancreatic carcinomas  (39) (40) (41) . Regular exercise has been shown to be protective against both proximal and distal colon cancers, with a significant risk reduction of 27% for active individuals (42\n\n). In terms of other health benefits, exercise has beneficial effects related to osteoporosis and hip-fracture prevention (specifically, weight-bearing exercise), smoking cessation, improved cognition, prevention of dementia, and reduction in anxiety and depression (42-47). ROLE OF PA FOR THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD Regarding primary prevention of CVD, the protective effects of physical fitness, PA, and energy expenditure have been demonstrated in numerous studies. The study populations and results of a select number of these studies are summarized in Table 1 (20,48-70). The findings of these studies support that all forms of PA, regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity, have a beneficial effect in CVD prevention. In most studies, both intensity and duration of exercise or PA also have been shown to be directly related to improved outcomes and mortality. Compared with no regular exercise, however, any type of PA provides a protective effect against the risk of CVD (71). ROLE OF PA FOR THE SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CVD For secondary prevention among patients with CVD, numerous studies, many summarized in Table 2 (67,72-75), have shown the protective effects of PA, FIGURE 1 Benefits of PA/Exercise Psychologic \u2191 Social Interactions \u2193 Psychosocial Stress \u2193 Depression \u2191 Heart Rate Variability \u2193 Adrenergic Activity \u2191 Vagal Tone \u2191 Fibrinolysis \u2193 Platelet Adhesion \u2193 Fibrinogen \u2193 Blood Viscosity \u2191 Insulin Sensitivity \u2191 HDL / \u2193 LDL \u2193 Triglycerides \u2193 Blood Pressure \u2193 Adiposity \u2193 Inflammation Cardiac Remodeling \u2191 Coronary Flow \u2191 EPCs and CACs \u2193 Myocardial O 2 Demand \u2193 Endothelial Dysfunction \u2191 Nitric Oxide Anti-Arrhythmic Anti-Thrombotic Cardioprotective Mechanisms of Physical Activity Antiatherosclerotic Hemodynamics Mechanisms by which moderate-to-vigorous exercise training may reduce the risk for nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events. *Nitric oxide also has antithrombotic effects.

(61) 2,994 women Variables obtained from maxETT Low exercise capacity, low HR recovery, and failure to achieve target HR, but not ST-segment depression, were independently associated with allcause and CV mortality. Gulati et al. (62) 5,721 women Variables obtained from maxETT A nomogram to predicted exercise capacity (predicted MET \u00bc 14.7 \u00c0 (0.13 \u00c2 age) was used predict death. Subjects unable to achieve 85% of predicted MET value had twice the risk of death. Wagner et al. (63) 9,758 men Leisure-time net energy expenditure Leisure time PA energy expenditure was associated with a lower risk of hard CHD events; by contrast, walking or cycling to work did not correlate with hard events. Tanasescu et al. (64) 44,452 men Total physical activity, rowing, running, weight-training, walking Several forms of exercise were associated with reduced CHD risk. More intense exercise (MET level) and faster walking pace were associated with further reduced CHD risk reduction: Running for> 1 h/week-42% (RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.44-0.77) Weight training >30 min/week-23% (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61-0.98) Rowing >1 h/week-18% (RR: 0.82; 05% CI: 0.68-0.99) Walking briskly >0.5 h/day-18%/RR: 0.82; 05% CI: 0.68-0.99) LaMonte et al. (65) 3,232 men 1,128 women Variables obtained from maxETT Favorable inverse associations between fitness and most CHD risk factors were demonstrated among men and women. Higher fitness significantly reduced the odds of clinically relevant risk factor values among men and women without CHD. Continued on the next page exercise, and CRF in terms of reduction of recurrent CVD events. Among patients with documented or presumed CVD based on the presence of a positive stress test, peak exercise capacity or CRF was the strongest predictor of survival (72). In a large meta-analysis evaluating the benefits of cardiac prevention programs in patients with CVD, exercise programs were associated with a RR of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.95) for mortality (73). Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for patients with CVD probably reduces allcause and certainly CVD mortality, with additional beneficial effects on lipids, BP, smoking, inflammation, and especially on psychological risk factors, such as depression, anxiety, hostility, and total levels of psychological stress. The benefits of CR, particularly in CHD, are well known, although these benefits have now been extended to heart failure (HF) and peripheral arterial disease, and are summarized in Table 3 (35,47,76-78). In general, PA, including light and moderate habitual exercise, and moderate recreational PA, reduces mortality among men with CVD. In a study population of 772 men with established CVD from the United Kingdom, the lowest risks for all-cause and CVD mortality were seen in light and moderate PA groups. Recreational PA of $4 h per weekend, moderate or heavy gardening, and regular walking (>40 min/day) were all associated with a significant reduction in mortality. Men who were initially sedentary but began at least light PA showed lower mortality rates on follow-up than those who remained sedentary (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.03; p \u00bc 0.06) (74). In patients with CHD, recent studies indicate that PA is more important than weight (79), and changes in PA are considerably more important than long-term changes in body mass index regarding long-term prognosis (80). According to current guidelines, \"30 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic PA, such as brisk walking, at least 5 days and preferably 7 days per week, supplemented by an increase in daily lifestyle PA (e.g., walking breaks at work, gardening, household work) to improve CRF\" is recommended for patients with stable CVD (81). MECHANISTIC/TRIGGERING FACTORS FOR BEING PHYSICALLY ACTIVE Understanding the multiple factors that influence participation in PA and regular exercise is important TABLE 2 PA and Secondary Prevention First Author (Ref. #) Subjects Results Myers et al. (67) 6,213 men (3,679 with abnormal stress or documented CHD) Peak exercise capacity in METs was the strongest predictor of death both in normal subjects and those with CVD. Each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity conferred a 12% improvement in survival. Clark et al. (72) 21,295 pts with CHD (from 63 randomized trials) Comparison of the effects of cardiac prevention programs with or without exercise. Overall, the summary risk ratio was 0.85 (95% Cl: 0.77 to 0.94) for all-cause mortality and 0.83 (95% Cl: 0.74 to 0.94) for recurrent Ml at 12 months. Risk factor education \u00fe exercise program: 0.88 (95% Cl: 0.74 to 1.04) for mortality and 0.62 (95% Cl: 0.44 to 0.87) for myocardial infarction. Risk factor education alone: 0.87 (95% Cl: 0.76 to 0.99) for mortality and 0.86 (95% Cl: 0.72 to 1.03) for myocardial infarction. Exercise program alone 0.72 (95% Cl: 0.54 to 0.95) for mortality and 0.76 (95% Cl: 0.57 to 1.01) for myocardial infarction. Taylor et al. (73) 8,940 pts with CHD from 48 trials Cardiac rehabilitation was associated with reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.93) and cardiac mortality (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.96). There were greater reductions in total cholesterol, triglyceride levels, systolic blood pressure, and lower rates of self-reported smoking. There were no significant differences in the rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction and revascularization, and no changes in high-and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and diastolic pressure. Wannamethee et al. (74) 5,934 men with CHD The lowest risks for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were seen in light and moderate activity groups (adjusted relative risk compared with inactive/occasionally active: light 0.42 (0.25 to 0.71); moderate 0.47 (0.24 to 0.92); and moderately vigorous/vigorous 0.63 (0.39 to 1.03). Recreational activity of $4 h/weekend, moderate or heavy gardening, and regular walking (>40 min/ day) were all associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. Steffen-Batey et al. (75) 406 Mexican American and non-Hispanic white women and men Ml survivors Over a 7-yr period, the relative risk (95% Cl) of death compared with the sedentary, no change group was as follows: 0.21 (0.10 to 0.44) for the active, no change group; 0.11 (0.03 to 0.46) for the increased activity group; and 0.49 (0.26 to 0.90) for the decreased activity group. The relative risk of reinfarction was as follows: 0.40 (0.24 to 0.66) for the active, no change group; 0.22 (0.09 to 0.50) for the increased activity group; and 0.93 (0.59 to 1.42) for the decreased activity group. Abbreviations as in Table 1. different countries evaluated the heritability of leisure-time PA. These investigators found that the heritability for exercise activity of at least 60 min/week ranged from 27% (men in Norway) to 71% (women in the United Kingdom), with a median heritability of 62% for all countries (86). Clearly, PA levels had higher correlation in monozygotic compared with dizygotic pairs. The Vietnam Era Twin Registry investigators concluded that there was indeed a genetic contribution to PA (87). Another twin study comparing the duration of exercise (150 min/week vs. 60 min/week) suggested that, although both genetic and unique environmental factors contribute significantly to participation in PA, common environmental factors likely have a stronger influence on duration of PA (87).\n\nRegarding differential heritability of PA in males versus females, there is currently no consensus, given conflicting results in several large studies."

      "title": "ROLE OF NONGENETIC FACTORS",
      "text": "In a systematic review compiling the results of 25\n\npublished reviews that addressed the potential variables related to participation in PA  (88) , multiple personal and environmental factors were identified.\n\nPersonal variables evaluated included demographics, biological characteristics, behavioral factors, social and cultural factors, and psychological, cognitive, and emotional factors. Environmental variables included availability of facilities, type of neighborhood, safety, home environment, location of region, and climate. In this study, factors with a true correlation were deemed a \"definitely associated factor\" (DAF). Multiple personal factors, including age, health and/or fitness status, intention to exercise, outcome expectations, perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, and perceived fitness were assessed as DAFs in at least 3 of the 25 studies reviewed. Environmental factors considered as DAFs included accessibility to fitness centers, presence of sidewalks, and aesthetics. These specific associations that may influence participation in PA could provide directions for health care and aid community and governmental leaders to better design programs and facilities that may help to improve participation in PA and ultimately improve the health and wellness of our society (discussed in the following text). THE ROLE OF CR IN PROMOTING PA IN SECONDARY PREVENTION In the United States, Europe, and much of the world, CR is a Class I, Level of Evidence: A indication for the treatment of CVD and has thus received the highest classification possible from major professional societies (35,89,90). Indeed, there is reduced morbidity and mortality, especially CVD mortality, in patients who receive outpatient CR as opposed to those who do not (77,91,92). For inpatient CR, there is a paucity of such data. Nevertheless, most candidates for CR following major CHD events do not participate in formal CR and exercise training programs, and now, in the United States, the recommendation for formal CR has been extended to chronic, stable HF with a reduced ejection fraction as well as to patients with peripheral arterial disease (35). The barriers to attending and completing CR programs have been well described (35,77), including low referrals, inadequate \"vigorous\" referral, distance from the CR center, transportation issues, employment, costs (including lack of insurance coverage and high copays), and women and elderly are less likely to be referred and attend CR programs (35,77,93-95). Clearly, great efforts are needed to make these CR programs more available and affordable, not to mention \"cost-effective\" (78). For many CR candidates, automatic referral has become increasingly adopted. However, without strong endorsement of CR participation by the health care providers, patients are much less likely to attend CR (35,77,95,96). Strong multifaceted endorsement of CR from health care providers, including nurses, exercise specialists, physical therapists, social workers, and others, as well as from the physicians, is an TABLE 4 Key Recommendations for Integrating the Assessment and Promotion of PA into Clinical Practice\n\nPA assessment is a priority during all patient visits-particularly those at high risk for or diagnosed with 1 or more chronic diseases. The 2 central questions include: \"On average, how many days per week do you engage in moderate or greater intensity PA (like a brisk walk)?\" \"On average, how many minutes do you engage in this PA on those days?\"\n\nIf the product of the responses to the questions above indicate the individual is below the recommended U.S. PA guideline recommendation of 150 min/week, individuals should be advised of the health benefits of regular PA and encouraged to gradually increase either their frequency or duration of activity Consumer-oriented wearable devices or smartphones can objectively assess PA levels. Self-tracking is helpful to some individuals to increase their PA levels in the short term. A more structured promotion/referral/behavior change plan is needed for the maintenance of effects.\n\nThe recommended U.S. PA guidelines may be perceived by some individuals as unattainable. Health professionals should stress that accumulating at least 60 to 100 min/week of PA also has significant health benefits.\n\nAs recommended by the U.S. guidelines for Americans, a comprehensive assessment of PA should include engaging in muscle-strengthening, resistance, and flexibility exercises for major muscle groups at least twice a week. The following question can be used: \"How many days a week do you perform muscle-strengthening exercises such as body weight exercises or resistance training?\"\n\nBehavior change is a dynamic phenomenon; attempting to change unhealthy behaviors often entails a series of stages. Identifying behavioral readiness with the transtheoretical model of behavior change can help tailor the PA counseling.\n\nIn addition to behavioral readiness, assessment of physical readiness for exercise constitutes an important step for PA promotion. The deleterious health effects of inactivity far outweigh the risks of adverse events triggered by exercise. Following a pre-exercise screening protocol can reduce these risks and build trust between the provider and the patient.\n\nTo make PA promotion efforts more credible and motivating, health professionals should ensure that they lead a physically active lifestyle themselves. Personal experience influences a health care professional's view and approach to PA promotion."

The intervention was found to be particularly successful in reducing the incidence rate of stroke in the intervention group (11.81%, 95% CI: 5.90% to 17.72%) compared with the control group (19.78%, 95% CI: 14.07% to 25.50%; p \u00bc 0.03), however, no effect on incidence rate of MI (3.34%, 95% CI: 1.19% to 8.58%, and 6.68%, 95% CI: 1.64% to 11.73%, respectively) was observed. These favorable outcomes provide initial evidence supporting a group-based method of promoting and sustaining long-term PA adherence. Practitioners in clinical settings should be aware of similar programs available to the surrounding community or pursue establishing group-based programs in collaboration with key stakeholders in health and PA promotion for future patient referral. CONSIDERATIONS OF SOCIETAL FACTORS TO INCREASE PA. The \"Westernization\" of societies is often considered to be synonymous with progress and modernization of industries and technology that increase efficiency in the labor, transportation, and food production sectors. Consequently, societies that take steps toward Westernization have experienced sobering increases in the prevalence of metabolic disorders and CVD (130). Although many factors influence these trends, reductions in PA and increases in SB are major contributors (131). In the United States, there has been a 32% reduction in reported PA since 1965 (from 235 MET-h/week to 160 MET-h/week), and it is forecasted that PA levels will be 142 MET-h/week in 2020 due to reductions in occupational, domestic, and travel PA, with sedentary time increasing to 40 h/week (131). Characteristics of the built environment can influence PA behavior and the health profile of community members (132). Neighborhoods with greater perceived walkability, active transport infrastructure, and access to parks and playgrounds are often associated with more active residents (133). Recent outcomes reported from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis demonstrate the changes in built environment are associated with increases in reported PA (134) as well as reductions in body mass index (135). Furthermore, individuals that report Fletcher et al. J A C C V O L . 7 2 , N O . 1 4 , 2 0 1 8 Promoting Physical Activity and Exercise O C T O B E R 2 , 2 0 1 8 : 1 6 2 2 -3 9 regularly (3 times per week) bike commuting to work are associated with 20% lower cardiometabolic risk factors compared with those that drive (111). Yet, regularly biking for individuals who are overweight, older, and/or inactive may initially be perceived as a daunting task. For this reason, electronically assisted bicycles have become more popular in recent years. A short, 4-week intervention comparing the effects of regular electronically assisted bike commuting to conventional bike commuting in untrained overweight adults lead to similar increases in CRF (136). This form of transportation and activity may be unrealistic for a large portion of the population, and therefore, parks and those parks that incorporate outdoor fitness equipment may serve as an alternate, cost-effective strategy to increase moderate-intensity PA (137,138). Installation of these outdoor gyms have shown to significantly increase moderate-to vigorous-intensity PA performed by park users from 6% to 40% over a 12-month period, as well as significantly reducing the number of individuals who walk past an outdoor gym from 46% to 16%, indicating increased use over a 1-year period (139). However, there is less evidence quantifying the number of new park goers because of building outdoor gyms and the extent to which outdoor exercise spaces confer significant changes in PA behavior across populations, particularly untrained individuals. Accordingly, Arena et al. (137) have proposed to capitalize on the use of public parks to implement healthy lifestyle interventions by utilizing healthy lifestyle practitioners to facilitate the effective and broad use of outdoor gyms through a \"HealthPark\" model. It is also essential to consider that the aforementioned features are more commonly available in communities of economically advantaged individuals/families. Underserved communities, predominately composed of individuals with a lower socioeconomic status, face a paucity of sidewalks, active transportation options, and reduced perceptions of safety from crime, which are associated with low walking time and high vehicle time (140). Therefore, clinicians and other health practitioners providing PA counseling should be mindful of the individual's socioeconomic background, built environment, and perceptions of neighborhood safety to adjust PA recommendations accordingly. There will also have to be future investigative efforts to identify best practice strategies to incorporate PA interventions in these communities. Collectively, there are numerous factors that influence an individual's and community's ability to take on an active lifestyle and maintain long-term compliance. The successful clinical application of PA interventions will depend upon practitioners' considerations for personal, education, community, and societal actions and considerations to best direct individuals to resources that can provide individualized PA guidance. TYPE, DURATION, AND INTENSITY OF PA: WHAT IS THE CORRECT PRESCRIPTION? The exact formula (i.e., frequency, type, intensity, and duration) of exercise that provides the beneficial effects on primary and secondary prevention of CVD morbidity and mortality remains indeterminate. The relationship between PA and CVD risk has typically been described as curvilinear, with the highest risk attributed to those physically inactive and the lowest risk to those with the highest aerobic exercise volumes. Although the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report has recommended 150 min/week of moderate or 75 min/week of vigorous aerobic PA in conjunction with muscle-strengthening activities for most adults in this country (120,141), a small percentage of Americans comply with these guidelines. Despite the failure of most to fulfill these guidelines, several studies have shown that even a small amount of PA has a beneficial effect. At the lower end of the PA spectrum, those who engage in as little as 75 min of exercise 1 to 2 times per week, the so-called weekend warriors, have decreased all-cause and CVD mortality compared with sedentary individuals (1,142), supporting the notion that even small amounts of PA provide positive CV benefits. In terms of the type of exercise performed, one large cohort of 44,452 men demonstrated the benefit of short durations of several types of exercise in reducing CVD risk. Running for 1 h or more per week, rowing for 1 h or more per week, brisk walking for 30 min or more per day, or lifting weights for as little as 30 min per week had a significant positive effect in reducing the risk of CVD and mortality (2,64,103,143). Another large study (55,137 adults) evaluating the associations of running with all-cause and CVD mortality risks found that, at 15 years, runners had 30% and 45% lower adjusted risks of all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively, compared with nonrunners, conferring a 3-year life expectancy benefit. Interestingly, the mortality benefits in runners were similar across quintiles of running time, distance, frequency, amount, and speed. Persistent runners had the most significant benefits. Even those subjects running only 5 to 10 min daily and at slow speeds had marked reduction in risk of death from all causes and CVD (103). These data showing the benefits of even low levels of PA should encourage health care providers to discuss these findings with their patients with the J A C C V O L . 7 2 , N O . 1 4 , 2 0 1 8 Fletcher et al. O C T O B E R 2 , 2 0 1 8 : 1 6 2 2 -3 9 Promoting Physical Activity and Exercise potential to motivate sedentary individuals to begin and continue exercise to obtain significant mortality benefits. Although \"low-dose\" PA confers positive benefits, several studies have demonstrated a larger reduction in CVD events and risk factors for more vigorous as compared to moderate-intensity exercise (104). An increase in PA from the minimum effective duration of moderate PA (15 min a day) (144) or vigorous PA intensity (8 min a day) (9,103) to the national PA guidelines of 30 min a day of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 min a week of vigorous-intensity exercise significantly improves health outcomes (120). In one study, every additional 15 min of moderate-intensity PA translated into a 4% further reduction of allcause mortality over 13 years. The greatest benefit was obtained by the most active individuals (63 to 88 min a day), with higher mortality reductions for vigorous-intensity versus moderate-intensity exercise (144). Although the upper limit for moderateintensity PA in healthy individuals has not been defined, exercise of more than 100 min a day does not appear to be associated with additional reductions in mortality rates. For vigorous PA, low doses confer large benefits, whereas doses up to 10 times the recommended PA levels do not further reduce mortality (9,103,144). IS TOO MUCH EXERCISE HARMFUL TO THE CV SYSTEM? Controversy exists regarding the potential for harmful doses of PA. Although it generally has been accepted that the relationship between PA and health is curvilinear, more recent studies have suggested that a U-or J-shaped curve better defines this association with higher mortality rates at high doses of exercise (145-151). In a large study evaluating the PA of 49,113 women over a 9-year period, women reporting moderate PA, as expected, had significantly lower risk of a first CVD or venous thromboembolic event compared with inactive women (152). However, women reporting strenuous daily PA had higher risks of CVD, cerebrovascular disease, and venous thromboembolism compared with those performing strenuous PA limited to only 2 or 3 times a week. In a study evaluating graded exercise among survivors of a MI, running or walking was associated with decreased CVD mortality risk in a progressive fashion at most levels of exercise; however, the benefit was attenuated at the highest levels of exercise. Patients exceeding these PA limits had a mortality risk at 10.4 years that was similar to that of inactive survivors of a MI (146). Similar findings indicating a reverse J-shaped association of PA with CVD mortality was reported from a prospective cohort of 1,038 subjects with stable CVD. Both inactive and daily active patients had increased hazards of mortality compared with the reference group of patients whose activity was limited to 2 to 4 times per week (147). Although PI is associated with the highest mortality among all populations, high doses of strenuous or vigorous PA, especially among patients with CVD, may attenuate the positive health benefits and may be associated with increased morbidity/mortality."

      "text": "to becoming physically active include, but are not limited to, lack of time, lack of enjoyment, reduced self-efficacy, low social support, companionship, safety, and/or a misconception of the type, intensity, duration, and frequency of PA necessary to lower risk of CVD (107,108). Experiencing 1 or more of these barriers makes adopting a physically active lifestyle a formidable challenge for a large portion of the population.Additionally, 1-dimensional, one size fits all messaging strategies (i.e., \"walk briskly for 150 min per week\") by health professionals, may contribute to fortifying misconceptions of the volume and type of PA necessary to acquire health benefits. However, participation in \"nontraditional\" forms of PA, such as dance (109), ball games (109,110), and nonautomotive means of commuting to work (111,112), instill improvements in highly prognostic measures of future morbidity and mortality. A greater emphasis should therefore be placed on promoting all forms of PA and identifying health practitioners that can guide behavior change interventions, while considering the individual's personal barriers to becoming physically active.Developing sustained PA behaviors are highly dependent on an individual's self-regulatory skills, which encompass: 1) an awareness of the goal an individual is trying to accomplish; 2) the ability to selfmonitor behavior and establish a link to their goals;3) acquisition of feedback and information about their progress toward each goal; 4) self-evaluation of progress; and 5) ability to correct behavior that leads to progress toward their goal (113). The advent of consumer-wearable PA monitors was presented as ideal self-regulatory tools. In recent years, there has been exponential growth in the adoption of wearable consumer PA monitors to track and promote personal PA. Each generation of commercially competitive models have increased their ability to accurately quantify PA (i.e., step counts) and are quickly approaching the accuracy of research-grade models (114). Naturally, investigators have capitalized on the population's embrace of wearable PA monitors by working to identify effective interventions to modify PA behavior (115). A recent meta-analysis revealed that self-monitoring PA through popular technologies contributed to a 2,500 daily step increase from baseline and approached recommended daily step counts (7,000 steps) for overall health (116). Efforts have also been made to merge the self-monitoring capabilities of these devices with mobile applications that incorporate evidence-based behavior modification theories and have been efficacious in meaningfully improving PA (117). The favorable outcomes reported in these studies may certainly imply that mobile health and personal PA trackers are the solution to PI. However, it is important to keep in mind that many of these studies were conducted over a relatively short period of time (i.e., 6 months) and are not reflective of long-term PA adoption. Findings from a large-scale, 24-month-long trial by Jakicic et al. (118) demonstrated lower weight loss (difference of 2.4 kg) in participants that followed an evidence-based program in combination with a wearable PA device compared with participants following the weight loss program alone. Although there may have been many contributing factors to this observation, one limitation may have been related to the ability of oldergeneration PA monitors to accurately quantify PA, leading participants to potentially believe that they were more active than they actually were. Accordingly, more recent iterations of consumer PA monitors seek to mitigate this limitation by making heart rate monitoring readily available and incorporating algorithms to quantify the time spent in moderate and vigorous heart rate ranges (119). However, future studies with these devices are needed to establish their efficacy. ACTION TAKEN THROUGH EDUCATION AND THE COMMUNITY. The seminal works of Drs. Morris and Paffenbarger ignited a field of inquiry that aims to identify sobering consequences associated with SB and highlight the dose response relation between PA and health outcomes, with the aim of optimizing community health through movement. A culmination of subsequent findings from landmark observational and intervention studies helped formulate PA guidelines for reducing the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases (120). Despite scientific, national, and global institutions spearheading educational campaigns to bring awareness to the PA recommendations, an initial analysis demonstrated that only 36% of U.S. adults had seen, read, or heard of the governmental PA guidelines, with just 1% aware that the recommended volume of exercise for substantial health benefits was 150 min of moderate intensity PA per week (121). It became quickly evident that more direct methods were necessary to effectively increase awareness and education regarding the PA guidelines (122). Although many approaches exist to enable the dissemination of health education, strong physician endorsement of PA J A C C V O L . 7 2 , N O . 1 Promoting Physical Activity and Exercise during outpatient visits is one way in which individuals at risk for developing CVD can be reached. Recent observations within a large health care system adopting the concept of treating PA as a vital sign had 80% to 96% of physicians addressing and promoting PA during outpatient visits (123,124), contributing to modest improvements in well-established risk factors for CVD (125). Yet, this initiative is only an initial step toward widespread community adoption of healthy lifestyle practices, particularly when considering that many intervention trials that utilize standard of care (i.e., providing education on the PA guidelines) as the control group, do not show clinically meaningful changes in prognostic health markers. Additionally, physicians are often inundated with clinical responsibilities and are left little time to effectively discuss strategies to become physically active, let alone conduct routine assessments of patient PA status. Thus, implementing multidisciplinary approaches across health care professionals is a more attractive approach to healthy lifestyle behavior change (126,127). Although PA intervention trials have clearly established the efficacy of improving CVD risk factors, the highly controlled nature of these investigations may become unrealistic for many exercise-naive individuals to maintain and/or perform as a result of limited access to resources (i.e., exercise facilities/ equipment, individualized attention from exercise professionals). Community-based PA interventions on the other hand generally require fewer resources to identify impactful PA options for participants. The successful implementation of community-level PA interventions has been largely predicated upon providing a comprehensive intervention that assists participants to successfully move through the stages of behavior change (i.e., pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance). Partnerships among clinicians, healthy lifestyle practitioners, and community health centers serve as the ideal framework to deliver such programs. Gong et al. (128) provided compelling outcomes in a group of hypertensive adults enrolled in an 8-session (6 main sessions with 2 \"booster\" sessions), group-based PA intervention. The aim of the intervention was to utilize educational, individual, and small group sessions to progress participants through the different stages of behavior change (129)."

      "text": "priate and impactful premise (156). Clearly, PA patterns as well as CRF should also be considered vital signs(153,155). With broad and growing agreement that exercise and movement in general are medicine, and both PA status and CRF are vital signs, there is a need for health care professionals to integrate these concepts into their delivery of care. To achieve this goal, the way we train health care professionals and what is expected of them once they begin practicing must evolve.The AHA addressed the topic of lifestyle counseling during medical school training in a recent scientific statement, citing there is currently a low percentage of physicians who discuss lifestyle issues with patients, including PA (157). In a recent survey of physicians before receiving lifestyle training, exercise prescriptions were provided in <10% of office visits (158). The frequency of PA counseling is also low in those individuals who are in particularly urgent need of moving more. For example, a cohort of obese patients reported their primary care providers counseled them on exercise and PA during z20% of office visits (159). In truth, there is currently a low prevalence of training on the importance of regular exercise, moving more throughout the day, and CRF in Fletcher et al. medical schools (157,160). The lack of training in this area translates into a perceived lack of importance on the topic, which in turn leads to a failure to integrate PA, exercise, and CRF assessments and interventions into clinical practice. Conversely, medical training that includes lifestyle counseling into the curriculum in a meaningful way leads to students recognizing the importance of a healthy lifestyle into their clinical practice (161). Numerous leading organizations, including the AHA, American College of Cardiology Foundation, American College of Physicians and the Institute of Medicine endorse meaningful integration of how to assess PA patterns and effectively counsel those patients who have excess SB or have suboptimal PA patterns into medical school curricula (157,162,163). For those physicians who are currently practicing, research demonstrates that additional training on the importance of PA and exercise can significantly improve the integration of these important principles into their patient examinations and care plans (158,164,165). Clearly, PA, exercise, and CRF assessments and interventions should be integrated into the practice of all health professionals. As examples, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, physical and occupational therapists, clinical exercise physiologists, and registered dieticians all have an important role to play. Granted, the amount of time spent assessing PA, exercise habits, and CRF will vary greatly across practitioners. At a minimum, however, all health care professionals should ask simple questions related to how much the patients they care for exercise, and stress the importance of being more physically active if the patient reports leading a less than ideally active or completely sedentary lifestyle. Health care professionals without a primary focus on exercise as medicine should also be cognizant of when to refer patients to other members of the multidisciplinary team (i.e., clinical exercise physiologists) when there is a need of intensive lifestyle interventions (e.g., patient diagnosed with CVD and eligible for CR). Similar to medical school, with the exception of clinical exercise physiologists, the curricula of other health professions commonly do not have a meaningful amount of time committed to exercise and PA assessment and counseling (166,167). Educational models are emerging that may provide an opportunity to increase training in this area across the different health professions (160,168). The AHA recently published a scientific statement entitled \"Routine Assessment and Promotion of Physical Activity in Healthcare Settings\" (123). This excellent scientific statement describes the role of various health professions in assessing and promoting PA, as well as describes current best practice models. Readers are highly encouraged to become familiar with this publication."
