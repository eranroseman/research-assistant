  "title": "A Text Message Intervention to Minimize the Time Burden of Cancer Care",
  "abstract": "Patients with cancer spend considerable time commuting to, waiting for, and receiving health care. Patient-reported outcomes have been collected electronically to monitor patients for toxicity related to treatment, but, to the authors' knowledge, they have not been used as a strategy to minimize patients' time spent on cancer care by streamlining care delivery. Researchers at Penn Medicine set an objective to assess the effectiveness and implementation of a text message-based symptom reporting electronic triage (e-triage) versus usual care to minimize the time toxicity associated with ambulatory cancer care. The methods employed included a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation, unblinded, randomized controlled trial and sequential mixed-methods study, which was conducted between December 1, 2021, and December 31, 2022, with a follow-up period of 3 months or three visits (whichever came first, but all within the 2-year window). Adult patients with solid tumors receiving single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with access to a textmessaging device were enrolled, with a target sample size of 176. The intervention was a symptom-based e-triage via mobile text messaging combined with routine laboratory testing. Participants in the e-triage group with normal bloodwork and no symptoms of drug toxicity on e-triage were eligible to fast-track to ICI infusion, bypassing the pretreatment office visit. The primary end point was total time per ambulatory encounter; secondary end points",

Implementation readiness (acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility), barriers, and facilitators were evaluated in a mixedmethods analysis among treating oncologists, measured via surveys and focus groups. For the study, 40 patients were randomly assigned, of which 31 were evaluated for the primary end point; the median age among the 40 participants was 67.5 years of age (interquartile range 59.5-71.5 years of age), 80.0% were male, and 84.6% were white. Those randomly assigned to the e-triage group of the pilot randomized controlled trial (n=19, n=16 evaluable) had an average of 66.0 minutes less total time (95% confidence interval [CI], -123.7 to -8.08 minutes; P=0.03) and 30.1 minutes less wait time (95% CI, -60.9 to 1.1 minutes; P=0.08) per encounter, than those in usual care (n=21 randomly assigned, n=15 evaluable). ED or hospital visits, health-related quality of life, and patient satisfaction scores were similar. In the mixedmethods study, oncologists (n=31, 17 completed the survey) found the e-triage acceptable (mean 3.8, standard error [SE] 0.1), appropriate (mean 3.8, SE 0.1), and feasible (mean 3.9, SE 0.1) on a 5-point Likert scale of agreeability. Perceived barriers to uptake included challenges in patient identification, potential for drug toxicity underreporting, and reimbursement concerns. The authors conclude that the results of this pilot randomized controlled trial of a text message-based e-triage supports further investigation into the use of text messagebased symptom reporting by patients as a strategy to safely assess readiness for treatment and thus reduce the time toxicity associated with cancer care.\n\nPatients with cancer spend a substantial portion of their time receiving health care.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5]  Frequent and time-intensive health care encounters are costly to patients and their caregivers, from lost wages to lost time with loved ones.  2, 6, 7 The collective time spent by patients commuting to, waiting for, and receiving cancer treatment has been defined as time toxicity.  [8] [9] ] [10]  Among patients with advanced cancer who face limited survival, time spent pursuing cancer treatment may reduce meaningful survival time.  2  Innovative strategies that optimize nonmedical time with high-quality cancer care are needed.\n\nThe leveraging of digital technologies to monitor patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in oncology is well established,  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]  but, to our knowledge, has not yet been applied as a tool to minimize the time toxicity of cancer treatment, particularly in ambulatory care. PRO collection offers an opportunity to personalize cancer care delivery, potentially lessening the need for standard inperson office visits prior to infusion treatment in the appropriate clinical context. In contrast to cytotoxic chemotherapy, many patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) do not experience severe toxicity, although those patients who do require early intervention.  [20] [21] 1] [22] [23] [24]  (The ICIs act in a way that inhibits immune-related adverse events.) In a previous study, we measured the performance characteristics of a mobile text message-based electronic-triage (e-triage) instrument in ICI-treated patients and demonstrated that this instrument accurately identified those without symptoms of toxic effects with a 100% negative predictive value and 0% false negative rate.  25  We hypothesized that an e-triage intervention, when combined with routine laboratory testing, could be a novel strategy to identify solid tumor oncology patients who can safely bypass the routine pretreatment office visit and fast-track directly to ICI infusion.\n\nIn this article, we report the results of our type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study.  26 irst, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of a text message-based e-triage intervention, as compared with usual care, to minimize the time toxicity of ambulatory cancer care. Next, we identified barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of the intervention using a mixed-methods approach.  27 is design was chosen to test the effectiveness of the intervention while also describing the implementation experience through process evaluation, guided by Enola Proctor's conceptual model (Appendix, Supplemental Exhibit 1).  27"

The e-triage consisted of 16 questions (Appendix, Supplemental Exhibit 2), modified from the validated National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,  28  sent to patients via Way to Health's  29  two-way texting system 96 hours prior to their scheduled ICI infusion. Questions pertained to common or emergent immune-related adverse events as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and two senior disease experts.  [20] [21] 1] [22]  Patients were prompted via text to record the presence and severity of symptoms over the week prior to the next scheduled infusion, and had 24 hours to complete the tool. The performance characteristics of the 16-question instrument to identify patients without symptoms of ICI toxicity were previously reported.  25 sponses to the e-triage system (i.e., presence or absence of new or worsening symptoms), as well as recent results of relevant laboratory testing, were reviewed by the clinical and research staff in the electronic medical record prior to the scheduled clinic appointment. Laboratory testing (complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic panel, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level) was obtained at any Penn Medicine location (hereafter referred to as \"Penn\") or at a local commercial laboratory, per patient preference. Patients with acceptable laboratory testing and no symptoms identified on the text message-based e-triage were eligible for fasttracking directly to ICI infusion, bypassing the usual pretreatment clinical evaluation. Eligible patients could opt for or against the fast-track: patients opting for fast-tracking were offered a dedicated infusion appointment, and patients (or their clinicians) opting against fast-tracking were scheduled for an in-person evaluation prior to scheduled ICI infusion (usual care)."

Patients were eligible if they planned to receive ICIs at Penn, could read English, and had access to and ability to use a mobile phone with text messaging capabilities. Patients were ineligible if they were participating in an investigational clinical trial, as those studies require conventional evaluation and symptom reporting. Treatment with ICIs was selected because of the prevalence of ICI use and the relatively low toxicity (compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy). At the onset of trial enrollment (December 2021 through April 2022), only patients newly initiating ICI therapy were eligible for inclusion. Following feedback from clinical staff in May 2022, the study protocol was amended to allow for enrollment to include patients with any ongoing ICI treatment due to concern for a relative increased risk of ICI toxicity among new ICI initiators.\n\n\" The primary end point was total care time, defined as the all-inclusive time patients spent traveling to and receiving ambulatory care including commute time, lab time, wait time, and infusion time, per encounter.\""

The commuting time was estimated based on the distance between the patient's home address and the care delivery location. This was captured prospectively using a combination of a real-time location system to track patients (AirFinder)  30  deployed in clinics, and patient-reported time spent obtaining local labs. In addition, time stamp data were prospectively abstracted from the electronic medical records (Epic Systems, Verona, Wisconsin) and used in instances of a technical malfunction of the AirFinder system (29 encounters, or 26%). Distance and travel times were calculated using the Google Maps application programming interface (API) via the googleway package in R statistical software version 4.3.1.  31, 32 The time spent obtaining local laboratory tests was self-reported by patients via a survey at the time of their infusion treatment. Secondary end points included wait time, as measured as the total care time minus the time spent with the physician, undergoing laboratory tests, receiving treatment, and commuting; incident ED visits or hospitalization during follow-up; health-related quality of life, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General (FACT-G) 27-item questionnaire; and patient satisfaction, as measured by the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire 18 (PSQ-18).  33, 34 he FACT-G and PSQ-18 were administered via an iPad (Apple, Cupertino, California) and completed at enrollment and at each subsequent infusion visit. All survey results were collected and managed using encrypted REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Pennsylvania.  35, 36 Exploratory end points included implementation outcomes such as reach (the proportion of patients who participated in the trial out of the number approached) and fidelity (the proportion of patients in the intervention group who adhered to their triage assignment)."

I have a patient who's a national advocate and he is also a patient that participated in the TIME study and he was so excited about this. He loves it. And I think that there are core missions at the cancer center, one of them is access to care in our catchment area. And I think that picking kind of pots of patients with variable needs would be a really good way to figure out who is benefiting both from the physician end of it and the patient end of it. So I'm very supportive of the efforts that you guys are doing.\" Opportunities to leverage a multidisciplinary care team \"I would just say that multiple comments here are on sort of teamwork and clinic team efficiency is tied to good relationships with nursing clinicians. So any support for that kind of dynamic I think is a facilitator. And another facilitator I think would be having nursing champions. So having infusion nurses who are very aware of what's going on with the protocol and understand it and can talk to patients and comfort them so that they understand that it's opt in and that you're not having anything taken away, it's a choice.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Among outpatients receiving ICIs, text message-based symptom reporting to select patients for a fast-track process allowing them to proceed directly to infusion (e-triage) compared with usual care (a standard office visit) resulted in 66 minutes less total care time and 30 minutes less wait time per outpatient encounter. Furthermore, participants in the e-triage group did not experience increased ED or hospital visits or decreased health-related quality of life or patient satisfaction. These results suggest that the use of a mobile device capturing PROs can safely assess patients' readiness for ICI therapy, and effectively reduce the time burdens of cancer care, such as unnecessary office visits.\n\nPrior work has found that patients with cancer spend an average 16 hours over a 4-to 5-day period per-month on anticancer treatment-related activities.  4 Cancer survivors and their caregivers describe cancer care as time consuming, requiring strong social support, flexibility (i.e., being retired), and financial security to mitigate treatment burden.  40 As of late 2024, research to mitigate time toxicity has primarily focused on strategies to optimize clinic function through improved workflows,  [41] [42] [43] [44]  space utilization,  42, [44] [45] [46] [47]  and provider availability.  46, 47 Others have attempted to measure toxicity as a patient-centered outcome (i.e., home days) to facilitate treatment decision-making.  48 However, to our knowledge, ours is the first prospective trial to leverage digital collection of PROs to reduce time toxicity and personalize cancer care delivery. Given that trial participants reported that a minimum 45-minute reduction of ambulatory care time would positively impact their quality of life, our finding of a 66-minute reduction of time with the intervention is clinically meaningful.\n\nThe hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study design is an important tool to understand implementation end points while also testing the effectiveness of a novel program. Although findings from the pilot RCT demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of the e-intervention, implementation challenges were identified. For example, while physicians found the intervention to be acceptable, appropriate, and feasible, the most common reason for screen failure was physician assessment of the patient as inappropriate for trial participation. In addition, even among patients appropriate for trial participation and fast-track eligible, physicians opted against fast-track in 26.3% of encounters, suggesting some inherent concerns regarding the e-triage system. Potential strategies identified by the focus groups to address such barriers included more stringent inclusion criteria (e.g., at least 3 months of uneventful ICI treatment before enrollment) and integration of oncology nursing into the preinfusion e-triage assessment. In addition, oncologists identified the need to better integrate e-triage systems into existing clinical workflows within the electronic medical record to minimize the workload of physicians and support staff. For example, the clinical time spent administering and reviewing the e-triage results should be seen as a value added rather than as a penalty that results in less revenue-generating patient-visits.  49 fforts to decrease time toxicity with e-triage systems such as the one proposed in this study align well with the shift from a traditional fee-for-service model to one valuing high-quality patientcentered care."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study has several limitations. It was conducted in single urban academic cancer center and patients were primarily white (84.6%), male (80.0%), and with a higher socioeconomic status (40.0% earned more than US$100,000 per year), limiting generalizability. The study relied on English-only participants, given limited resources for translating the instrument into multiple languages; expansion would be a key part of a larger study.\n\nThe e-triage intervention also relied on mobile phone, text message-based symptom capture; future studies should include alternative assessments (including phone-, email-, or Web-based symptom reporting). In addition, despite random assignment, and likely due to low accrual, we observed some imbalances in patient characteristics, such as commute distance, raising the possibility of confounding. And while a subset of patients (9 of the 19 randomly assigned to the intervention group, 47.3%) deviated from their e-triage assignment at least once as either they or their physician opted against the fast-track mechanism and instead preferred an office assessment, this would bias results toward the null, which was not observed in our study. Furthermore, we were not able to measure patient commute in real time and, as such, had to use a proxy of calculated commute time using a Google Maps API. Therefore, we are not able to account for variations in time if patients started from another location other than their home. In addition, time spent completing the PRO was not included in total care time, although this was expected to take patients less than 5 minutes to complete. Finally, owing to the limited follow-up of 3 months or three visits and challenges meeting our target enrollment, this work represents a proof-ofconcept pilot study to inform future studies. These future studies should include cost-effectiveness analyses, which were not performed as part of this work."

      "title": "Looking Ahead",
      "text": "In an era of evolving care delivery models that prioritize patient-centeredness, a novel e-triage program incorporating PRO collection and local laboratory assessments offers the opportunity to streamline cancer care delivery. However, before this approach can be adopted into clinical practice, further work needs to improve the integration of the e-triage system into routine clinical workflows, enhance the e-triage system by incorporating nursing to address patient and clinician barriers to participation, and test the cost-effectiveness and real-world effectiveness of this approach in a larger scale, pragmatic trial with longer follow-up and a larger, more generalizable cohort. If found to be efficacious, similar approaches can be developed for other infusion treatments both in oncology and other settings such as rheumatology. In addition, studies to better understand what patients desire in alternative care models will help to increase the impact of such interventions. It is important to note that this intervention is not meant to be deployed for all eligible patients, but rather to create options for them. The standard approach for health care traditionally has been one size fits all. This initiative is designed to create a model of care that gives patients an option that they may find works better for them.\n\nThe findings from this study support further efforts to optimize the design and implementation of an e-triage program to minimize the time burden of routine cancer care. In the interim, some institutional priorities and logistical challenges (such as implementation of a new electronic medical record) have resulted in delays in scaling this program. Work to design a multiinstitutional trial to assess this intervention is actively under way."
