  "title": "Mobile Health for Asthma",
  "abstract": "Asthma is a highly prevalent disease associated with significant individual and health systemlevel burdens. Mobile health (mHealth) apps and connected mobile digital devices, all of which are in the category of mHealth, may have the potential to address many of the important care gaps in asthma. In this narrative review, we document the current state of asthma mHealth for adults, discuss the main challenges to widespread asthma mHealth adoption, and explore future possibilities for asthma mHealth. The number of asthma mHealth options is growing, classified into four discrete categories based on technology type: standalone apps, digital inhalers, digital spirometers, and other mHealth devices used in asthma care. Evidence for asthma mHealth effectiveness is emerging, but systematic assessment is challenging because of technological heterogeneity. To attain more general clinical viability, challenges include advancing the evidence for mHealth effectiveness; promoting accessibility and inclusivity; sustaining patient engagement and successful integration into clinical workflows; ensuring mHealth safety; and considering future regulatory, economic, and pedagogical needs. If these challenges are met, asthma mHealth may help to deliver personalized digital asthma care when combined with novel artificial intelligence approaches, to improve the validity of future asthma research, and to enhance the provision of virtual asthma care. As mobile technology becomes a greater part of our lives and investment and interest in mHealth continues to grow, providers who care for patients with asthma must prepare for this mHealth digital revolution and lobby for safe, effective, and equitable mHealth solutions.",

      "text": "Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic airways disease, affecting > 21 million adults in the United States as of 2020. Asthma also was responsible for roughly 1 million ED visits and 100,000 hospitalizations in 2019 and accounts for > $50 billion in yearly health care costs.  1, 2 Globally, 26 million disabilityadjusted life-years are lost annually because of asthma.  3 Although effective therapies are available for most people with asthma, most have uncontrolled disease, as many as 60% in the United States.  [4] [5] 5] [6]  This can lead to asthma exacerbations associated with significant morbidity and mortality, which > 40% of US adults with asthma experience yearly.  1  In the United States alone, 10 people die because of asthma every day.  2  The care gaps responsible for suboptimal asthma control are present at both the patient and provider levels. At the patient level, these include poor inhaler adherence and technique, lack of environmental trigger control, insufficient understanding of asthma control, and underuse of self-management asthma action plans.  5, 7, 8 At the provider level, inadequate and irregular assessment of asthma control including spirometry, undertreatment, failure to provide comprehensive asthma education and action plans, and failure to refer to specialty care for severe asthma all are significant issues.  5, [7] [8] 9] [10] [11]  As mobile technology like smartphones has become a routine part of our lives over the past 20 years, a growing body of research has sought to explore how apps and other mobile digital devices might be able to address many of these important care gaps in asthma. The use of mobile technology for the provision of health services and information is known as mobile health (mHealth), as defined by the World Health Organization.  12 Health tools can be used to track and share health data, deliver individually tailored disease education, promote positive health behavior change, enhance patient and provider connectivity, and facilitate the provision of evidence-based care.  13 thma is an attractive target for mHealth. It is a highly prevalent disease with significant individual and health system burdens, many of its care gaps may be amenable to mHealth solutions, and its relatively young patient demographic has a high level of familiarity and comfort with mobile technology.  [14] [15] 5] [16]  In this review, we discuss the current state of asthma mHealth for adults and the evidence to support it, present the challenges that must be addressed for asthma mHealth to reach its full potential, and imagine the future possibilities presented by an evolving technological milieu."

These included tracking peak flow, medication use, asthma symptoms and triggers, sleep quality, medical appointments, and location of asthma attacks. Other prominent asthma app features were information functions (including therapeutic information, general asthma information, medication information, and inhaler technique guidance, present in 68% of apps); self-assessment or self-management functions, or both (decision support, peak flow classification, asthma action plans, and symptom forecasts, present in 53% of apps); and notification functions (medication alerts, asthma questionnaires, peak flow measurement reminders, and appointment reminders, present in 47% of apps). A systematic quality appraisal of included asthma apps found them to be, on average, \"marginally above acceptable,\" with a mean mobile app rating score (MARS) of 3.17 (the average of 19 items covering app engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality, each rated on a five-point Likert scale in which 1 indicates inadequate quality, 2 indicates poor quality, 3 indicates acceptable quality, 4 indicates good quality, and 5 indicates excellent quality).  18, 19 The MARS has been validated and shown to be a reliable and objective measure of app quality across a range of health conditions.  20"

Both types of digital inhalers pair wirelessly with dedicated apps and also can share data securely with provider-facing portals.  23 Common functions include recording the time of each actuation and providing reminders for scheduled doses.

      "title": "Digital Spirometers",
      "text": "Digital spirometers are ultraportable electronic spirometers intended for home use by patients with asthma to track their spirometry and peak flow measurements. As with digital inhalers, they often are paired wirelessly with dedicated apps and have the potential to share lung function data with health care practitioners through secure portals. A review of digital spirometers identified 16 devices, of which four had US Food and Drug Association (FDA) approval at the time.  25 Currently, six digital spirometers capable of full spirometric measurements are FDA approved and commercially available (Table  2 ). Of note, several other FDAapproved devices that measure only peak expiratory flow and FEV 1 also are available that we have not included in the table. Systematic assessment of app quality for digital spirometer-associated apps is not currently available.\n\nOther mHealth Devices Used in the Care of Asthma\n\nThe last category of asthma mHealth includes other mobile digital devices not specifically designed for asthma but used, often in combination with other mHealth devices, as part of asthma care. These devices may include digital oximeters, activity trackers, scales, sleep monitors, and other devices that digitally record physiologic or health parameters, or both.  26, 27 They may connect with dedicated apps to facilitate unified monitoring and sharing of information with health care teams and often are part of modern asthma telemonitoring programs.  28  Text Messaging mHealth?\n\nBased on the inclusive World Health Organization definition of mHealth, text messaging interventions also may be categorized as mHealth, and a rich body of literature exists specifically evaluating the use of text messaging as a mobile intervention in asthma care.  29, 30 owever, because text messaging interventions do not rely on the internet or make use of the full and complex feature sets of smart devices available today, they often are excluded from asthma mHealth reviews  31  and are not addressed further in this review. With the increasing adoption of smartphones and access to broadband internet services in the United States and globally, the full functionalities of the more complex modern mHealth interventions detailed in this review are more accessible than ever before.  32, 33 e Evidence for Asthma mHealth\n\nThe pace of clinical research in asthma mHealth is still accelerating, and given the lack of an accepted classification system, significant heterogeneity in definitions of mHealth across the literature remains. However, several systematic reviews published in the last 5 years have begun to elucidate the overall state of evidence for asthma mHealth. Using our proposed asthma mHealth taxonomy, we summarize the results of these reviews herein, discuss the limitations of current research, and highlight examples of commercially available individual mHealth interventions in each category. It is also important to note that beyond the technology itself, the context of asthma mHealth delivery likely also affects its success. For example, ongoing clinical monitoring and feedback combined with mHealth may be more effective than independent patient use alone, but also presents practical challenges.  [34] [35] [36]  Standalone Apps\n\nA 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis by Miller et al  37  of mobile technology interventions for asthma self-management in adults included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of standalone asthma apps, one trial that also included a home spirometer not connected with the provided app, and seven trials involving text messaging-based mobile interventions. The asthma apps provided symptom, medication, and peak expiratory flow tracking; medication reminders; health care team messaging services; automated feedback on asthma status and management advice; and asthma action plans. Meta-analyses that included the app trials did not show significant improvements in medication adherence, lung function, or unscheduled visits compared with paper-based interventions, but did demonstrate improvements in quality of life (Hedges g, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.19-1.08), unscheduled ED visits (Hedges g, -0.64; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.38), and asthma control (Hedges g, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-0.69) compared with standard treatment.\n\nThe specific aggregated effects of standalone apps could not be assessed because all the meta-analyses also included text messaging-based intervention trials, and none of the three standalone apps evaluated are widely available for download currently.  37 A 2021 review of digital health technology in asthma by Mosnaim et al  29  identified several more recent standalone app studies, many of which demonstrated positive effects on medication adherence, asthma control, health care use, or a combination thereof. However, because it was a scoping review, metaanalysis was not performed. Given the limitations of these reviews, other approaches to evaluating available asthma apps are helpful, such as the 2019 review by Ramsey et al  38  that examined the inclusion of evidence-based behavior change techniques among apps currently available for download. The authors concluded that two asthma self-monitoring and selfmanagement apps, AsthmaMD (AsthmaMD Inc.) and Kiss myAsthma (Asthma Australia), included optimal behavior change techniques. Of these two, only Kiss myAsthma has been evaluated formally, demonstrating improvements in asthma quality of life in a short-term pilot study.  39 Other available asthma apps with positive clinical effectiveness data include ASTHMAXcel (Montefiore Applications, LLC), an asthma education app, and eAMS (EAPOC), the patient-facing component of a primary care asthma clinical decision support system.  [40] [41] [42]  Digital Inhalers\n\nA 2021 systematic review of mHealth apps that interface with inhaler sensors by Nguyen et al  43  evaluated six studies (both RCTs and non-RCTs) that used two different inhaler systems-the Propeller Health (ResMed) platform (FDA approved) (Table  1 ) and the BreatheSmart system (developed by Cohero Health and using the HeroTracker sensor, which is not FDA approved). Although no meta-analysis was performed, individual studies demonstrated that digital inhaler systems improved maintenance inhaler adherence, decreased mean daily rescue inhaler use, and increased rescue inhaler-free days. Studies did not show a significant effect on asthma control, but all studies reported high user satisfaction levels with mHealth.  43 A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of digital interventions on medication adherence by Jeminiwa et al  44  included three RCTs incorporating electronic monitoring with digital inhalers. Meta-analysis showed a significant effect on adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (standardized mean difference, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.49-1.89) with electronic adherence monitoring.  44 Only one of the studied digital inhalers (the progenitor to the Hailie device detailed in\n\nTable 1) currently is available and approved by the FDA. Finally, a 2017 Cochrane review of interventions to improve inhaled corticosteroids adherence by Normansell et al 45 included six RCTs chestpulmonary.org involving digital inhalers. Pooled analysis demonstrated that mean adherence was nearly 20% better with electronic inhaler monitoring (mean difference, 19.86; 95% CI, 14.47-25.26\n\n) compared with a control, but no significant effects were seen on oral steroid requirements, exacerbations, or asthma control.  45 Once again, the only currently available and FDA-approved digital inhaler included in this analysis was the progenitor to the Hailie device."

      "text": "Currently, no systematic reviews of the impact of digital spirometers on clinical outcomes have been published.  25 owever, a number of individual studies show that digital spirometers reliably reproduce spirometric measurements from laboratory settings and from larger portable devices approved for clinical use. Studies also demonstrate that the spirometric measurements consistently can meet American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society quality standards.  [46] [47] ] [48]  Among the FDA-approved and commercially available spirometers listed in Table  2 , studies have demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the Spirobank (MIR) device for home monitoring,  49  as well as improved asthma control levels when it is used as part of an mHealth self-management system (AsthmaTuner; Medituner AB).  50 Likewise, the AioCare (Vyair Medical) and NuvoAir (NuvoAir Inc) devices were shown to be feasible and safe for home use in asthma,  51, 52  and the GoSpiro (MTI) device has been studied successfully as part of a home telemonitoring system for COPD.  53 ome concerns have been raised that not all home spirometers may adequately meet American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society low-flow measurement requirements when tested rigorously, so when considering their use for patients with severe airway disease, devices that are able to measure low flows accurately, such as the GoSpiro (Table  2 ), may be preferred.  54 her Devices Used in the Care of Asthma\n\nThis category of asthma mHealth is more challenging to evaluate, given the variety of digital devices included and the correspondingly heterogeneous composition of interventions. Currently this asthma mHealth category has no relevant systematic reviews, but individual studies involving digital activity trackers, multiple mobile device self-management systems, and mobile teleconsultation services have shown encouraging results.

      "title": "Advancing the Evidence for Asthma mHealth",
      "text": "As with any method that challenges conventional practice models, more evidence will be needed for the clinical effectiveness of asthma mHealth going forward. In this regard, consensus around a shared taxonomy such as the one we propose herein would facilitate more focused evidence generation and systematic appraisal. This is realized most easily for digital inhalers and digital spirometers, which generally have more homogenous components and target similar clinical outcomes.\n\nAnother approach is to classify mHealth based on system functionalities. This is the method currently in use by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for classifying all digital health technologies and determining the required level of evidence for regulatory approval.  58 Applying this functional classification to mHealth, a perspective piece by Rowland et al  59  proposed four mHealth categories relevant to use in clinical practice: (1) mHealth that supports diagnosis and patient or provider decisionmaking, which for asthma could include standalone apps that track respiratory symptoms and transmit data to health care teams or the use of digital spirometers to track lung function at home; (2) mHealth that targets health behavior change, such as digital inhalers with medication reminders or digital activity trackers that promote increased exercise; (3) mHealth that acts as a standalone digital therapeutic, such as mHealth pulmonary telerehabilitation; and (4) mHealth that primarily delivers disease education. However, this classification approach may not adequately categorize asthma mHealth apps with functionalities across multiple categories and does not deal with the technological heterogeneity of asthma mHealth.\n\nWe also must consider whether conventional sources of evidence such as RCTs are suited adequately to evaluate mHealth interventions, given that mHealth technological and user-interface components benefit from rapid adjustments (both at the individual user and system level) based on feedback, emerging data, and often simply because of changes in technology that outpace clinical trials.  59, 60 Accordingly, adaptive trials, interrupted time-series analyses, and stepped-wedge RCTs may be better suited for asthma mHealth evaluation. Novel sequential factorial trial designs such as the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial and microrandomized trials also may be considered. These methods can provide a more efficient assessment of variable mHealth intervention components at a participant level and also can account for time-varying effects.  61"

      "title": "Ensuring Accessibility and Inclusivity",
      "text": "Another significant challenge for asthma mHealth is to ensure that apps and devices are usable and available for all patients. Older adults; people with lower digital literacy levels; and those who are economically disadvantaged, who do not speak English as a first language, or both may experience difficulties accessing and engaging with existing asthma mHealth tools.  17 Furthermore, mHealth research often has not included varied patient populations in usability and acceptability testing,  59  and preconceived perceptions may limit engagement further in some groups. For example, an asthma mHealth tool developed with usability testing across age groups and levels of technological experience still showed lower initial acceptance among adults 65 years of age and older compared with younger participants when implemented in practice.  62 Future asthma mHealth developers must consider health equity when developing and implementing mHealth solutions, including patients throughout the mHealth research life cycle, and applying frameworks like PROGRESS-Plus to identify and include potentially underserved patient populations.  63 alth care organizations also have an important role to play in ensuring that so-called digital divides are not worsened by new health technologies. They must measure and report local digital access disparities, lobby for broader access to high-speed internet and digital devices in the community, and ensure that mHealth offerings are available in multiple languages.  64 Those attempting to integrate mHealth initiatives into routine care also should allocate resources toward specialized digital health navigators who can facilitate equitable mHealth uptake.  64 For example, the Oschner Health System in Louisiana created the O Bar, an onsite digital health assistance model based on the Apple Genius Bar (Apple, Inc.).  65 The O Bar provides digital health information and technology assistance and training specifically designed for older adults and has been used successfully for diabetes and hypertension mHealth tools.  66, 67 globally equitable asthma mHealth intervention also must account for the digital divide between high-income and low-or middle-income countries, where a greater burden of chronic respiratory disease exists and where the benefits of mHealth may be realized only through careful tailoring to local needs and resources.  68"

      "title": "Sustained Engagement With mHealth",
      "text": "As with any clinical intervention, the importance of sustaining meaningful patient engagement with asthma mHealth must not be overlooked. A meta-analysis of mHealth for chronic diseases reported a pooled study dropout rate of 43% (95% CI, 26%-57%), with no significant differences found in sensitivity analyses accounting for study duration (studies ranged from 2 weeks to 12 months).  69 Accordingly, it is imperative that asthma mHealth researchers track, report, and address use attrition. Strategies to increase sustained engagement may include gamification, personalized recommendations, and the incorporation of persuasive design principles.  17, 70 Adopting concepts such as these and prioritizing tool so-called stickiness early on through the inclusion of patients in qualitative and quantitative usability evaluations from development to trial phases will be required.  17, 71 tegration Into Clinical Care Systems\n\nWe also must consider the role of the health care provider in the asthma mHealth continuum, particularly for tools with provider-facing components, because suboptimal (or absent) integration into routine clinical care systems is a major barrier to long-term provider uptake.  72 Given that information sharing from patient to provider is an integral function in many asthma mHealth interventions, interoperability with current provider-facing digital systems must be a priority in asthma mHealth design. Ideally, apps and devices should be incorporated into clinical workflows so that asthma mHealth can be prescribed and tracked like any other treatment.  65 This involves integration into electronic health record systems such that mHealth indications and use directions can be specified at the point of care, tools can be distributed to patients efficiently, patient consent for data sharing can be acquired easily, and patient data then can be recorded automatically in the electronic patient record (and visible to other care providers).  65 Recent developments in the United States such as the meaningful use requirement for electronic health record certification and the emergence of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources data-exchange standard will facilitate this process greatly.  73 The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's requirements for sharing of protected electronic health information with patients also may accelerate this process by creating bidirectional channels for chestpulmonary.org information exchange between patient apps and electronic heath record systems.\n\nGiven the heterogeneity of asthma mHealth options with variable levels of supporting evidence, functionality, complexity, and cost, providers also must be guided toward the most appropriate mHealth options for each patient.  65 This can be accomplished through digital formularies, which can highlight available mHealth options that meet predefined standards for interoperability and clinical effectiveness, along with tool-specific feature sets. Current examples include the UK National Health Service App Library and the German DiGA Directory.  60"

      "title": "Safety of mHealth",
      "text": "Before asthma mHealth tools are integrated fully into routine care, data security and privacy concerns also must be addressed because digital tools may be the targets of cyber attacks. One prominent example is the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack that affected 600 organizations within the National Health Service, locking hospitals and patients in the United Kingdom out of their digital systems and connected medical devices.  74 To prevent future attacks, the FDA created the Medical Device Safety Action Plan that proposes that all digital health manufacturers be required to detail their cybersecurity safety measures clearly through a Cybersecurity Bill of Materials.  75 ps and devices themselves also may be harmful if they provide misleading information or if they malfunction. A scoping review of safety concerns in consumer-facing mHealth apps identified 52 reports of actual or potential safety consequences with mHealth use, with inaccurate information being the most common cause and software functionality issues (eg, delays in information processing, faulty alarms) being the next more common.  76 Among publicly available asthma apps reviewed in the 2017 study discussed previously, overall information quality was rated only mediocre overall in the MARS appraisal.  18 her Emerging Challenges for mHealth mHealth faces several other challenges in general, including asthma tools. mHealth regulatory frameworks have not provided effective oversight to all forms of mHealth, such as standalone apps.  60 However, concepts such as software as a medical device and software in a medical device and the conceptualization of mHealth regulation into risk categories (each with their own regulatory requirements) are being elaborated.  60 The FDA's Digital Health Innovation Plan also includes one of the more innovative approaches to mHealth regulation, whereby developers will be able to obtain precertification based on a strong demonstration of quality and organizational excellence to expedite future product clearance, combined with ongoing real-world evaluation.  77 Next, the question of who will pay for mHealth also must be answered. In Canada, for example, no current framework exists to provide validated mHealth tools to patients or for remuneration to providers participating in mHealth programs. In contrast, new US Medicare program codes were developed during the pandemic for remote patient monitoring and remote therapy monitoring using mHealth, and these remain in place.  23 Eventually, medical education also will need to include digital training in the core curriculum, as well as in ongoing professional certification programs.  65, 78 e Future Potential of Asthma mHealth Provided the challenges discussed can be resolved effectively, the future of asthma mHealth is teeming with potential. Greater adoption of mHealth into routine asthma care will generate a wealth of digital information that may be leveraged through artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to improve outcomes further. These techniques may allow for personalized digital asthma care, whereby mHealth data are used to predict asthma exacerbations and to optimize treatment dosing schedules.  79, 80 On a population level, artificial intelligence and machine learning analysis of asthma mHealth data may identify novel patient clusters leading to new insights into phenotypic subclasses and may help to direct resources by targeting specific temporally or spatially susceptible groups with care interventions.  79 sthma mHealth tools also may be used to improve future asthma research design. For example, a recent systematic review of 87 RCTs of add-on therapy for severe asthma found that none of the included trials used an objective measure of adherence for baseline inhaled therapies, potentially leading to significant variance in the results.  81 Integrating digital inhalers into trials effectively addresses this issue and is likely to become more common in future asthma research. mHealth also may be able to augment the quality of virtual care for asthma, providing accurate remote measurement of respiratory physiologic characteristics to compensate for the absence of physical examination and in-laboratory pulmonary function testing.  82 Finally, many innovative and potentially disruptive mHealth asthma technologies currently are in development, such as mobile respiratory oscillometry devices and smartphone microphone spirometry.
