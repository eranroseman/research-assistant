  "title": "An adaptive text message intervention to promote psychological well-being and reduce cardiac risk: The Text4Health controlled clinical pilot trial",
  "abstract": "Objective: In a two-arm pilot trial, we examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12week, adaptive text message intervention (TMI) to promote health behaviors and psychological well-being in 60 individuals with multiple cardiac risk conditions (i.e., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and/or type 2 diabetes) and suboptimal adherence to exercise or dietary guidance. Methods: Participants were allocated to receive the TMI or enhanced usual care (eUC). The TMI included daily adaptive text messages promoting health behaviors, twice-weekly messages to set goals and monitor progress, and monthly phone check-ins. Feasibility (primary outcome) and acceptability were measured by rates of successful text message delivery and daily participant ratings of message utility (0-10 Likert scale). We also assessed impact on health behavior adherence, psychological health, and functional outcomes. Results: The TMI was feasible (99.3% of messages successfully sent) and well-accepted (mean utility = 7.4/10 [SD 2.6]). At 12 weeks, the TMI led to small-sized greater improvements in moderate to vigorous physical activity (d = 0.37), overall physical activity (d = 0.23), optimism (d = 0.20), anxiety (d = -0.36), self-efficacy (d = 0.22), and physical function (d = 0.20), compared to eUC. It did not impact other outcomes substantially at this time point. Conclusion: This 12-week, adaptive TMI was feasible, well-accepted, and associated with small-sized greater improvements in health behavior and psychological outcomes. Though larger studies are needed, it has the potential to be a scalable, low-intensity program that could be used in clinical practice. ClinicalTrials.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Despite known relationships between nonadherence to health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet) and increased cardiovascular risk  [1, 2] , most adults at risk for heart disease struggle to adhere to such behaviors  [3, 4] . Existing interventions to promote health behavior adherence in cardiac risk populations have had substantial limitations. Many are time-intensive and require in-person visits, limiting accessibility  [5, 6] . Additionally, few contain activities that focus on the promotion of psychological well-being (e.g., optimism, life satisfaction, gratitude, positive affect), which is linked to improvements in health behavior adherence and health outcomes  [7, 8] . Finally, most prior interventions have not been designed to adapt to individuals' changing needs.\n\nText message interventions (TMIs) may address many of these limitations. Text messages are widely accessible, with over 90% of American adults having access to a cell phone that can receive text messages  [9] . Additionally, TMIs are flexible; they can deliver targeted content to promote both health behavior adherence and well-being. Finally, they can leverage algorithms to preferentially deliver text messages that individual users may find to be particularly useful in an ongoing adaptive manner  [10] .\n\nNon-adaptive TMIs (i.e., those with a fixed set of messages that go to all participants regardless of goals or preferences) appear to be modestly effective (Cohen's d = 0.24-0.33) in improving health behavior adherence  [10, 11] , including self-reported and objectively measured activity. and TMIs and other mHealth interventions have begun to be studied specifically in individuals with cardiac risk conditions. Among individuals with hypertension, TMIs have been linked to very small effect sized reductions in systolic blood pressure (d = -0.13) [12] , and in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), TMIs have led to significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c  [13] . Adaptation of text messaging, based on participant characteristics, feedback from prior texts, or outcomes (e.g., blood pressure readings) could a more personalized and effective approach. However, to our knowledge only one prior proof-of-concept trial (N = 15) has examined the impact of an adaptive text message intervention to promote health behavior adherence and well-being in patients with cardiac risk; this intervention, in T2D patients, found the program to be feasible, well-accepted, and associated with moderate to large pre-post improvements in diet (d = 0.99) and physical activity (d = 0.61)  [14] .\n\nAccordingly, we developed Text4Health, a text-message-based program involving daily adaptive text messages and weekly goal-focused messages, to promote well-being and adherence to physical activity and dietary recommendations. In this controlled pilot trial, we assessed the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in 60 adults with cardiac risk conditions and suboptimal adherence to physical activity or dietary guidelines."

Specifically, to be considered as having a cardiac risk condition, participants met established criteria for the condition  [16] [17] [18]  or were actively receiving treatment for the disorder (per the medical record). Additionally, participants were required to have low moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; \u2264 150 min per week) or elevated sedentary leisure time (\u2265 120 min/day), and low fruit/vegetable intake (< 5 servings of fruits/ vegetables per day; assessed with the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System's [BRFSS] Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Module  [19] ) or elevated cholesterol/saturated fat intake (\u2265 70 on the MEDFICTS scale  [20] ). Physical activity was measured initially by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire  [21]  and confirmed using Actigraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers (Pensacola, FL). Exclusion criteria included coronary artery disease, an unrelated condition limiting physical activity, cognitive impairment (assessed using a six-item cognitive screening tool  [22] ), participation in another program focused on promotion of cardiovascular health or well-being (e.g. mind-body programs or cardiac rehabilitation/prevention programs), inability to receive text messages, or inability to communicate in English or Spanish."

      "text": "Participants were recruited from Massachusetts General Hospital-affiliated outpatient clinics. They could be referred by their outpatient providers or self-refer in response to an MGH-based online advertisement platform (\"Rally\"). To supplement these referrals, we identified potential participants through systematic searches of the electronic medical record, sent potential participants opt-out letters, and followed up with them by telephone to assess interest in participation. If an eligible potential participant were interested, study staff would schedule the participant for an initial visit.\n\nDuring the initial visit, participants provided informed consent and completed self-report questionnaires related to sociodemographic characteristics, health behavior adherence, psychological health, and physical health. Study staff then obtained vital signs (and performed venipuncture. Finally, participants were given an Actigraph w-GT3X-BT accelerometer, which they were asked to wear for 10 days. Participants were required to have worn the Actigraph for at least 4 days, with at least 10 h/day of wear, as in prior work  [23, 24] , for the wear period to be considered valid. Participants were asked to re-wear the Actigraph as needed.\n\nFollowing the collection of all baseline information, participants were allocated to the Text4Health or eUC groups using allocation by minimization. This is an established process to minimize between-group differences in key participant characteristics more effectively than pure randomization, which can lead to substantial imbalance between groups in small trials  [25, 26] . We utilized this process to balance age, sex, physical activity, and medical comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index  [27] ) in this trial. Specifically, participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group until at least 8 participants were present in each group. Subsequently, participants were assigned to a treatment group using a dynamic algorithm that minimized between-group differences in age, sex, physical activity, and comorbidity.\n\nFollowing allocation to a treatment group, participants received an Omron HJ-365 step counter (Kyoto, Japan). Those in the Text4Health group completed the intervention, while those in the eUC group engaged in their usual medical care. Individuals from both groups completed follow-up assessments at 12-and 24-week time points, during which they completed questionnaires, underwent peripheral venipuncture, and wore the Actigraph accelerometer for 10 additional days. After completing the 24-week assessment, participants in the eUC group were given the opportunity to complete the Text4Health program, during which they provided feasibility and acceptability information."

      "title": "2.4.. The Text4Health intervention",
      "text": "The Text4Health intervention was generated from a theoretical model that focused on the combination of well-being promotion and physical activity education and goal-setting to optimize activity and health (see Supplemental Fig.  1 ). The intervention was comprised of three main components: (1) daily adaptive text messages, (2) weekly interactive text messages, and (3) brief phone sessions with a study trainer (see Fig.  1 ). Participants first rated the potential utility of 16 daily text messages to allow the program to understand message attributes (e.g., focus on well-being or physical activity, focus on social activities, directive vs. informational messages) felt by participants to be most useful. Throughout the intervention, participants received one text message each day (e.g., \"Increasing physical activity can reduce stress and help improve sleep, memory, energy, and mood. Take a 15-to 20minute walk today to get started!\") that either provided information about well-being or health behavior adherence or encouraged the participant to engage in an activity related to these topics. Participants rated the utility of the message on a scale of 0-10 (0 = not at all helpful, 10 = very helpful) via text message, and this information-along with participants' identified barriers to adherence, health goals, and progress-was used by a computer algorithm to choose subsequent messages with attributes that fit the preferences and goals of each participant. (See Fig.  2 .) (See Table  1 .)\n\nAdditionally, alongside these daily messages, twice per week, participants engaged in brief, interactive goal-focused text messaging related to health behavior adherence. Each week, the Text4Health program asked participants to set a goal related to a health behavior; participants chose the health behavior and set a specific goal. A few days later, participants received messages inquiring about their progress toward their goal and any barriers or facilitators they encountered. Finally, the following week, the Text4Health program assessed whether participants met their goal, suggested a new goal based on their progress, and then prompted them to set a new health behavior goal. Finally, participants engaged in brief (15-min) phone sessions with a study trainer at the start of the program, at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and at the end of the program. During the initial session, a study trainer introduced the program and the types of text messages the participant would receive, then explored their current engagement in health behaviors and their overall goals. During the Week 4 and Week 8 sessions, the study trainer reviewed the text message protocol, reoriented participants to positive psychology-based message content, discussed the participant's progress, and provided targeted feedback. At the final session, the study trainer reviewed participant progress, encouraged the participant to maintain their progress, and obtained feedback about the program. We chose 12 weeks as a study intervention duration based on our prior work that found 4-8 weeks of text messaging to be likely insufficient for sustained behavior change  [14] , while >12 weeks of daily text messages, twice-weekly goal messages, and monthly study calls seemed to potentially represent a large participant burden. Additional detail on the messages and their connection to study aims are provided in the study methods paper  [15] .\n\nText messages and ratings were stored in a DynamoDB database  [28] , and messages were sent using Amazon Web Services and Twilio  [29] [30] [31] . Text messages were sent at a time of the participant's choosing and did not include identifiable information. Full details of the algorithm and sample text messages have been published previously  [15] , though we have included sample text messages in Supplemental Table  1  as well."

      "text": "We examined the impact of the Text4Health program on physical activity and dietary measures, given the focus of the text messages on these topics. The main preliminary efficacy outcome was a composite health behavior adherence score, comprised of the following: (1) MVPA (minutes/day), (2) sedentary time (minutes/day), (3) fruit and vegetable intake (servings/day), and (4) saturated fat/cholesterol intake. MVPA and sedentary time were measured using Actigraph wGT-3\u00d7-BT accelerometers. We initially utilized activity self-report as an additional measure, but found that this was not needed due to high use and adequate data from the accelerometers. Fruit and vegetable intake was assessed with the fruit and vegetable modules of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)  [19] , while saturated fat/cholesterol intake was measured with the American Heart Association MED-FICTS questionnaire  [20] . To calculate the composite score, we created z-scores for each individual health behavior (with positive z-scores indicating greater health behavior adherence), then summed them to create the total composite adherence score. When data were missing for one or more of these health behaviors, we imputed the mean z-score for all other participants in the corresponding treatment group at that time point. As an additional outcome, along with MVPA, we assessed overall physical activity (steps) using Actigraph wGT-3\u00d7-BT accelerometers."

      "text": "We used descriptive statistics to describe the proportion of daily text messages successfully transmitted, the proportion of daily text messages receiving a response from participants, and the mean participant ratings for text messages. To assess differences in utility ratings by message type, we grouped messages into one of six categories based on their main areas of focus: well-being, physical activity, diet, weight loss, weight loss and diet, and all others. Then, we performed mixed effects regression analyses, to account for intra-participant effects on message utility ratings. Similarly, to examine the impact of the Text4Health intervention on psychological and health behavior outcomes, we performed mixed effects regression analyses, with a categorical effect of time and an unstructured covariance matrix, adjusting for those factors included in the allocation process (i.e., age, gender, baseline physical activity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index) and their interactions with time. For physical activity outcomes, we additionally adjusted for the time of year that the activity data were obtained, given lower levels of activity frequently seen in winter  [40, 41] . Modified Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated by dividing the group*time coefficient by the standard deviation of the residual of the model at baseline. Based on prior work of TMIs  [42] [43] [44] , in which participants provided feedback for approximately 75% of messages, and using a conservative standard deviation of 30%, this study had 98% power to observe a mean participant response rate of \u226560%. Additionally, the study had 97% power to detect a mean utility rating of >7.0, based on prior work using such ratings in projects delivering content related to PP and physical activity  [45] . This trial was not powered to detect significant differences in efficacy outcomes. All analyses were performed in Stata 17.0 (College Station, TX)."

In our main efficacy analysis, Text4Health led to very small-sized greater improvements (compared to eUC) in the composite health behavior adherence outcome (12 weeks: d = 0.08; 24 weeks: d = 0.20).

Surprisingly, it led to small-sized greater increases in sedentary time (d = 0.37) at 24 weeks. None of these findings was statistically significant. The Text4Health program did not substantially impact other health behavior outcomes."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "In this initial controlled pilot feasibility trial, a 12-week, adaptive TMI was feasible and well-accepted, with participants receiving over 99% of daily messages, responding to 82% of daily messages, and engaging with 86% of the goal-setting message sessions. Participants also rated the daily messages as useful, with main ratings of message utility above our a priori threshold of 7.0/10.\n\nRegarding the secondary outcomes of health behaviors and psychological impact, the intervention led to small effect size magnitude improvements in several psychological metrics (i.e., optimism, anxiety, and self-efficacy). There were lesser effects on other psychological outcomes (e.g., depression), potentially because levels of distress were low at baseline and because the TMI did not specifically target these constructs. However, the TMI had mixed effects on other outcomes, including minimal substantial impact on composite health behavior adherence.\n\nThe intervention's feasibility findings are similar to those of trials in individuals with hypertension or T2D, which have found successful text message transmission rates of >94%  [14, 46] . The current trial suggests that both adaptive and interactive text messages can be sent successfully and highlights the potential scalability of TMIs. Additionally, the acceptability findings are consistent with or superior to related text message studies, such as a recent, single-arm pilot trial in which participants responded to 79% of transmitted messages and rated the utility of messages as 8.1/10  [14] . Though that prior trial included only daily adaptive text messages, the current study also contained weekly goalfocused sets. Another randomized trial of a TMI to promote health behaviors in adolescents found that 53.7% of participants responded to a majority of the text messages in the program  [47] . Those messages were not used to tailor additional messages, which may have led to lower engagement than the current trial. The acceptability findings from the current trial suggest that adaptive TMIs lead to high engagement from users and may be a promising area for future research. This high acceptability may well extend beyond psychological or health behavior TMIs, and suggests that this modality could be used for a wide range of applications in healthcare and beyond.\n\nThe intervention led to small effects on psychological outcomes and mixed effects on health behavior adherence. Though there has been limited study of the effects of TMIs on psychological health, our findings are generally consistent with prior work. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, TMIs focused on individuals with depression were associated with a small-sized, marginally significant reduction in depressive symptoms (d = 0.23, p = .07) [48] ; this effect size was highly similar to that seen for depression and anxiety in the current study. To our knowledge, there has been limited research examining the impact of TMIs on other psychological constructs, with studies finding mixed results related to self-efficacy and one study finding that a TMI led to increases in anxiety  [49] [50] [51] [52] .\n\nSimilarly, Text4Health led to small-sized increases in MVPA and fruit/vegetable intake, as well as small-sized reductions in fat/cholesterol intake at different time points but also was associated with smallsized increases in sedentary time and mixed effects on overall activity. While the findings regarding sedentary time are surprising, the other findings are generally consistent with the literature, which has found TMIs to be associated with small-sized improvements in health behavior adherence or physical activity (d = 0.24-0.38) [10, 11, 53] .\n\nSeveral factors may have contributed to the somewhat limited impact of the intervention. First, the daily text messages covered a wide range of topics, and participants were able to choose between a wide variety of health behavior goals each week. While this increased the flexibility of the intervention and its potential clinical implementation, it also may have diluted the effects of the intervention on the composite health behavior outcome. Similarly, the intervention's impact on psychological outcomes may have been limited by the relatively small percentage of messages (24.9%) that focused on well-being and the lack of well-being-related activities in the weekly goal-setting messages. Finally, though the program provided general feedback about progress toward health behavior goals and problem-solving barriers to adherence, this information was not highly customized to participants. Additional methods to tailor these components of the program could its efficacy.\n\nThis trial has several limitations. While the study was powered to examine feasibility and acceptability outcomes, the relatively small sample size limited our ability to detect between-group differences in efficacy. Additionally, though physical activity was objectively measured, psychological and dietary outcomes were self-reported, which has the potential to introduce bias. Finally, most participants were female and White, and only a small portion of participants had T2D, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Larger studies in more diverse populations will be needed to fully assess the efficacy of this intervention.\n\nDespite these limitations, the current study suggests that the Tex-t4Health program was feasible, led to high levels of engagement, and was felt to be helpful by participants. It also led to small-sized improvements in psychological outcomes and some health behaviors. Future, larger studies are needed to further determine the efficacy of a program modified to address the limitations observed in the present trial. If a future, optimized program led to improvements in health behavior adherence, it would have great potential for implementation given the scalability and low provider burden of this automated, adaptive, algorithmic health intervention."
