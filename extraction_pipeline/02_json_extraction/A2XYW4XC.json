  "title": "Features, functions, and quality of mobile applications for type 2 diabetes care in China: Systematic search of app stores",
  "abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is highly prevalent in China, affecting over 114 million people. While mHealth interventions have shown promise, there is limited research on T2DM management apps in real-world app stores. Objective: This study aimed to systematically search and analyze T2DM care mobile apps in the Chinese market, describing their features, and functions, and evaluating the quality of the most popular apps using validated tools. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in Chinese Android and iOS app stores for T2DM management apps. We downloaded 138 eligible ones for a general review of their key features and function. We also assessed the quality of the top 20 apps from both platforms using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) by both researcher and patient. Results: A total of 3524 apps were searched. 138 eligible apps were downloaded for general review and 29 popular apps were included for quality assessment. Most apps were designed for patient users (87.0 %) and developed by commercial companies (85.5 %). Common functions included blood glucose monitoring, diabetes education, integration with measuring devices, medication adherence reminders, teleconsultation services, and diabetes risk factor tracking. The researcher's evaluation yielded an average MARS score of 4.0 out of 5 for popular apps, with subscale scores of functionalities (4.5), aesthetics (4.1), engagement (3.7), and information (3.6). However, patient ratings were lower in functionality (3.5), aesthetics (3.4), and engagement (2.6), and the patient faced difficulties with information-related items. Similar trends were observed in subject quality items. Conclusion: App developers should engage caregivers, and family members as target users, and involve government agencies as partners to improve T2DM management apps. Future apps should incorporate scientifically proven advanced functions to enhance their effectiveness. The quality assessment highlighted weaknesses in engagement and information and the importance of user-centric approaches in app development.",

      "text": "China has the largest number of people with T2DM in the world. Over the past three decades, the T2DM prevalence has increased from 0.7 % in 1980  [1]  to 5.5 % in 2001  [2] , 9.7 % in 2008  [3] , 11.6 % in 2010  [4] , and 12.4 % in 2018  [5] . Patients with T2DM receive most of their healthcare services in primary healthcare (PHC) facilities  [6] . As part of a series of healthcare reforms, the Chinese government has made substantial investments to strengthen the PHC sector. These reforms have improved the access to and affordability of PHC through increased government funding, universal health insurance coverage, and availability of essential medicines at little or no cost  [6] .\n\nDespite these health reforms, there are major gaps in optimal care for people with T2DM in China. National representative surveys have shown that only 50 % of treated patients with T2DM achieved the blood glucose targets  [5]  and only 5.6 % of outpatients with T2DM met the optimal ABC targets (HbA1c < 7 %, BP < 130/80 mm Hg, and total cholesterol < 4.5 mmol/L)  [7] . Given that sub-optimal management targets are associated with an increased risk of diabetic complications, this will substantially increase the disease burden in years to come.\n\nThe mHealth technologies have the potential to improve the health outcomes of patients with T2DM through the promotion of self-management  [8] . The World Health Organization defines mHealth as \"medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices\"  [9] . Previous systematic reviews have shown that mHealth techniques lead to improvements in diabetes management, hypertension management, weight loss, physical activity, attendance rate, treatment adherence, and HbA1c  [10] [11] [12] . A recent large-scale Chinese study also found that an mHealth-enabled diabetes management intervention improved diabetes control in PHC settings. The intervention resulted in an absolute improvement of 7.0 % (95 % CI 4.0-10.0 %) and a relative improvement of 18.6 % (RR 1.186, 95 % CI 1.105-1.267) in HbA1c control rate, and an absolute improvement of 1.9 % (95 % CI 0.5-3.5) and a relative improvement of 21.8 % (RR 1.218, 95 % CI 1.062-1.395) in the composite HbA1c, blood pressure and LDL-C control rate  [13] .\n\nDespite the promising results from randomized controlled trials, there remains limited research on the use of mobile apps in real-world settings. With the rapid development of mHealth, a multitude of T2DM management apps have emerged in China's Android and iOS market stores. Therefore, our study aimed to fill this research gap by conducting a systematic search and analysis of T2DM care apps. We conducted an initial evaluation to identify the most common functions and features of these apps, particularly in terms of their relevance to T2DM management. Subsequently, we performed an in-depth quality assessment to gain insights into the engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality of the identified popular apps. Through this comprehensive approach, we sought to provide a better understanding of the effectiveness and user experience of these apps in the context of T2DM management."

      "text": "We conducted a systematic search of T2DM management apps in the Chinese market in April 2019. We searched the 3 mainstream Chinese Android app stores (Tencent MyApp, Baidu Mobile Assistant, and 360 Mobile Assistant) and iTunes App Store. The keywords used for searching were Diabetes, Blood Glucose, Insulin, HbA1c, Fasting Blood Glucose, Random Blood Glucose, Hyperglycemia, Diabetes Care, Diabetes Risk, Diabetes Education, Diabetes Self-help, Diabetes Selfmanagement, Diabetes Management, Diabetes Exercise, and Diabetes Diet (See the Chinese Keywords in Supplementary 1). Each keyword was searched through the general search bar of the four app stores listed above.\n\nThe preliminary screening of the apps was conducted based on the app title and description. Apps were included if they supported the practice of medicine (e.g., treatment, self-management) or health promotion (e.g., information about diagnosis, lifestyle risk factors). Apps were excluded if they (1) did not include the Chinese language, (2) were irrelevant to diabetes, (3) only focused on type 1 diabetes, or (4) were designed for advertising purposes only. Two researchers (XT and XZ) conducted the search and selection of the apps, and the disagreement was resolved by discussion.\n\nDuplicates due to the availability of the same app on multiple stores or retrieval of the same app through multiple search terms were removed after the preliminary screening. For removing duplicates due to the availability of the same app on multiple Android stores, we considered the selection of the store from where it was installed the most. For removing duplicates due to the availability of the same app on both Android and iOS stores, we considered the selection of the Android store considering the massive Android users in China.\n\nAfter the description screening and deduplication process, we downloaded the remaining unique apps. Non-functional apps that failed in registration or did not work properly were excluded."

      "text": "We selected the top 20 Android apps based on the number of aggregated downloads and the top 20 iOS apps based on the number of comments. Duplications were excluded.\n\nThe quality of the apps was evaluated by the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), which is a widely used instrument for evaluating smartphone app quality  [14] . The scale was previously tested and validated in various Asian contexts and has shown excellent internal consistency and interrater reliability  [15, 16] . Translation and back translation process was employed to ensure the linguistic and cultural equivalence of the questionnaire items between the source language (English) and the target language (Chinese). The MARS consists of 19 items grouped into four subscales, including A) engagement, B) functionality, C) aesthetics, and D) information. The Engagement subscale measures the level of user engagement with the app, including factors such as entertainment value and customization options. The Functionality subscale assesses the app's usability, navigation, and overall performance. The Aesthetics subscale focuses on the visual appeal and design elements of the app, including layout and graphics. Lastly, the Information Quality subscale evaluates the relevance, credibility, and usefulness of the app's content. Each subscale of the MARS was rated on a 5-point scale (1-inadequate, 2-poor, 3-acceptable, 4-good, and 5-excellent). To calculate an overall app quality score, the scores from each subscale were averaged. In addition to the objective assessment, four items (willingness to recommend, willingness to use, willingness to pay and overall rating) were used to assess the app's subjective quality (See the 23-item MARS in Supplementary 3). We randomly selected about 25 % of the apps and doublerated them to check the inter-rater reliability. Finally, an experienced researcher (XZ) and a patient with T2DM were invited to participate in the quality assessment of the popular apps."

For the iOS apps, the most popular one had 5,092 reviews, while more than half (40/67, 59.7 %) of them had zero reviews in the iTunes App Store.\n\nThe key features of T2DM management apps are shown in Table  2 . The majority of the apps were primarily designed for patients with T2DM (120/138, 87.0 %) and healthcare professionals (13/138, 9.4 %). Only a small proportion of apps (2/138, 1.4 %) were specifically targeted towards caregivers. Most apps (118/138, 85.5 %) were developed by commercial companies, whereas a significantly smaller number of apps (5/138, 3.6 %) were developed by government entities or hospitals.\n\nThe most popular government-designed app resulted from a collaborative effort between the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission and Wanda Company, one of China's most successful commercial enterprises. The app established a digital connection between patients and the local primary healthcare system by utilizing patients' electronic health records data, which was made accessible by the government. Wanda company played a crucial role by providing technical support for software development and maintenance. More than half of the analyzed apps (79/138, 57.2 %) were entirely free to use. Approximately onethird of the apps (51/138, 37.0 %) offered free downloads with in-app purchase options.

Twenty nice unique apps were included for quality assessment and seven apps were double rated by two researchers and reached an excellent inter-rater reliability score of 0.91 (95 % CI 0.46-0.98).\n\nThe researcher assessed the apps by 19 items grouped by four subscales. The apps received the highest ratings with functionality (mean 4.5, SD 0.24), followed by aesthetics (mean 4.1, SD 0.60), engagement (mean 3.7, SD 0.67), and information quality (mean 3.6, SD 0.43). The overall quality score of the top popular apps had an average score of 4.0 (SD 0.39), with individual scores ranging from 3.1 to 4.5. Regarding item 19, which assessed the evidence base, only one app received a rating of 5, indicating strong evidence of effectiveness. The other apps were not applicable to item 19 as they have not undergone testing through trials yet. The patient rater was a college-educated female in her 60 s who had prior experience with mHealth mobile applications The patient assessed the apps using a set of 12 items, as the participant encountered difficulty in responding to the 7 items within the information subscale. Same as the researcher's feedback, the apps got relatively high score from the patient in functionality (mean 3.5, SD 0.71) and aesthetics (mean 3.4, SD 0.95) and suboptimal score in engagement (mean 2.6, SD 1.2). Fig.  2  shows the average objective score of each MARS item rated by the researcher and the patient.\n\nBoth researcher and patient rated the apps subjective quality by 4 items (See Fig.  3 ). Researchers, on average, expressed higher levels of willingness to recommend the app (mean 3.6) and use it (mean 4.7) compared to patients (mean 1.9 and 2.6, respectively). Similarly, researchers demonstrated a greater willingness to pay for the app (mean 4.0) compared to patients (mean 1.8). Overall, researchers provided a more positive rating for the app's performance (mean 3.8) than patients (mean 2.5)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study conducted a comprehensive search and analysis of T2DM management apps in the modern China app markets. A total of 2982 Android and 542 iOS apps were searched, and 138 eligible apps were included for general review. Further, 28 popular apps were selected for a quality assessment using MARS. The study found that most apps were developed by commercial companies, primarily targeting the patient population, with only a few dominating the app market. The most common functions of these apps were for client education and behavior change communication purposes. However, the apps were found to be suboptimal in terms of engagement and information quality. And patient tended to rate the app quality lower compared to researcher.\n\nIn the current market, a few top popular T2DM care apps are exerting significant dominance. The diabetes care apps have been primarily designed to cater to patients and healthcare providers, overlooking a crucial stakeholder in the diabetes management loop -caregivers and family members. These individuals, despite lacking professional training, play a vital role in supporting patients' disease selfmanagement, especially in the context of a family-oriented environment like the Chinese culture  [18] . Previous studies have shown that engaging family members in healthcare intervention could make significant improvements in behavior change, blood pressure and blood glucose control  [19, 20] . Despite the high motivation of family members to provide care, the quality of this support is often inconsistent and lacks of evidence. Mobile applications offer an unprecedented opportunity to address the problem by providing evidence-based guidelines and ongoing customized medical supports  [21] .\n\nThe vast majority of apps were developed by commercial companies, and there was minimal to no involvement of government agencies or hospitals in their creation. This result highlights the predominant role of private enterprises in the development and deployment of diabetes care apps. However, considering the potential benefits of collaboration between commercial entities and government/hospital organizations, it becomes essential to explore avenues for fostering partnerships that can lead to more comprehensive and impactful solutions in the diabetes management  [22] . Among the apps we examined, a notable success story emerged from a collaborative endeavor between the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission and Wanda Company. This particular app  achieved remarkable results by creating a digital connection between patients and the local PHC system through the utilization of patients' electronic health records data, which was made accessible by the government. Wanda's significant contribution lay in providing crucial technical support for software development and maintenance, ultimately leading to the successful implementation, and functioning of the app. Such collaborative efforts exemplify the potential benefits of partnerships between government agencies and commercial companies in the realm of healthcare technology, enhancing the overall effectiveness of diabetes care apps and improving patient outcomes. T2DM management apps hold great promise in enhancing clinical and public health practice. They improve accessibility with virtual consultations and remote monitoring, streamline administrative tasks, and provide quick access to medical records. These apps enable data analytics for research and disease prevention, leading to personalized treatment approaches. Additionally, they offer reliable health information and educational resources, promoting health literacy and empowering users in managing their condition. However, addressing challenges related to data security, digital access, and usability is crucial to fully capitalize on the benefits of these apps for diabetes care and prevention  [23, 24] . Therefore, the government should develop clear policies to regulate and safeguard the use of T2DM management apps, ensuring data privacy and equitable access for all users. Such policies can foster innovation while upholding patient confidentiality and promoting widespread adoption, ultimately improving diabetes management and public health outcomes. X. Tao et al.\n\nWe observed a consistent pattern with previous studies that the most popular functions of diabetes management apps centered on client education and behavior change communication  [25] [26] [27] , while advanced features such as clinical decision support for healthcare providers or insulin dose management for patients were scarce despite their proven effectiveness in diabetes management  [28] [29] [30] [31] . These advanced functions pose challenges in design and development for commercial companies, necessitating additional support from healthcare professionals and underscoring the importance of clinical input during app design. A systematic review revealed that most insulin dose calculator apps on the market failed to protect patients from incorrect dose recommendations and put users at risk of both catastrophic overdose and suboptimal glucose control  [32] . Future studies should focus on adopting artificial intelligence to optimize the insulin dosage  [33]  and incorporating rigorous professional support to the decision-making process.\n\nThe researcher's evaluation of the popular apps' quality as having relatively high functionality and aesthetics, but suboptimal engagement, and information. This result is consistent with previous reviews of the diabetes management mobile applications  [27, 34] . In our study, a mere one-fourth of the apps included features or mechanisms to incentivize and motivate users to engage with the app regularly, such as rewards, badges, challenges, or personalized goals. Additionally, our findings highlighted a concerning trend where only one app out of the selected pool was developed based on clear scientific evidence and had undergone rigorous testing through trials. This indicates that a substantial number of the apps lack a robust evidence-based design and credibility. Such uncertainty in clinical efficacy could lead to patients' distrust, which is a major obstacle for healthcare providers, especially at the primary care level, to embrace and use mHealth apps  [35] .\n\nThe patient's evaluation of the objective quality of the popular apps was lower compared to the researcher's assessment, particularly in functionality, aesthetics, and engagement subscales. This emphasizes the significance of considering the perspectives and experiences of the app's true target users -patients with Type 2 Diabetes -during its development and design. We found the patient struggled to answer three items, which require professional expertise, about evidence base, app goals, and accuracy of app description, suggesting the need of a more user-friendly version of the MARS  [36] . Alternatively, researcher may focus on evaluating the usability of the apps by adopting scales such as System Usability Scale (SUS), Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) and the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ)  [37] [38] [39] . Furthermore, patient expressed lower levels of willingness to recommend, use, and pay for the apps, as evident from their lower ratings compared to the researcher's ratings. This discrepancy highlights the importance of tailoring apps to better meet patients' needs and preferences, as greater patient acceptance and satisfaction are key factors in promoting the successful adoption and sustained use of diabetes management apps. By incorporating patient feedback and ensuring usercentric app design, we can work towards developing more effective and patient-friendly apps that truly cater to the needs of individuals with Type 2 Diabetes  [40] ."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study acknowledges several limitations. Firstly, the app search was conducted on 27th April 2019 and the results may be outdated. However, we did another search on 20th June 2023 by the keyword \"diabetes\" and looked at the first 20 search results from both Android and iOS markets. In total, we identified 4 new emerging apps (10 %, 4/ 40). Secondly, we could not find the number of downloads for apps from the Apple APP Store. Instead, we used the number of comments as a proxy for downloads as this approach has previously been adopted by another study about maternal and child healthcare apps on the Chinese market  [41] . Thirdly, we did not include WeChat's built-in apps in our study because the search engine provided only limited information about these apps. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that many of the most popular apps have their own versions of WeChat's built-in apps. In future studies, it may be beneficial to consider the inclusion of WeChat's built-in apps, as they are relevant to the domain of mHealth mobile applications. Fourthly, while there were other alternative operating systems like Harmony OS in existence, our primary focus remained on Android and iOS due to their dominant market presence. Finally, we were unable to collect MARS feedback from enough patients and researchers to conduct statistical testing and establish firm evidence supporting our conclusion. Therefore, further research is warranted to comprehensively evaluate the matter and investigate the difference in ratings between patients and researchers."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This review systematically searched T2DM care apps in the Chinese market and analyzed their key features, functions, and quality. Several noteworthy gaps were identified in the landscape of diabetes management apps. Firstly, there was a noticeable lack of apps specifically designed for family members, who play a crucial role in supporting patients with T2DM. Secondly, we observed a lack of cooperation between companies and government/hospital sectors, limiting the potential for comprehensive and innovative app development. Finally, there was a scarcity of apps offering complex functions that have been proven effective in diabetes management through clinical evidence. In the quality assessment, the apps were found to perform relatively poorly in the areas of engagement and information. Improving engagement features and ensuring the provision of reliable and user-friendly information can lead to higher patient satisfaction and ultimately enhance the overall effectiveness of diabetes management apps. Furthermore, patients rated the apps lower compared to the researcher's assessment, emphasizing the significance of incorporating patient perspectives and experiences in app development. By adopting a user-centric approach and integrating patient feedback, we can create more effective and patient-friendly apps tailored to the needs of individuals with Type 2 Diabetes."
