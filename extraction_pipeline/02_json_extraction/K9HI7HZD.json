  "title": "Sample size calculators for planning stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials: a review and comparison",
  "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs). SW-CRTs include several design variations and methodology is rapidly developing. Accordingly, a variety of power and sample size calculation software for SW-CRTs has been developed. However, each calculator may support only a selected set of design features and may not be appropriate for all scenarios. Currently, there is no resource to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate calculator for planning their trials. In this paper, we review and classify 18 existing calculators that can be implemented in major platforms, such as R, SAS, Stata, Microsoft Excel, PASS and nQuery. After reviewing the main sample size considerations for SW-CRTs, we summarize the features supported by the available calculators, including the types of designs, outcomes, correlation structures and treatment effects; whether incomplete designs, cluster-size variation or secular trends are accommodated; and the analytical approach used. We then discuss in more detail four main calculators and identify their strengths and limitations. We illustrate how to use these four calculators to compute power for two real SW-CRTs with a continuous and binary outcome and compare the results. We show that the choice of calculator can make a substantial difference in the calculated power and explain these differences. Finally, we make recommendations for implementing sample size or power calculations using the available calculators. An R Shiny app is available for users to select the calculator that meets their requirements ( https://douyang.shi  nyapps.io/swcrtcalculator/ ).",

      "text": "In recent years, the stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) design has been increasing in popularity.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4]  In SW-CRTs (Figure  1a ), each cluster begins in the control condition. At different time points, clusters are randomized to cross over to the intervention condition until by the end of the trial, all clusters have received the intervention. In a complete SW-CRT design, measurements are taken from each cluster in each period. The SW-CRT can help facilitate recruitment when stakeholders perceive there are benefits to being exposed to the intervention at some point during the trial.  5, 6 The design is also attractive when the goal is to implement the intervention in all clusters but there are inadequate resources to do so in all clusters simultaneously.  5, 6 Despite their potential advantages, the use of stepped-wedge (SW) designs must be appropriately justified and researchers must be aware of the potential risks of bias.  7, 8 ethods for planning SW-CRTs are rapidly evolving and a variety of sample size calculation methods and tools are now available. Applied statisticians are faced with a bewildering array of choices and there is no centralized discussion of the functionalities of different calculators. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the trial design features that can be accommodated by available power and sample size calculators for SW-CRTs, illustrate how to use the main calculators and provide a guide to allow users to select the most appropriate calculators for their studies.\n\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. We start with an overview of SW-CRTs, including major features to consider in sample size calculation. We then provide a detailed review of four main calculators including their strengths and limitations. Using two example trials, we then illustrate how to use these calculators to obtain power for each of the trials and compare the results across the four calculators. We conclude by summarizing our findings and making recommendations for selecting the most appropriate calculator in practice."

      "title": "Types of SW designs based on sampling structure",
      "text": "There are three main types of SW-CRTs, depending on the sampling structure.  9 In a cross-sectional design, outcomes are measured on different participants over time so each participant contributes outcomes to either the control or intervention condition but not both. In the closed cohort design, the same participants are measured repeatedly over time so each participant contributes outcomes under both the control and intervention conditions. The open cohort is a variation on the closed cohort in which participants may join or leave the cohort during the trial and thus at least some participants contribute outcomes under both control and intervention conditions.  10 The majority of work on sample size calculation for SW-CRTs has focused on crosssectional or closed cohort designs; open cohort designs have received relatively little development except for the work by Kasza et al.  10  Recent work has started to consider cross-sectional designs arising from the common scenario in which participants are recruited continuously in time (but exposed for only a short period) as a special class of design requiring different correlation structures, called 'continuous-time decay', and different analytical approaches.  9, 11 Further work is required but some methodology for continuous-time decay has already been developed by Grantham et al.  12  that includes an R Shiny web app to determine power for some scenarios, assuming individual measurement times are evenly spaced within each interval. In practice, cross-sectional designs are often considered to be approximations of continuous recruitment short exposure designs and, depending on the assumed correlation structure, sample size calculators based on discrete sampling may yield identical calculations."

      "title": "Incomplete designs",
      "text": "Standard SW-CRTs collect data in each cluster period. Incomplete SW-CRTs are designs that do not collect data in all cluster periods.  13, 14 Figure  1b  illustrates a design in which no data are collected during the period immediately prior to the intervention. These 'transition periods' allow extra time to implement the intervention or for the intervention to start exerting its effect. Each sequence can have one or more transition periods.  14 Figure  1c  illustrates a design in which each cluster has the same number of control and intervention periods, but not all clusters enter and exit at the same time. This type of design is called a staircase design.  15"

      "title": "Correlation structures and statistical models for SW-CRTs",
      "text": "In a SW-CRT, the intervention effect is partially confounded with the time effect (i.e. secular trend) by design; therefore, the analytical model must always account for time to obtain unbiased inferences. It is further well known that CRTs must account for the correlation among multiple responses from different individuals within the same cluster. In a post-test-only parallel-arm CRT, the degree of clustering is usually measured using a single intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), defined as the ratio of the between-cluster variance and the sum of the between-cluster and within-cluster variances.  16 In multi-period CRTs, such as SW-CRTs, correlation structures may be more complex as outcomes are measured in different periods. Nevertheless, the initial statistical model for SW-CRTs developed by Hussey and Hughes was a random intercepts model that assumed a single exchangeable correlation, i.e. the correlation between any two individuals from the same cluster is the same regardless of their distance apart in time.  2  Building upon earlier work on multi-period parallel-arm CRTs,  17  Hooper et al.  18  and separately Girling and Hemming  19  introduced a conditional (i.e. mixed-effects) model (referred to as the Hooper/Girling model) that allows the within-period ICC (wp-ICC) (i.e. the correlation between two individuals from the same cluster and same period) to differ from the between-period ICC (bp-ICC) (i.e. the correlation between two individuals from the same cluster but different periods). We would typically expect the bp-ICC to be less than the wp-ICC. The ratio of the bp-ICC and wp-ICC is called the Cluster Autocorrelation Coefficient (CAC), which is typically <1.  18, 20 Li 21 referred to this as a nested exchangeable correlation structure. In a cohort design, an additional correlation is needed to account for repeated measures on the same individual over time. In the Hooper/Girling model, this correlation was introduced through the addition of a patient-level random effect and quantified as an Individual Autocorrelation Coefficient (IAC), which implies a constant correlation in the repeated measures on the same individual over time.  18 Li 21 referred to this as a block exchangeable correlation structure.\n\nIntuitively, within a cluster, the responses from individuals between two consecutive periods are usually more correlated than those separated by a longer interval. Therefore, assuming a constant bp-ICC may not be realistic, Kasza et al.  22  proposed an extension to the Hooper/ Girling model that allows the bp-ICC to decay exponentially. In this case, the CAC refers to the rate of exponential decay per period. In the case of a cohort design, individuallevel correlation is also required and there are two possibilities: either a constant individual-level correlation over time (specified through an IAC) or allowing individuallevel correlations to decay exponentially (referred to as the proportional decay structure).  21 s an alternative to mixed-effects models, Li et al.  23  proposed a marginal model based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) and corresponding power and sample size calculation methodology allowing for both crosssectional and closed cohort SW-CRT designs. In a cohort setting, it is worth noting that in a marginal model, the correlation in repeated measures on the same individual is modelled directly through the within-individual ICC (wi-ICC) and is not identical to the IAC referred to above in the context of a mixed-effects model. A comprehensive overview of statistical models available for SW-CRTs can be found in Li et al.  24  In addition to the above correlation structures that are based on time (period), correlation structures can also be allowed to depend on exposure. This is referred to as cluster-treatment effect heterogeneity and is accomplished by including a random cluster by treatment effect in the analytical model.  25, 26 fferent ways to specify treatment effects\n\nThe most common way to model a treatment effect in a SW-CRT is as a time-averaged effect (step/immediate change),  2  which implies an immediate effect that is sustained. With this specification, the average response across the intervention periods is compared with that across the control periods (Figure  2a ). In some situations, the intervention will not be fully implemented in the period immediately after crossing over or may have a delayed effect. This can be handled by specifying a fractional treatment indicator.  2, 25 For example, using prior knowledge, one may specify that the treatment will only be 50% effective during the first intervention period and code the treatment indicator as 0.5 in that period. When the treatment effect is anticipated to be gradual across multiple periods, one can assign fractional values to consecutive periods (assuming the fractions are known) (Figure  2b ). More generally, rather than estimating a single treatment effect, one may allow the treatment effect to vary in an unrestricted way according to the number of periods of exposure to the intervention. This is referred to as general time-on-treatment effects  24, 25  ; it requires that an adequate number of clusters are available given the desired number of treatment effects. A more parsimonious version is to assume a constant (linear) change with increasing duration of exposure (called a linear time-on-treatment effect).  24 Linear time-ontreatment can also be viewed as a special case of fractional treatment indicators but where the fractions are equally spaced and determined by the maximum exposure time (Figure  2c )."

      "title": "Analytical approximation for non-continuous outcomes",
      "text": "For non-continuous (binary and count) outcomes, a common approach to sample size calculation is to use the normal approximation.  2, 27 However, this approach has several issues. First, it requires the specification of an absolute difference even if relative measures are of interest. Second, the variance of the estimated treatment effect for non-continuous outcomes theoretically depends on the assumed treatment effect as well as on the size of any time effects, whereas under the normal approximation it depends on neither. Several recent methods have shifted away from normal approximation approaches towards methods based on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)  28  of the generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) or marginal models using GEE.  23, 29 These methods allow users to specify odds ratios and risk ratios directly in their sample size calculation procedures. Moreover, they allow the variance to depend on the assumed treatment effect and thus require the effect of secular trends to be incorporated in the power calculation. Although the analytical model should always include time effects to account for potential secular trends, power calculations for continuous outcomes are not affected by the magnitude of the secular trends.\n\nTable  1  summarizes these and other features that researchers need to consider when designing a SW-CRT."

The most common approach is to specify anticipated intra-cluster correlation coefficients. An alternative is to specify the anticipated variance or standard deviation of the random-effects distributions. Finally, the coefficient of outcome variation can sometimes be specified Cluster-treatment heterogeneity Users may allow treatment effects to vary randomly across clusters (which can reduce power) Multilevel clustering More than two levels of clustering during each time period, e.g. patients may be clustered within providers who are clustered within primary care practices Hybrid design\n\nThe design contains a mixture of SW-CRT and parallel CRT (see Girling et al.  19"

Exponential decay is referred to as 'discrete time decay' in this app.\n\nImportant features and strengths SHINYCRT automatically displays power or sample size curves. Users can either provide sample sizes per cluster period to calculate the power or specify a target power to obtain the required sample sizes. In addition to the specified 'base' ICC values, users can conduct a sensitivity analysis by specifying the upper and lower bounds of the wp-ICC. The plot will automatically include results for lower and higher CAC values (80% and 120% of the specified CAC) as a sensitivity analysis. Users can upload their own design matrices to accommodate unequal numbers of clusters per sequence. Uploading a design matrix also activates additional features including an option for accommodating clustertreatment heterogeneity. The design matrix may contain empty cells to allow for incomplete designs or cells with fractions to accommodate delayed or linear time-ontreatment effects (although the design matrix will be displayed as integers). This calculator can also accommodate unequal cluster sizes by specifying a CV for cluster-size variation. Instead of a z-test, users can request a t-test with degrees of freedom equal to the number of cluster periods minus the number of periods minus one, although the t-test is not available for exponential decay or when uploading a user-specified design matrix. An attractive feature of this app is that in addition to SW-CRT, menu options include other multiple-period designs, e.g. parallel-arm and multiple-period cluster crossover designs."

Notably, when specifying the proportional decay structure, it allows bp-ICC and individual-level correlation to decay at different rates. However, POWERSWGEE currently cannot accommodate incomplete designs. A few calculators in our review accommodate special features, e.g. designs with subclusters  40  ; a calculator is also available to determine allocation-based power.  41, 42 The choice of calculators that can deal with open cohort designs is limited  10, 43  ; however, a reviewer pointed out that by multiplying IAC by one minus the churn rate (the rate that participants leave the trial), calculators that support closed cohort designs can also be used for open cohort designs. This observation will hold for continuous outcomes under a constant individuallevel correlation. Conversely, calculators for open cohort designs can also support closed cohort and cross-sectional designs by setting the churn rate to 0 or 1.\n\nDuring peer review, a new standalone calculator (SWGRT 33 ) became available and was added to our manuscript. SWGRT can support continuous and binary outcomes, all three types of designs and available correlation structures, and is accompanied by excellent documentation.

The code used to implement the calculations is presented in Sections 1 and 2 of Supplementary File 2 (available as Supplementary data at IJE online) or RPubs ( https://rpubs.com/derek6561/swcrtcalculator ).\n\n'Girls on the Go!' trial 'Girls on the Go!' is a closed cohort SW-CRT designed to determine whether a 10-week programme that incorporates interactive and practical learning would help to increase self-esteem, self-confidence and body image among school girls aged 10-16 years in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  44 The trial was designed with three sequences and four periods with two clusters per sequence (a total of six clusters) and 10 participants per cluster, i.e. a total sample size of 60 participants. There were no transition periods. The primary outcome was continuous: a measure of selfesteem on a scale from 0 to 40. The sample size parameter values including ICC estimates under the three different correlation structures from the CLOUDbank data set, which is a repository of ICC values under different correlation structures, are summarized in Table  2 .  46  Due to the small number of clusters, we illustrate power with both a z-test and a t-test. SWCRTDESIGN was excluded from this example as it cannot be used for cohort designs. Power calculations when using SWDPWR and CRTFASTGEEPWR are shown both with and without time effects. (This does not contradict an earlier statement that the magnitude of time effects is irrelevant for continuous outcomes but was included to illustrate how SWDPWR handles time effects compared with other packages.)\n\nThe power when using the three main calculators under these assumptions is presented in Table  3 . Not surprisingly, the power did not differ much whether GLMM or GEE was used. Whereas power was substantially different under different correlation structures, power was similar across the different calculators when using the normal distribution. Under the no-time-effect scenario however, SWDPWR yields substantially higher power due to fixed time effect parameters being excluded from the model, leaving fewer fixed parameters to estimate. Therefore, to approximate the results of CRTFASTGEEPWR assuming a null secular trend (where the analytical model includes time effects), users must specify a small secular trend in SWDPWR. As expected, the magnitude of time effects in the linear model is irrelevant to CRTFASTGEEPWR. Note that power from CRTFASTGEEPWR is based on an exponentially decaying wi-ICC, whereas SHINYCRT assumes a constant IAC; nevertheless, the power obtained was comparable. When using the t-distribution, calculated power in SHINYCRT and CRTFASTGEEPWR were substantially different (76% vs 50%) due to the degrees of freedom implemented being different (19 in SHINYCRT vs 4 in CRTFASTGEEPWR, i.e. the number of clusters minus two)."

      "text": "The Washington State EPT trial is a cross-sectional SW-CRT designed to evaluate the impact of promoting the use of EPT on the decrease of Chlamydia test positivity among women.  45 The trial was designed with four sequences and five periods. Each sequence has 6, 6, 6 and 4 clusters, respectively (a total of 22 clusters). The average clusterperiod size was 305 participants, i.e. a total sample size of 33 550 participants. There were no transition periods. The primary outcome was binary: prevalence of Chlamydia positivity. The sample size parameter values including ICC estimates under the three different correlation structures, from reanalysis of the real EPT trial data,  47, 48  are summarized in Table  4 . Since the magnitude of any assumed time effects will impact the power for binary outcomes, we assessed power assuming (i) no time effect, (ii) a small time effect equal to half the size of the treatment effect and (iii) a moderate time effect equal to the treatment effect.\n\nThe power when using the four main calculators is presented in Table  5 . The power was dramatically different under different assumed correlation structures. The power did not appear to differ based on whether GLMM or GEE was used, but when assuming no time effects, SWDPWR a SHINYCRT requires IAC; SWDPWR and CRTFASTGEEPWR require within-individual ICC. We used the same value for both parameters. b Assumed 0.1 in SWDPWR where specification of time effects is necessary to avoid inflating power; changing the value of assumed time effects will not change power as the outcome is continuous gave substantially different results to the other packages, as explained earlier. When the time effects were not null, the power from SWDPWR and CRTFASTGEEPWR was similar but substantially different from the power under the normal approximation in SHINYCRT and SWCRTDESIGN (since the normal approximation does not rely on the magnitude of time effects). The differences tend to increase when the time effects increase.\n\nThe logit link can also be specified for the mean model in SWDPWR and CRTFASTGEEPWR (see Supplementary File 2, Section 3, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Both calculators require users to specify the effect size on the log scale and the ICC of the binary outcomes on the proportions scale. Whereas SWDPWR requires the time effect to be specified as proportions, CRTFASTGEEPWR requires all marginal mean model parameters (i.e. period and intervention effects) to be specified on the link function scale."

      "title": "Summary and recommendations",
      "text": "There are several key considerations when designing a SW-CRT and choosing a power and sample size calculator. For a continuous or non-continuous outcome when the normal approximation is appropriate (i.e. where there is a relatively large number of clusters and/or the anticipated proportion is not too close to 0 or 1) and when anticipated secular trends are small, SHINYCRT is potentially the best choice for most users. It is free to access and provides an intuitive interface. It can accommodate continuous, binary and count outcomes as well as cross-sectional and closed cohort designs under the three types of correlation structures. It allows for incomplete designs and cluster-treatment heterogeneity. Furthermore, it automatically implements a sensitivity analysis for the assumed correlation parameters. However, for non-continuous outcomes in which relative effects are of interest or when extreme baseline rates/proportions or large time effects are expected, CRTFASTGEEPWR seems to be the better choice. This SAS macro allows for cross-sectional and closed cohort designs, incorporates all correlation structures considered herein and can accommodate incomplete designs, fractional treatment effects and both categorical and linear time effects. However, non-SAS users or users who do not want to use GEE may use SWDPWR instead as long as they have a complete design with a continuous or binary outcome (exchangeable correlation only) and do not require decaying correlation structures or delayed treatment effects. When using SWDPWR, users should incorporate non-zero time effects (even for continuous outcomes), otherwise the calculation will be based on a model that excludes the time effect coefficients and this could yield spuriously high power. g This is a manual correction for the DF used in SHINYCRT based on its documentation; the actual implementation is under development.\n\nAlthough users may select the calculator most convenient to them facilitated by our Shiny app, a good rule of thumb when not all requirements can be met is to prioritize those factors that have the most impact on power in their scenario. As our examples illustrate, an important consideration is the assumed correlation structure: assuming an overly simple correlation structure (e.g. exchangeable) when a more complex correlation structure (e.g. block exchangeable or exponential decay) is appropriate can lead to power being overestimated.  49 Ideally, ICC values should be informed by analysing existing data (e.g. historical or routinely collected data) under a similar setting over a similar study duration. A practical approach is to select the best-fitting correlation structure based on information criteria, i.e. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).  50 egardless of the availability of prior data, it is always good practice to check the sensitivity of the calculations by assuming a range of plausible ICC values. When there are no prior data to inform the choice of correlation structure, we would recommend using a nested or block exchangeable correlation for binary outcomes and exponential or proportional decay for continuous outcomes. For non-continuous outcomes, the type of approximation used is also critical. For non-continuous outcomes, users must consider whether strong time effects are anticipated and choose a calculator that can accommodate such effects. As shown in our example, with binary outcomes, the normal approximation works poorly if the baseline proportion is away from 0.5 and the time effect is not null. A similar observation was made by Zhou et al.  28  Finally, for continuous outcomes with a small number of clusters, using the t-test is generally advised, but users must be aware that different degree-of-freedom options are implemented in different calculators and the best choice for degree of freedom remains unclear."

    "IAC, Individual Autocorrelation Coefficient; ICC, intra-cluster correlation coefficient; DF, degrees of freedom. a SWCRTDESIGN does not support cohort designs. b Linear mixed-effects model used. c Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and mixed-effects model produced the same results. d GEE method for marginal model. e By default, coefficients for time are excluded from the underlying model when no time effect is specified. f SHINYCRT and CRTFASTGEEPWR used different DF in t-test.",
    "a Normal approximation using mixed-effects model. Magnitude of time effects cannot be accommodated. b Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used for calculation. With cluster-period size of >150, only GEE can be used in SWDPWR. c By default, coefficients for time are excluded from the underlying model when no time effect is specified.",
