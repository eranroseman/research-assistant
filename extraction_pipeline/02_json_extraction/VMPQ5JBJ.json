  "title": "Pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and research outcome and quality: systematic review",
  "abstract": "Objective To investigate whether funding of drug studies by the pharmaceutical industry is associated with outcomes that are favourable to the funder and whether the methods of trials funded by pharmaceutical companies differ from the methods in trials with other sources of support. Methods Medline (January 1966 to December 2002) and Embase (January 1980 to December 2002) searches were supplemented with material identified in the references and in the authors' personal files. Data were independently abstracted by three of the authors and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Results 30 studies were included. Research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published than research funded by other sources. Studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were more likely to have outcomes favouring the sponsor than were studies with other sponsors (odds ratio 4.05; 95% confidence interval 2.98 to 5.51; 18 comparisons). None of the 13 studies that analysed methods reported that studies funded by industry was of poorer quality. Conclusion Systematic bias favours products which are made by the company funding the research. Explanations include the selection of an inappropriate comparator to the product being investigated and publication bias.",

      "text": "Clinical research sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry affects how doctors practise medicine.  1 An increasing number of clinical trials at all stages in a product's life cycle are funded by the pharmaceutical industry,  2 3  probably reflecting the fact that the pharmaceutical industry now spends more on medical research than the National Institutes of Health in the United States.  4 Most pharmacoeconomic studies are either done in-house by the drug companies or externally by consultants who are paid for by the company.  5 6 esults that are unfavourable to the sponsor-that is, trials that find a drug is less clinically effective or cost effective or less safe than other drugs used to treat the same condition-can pose considerable financial risks to companies. Pressure to show that the drug causes a favourable outcome may result in biases in design, outcome, and reporting of industry sponsored research.  7 e reviewed the relation between the source of funding of the research and the reported outcomes and investigated the quality of the methods in trials funded by pharmaceutical companies compared with other studies."

Of these, 13 found that clinical trials and meta-analyses sponsored by drug companies favoured the product produced by the funder. Statistical significance for this finding was reported in eight of the 13 studies and in another two there was a trend towards statistical significance. These studies covered a wide range of diseases, such as osteoarthritis of the knee, multiple myeloma, various psychiatric problems, Alzheimer's disease, and venous thromboembolism, and a wide range of drugs, such as tacrine, clozapine, third generation oral contraceptives, erythropoietin, antidepressants, and topical glucocorticosteroids. One study that found no difference looked at the outcome of trials of treatment for HIV and associated complications and in this case the trials were monitored by the National Institutes of Health. In one meta-analysis of third generation oral contraceptives, the risk of venous thromboembolism for non-industry funded research was higher than that for industry sponsored trials, although the increased risk for thromboembolic disease was significant in both cases. One study found no difference in outcomes in research published in five leading medical journals. The summary odds ratio for 18 different comparisons (15 studies) of the outcomes of industry and non-industry funded studies was 4.05 (95% confidence interval 2.98 to 5.51) (figure)."

We are also supported by Rochon and coworkers (we excluded this paper because all of the trials were sponsored by drug companies and were, therefore, not comparable with trials lacking company funding).  14 They found that trials supported by the manufacturers of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents almost always reported that the sponsor's drug was as effective or more and less toxic than the comparison drug."

      "title": "Possible explanations",
      "text": "At least four possible explanations exist for favourable results seen in industry sponsored research. Firstly, pharmaceutical companies may selectively fund trials on drugs that they consider to be superior to the competition. Data collected so far, however, indicate that researchers cannot predict results of trials in advance.  15 econdly, positive results could be the consequence of poor quality research conducted by industry. For\n\nRelation between source of funding and methodological quality of research* Study (first author) Criteria used to assess methodological quality of research Results Cho 9 22 item validated scoring system Study design in drug company sponsored clinical trials better than in research where no stated sponsorship (P=0.04) Clifford 5 item validated scoring system (Jadad) plus component (individual items on Jadad scale and adequacy of concealment) approach No difference by funding source for adequacy of allocation concealment (P=0.377); no difference by funding source for overall/composite score on Jadad scale (P=0.143) Davidson Sample size, blinding For all trials higher rate of blinding for ones with industry sponsorship (67.5% v 41.8%, P=0.01); for trials investigating medications no difference in blinding (P=0.46); for sample size no difference between clinical trials supported by drug companies and those with other sources of funding or where funding not stated Djulbegovic (1999) 5 item validated scoring system (Jadad) No difference in quality scores between randomised controlled trials funded solely by industry (mean 3.3 (SD 1.4); median: 3.5) and trials supported by public sources (mean 2 (SD 0.96); median: 2) (P=0.308) Djulbegovic (2000) 10 5 item validated scoring system (Jadad) Randomised controlled trials funded solely or partly by industry had trend towards higher quality scores (mean 2.94 (SD 1.3); median: 3) than trials supported by government or other non-profit organisations (mean 2.4 (SD 0.8); median: 2) (P=0.06) Jadad 7 point validated scoring system (Guyatt and Oxman) 6/6 industry funded systematic reviews and meta-analyses had serious flaws versus 34/44 non-industry funded reviews Kjaergard 5 point validated scale including: concealment of allocation, generation of allocation sequence, double blinding, dropouts/withdrawals, sample size Clinical trials funded by either drug or device industry had higher quality than trials with no external funding (P<0.001); quality of publicly funded trials same as trials funded by drug or device industry (P=0.68) Knox 9 item scale developed for this study, including clinical design, generalisable data sources, statistical tests of significance performed on appropriate outcomes, statement regarding perspective, description of costs of the main included resources, description of time horizon, description of source of total costs differences, discussion of limitations, comparisons with other published studies Drug company sponsored pharmacoeconomic analyses less likely to formally report on study generalisability, but were more likely to provide information on the key components of the methods section than were non-profit sponsored analyses Liebeskind 100 point scale addressing 5 aspects of trial design and reporting: randomisation, outcome, inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of therapeutic regimen, statistical analysis Clinical trials with corporate support had better quality than trials with non-profit support (mean 73.1 (95% CI 3.9) v 53.4 (9.8); P<0.0001) Mandelkern Presence or absence of placebo control 5/16 industry funded clinical trials had placebo controls compared with 3/16 non-industry funded trials Massie 11 Not stated Higher proportion of industry funded clinical trials were adequately controlled and designed than were trials with other sources of funding (71% v 33%, P<0.01) Neumann 12 Adherence to recommended protocols for cost effectiveness studies (adequate description of alternatives, study perspective clearly stated, discounted both costs and QALYs if needed, incremental analyses performed correctly) plus quality as judged by readers (scale of 1 to 7) No difference between industry and non-industry funded studies on any measure: adequate description of alternatives P=0.30; study perspective clearly stated P=0.98; discounted both costs and QALYs P=0.65; incremental analyses performed correctly P=0.73; quality as judged by readers P=0.49 Rochon Modified version of Chalmers score including 14 items: control appearance and/or regimen, randomisation, blinding, patients blinded, observers blinded to treatment and results, previous estimate of numbers, testing compliance, results of randomisation on pretreatment variables and inclusion in analysis, major end points, post-beta estimate, confidence limits, statistical analyses, withdrawals after randomisation, side effects discussion No difference in quality score between industry only funded clinical trials and those funded by government or foundations (mean 36.9% (SD 17.6%) v 37.1% (17.8%), P=0.271) QALY=quality adjusted life year. *References not cited here are on bmj.com\n\nexample, low quality trials exaggerate the benefits of treatment by an average of 34%.  16 17 We found that the research methods in research sposored by drug companies are at least as good as the methods in nonindustry funded research. This does not guarantee the absence of bias in studies sponsored by the industry since outcome could be influenced by factors left out of quality scores, such as the question asked or the conduct or reporting of the study.  7 18 hirdly, selecting an appropriate comparator is a key issue in planning a clinical trial.  7 10 15 In one study, when most cases in which the doses of the study and comparator drugs were not equivalent, the drug given at the higher dose was that of the supporting manufacturer. As the authors saw, higher doses may bias the results in favour of effectiveness of the manufacturer's product. Safer reports that in trials of psychiatric drugs the comparator drug is often given in doses outside the usual range or there is a rapid and substantial dose increase in the drug not manufactured by the sponsoring company.  16 In another instance, research funded by the company marketing fluconazole compared it to oral amphotericin B, a drug known to be poorly absorbed, thereby creating a bias in favour of fluconazole.  17 We did not consider who is finally responsible for the selection of the comparator-investigators, regulatory agencies, or sponsors.\n\nFinally, our results suggest that publication bias may explain our finding of bias in favour of outcomes of research funded by industry. Although research sponsored by industry was less likely to be published than research with other sources of funding, the two studies with this finding did not specifically examine whether non-publication applied just to research with non-significant outcomes.  18 19 In the past few years, manufacturers have attempted to prevent studies which are unfavourable to their products from being published, in several high profile cases.  [20] [21] ] [22]  Massie and colleagues raise another possible source of publication bias; research which was industry funded appears more often in symposiums.  11 Studies in symposiums are known to lack peer review and to favour the sponsor's product.  9 23 Although the methods of industry funded trials are at least equal to those in studies funded by other sources, the absence of peer review may result in an overly favourable interpretation of the results of a trial. Rochon and colleagues noted that claims of superiority for the sponsor's product were often not supported by the data.  14 ading medical journals recently decided to establish more rigorous criteria for the acceptance of research sponsored by industry; this is a step in the right direction towards increasing the credibility of studies paid for by drug companies.  24 The revised CONSORT statement should also help improve the quality of clinical research.  25 In addition, authors and editors should consider including a statement concerning prior beliefs of the investigators about the uncertainty of the treatments that are reported. Finally, all clinical trials should be registered prospectively as the only way to prevent publication bias.  26"
