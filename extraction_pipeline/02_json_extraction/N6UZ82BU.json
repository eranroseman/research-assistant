      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a prevalent illness that often begins in childhood and causes significant distress and/or impairment in daily functioning  (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) . It has been hypothesized that differences in brain functioning in OCD-affected individuals  (Dougherty et al., 2018; Zohar, 2012)  may contribute to the observed functional impairment across diverse settings, including home, school, and community  (Negreiros, Belschner, Selles, Lin, & Stewart, 2018; Piacentini, Bergman, Keller, & McCracken, 2003; Sukhodolsky et al., 2005) . Neurocognitive assessment focusing on executive function (EF)  (Geller, 2006)  has been recognized as a valuable approach to understanding the role of implicated neuroanatomical structures of the brain of OCD-affected individuals  (Kuelz, Hohagen, & Voderholzer, 2004) . Evidence of neurocognitive functioning in OCD could lead to enhanced interventions to improve functioning across environments  (Freeman et al., 2014) .\n\nEF has been broadly defined and is considered an \"umbrella term,\" describing a number of inter-related complex cognitive processes associated with purposeful, goal-directed behaviors  (Anderson, 2002) . The risk of task impurity  (Miyake, Emerson, & Friedman, 2000)  has been a major concern in EF assessment, as each specific domain is embedded within a particular task context that is influenced by non-EF processes. To address these challenges, Miyake and colleagues  (Miyake & Friedman, 2012)  used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling techniques to capture purer EF domains. Three main EF processes were identified, including updating (related to working memory), shifting, and inhibition. These partially correlated processes were reported to both tap into a common underlying ability (\"unity\") and partially differ from one another, with unique relationships to other neurocognitive measures (\"diversity\")  (Miyake & Friedman, 2012) .\n\nOperationalization of the term \"executive function\" has been an ongoing challenge as has the development of EF assessment tools with appropriate psychometric characteristics  (Chan, Shum, Toulopoulou, & Chen, 2008; Wong, 2004) . EF has historically been evaluated via either performance, test-based tasks or parent/self-ratings of daily behavior. However, these two types of measures have been poorly correlated across several childhood psychiatric and neurologic conditions  (Barkley & Fischer, 2011; Davidson, Cherry, & Corkum, 2016; Hybel, Lykke Mortensen, H\u00f8jgaard, Lambek, & Hove Thomsen, 2017; MCaukey, Chen, Goss, Schachar, & Crosbie, 2010; Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2013) , suggesting that they may assess differing underlying EF constructs that are relevant in structured versus unstructured conditions  (Hybel, Lykke Mortensen, H\u00f8jgaard, Lambek, & Hove Thomsen, 2017; Toplak et al., 2013) .\n\nOn test-based EF tasks, goals are explicitly described with an aim to measure \"processing efficiency of cognitive abilities\" under ideal and very structured environmental conditions (e.g., quiet setting, free from distractions)  (Toplak et al., 2013) . In contrast, behavioral rating scales based on parent report assess the child's ability to function with or without distraction or support in one's regular environment. In other words, they reflect success in pursuing and/or accomplishing goals without explicit guidance in unstructured situations  (Toplak et al., 2013) . Despite critiques regarding the potential bias of using EF rating scales due to parents' subjective perceptions of their child's daily behavior, rating scales are perceived to be more ecologically valid measures than test-based tools  (Flanagan & Harrison, 2012) .\n\nIllustrating differences with respect to assessment of inhibition, test performance captures the child's ability to quickly and accurately respond while suppressing the programmed response to a target shape, whereas parent reports capture their child's difficulty in resisting impulses and considering potential consequences of their actions before acting. Moreover, assessment of shifting based on test performance captures the child's ability to develop and maintain a problem-solving strategy across changing stimulus conditions, whereas parent reports captures the child's difficulty in making transitions or tolerating change  (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, & Kenworthy, 2001) .\n\nWhile several OCD studies have examined executive dysfunction via standardized performance testing, very few have investigated reportbased daily behavior associated with EF deficits  (Hybel , Lykke  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2019.100495 Received 19 September 2019; Received in revised form 8 November 2019; Accepted 10 November 2019  Mortensen et al., 2017; Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, H\u00f8jgaard, & Thomsen, 2017) . This is in contrast to research on ADHD  (Mcauley, Chen, Goos, Schachar, & Crosbie, 2010) , psychosis spectrum  (Gur et al., 2014) , epilepsy  (Hessen, Alfstad, Torgersen, & Lossius, 2018)  and traumatic brain injury  (Vriezen & Pigott, 2002)  populations. Adding more ecologically valid measures to EF assessment  (Isquith, Roth, & Gioia, 2013)  is central to providing critical information about OCDaffected youth's daily behavior in real-life contexts and across environments and conditions. This is important given the potential influences of OCD-related distress on cognitive function."

      "title": "Test-based measures of EF in OCD",
      "text": "Most test-based OCD neurocognitive studies have examined adult populations. All three meta-analyses of adult OCD neurocognition studies  (Abramovitch, Abramowitz, & Mittelman, 2013; Shin, Lee, Kim, & Kwon, 2014; Snyder et al., 2016)  identified weaknesses in EF, attention, processing speed, nonverbal memory, and visuospatial tasks. Few related studies have been conducted in pediatric OCD, with the only meta-analysis  (Abramovitch, Abramowitz, et al., 2015)  reporting no more than small effect sizes across varied neurocognitive domains. As such, discrepancies appear to exist between neurocognitive weaknesses in adult versus pediatric OCD, based upon performance testing  (Abramovitch, Abramowitz, et al., 2015; Abramovitch, Mittelman, Tankersley, Abramowitz, & Schweiger, 2015; Geller et al., 2018) .\n\nPediatric studies of test-based neurocognition in OCD have yielded variable results. While some identified no differences  (Beers et al., 1999) , others found poorer performance in planning, set shifting, response inhibition, and spatial working memory  (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2007; Ornstein, Arnold, Manassis, Mendlowitz, & Schachar, 2010; Purcell, Maruff, Kyrios, & Pantelis, 1998) , in addition to short-term memory and visual-constructional skills  (Garcia-Delgar et al., 2018; Olley, Malhi, & Sachdev, 2007) . McGuire and colleagues (McGuire et al., 2014)  reported that OCD-affected youth with symmetry/ordering but not hoarding demonstrated worse response inhibition and set shifting than healthy controls (HC). In addition to those domains, OCD-affected youth with symmetry/ordering and hoarding symptoms demonstrated poorer memory, verbal learning, fluency, and processing speed.\n\nThe question of whether putative neurocognition differences represent precursors, sequelae or a combination of both within pediatric OCD remains unconfirmed. In the only pediatric endophenotype OCD neurocognition study to date, poorer planning was found in both OCDaffected and in unaffected, genetically at-risk siblings compared to controls, identifying it as a putative susceptibility marker preceding illness  (Negreiros et al., 2019) . Studies have reported improvement of neurocognitive deficits in OCD-affected youth following treatment, suggesting that performance may change over time  (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2008; Huyser, Veltman, Wolters, De Haan, & Boer, 2010; Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, H\u00f8jgaard, et al., 2017; van der Straten, Huyser, Wolters, Denys, & van Wingen, 2018) . As such, planning may be a marker preceding illness that also shifts with disease course."

      "text": "The few studies assessing parent ratings of EF in OCD-affected youth  (Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, H\u00f8jgaard, et al., 2017; Hybel, Mortensen, et al., 2017; McNamara et al., 2014; Zandt, Prior, & Kyrios, 2009)  found significantly worse EF in comparison to HCs. Hybel and colleagues  (Hybel, Lykke Mortensen et al., 2017)  found that all three subgroups of OCD-affected youth (characterized by the symmetry/hoarding, harm/ sexual, and contamination/cleaning symptom dimensions) had greater parent-reported daily behavior problems associated with inhibition and shifting compared to controls. The only EF subdomain that differentiated between the OCD groups was working memory (for which the contamination/cleaning subgroup had more reported problem behaviors). Of note, the authors found no associations among OCD participants between EF scores (ratings or test-based performance) and any symptom dimensions.\n\nAnother pediatric OCD study investigating ratings of EF divided youth into those with and without hoarding symptoms and identified greater discrepancies in the latter group  (Park et al., 2016) . In yet another study, OCD severity was associated with report-based EF domains, and emotional control deficits were predictive of multimodal treatment outcome  (McNamara et al., 2014) . Finally, EF daily behavior has been shown to improve after CBT, suggesting that it may be significantly influenced by OCD symptomatology  (Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, H\u00f8jgaard, et al., 2017) ."

      "text": "When examining both test-based and report-based EF, Zandt and colleagues' findings  (Zandt et al., 2009)  highlighted the dissociation between measure findings. In their study, poorer parent ratings of EF in OCD (n = 17) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (n = 19) groups was found relative to controls (n = 18) across all composites. In contrast, on test-based assessment, the OCD group demonstrated poorer inhibition but not poorer planning, verbal fluency, or cognitive flexibility in comparison to HCs. Given its small sample size, this study did not enable more detailed comparison of these measure outcomes in pediatric OCD."

Secondly, this study investigated potential relationships between test -and report-based measures of EF. It was hypothesized that OCD-affected youth would demonstrate more widespread EF deficits when captured by reports of daily behavior versus test performance in controlled settings. It was further hypothesized that significant relationships would not be identified between corresponding measures intending to capture EF domains. Additional associations between the outcome measures and OCD severity and OCD symptom dimensions were further examined. It was hypothesized that both OCD severity and OCD symptom dimensions would not be correlated with the any of the outcome measures. This study was part of a larger project investigating endophenotypes in pediatric OCD."

For the OCD group, PhD-level clinic psychologists administered semi-structured interviews to confirm OCD diagnosis and to assess comorbidities, and their diagnoses were confirmed by the clinic's psychiatrists. For the HC group, following screening procedures, trained Masters-level psychology research assistants, who were supervised by PhD-level psychologists, administered the same semi-structured clinical interview to parents.\n\nThe general inclusion criteria to participate in the study were: youth between ages 6 and 18 years, able to communicate effectively in English, and with an IQ standard score of at least 80. For the OCD group, participants had a current DSM-IV-TR Axis I diagnosis of childhood-onset OCD but none of the following comorbidities: (a) current major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, psychosis, intellectual disability or ASD, and (b) lifetime substance dependence/ abuse disorder. The exclusion criteria for the HC group were lifetime DSM-IV-TR Axis I psychiatric disorder and having OCD or Tourette syndrome in a first-degree relative. MDD was listed as an exclusion factor given evidence that MDD-affected children  (Wagner, M\u00fcller, Helmreich, Huss, & Tadi\u0107, 2015)  and adults  (Rock, Roiser, Riedel, & Blackwell, 2014)  demonstrate a wide range of neurocognitive deficits, which could confound study results.\n\nAmong individuals consenting to participate, one OCD-affected youth was excluded following diagnosis of psychosis on the semistructured diagnostic interview, and six OCD-affected participants were excluded based on their low IQ score (standard score < 80).\n\nFollowing study entry, parents completed demographic and medical background questionnaires and their youth participated in a 2-3-hour neurocognitive assessment session conducted by Masters-or PhD-level psychology researchers trained and supervised by the first author. To maximize recruitment rates, participants were offered the option of participating in the assessment session either at the British Columbia Children's Hospital or at their house. Data quality checks were completed twice to ensure accuracy."

The CY-BOCS and the Y-BOCS are divided into two components. The first comprises the obsessive-compulsive checklist of current and life-long OCD symptoms. The second assesses severity of obsessions and compulsions as identified by their frequency, distress, interference, ability to resist, and perceived control over symptoms. OCD-affected youth's symptom dimensions were determined based on Bloch et al.'s meta-analytic results  (Bloch, Landeros-Weisenberger, Leckman, Rosario, & Pittenger, 2008)  describing a four-factor symptom structure, comprising hoarding (hoarding obsessions and compulsions), symmetry (symmetry obsessions and ordering, repeating, and counting compulsions), forbidden thoughts (aggression, sexual, and religious obsessions), and cleaning (contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions). Both components were administered by PhD-level clinic psychologists at the OCDaffected youth's initial clinic assessment, and the second component was repeated on the day of the neurocognitive assessment."

This was done in an effort to optimize comparability of the groups across all aspects that may influence outcome measures, other than a diagnosis of OCD. First, a logistic regression model was fitted to group membership (OCD versus HC) using age, gender, ethnicity (Caucasian versus other), state anxiety, and FSIQ-2. These variables were selected due to their theoretical associations with neurocognitive performance and/or to adjust for imbalance between the non-randomly assigned groups. The quality of matching was evaluated across minor adjustments of the matching algorithm, and the set of specifications that produced the highest quality matching was defined as that which: 1) allow for a single HC participant to match to more than one OCD-affected participant, 2) discard OCD and HC participants who did not match, and 3) re-evaluate the degree of matching after discarding participants. Importantly, the determination of the best matched sample was conducted without knowledge of each participant's BRIEF and CANTAB scores and, therefore, decisions regarding these specifications were not influenced by the primary study goal of examining group differences in the BRIEF and CANTAB scores."

Between group differences in shifting and inhibition were much smaller (Cohen's d = .04; p = .88 and Cohen's d = 0.21; p = .20, respectively) and found to be non-significant.\n\nIn contrast, across all parent-reported BRIEF domains, OCD-affected participants had significantly higher mean scores than their matched HC peers, with large effect sizes in shift (Cohen's d = 1.36; p < .001), working memory (Cohen's d = 0.92; p < .001), planning (Cohen's d = 0.89; p < .001), and inhibition (Cohen's d = 0.78; p < .001). Table  S4  provides mean T-scores for each group and the percentage of participants who scored within the clinically significant range (Tscore \u2265 65). Despite the fact that the mean T-score of the OCD-affected group did not reach clinically significant levels across domains, 37% of OCD-affected youth (n = 27) fell within the clinically significant range in the shift domain, followed by 34% in working memory (n = 25), 25% in planning (n = 15), and 14% in inhibition (n = 10). In comparison, almost no HCs fell within the clinically significant range in any domain (n = 0-1).\n\nGroup differences in neurocognitive performance (i.e., CANTAB and BRIEF) were not significantly impacted by assessment location, current participation in CBT, or current use of psychotropic medication (Tables  S6-S8 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest study in the pediatric OCD literature to assess and compare both test-and parent report-based measures of EF in OCD-affected youth versus HCs. Significant discrepancy between test-based and parent ratings of EF in pediatric OCD suggests that assessing daily EF behaviors can be a valuable way to capture previously underrecognized difficulties in functioning. In line with the few pediatric OCD studies to date that assessed daily EF behaviors  (Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, Thastum, et al., 2017; McNamara et al., 2014; Zandt et al., 2009) , EF-related behavior problems in \"less controlled,\" everyday real-world contexts appear to occur more commonly in OCD-affected youth than in HCs, with comparably large effect sizes. A notable segment of the OCD group scored within the clinically  significant range across shift (37%), working memory (34%), planning (25%) and inhibition (14%) domains. However, when conducted in a highly controlled setting, weaknesses in test-based EF tasks were less dramatic (i.e., poorer spatial working memory and planning). Consistent with two previous pediatric OCD studies  (Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, H\u00f8jgaard, et al., 2017; Zandt et al., 2009) , ADHD studies  (Barkley & Fischer, 2011; Davidson et al., 2016; Toplak et al., 2013) , and other literature  (Dawson & Guare, 2004; Toplak et al., 2013) , no significant associations were found between CANTAB and corresponding BRIEF domains for either group or the combined sample.\n\nWhen working with OCD-affected youth, clinicians may greatly benefit from assessing their patient's daily EF via ratings, as such information could help with case conceptualization, intervention development, and evaluation of changes in pre-and post-treatment outcomes  (Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, H\u00f8jgaard, et al., 2017) . For example, items on the BRIEF shift domain can inform whether one is able to problem solve with flexibility, to tolerate frustration when unexpected changes occur, or to switch from one activity or task to another without any major difficulty. Similarly, ratings on the BRIEF plan/organize domain can inform whether one's ability to manage current and future-oriented task demands (e.g., homework/chore completion) is age appropriate. Having knowledge about youth's weaknesses in these areas could assist in the development of interventions aiming to improve treatment outcomes and school and family functioning.\n\nInterestingly, BRIEF scores were not associated with OCD severity, suggesting that parent ratings of their child's daily behavior were not merely a result of OCD severity. Such lack of association could be due to the different constructs that these measures assessed such as the severity and intensity of obsession and compulsions over the previous week (CY-BOCS) versus daily behaviors related to self-control and problem-solving skills (BRIEF). In addition, the informants of these measures were not the same (parents versus youth). Based on documented improvements on ratings of daily behavior following treatment  (Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, H\u00f8jgaard, et al., 2017) , it appears that results on the BRIEF were influenced by the overall impact of OCD symptoms on daily routines and/or life situations rather than by the severity of symptoms reported on a specific week. To better understand how EF behavior problems are related to general life conditions across environments, future studies may consider examining associations between daily EF behavior and overall life and school functioning in pediatric OCD populations. Furthermore, potential influences of parent gender and other family factors on BRIEF ratings are also worth exploring.\n\nWith respect to test-based results, spatial working memory and planning were found to be areas of weaknesses in pediatric OCD. Evidence regarding OCD-affected individual's weaknesses in spatial working memory has been documented in two OCD adult meta-analytic studies  (Abramovitch et al., 2013; Snyder et al., 2016)  with small and medium to large effect sizes, respectively, and in one OCD endophenotype adult study  (De Vries et al., 2014) . However, evidence of spatial working memory weakness in pediatric OCD populations is scarce  (Abramovitch, Abramowitz, et al., 2015; Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, Thastum, et al., 2017; Negreiros et al., 2019) , and larger pediatric OCD studies that assess spatial working memory are needed to support our findings. In terms of planning, there was some evidence for a moderate difference in the CANTAB planning score, though the difference was not deemed statistically significant after accounting for multiple tests. Significant planning weakness in pediatric OCD has been found in the only child OCD endophenotype study  (Negreiros et al., 2019)  and in four smaller adult OCD endophenotype studies  (Cavedini, Zorzi, Piccinni, Cavallini, & Bellodi, 2010; Delorme et al., 2007; Li, Sun, Li, & Yang, 2012; Segalas et al., 2010)  conducted with unaffected relatives, as well as with other OCD case-control neurocognition adult and child studies  (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2007; Ornstein et al., 2010) . No meaningful differences on inhibition and shifting tasks were found, which is consistent with other pediatric OCD studies  (Abramovitch, Abramowitz, et al., 2015; Hybel, Mortensen, Lambek, Thastum, et al., 2017; Negreiros et al., 2019) . Null findings could also be related to the fact that test-based EF tasks are not designed to capture more subtle brain activation deficits in youth but rather to assess \"gross\" deficits  (Gruner & Pittenger, 2017) . Thus, future studies that examine neural and clinical neurocognitive correlates of pediatric OCD are needed.\n\nAnother strong finding was the lack of significant associations between test-based and parent ratings of EF in each assessed domain, suggesting that these measures assess different underlying constructs. Such discrepancy could be explained by a range of factors including (a) inconsistency with the operationalization of the term EF and its domains, (b) concerns with task specificity and impurity, (c) limited numbers of developmentally appropriate standardized EF measures for children, (d) low test-retest reliability of test-based EF tools, (e) limited process-behavior correspondence  (Anderson, 2002; Baron, 2003; Miyake et al., 2000; Strauss et al., 2006) , (f) lack of ecological validity of test-based measures  (Dawson & Guare, 2004; Isquith et al., 2013; Kapur, 2005 Kapur, 2004)) , and (f) different methods of measurement (test performance versus parent ratings  (Flanagan & Harrison, 2012) . While behavioral rating scales may identify the individual's ability to function with or without distraction or support in his/her regular environment, performance-based testing provides information about one's executive functioning under ideal environmental conditions. Thus, these two classes of measures should not be interpreted as equivalent, interchangeable, or as types or subcategories of one another, especially because these measures appear to assess different underlying constructs  (Barkley & Fischer, 2011; Davidson et al., 2016; Hybel, Lykke; Mortensen et al., 2017; MCaukey et al., 2010; Toplak et al., 2013)  Based on the aforementioned factors, we believe that the BRIEF provides more meaningful information about OCD-affected youth's ability to perform tasks reliant on EF in their real environment in comparison to results derived from test-based assessment. Such observable executive deficits of daily functioning could be potentially influenced by the manifestation of youth's OCD symptoms caused by environmental triggers. Therefore, future studies that examine interactions between OCD symptom provocation and test-based EF deserve exploration. Interestingly, executive dysfunction using the BRIEF has also been identified in other clinical populations such as of youth with ADHD  (Davidson et al., 2016)  or ASD  (Gilotty, Kenworthy, Sirian, Black, & Wagner, 2002) . Despite the current study not identifying significant associations between symptom dimensions and BRIEF ratings, it is possible that BRIEF results are conflated by OCD symptom presentation. As opposed to other disorders, where this has been directly examined (e.g., ADHD, ASD), the potential overlap between OCD phenotype and BRIEF domains requires further study. It is suggested that the BRIEF may be a useful tool to discriminate between individuals with and without a mental health diagnosis, but not to specify the type of diagnosis. More research that investigates whether different clinical populations have unique EF behavior profiles on the BRIEF is warranted. Finally, a few, but not meaningful, associations between test-and rating-based outcome measures and the four OCD symptom dimensions were found. More specifically, there were moderate relationships between symmetry and test-based planning and spatial working memory scores. However, as we did not adjust for multiple testing, this finding is perceived as an interesting possibility but not necessarily as a confirmation that youth with symmetry symptoms have worse test performance on planning and working memory tasks. Symmetry/ordering symptoms are often associated with \"Tourettic OCD\" with reported limited improvement following CBT  (McGuire, Tan, & Piacentini, 2019) . In light of our findings, OCD-affected youth with symmetry/ ordering symptoms may struggle with planning and working memory in the context of CBT, contributing to poorer treatment response. As such, clinicians may want to be mindful of these potential weaknesses when providing CBT for this population. While our results were mostly similar to Hybel et al.'s null findings  (Hybel, Lykke Mortensen et al., 2017) , our findings also diverged from two other pediatric studies that investigated such associations. In terms of test-based measures,  McGuire et al. (McGuire et al., 2014)  reported that youth with symmetry/ordering symptoms (not including hoarding) had worse shifting task performance (among other tasks not assessed in the current study) in comparison to youth without those symptoms. Regarding ratings of EF, Park and colleagues  (Park et al., 2016)  found significant correlations between hoarding symptoms and problem behavior associated with inhibition and working memory. It is possible that discrepancies between study findings occurred due to different symptom dimension clustering procedures. While a 4-factor symptom dimension model was used in our study, which derived from Bloch et al.'s meta-analytic results  (Bloch et al., 2008)    (Hybel, Lykke Mortensen et al., 2017), and Park et al. applied a dichotomous model (hoarders versus non-hoarders; Park et al., 2016) . Different findings could also be attributed to small sample sizes (e.g., in Hybel et al.'s study, group sizes ranged between 8 and 30 participants per symptom dimension) or to the administration of different test-based measures."

      "text": "While the BRIEF provided information about parents' perceptions of their child's daily behavior associated with EF, results may represent their unique perspective of their child's behavior. To identify the best informant regarding a child's psychopathology and behavior, it is suggested that the child's age (i.e., younger versus older), the problem type (i.e., internalizing versus externalizing), and the setting (i.e., inpatient versus outpatient) be considered  (Smith, 2007) . Thus, including multiple observers' perspectives on individuals' everyday behavior could also provide a more comprehensive view than a single observer. Using both test-and rating-based measures of EF may be relevant, as these tools seem to identify different manifestations of EF impairment in an \"ideal\" versus \"real-world\" settings  (Isquith et al., 2013; Strauss et al., 2006) . Future studies of this type should capture measures of quality of life, family environment (e.g., accommodation and functioning), and school functioning to help disentangle environmental influences on EF. Finally, applications to clinical practice should be further investigated."

Findings suggest that OCD-affected youth demonstrate greater executive dysfunction in real-life contexts (BRIEF) in which OCD symptoms may interfere more than in controlled settings (CANTAB). Discrepancies between test-and rating-based measures of EF suggest that these tools assess different underlying constructs and should not be used interchangeably. Information about OCD-affected youth's daily EF behavior can be valuable to assist clinicians with case conceptualization, intervention development, and evaluation of changes in pre-and post-OCD treatment outcomes."
