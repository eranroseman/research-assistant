      "text": "To the Editor:\n\nOccam's razor is a principle of parsimony commonly applied to diagnostic medicine in minimizing assumptions to arrive at an explanation. We present a case of what appeared to be a simple case of diverticulitis where a patient was diagnosed concomitantly with lymphoma. In this instance, further work-up was triggered by an abnormality in a complete blood cell count differential, an easily missed element following the establishment of a unifying diagnosis."

      "text": "An 82-year-old gentleman presented with mid-epigastric pain over 3 months associated with nausea. His pain improved with eating, although he had been experiencing subtle weight loss over the past month. He denied any fevers. However, he did experience a single loose bowel movement. He carried no family history of blood dyscrasias or lymphomas, but did carry a family history of breast cancer. A complete blood cell count was ordered, which revealed a white blood cell count of 26,300/mm 3 . Given his abdominal pain and leukocytosis, a computed tomography scan of the abdomen was obtained, revealing inflammatory changes surrounding a colonic outpouching consistent with acute diverticulitis. He was started on antibiotics and his symptoms improved. A subsequent differential of his complete blood cell count returned showing 39% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 11% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, and 48% pathologic cells (Figure). A complete blood cell count 3 months prior showed a normal white blood cell count with a normal differential. Given the abnormal peripheral smear, a bone marrow biopsy was obtained revealing changes consistent with mantle cell lymphoma, blastoid variant, involving 40% of cells. There was normal maturation of the myeloid and erythroid series with megakaryocytes. The cells in the bone marrow were CD20 positive and cyclin D1 positive. The Ki-67 index was >90%. Cytogenetics were complex, including a p17 deletion, but without the typical translocation seen in mantle cell lymphoma."
