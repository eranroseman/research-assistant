      "text": "To the Editor:\n\nOccam's razor is a principle of parsimony commonly applied to diagnostic medicine in minimizing assumptions to arrive at an explanation. We present a case of what appeared to be a simple case of diverticulitis where a patient was diagnosed concomitantly with lymphoma. In this instance, further work-up was triggered by an abnormality in a complete blood cell count differential, an easily missed element following the establishment of a unifying diagnosis."

      "text": "An 82-year-old gentleman presented with mid-epigastric pain over 3 months associated with nausea. His pain improved with eating, although he had been experiencing subtle weight loss over the past month. He denied any fevers. However, he did experience a single loose bowel movement. He carried no family history of blood dyscrasias or lymphomas, but did carry a family history of breast cancer. A complete blood cell count was ordered, which revealed a white blood cell count of 26,300/mm 3 . Given his abdominal pain and leukocytosis, a computed tomography scan of the abdomen was obtained, revealing inflammatory changes surrounding a colonic outpouching consistent with acute diverticulitis. He was started on antibiotics and his symptoms improved. A subsequent differential of his complete blood cell count returned showing 39% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 11% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, and 48% pathologic cells (Figure). A complete blood cell count 3 months prior showed a normal white blood cell count with a normal differential. Given the abnormal peripheral smear, a bone marrow biopsy was obtained revealing changes consistent with mantle cell lymphoma, blastoid variant, involving 40% of cells. There was normal maturation of the myeloid and erythroid series with megakaryocytes. The cells in the bone marrow were CD20 positive and cyclin D1 positive. The Ki-67 index was >90%. Cytogenetics were complex, including a p17 deletion, but without the typical translocation seen in mantle cell lymphoma."

      "text": "Over the ages, multiple philosophies in diagnostic medicine have surfaced, including Saint's Triad and Hickam's dictum. These both advocate for multiple separate diagnoses to arrive at an explanation vs Occam's razor advocating for diagnosis solidarity.  1  As physicians, we often recognize a"
