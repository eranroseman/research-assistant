  "title": "The Effects of mHealth-Based Gamification Interventions on Participation in Physical Activity: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: It is well known that regular physical exercise has associated benefits; yet, participation remains suboptimal. Mobile health (mHealth) has become an indispensable medium to deliver behavior change interventions, and there is a growing interest in the gamification apps in mHealth to promote physical activity (PA) participation. Gamification could use game design elements (such as points, leaderboards, and progress bars), and it has the potential to increase motivation for PA and engagement. However, mHealth-based gamification interventions are still emerging, and little is known about the application status and efficacy of such interventions. Objective: This systematic review aims to investigate gamification apps in mHealth for improving PA levels and simultaneously summarize the impact of gamification interventions on PA participation. \n Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL (EBSCO host), and IEEE Xplore from inception to December 20, 2020. Original empirical research exploring the effects of gamification interventions on PA participation was included. The papers described at least one outcome regarding exercise or PA participation, which could be subjective self-report or objective indicator measurement. Of note, we excluded studies about serious games or full-fledged games. Results: Of 2944 studies identified from the database search, 50 (1.69%) were included, and the information was synthesized. The review revealed that gamification of PA had been applied to various population groups and broadly distributed among young people but less distributed among older adults and patients with a disease. Most of the studies (30/50, 60%) combined gamification with wearable devices to improve PA behavior change, and 50% (25/50) of the studies used theories or principles for designing gamified PA interventions. The most frequently used game elements were goal-setting, followed by progress bars, rewards, points, and feedback. This review demonstrated that gamification interventions could increase PA participation; however, the results were mixed, and modest changes were attained, which could be attributed to the heterogeneity across studies. Conclusions: Overall, this study provides an overview of the existing empirical research in PA gamification interventions and provides evidence for the efficacy of gamification in enhancing PA participation. High-quality empirical studies are needed in the future to assess the efficacy of a combination of gamification and wearable activity devices to promote PA, and further exploration is needed to investigate the optimal implementation of these features of game elements and theories to enhance PA participation.",

      "text": "Regular physical activity (PA) correlates with varied physical and mental health benefits  [1] [2] [3] [4] . Guidelines reviewed by the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended that even small increases in light-intensity PA participation can lead to health benefits  [5] [6] [7] . However, despite proven benefits of PA participation, approximately one-third of the global adult population is insufficiently active and fails to fulfill the minimum PA guideline recommendations  [8] . Moreover, an average adult spends approximately 8 hours of the day in sedentary mode  [9] , resulting in poor health outcomes, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes  [10, 11] . Therefore, innovative behavior change interventions are required to improve PA levels.\n\nMobile health (mHealth), as defined by the American Heart Association's scientific statement, is \"the use of mobile computing and communication technologies (eg, mobile phones, wearable devices) for health services and information\"  [12] . It has become an essential medium to bring about behavior change interventions and has demonstrated a promising role in improving PA levels  [13] ; for example, wearable activity trackers enable users to objectively monitor their PA levels when used in conjunction with a mobile app. The real-time feedback relating to daily steps from the app may provide ongoing support and motivation for maintaining healthy PA behavior  [14] .\n\nGamification is the use of game design elements (such as points, leaderboards, progress bars, and badges) in nongame contexts (such as management, education, marketing, and health care) to increase motivation and engagement  [15] . There is a growing interest in the application of gamification in mHealth to promote healthy behavior change  [16] [17] [18] [19] , especially in promoting PA levels  [20] . For example, Patel et al  [21]  used gamification combined with social incentives to reward behaviors and finally increased PA among adults who were overweight and obese. As the concept of gamification is relatively new  [15] , empirical evidence is still emerging on the efficacy of gamification PA behavior change interventions.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no systematic review of quantitative studies has assessed the efficacy of gamification on PA behavior change. A systematic review in 2016 examined the amount and quality of empirical evidence for the efficacy of gamification on health and well-being  [19] ; however, the wide variability in gamification studies was limited in terms of the conclusions that could be drawn. Besides, the use of gamification in behavior change interventions is a young but rapidly growing research field; therefore, it would be timely to conduct a systematic review that combines all the empirical evidence related to the efficacy of gamification on PA participation."

      "text": "Gamification was defined and operationalized as the use of digital game elements in nongame contexts, which needs to be differentiated from creating immersive, full-fledged games as in serious games  [15, 22] . Serious games, sometimes referred to as games with a purpose, provide pure gaming experiences by creating a complete and immersive game (eg, augmented reality exergames such as Pok\u00e9mon Go), whereas gamification attempts to affect users' behavior and motivation through an experience reminiscent of games using game elements such as badges and points (eg, a wearable device combined with a mobile app used points and leaderboards to promote PA levels). However, the actual difference between the 2 concepts could be vague and highly subjective  [22] . In cases where the concepts were indistinguishable, 3 investigators (LX, XY, and FL) discussed the issue and arrived at the final decision."

For the systematic review, the PA results comprised daily step counts, time spent in light PA (LPA), moderate PA (MPA), vigorous PA (VPA), moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), percentage of goal reached, and PA motivation.\n\nBecause of multiple definitions proposed for the term gamification, the subsequent classification methods of game elements were also divided. In this study, we used a combination of the taxonomy of game elements provided by Cugelman  [26] , Johnson et al  [19] , Lister et al  [17] , Sardi et al  [16] , and Vermeir et al  [27] . The studies included in the systematic review had variations in study designs and insufficient data, which did not allow us to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, we present the analysis of the PA outcomes and sedentary behavior in the form of a narrative review, with the results summarized in a table. Furthermore, we compared the inconsistencies of the intervention and gamification features between positive and negative studies to identify potential explanations."

The age of the participants ranged from 8 to 71 years, with the gamification interventions broadly distributed among young people but less distributed among older adults and patients with a disease. The proportion of women varied from 0% to 88%; of the 50 studies, 1 (2%) included only male participants and 7 (14%) did not report the gender ratio.\n\nIntervention Characteristics Most of the study interventions (35/50, 70%) were conducted on the web, 12% (6/50) at homes, 8% (4/50) at schools, 4% (2/50) at workplaces, 4% (2/50) in communities, and 2% (1/50) in laboratories. The gamification of PA was delivered by means of several digital methods: mobile apps only (14/50, 28%), website only (6/50, 12%), activity monitors (eg, wristband and bracelet) only (7/50, 14%), website combined with activity monitors (9/50, 18%), and mobile apps combined with activity monitors (14/50, 28%), showing that most of the studies (30/50, 60%) combined gamification with wearable devices to improve PA behavior change. To be more specific, most of the wearable devices used in gamification were wrist worn (eg, Fitbit). The duration of the intervention ranged from 72 hours to 2 years; most (38/50, 76%) had no follow-up duration, indicating that further evaluations of PA gamified interventions are required to determine longer-term sustainability in the future.

A total of 50 studies were included in the systematic review, suggesting that gamification in PA was still developing and lacked high-quality empirical research that could validate the efficacy of such interventions. The review revealed that gamification of PA had been applied to a variety of population groups and broadly distributed among young people but less distributed among older adults and patients with a disease. Most of the studies (30/50, 60%) combined gamification with wearable devices to improve PA behavior change. The most frequently used game elements were goal-setting, followed by progress bars, rewards, points, and feedback; besides, the most used theory in PA gamification was SDT. This systematic review revealed mixed findings for the efficacy of gamification interventions for improving PA participation and sedentary behavior. Both controlled studies and single-group studies reported mixed results on step counts, MVPA, and sedentary behavior. In addition, the controlled studies reported mixed results on time spent in LPA, MPA, and VPA. However, most of the single-group studies (6/8, 75%) revealed that gamified interventions might positively affect time spent in overall PA. Of note, these findings were limited because of the small number of studies."

To be more specific, most of the wearable devices used were wrist worn (eg, Fitbit). There is a growing interest in the use of wearable activity trackers to facilitate behavior management, when combined with the use of mobile apps; they might enhance users' motivation for PA and help to better manage their health  [77, 78] . Wearable activity trackers could provide real-time feedback related to daily steps and energy expenditure by means of specifically designed algorithms or through health professionals  [79, 80] , and when combined with gamification, they may markedly help in improving PA motivation and participation. However, there are few high-quality empirical studies. Thus, more empirical research is required in the future to explore the efficacy of a combination of gamification and wearable activity devices in promoting PA."

      "title": "Game Elements Used in PA Gamification",
      "text": "In the systematic review, the most frequently used game elements were achievement and progress oriented, such as goal-setting, progress bars, rewards, points, and feedback, which is consistent with previous reviews  [26, 27] , suggesting that these were also the most frequently used elements in PA gamification interventions. Goal-setting (30/50, 60%) is a key technique for behavior change  [26] , and when it is combined with progress and feedback, it could markedly facilitate intrinsic motivation  [81] . However, few scholars believe that rewards promote extrinsic motivation compared with intrinsic motivation; therefore, there may be a poor maintenance effect of the interventions  [82] .\n\nThe second most frequently used game elements in PA gamification interventions were social interaction oriented, such as competition and collaboration; these 2 elements increase users' experience of fun and promote motivation for PA participation through social incentives. However, studies have demonstrated that different types and applications of social incentives might affect the efficacy of gamification interventions  [21] . For example, gamification with collaboration among families led to significant increases in PA; however, the intervention was ineffective when conducted with participants who were previously unknown to each other  [21, 54] . Among such participants, competition became a more effective incentive method to promote PA. Therefore, future research needs to investigate the efficacy of gamification combined with different types of social incentives to promote PA participation."

      "title": "Gamification and Behavior Change Theories",
      "text": "In the systematic review, half of the studies used theories or principles for designing gamified PA interventions, and SDT (8/25, 32%) was the most commonly used theory, followed by BE (5/25, 20%). These findings were consistent with a previous systematic review  [19] . SDT is a well-established motivation theory that has become a key framework for health behavior interventions because the motivation of individuals was recognized as the main factor driving behavior change  [83] . However, intrinsic motivation or extrinsic motivation has different effects on behavior change, and existing research reveals that intrinsic motivation can promote not only behavior change in a more stable manner but also psychological and social well-being  [19] . Hence, future research could consider applying gamification to promote intrinsic motivation to aid in improving PA participation.\n\nThe second most commonly used theory in PA gamification interventions was BE. In recent years, there has been a trend to use BE principles to guide interventions for improving PA  [84] . From the perspective of BE principles, the decision to participate in PA is considered an investment in future health. An individual who is willing to pay the immediate costs of PA (eg, time and energy expenditure) to obtain health benefits in the future is regarded as having patient time preferences. We identified some predictable decision biases and chose interventions that persuade patients to choose a healthier decision (eg, participating in PA). Common BE principles embedded within PA gamification interventions included loss aversion, regret aversion, precommitment, and social norms  [21, 54] ."

      "title": "Effects of Gamification on PA and Sedentary Behavior",
      "text": "Overall, the evidence regarding the use of gamification to facilitate PA participation was inconclusive. Therefore, it is essential to consider potential explanations for the inconsistencies between the positive and negative studies. Regarding the time spent in overall PA, the positive impact of gamified interventions on PA was observed in 75% (6/8) of the single-group studies; these findings were consistent with a previous published systematic review  [19] , which reported that the positive impact of gamified interventions on PA was observed in 80% (8/10) of the studies. We further compared the differences in intervention and gamification characteristics between positive and negative studies. Of the 8 single-group studies, only 1 (13%) showed no trend toward improvement, and the pre-post difference was not significant in terms of the time spent in overall PA after the gamification intervention; the study used just 1 game element (challenge) and did not use any theory. These findings revealed that a combination of multiple game elements could be more effective for PA participation than a single game element, and gamification intervention using theory guidance could be more effective than a gamification intervention without any theory guidance. Furthermore, we tried to identify the appealing game features that could be associated with a positive effect; however, it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion because many studies have applied \u22652 gamification elements, and we cannot separate them to make a judgment. In addition, some of the studies  [9, 39]  reported that participants liked the self-monitoring of progress and leader board aspects, which might be associated with the positive effect on PA outcomes. However, this should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the selected studies.\n\nRegarding the time spent in MPA and VPA, of the 50 included studies, 6 (12%) controlled studies measured the time spent in MPA and VPA and reported mixed results; the results differed between RCTs and non-RCTs. The bias in the non-RCTs could have potentially led to positive results. Our study reported mixed effects of gamification on daily sitting time. As far as we know, this is the first systematic review to report the impact of gamification on sedentary behavior; however, the results were limited because there were only a few high-quality empirical studies."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Our study includes several limitations. First, because of the variability and heterogeneity of the research interventions and results, the evidence might not be sufficiently strong to determine whether gamification effectively improves PA participation. Second, the studies included in the systematic review had variations in study design and insufficient data, which did not allow a meta-analysis. Third, although the population was diverse, the original articles had insufficient data, which prevented us from conducting a subgroup analysis based on the population. Fourth, related outcomes were measured immediately after the end of the intervention period, and the long-term effects of gamification in most studies were not observed; therefore, we did not summarize and synthesize the maintenance effect of the gamification interventions. Fifth, the differences in game elements, mHealth technology types, populations, and sample sizes among the included studies might be a major cause of the heterogeneity. Finally, most selected studies in our review were conducted using medical registry databases, which might suffer from an intrinsic risk of coding imprecision and incompleteness."

    {
      "title": "Conclusions and Practical Implications",
      "text": "This study demonstrates that gamification interventions can increase PA participation; however, the results were mixed, and modest changes were obtained. This could be attributed to the heterogeneity across studies. Gamification combined with wearable activity trackers could help individuals to self-monitor progress and provide fun and motivation to promote health-related behavior change, especially in improving PA. Therefore, high-quality empirical studies are required in the future to examine the efficacy of a combination of gamification and wearable activity devices to promote PA. Gamification interventions generally have short-term effects, and ongoing contact by means of specifically designed algorithms and through health professionals could increase long-term adherence to PA participation. Hence, gamification combined with wearable activity devices has the potential to assist health professionals to provide ongoing support and motivation to patients who are physically inactive in terms of adherence to PA participation. Moreover, this study reveals that a combination of multiple game elements could be more effective for PA participation than a single game element, and a gamification intervention using theory guidance could be more effective than a gamification intervention without any theory guidance. The combination of different theories and different multiple game elements might produce different effects; hence, further exploration is required to explore the optimal implementation of these features of game elements and theories to improve PA participation. Furthermore, future empirical research on gamification should focus not only on the outcome of PA but also on the impact on sedentary behavior."
