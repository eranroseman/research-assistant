  "title": "Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Machine Learning-Based eHealth System to Predict and Reduce Emergency Department Visits and Unscheduled Hospitalizations of Older People Living at Home: Retrospective Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Dependent older people or those losing their autonomy are at risk of emergency hospitalization. Digital systems that monitor health remotely could be useful in reducing these visits by detecting worsening health conditions earlier. However, few studies have assessed the medico-economic impact of these systems, particularly for older people. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and economic impacts of an eHealth device in real life compared with the usual monitoring of older people living at home. \n Methods: This study was a comparative, retrospective, and controlled trial on data collected between May 31, 2021, and May 31, 2022, in one health care and home nursing center located in Brittany, France. Participants had to be aged >75 years, living at home, and receiving assistance from the home care service for at least 1 month. We implemented among the intervention group an eHealth system that produces an alert for a high risk of emergency department visits or hospitalizations. After each home visit, the home care aides completed a questionnaire on participants' functional status using a smartphone app, and the information was processed in real time by a previously developed machine learning algorithm that identifies patients at risk of an emergency visit within 7 to 14 days. In the case of predicted risk, the eHealth system alerted a coordinating nurse who could then inform the family carer and the patient's nurses or general practitioner. Results: A total of 120 patients were included in the study, with 60 in the control group and 60 in the intervention group. Among the 726 visits from the intervention group that were not followed by an alert, only 4 (0.6%) resulted in hospitalizations (P<.001), confirming the relevance of the system's alerts. Over the course of the study, 37 hospitalizations were recorded for 25 (20.8%) of the 120 patients. Additionally, of the 120 patients, 9 (7.5%) were admitted to a nursing home, and 7 (5.8%) died. Patients in the intervention group (56/60, 93%) remained at home significantly more often than those in the control group (48/60, 80%; P=.03). The total cost of primary care and hospitalization during the study was \u20ac167,000 (\u20ac1=US $1.09), with \u20ac108,000 (64.81%) attributed to the intervention group (P=.20). \n Conclusions: This study presents encouraging results on the impact of a remote medical monitoring system for older adults, demonstrating a reduction in both emergency department visits and hospitalization costs.",

      "title": "Older Adults and Emergency Hospitalizations",
      "text": "In France, over 13.4 million people are aged 65 years or older, representing 20% of the French population. This proportion has increased by 4% in 20 years  [1] . With aging and frailty, the risk of unplanned hospitalizations is increased.\n\nStudies show that in France, older adults living at home represent 13% of the population that is hospitalized at least once a year, compared to 6% for the general population  [2, 3] . According to medico-economic data, nearly 1.6 million people aged >80 years were hospitalized in 2017, twice the number in the general population. In addition, the average length of stay doubles between the ages of 60 and 80 years, reaching nearly 10 days for those aged >90 years  [4] .\n\nDepending on the study, between 19% and 67% of hospitalizations of older people are considered avoidable  [5, 6] .\n\nMedical and social frailty and comorbidity of the older population are the main factors that increase the prevalence and time spent in hospital  [3] .\n\nThe emergency department (ED) is the main entry point for the older people. Half of the people who visit the ED are subsequently hospitalized. Moreover, older adults represent 41% of ED visits, and nearly 23% of them spend more than 8 hours there and 34% spend between 4 and 8 hours-more than twice as long as younger people. This longer stay in the ED is compounded by a higher rate of transfer to other departments or hospitals  [3, 7] .\n\nIn people aged >80 years, main causes of admission to the ED are traumatic events (generally related to fall; 25%), cardiovascular events (17%), altered general condition or infection (12%), a respiratory symptom (12%), a gastrointestinal symptom (10%), and neurological symptoms (9%)  [3, 7] .\n\nEmergency hospitalization represents a significant medical and economic cost. Older adults' hospitalizations reduce the level of dependency by 30% to 60% (immobilization syndrome, confusion, malnutrition, urinary incontinence, undesirable effects related to treatments, etc). While people aged >75 years represent 8% of the population, they are responsible for one-fifth of health care expenditure  [8, 9] . In France, the main expenses to support the loss of autonomy of older adults are approximately \u20ac12.2 billion (\u20ac1=US $1.09) in care expenses and \u20ac10.7 billion in human and technical assistance. The challenge is not so much to reduce hospitalization rates or the average length of stay but rather to avoid preventable emergency hospitalizations  [1, 2, 8, 10, 11] ."

      "title": "Telehealth and Artificial Intelligence for the Prediction and Prevention of Emergency Situations in Older Adults",
      "text": "Therefore, it is crucial to anticipate adverse events at home. The use of eHealth systems, telemedicine, and connected objects represent a promising approach for keeping older adults at home and preventing the loss of autonomy. Patient-reported outcome measures benefit people with chronic diseases by improving their quality of life, reducing mortality, and reducing ED visits and hospitalizations  [7, 12] .\n\nWe have implemented a machine learning-based eHealth device to predict and prevent ED visits and unscheduled hospitalizations for older people living at home  [13, 14] . In 2022, we conducted a multicenter study with people aged >65 years, living at home, and receiving regular visits of home care aides (HCAs) to evaluate this device in real life. After each home visit, HCAs completed a smartphone-based questionnaire on the functional status of the patients. The information was processed in real time by a machine learning algorithm developed beforehand in order to identify patients at risk of an ED visit within 7 to 14 days (with a predictive performance of 83% sensitivity and 86% specificity). This machine learning algorithm can also predict symptoms or events such as malnutrition, falls, swollen legs, or depressions  [15] . In the case of predicted risk, the system alerted a nurse coordinator who could then inform the family caregiver and the patient's nurses or general practitioner. A total of 206 patients were included and followed for 10 months. Compliance was good. Among the 2656 home visits, 405 alerts were issued. The system significantly reduced the number of ED visits when an intervention was performed after an alert. The system was considered easy to use and useful, and it was well accepted by more than 90% of the HCAs and coordinating nurses  [15] . This algorithm opens the possibility of mobilizing health professionals to intervene early in an acute illness or in the decompensation of a chronic illness before it leads to an emergency hospitalization."

In France, as this medical device is the first to predict ED use, there are, to our knowledge, few medico-economic studies available."

      "title": "Recruitment",
      "text": "Participants were recruited from among adults aged 75 years and older who were living at home and receiving the assistance from HCAs. These HCAs were not health care professionals and typically provided assistance with nonmedical tasks (eg, helping with meals, assisting with personal care, housekeeping, and running errands). The dependency levels of the persons were established according to the French national instrument, which stratifies the dependency level from groupe iso-ressources (GIR) 1 (very severe dependency) to GIR 6 (no dependency)  [16] .\n\nPatients in palliative care situations (GIR 1) were not included. Patients were proposed to be included in the controlled group without being offered any incentives. Written consent was obtained from all participants of the intervention group to be included in the study.\n\nThe control group was composed of people receiving the usual support from the home care service. The adjustment between intervention and control groups (1:1 or 1:2 when possible) was based on age (within 2 years), gender, and level of dependency. Participants in the control group were informed of their enrollment in the study. Data were collected between May 30, 2021, and May 31, 2022."

      "title": "Intervention",
      "text": "For participants in the intervention group, HCAs used a smartphone app, for which they received training on its use (a 1-hour session at the start of the study). Each week, they completed a simple and concise questionnaire for each patient via the app. This questionnaire comprised 25 yes-or-no questions covering functional and clinical autonomy (activities of daily living); medical symptoms such as fatigue, falls, pain, and undernutrition; as well as behavioral changes (cognitive disorders and aggression), communication with caregivers, and social life.\n\nThe collected data were transmitted in real time to a secure server, where an artificial intelligence algorithm analyzed them to assess risk levels and predict ED visits within 7 or 14 days. The risk assessment was displayed on a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne-marked, web-based secure medical platform called PRESAGE CARE. When the algorithm detected a high-risk level, an on-screen alert was sent to the nurse coordinator of the home care center. This alert included information on recent changes in the patient's functional status, along with decision-support insights to help the nurse coordinator take appropriate action, such as contacting the family caregiver or other health care professionals, or conducting a home reassessment.\n\nNo specific intervention protocol was imposed on health care professionals, allowing them full autonomy in their decision-making. This alert-based intervention model was presented to and approved by the Agence du Num\u00e9rique en Sant\u00e9 (National Agency for eHealth). The study followed the guidelines and recommendations of the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (French Health Authority) regarding the cost-effectiveness evaluation of medical devices."

Unscheduled hospitalizations were defined as those occurring after an ED visit or those explicitly recorded as such in the PRESAGE CARE console or the data extracted from the center's information system.\n\nSecondary outcomes included a comparison of hospitalization rates following an alert that did not lead to an intervention versus those following an alert that triggered an intervention, as well as a cost comparison of hospitalizations between the two groups. Additionally, the probability of remaining at home was assessed, defined as the time elapsed from May 30, 2021 (study start date), to the first occurrence of one of the following events: unplanned hospitalization, death, or institutionalization."

Hospital costs have been determined on the basis of published costs by the type of illness and length of hospital stay (basic category of classification in medicine, obstetrics, or surgery). The costs of consultations with the attending physician related to the PRESAGE CARE system were also included. The average length of hospital stay was compared between the groups. The burden costs (gross salary and taxes) of nurses who managed alerts (intervention arm) and conducted regular activities (control arm) were defined according to the time needed to proceed their tasks and average gross salary for nurses  [17] .\n\nThe cost for data collection by HCAs was defined as training costs (1 hour of training time multiplied by the hourly burden costs for HCAs  [17] ). The collection of data into PRESAGE Care eHealth device occurred during regular visits so no extra time was counted. In this study, the medical device was deployed free of charge.\n\nThe analysis was performed from the point of view of the total hospital cost per event and per patient in relation to the medical benefit determined by the number of deaths, the number of institutionalizations, and the data in the literature concerning the loss of functional independence following hospitalization (in the absence of data on the reassessment of the dependency level after hospitalization). The cost analysis was mainly carried out from the point of view of social security expenditure.\n\nCoordinating nurses were asked to report time spend in order to check alerts and act according to the procedure. The number of ED visits, emergency hospitalizations, deaths, and nursing home admissions were compared between the groups. The times before the first event were compared between groups."

The use of the PRESAGE CARE device led to a nearly 32% reduction in emergency hospitalizations compared to the control group. Overall, it reduced hospital-related costs by 45.72%. In XSL \u2022 FO RenderX addition, this cost reduction must be considered in the context of additional expenses, including in-home care, posthospitalization consultations, and the increased risk of rehospitalization.\n\nThe median length of stay in the intervention group was consistent with findings in the literature, whereas it was higher in the control group, likely due to extreme values and the small cohort size.\n\nFurthermore, over a 1-year follow-up of 60 participants, the system extended the mean time to failure in the care pathway by 38 days. This result is likely underestimated given the limited cohort size.\n\nIn the intervention arm, among the 726 visits not followed by an alert, only 4 (0.6%) hospitalizations followed the visit (P<.001), which confirm the relevance of the alerts issued by the system. Comparison of the postintervention hospitalization rate in the intervention group shows that an alert-triggered intervention significantly reduces hospitalization. These results are consistent with a previous study on this system  [15] . Professionals can effectively anticipate a deteriorating health condition and act at the right time.\n\nThe multiplication of technological tools to promote home care rarely benefit from data on their real medico-economic benefits  [17, 18] . Moreover, few studies on the economic evaluation of telemedicine systems show a medico-economic gain  [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition, to our knowledge, they have not evaluated the effectiveness of a predictive system for the prevention of unplanned hospitalizations of older people living at home."

      "title": "Increased Cost of Dependency and Quality of Life",
      "text": "According to the report of the Hospital and Older People Workshop published in 2018, the incidence of dependence related to hospitalization varies between 30% and 60% in people aged 70 years and older and increases to 50% in patients aged 85 years and older. After discharge from hospital, only 50% of patients recover their basic functional state, 33% within 6 months after discharge, and 14% at 1 year  [10, 19] . The prevalence of iatrogenic dependence is about 12%, and it is avoidable in 80% of cases. It is therefore possible to prevent it. Moreover, after a visit to the ED, 56% of older patients are hospitalized, and 44% return home. The difficulty in finding suitable hospital places for older adults leads to an increase in the time spent by carers on calls to other departments. Older people spend more time in the ED, on average 4 hours more  [10] .\n\nThese data increase the medical and financial impact of devices aimed at predicting and preventing ED visits and emergency hospitalizations.\n\nThe increase in the loss of autonomy of older adults after hospitalization (bed rest, loss of mobility, and waiting time in the ED) leads to an increase in home care needs and increases the costs associated with the management of dependency. This increase in posthospitalization dependence leads to a decrease in quality of life, which has been widely described in the literature  [24] . This device represents a real gain in terms of medical benefits, quality of life, and hospital costs."

Moreover, the number of deaths was higher in the control group, but the sample size did not allow us to identify a significant correlation with the intervention. The lack of significance of the different results can indeed be explained by the size of the cohort, the number of events, and the low statistical power. Some particularly long hospital stays imply a wide CI, impacting the significance of the results.\n\nIn view of the number of deaths and the lack of consensus on the relevance of using quality-adjusted life-year analyses to carry out medico-economic studies of dependent or frail older people (National Academy of Medicine)  [21, 24] , it was not possible to carry out a quality-adjusted life-year study based on life expectancy. Furthermore, the quality of life of the individuals could not be measured and compared. It is not possible to draw conclusions on the impact of PRESAGE CARE on the quality of life of beneficiaries. A prospective study will be conducted to evaluate this impact.\n\nThe size of the cohort is also a limitation and will require a larger-scale, multicenter, randomized controlled trial."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This first study evaluating the medico-economic impact in real life of the use of the PRESAGE CARE medical device shows a reduction of almost half of the hospital expenses among the beneficiaries of the device. In addition, PRESAGE CARE reduced unplanned hospitalizations by more than 30% and increased life expectancy in good health at home. A larger, randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these already very encouraging results."
