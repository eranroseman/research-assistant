  "title": "Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Telehealth: A Comparison between Home Telemonitoring, Nurse Telephone Support, and Usual Care in Chronic Heart Failure Management",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To assess the cost effectiveness of home telemonitoring (HTM) and nurse telephone support (NTS) compared with usual care (UC) in the management of patients with chronic heart failure, from a third-party payer's perspective. Methods: We developed a Markov model with a 20-year time horizon to analyze the cost effectiveness using the original study (Trans-European Network-Home-Care Management System) and various data sources. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the decision uncertainty in our model. Results: In the original scenario (which concerned the cost inputs at the time of the original study), HTM and NTS interventions yielded a difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained compared with UC: 2.93 and 3.07, respectively, versus 1.91. An incremental net monetary benefit analysis showed \u20ac7,697 and \u20ac13,589 in HTM and NTS versus UC at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of \u20ac20,000, and \u20ac69,100 and \u20ac83,100 at a WTP threshold of \u20ac80,000, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were \u20ac12,479 for HTM versus UC and \u20ac8,270 for NTS versus UC. The current scenario (including telenurse cost inputs in NTS) yielded results that were slightly different from those for the original scenario, when comparing all New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes of severity. NTS dominated HTM, compared with UC, in all NYHA classes except NYHA IV. Conclusions: This modeling study demonstrated that HTM and NTS are viable solutions to support patients with chronic heart failure. NTS is costeffective in comparison with UC at a WTP of \u20ac9000/QALY or higher. Like NTS, HTM improves the survival of patients in all NYHA classes and is cost-effective in comparison with UC at a WTP of \u20ac14,000/ QALY or higher.",

      "text": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death in the world-in 2012, 17.5 million people died from CVD, representing 31% of all global deaths  [1] . Age-related changes in the cardiovascular system-particularly hypertension, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease-result in a high prevalence of heart failure  [2] . As a result, chronic heart failure (CHF) is becoming an increasing problem globally, imposing \"direct costs to healthcare systems and indirect costs on society through morbidity, unpaid care costs, premature mortality and lost productivity\"  [3] .\n\nIn the European Union (EU), the rate of mortality from CVD has been declining since the early 1980s, but recently, deaths caused by CVD have plateaued in 15 countries  [4] . CVD causes 1.9 million deaths in the EU and is estimated to cost the EU economy almost \u20ac196 billion a year  [5] . Out of the total cost of CVD in the EU, about 54% is accounted for by direct health care costs, 24% by productivity losses, and 22% by informal care  [5] .\n\nPeople live longer in the EU  [6] , and although mortality from CVD is in decline, there will be an increasing number of patients with heart disease in the future, and this will place a significant burden on the health care systems  [7] . The use of information communication technologies in the provision of care for patients with heart disease could prove to be a useful strategy for tackling this problem. It is believed that successful management of patients with CHF is dependent on telemonitoring, adherence to treatment, provision of guidelines, and daily communication with patients  [8, 9] . There have been a number of studies on the clinical effectiveness of telemonitoring systems  [10, 11] , but few full analyses of the cost effectiveness of telemonitoring systems for patients with CHF  [12, 13] .\n\nThe biggest telemonitoring trial to date-the Whole System Demonstrator (WSD)-aimed to \"examine the costs and costeffectiveness of telehealth in addition to standard support and treatment, compared with standard support and treatment\" in heart failure in the United Kingdom  [12] . Participants received telehealth equipment and a monitoring service for 12 months, whereas the control group received usual care (UC) and social care. The authors found that telehealth is associated with lower mortality and reduced emergency admission rates  [14] , but \"the QALY gain by patients using telehealth in addition to usual care was similar to that for patients receiving usual care only, and total costs associated with the telehealth intervention were higher\"  [12] .\n\nThe Trans-European Network-Home-Care Management System (TEN-HMS), another study from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany, found the \"number of admissions and mortality similar among patients assigned to home telemonitoring (HTM) or nurse telephone support (NTS), but the mean duration of hospital admissions reduced by 6 days (95% confidence interval 1 to 11) with HTM\"  [8] . The interventions were similar to the WSD: HTM consisted of twice-daily patient selfmeasurement of weight, blood pressure, and heart rate and rhythm with automated devices linked to a cardiology center; NTS consisted of specialist nurses being available to patients by telephone; and UC consisted of care delivered by primary care physicians  [8] . Patients assigned to receive UC had \"higher oneyear mortality (45%) than patients assigned to receive NTS (27%) or HTM (29%) (p \u00bc 0.032)\"  [8] .\n\nBoth the WSD and TEN-HMS trials used versions of a Philips telemonitoring system. The aim of this study was to provide insights into the cost effectiveness of a telehealth (i.e., telemonitoring) system in the Netherlands. We were interested in knowing whether HTM and NTS are cost-effective strategies in the management of CHF, compared with UC, and whether there is a subgroup of patients with CHF who can benefit the most from telemonitoring."

We secured access to original data from the TEN-HMS study. Modeling was necessary for two reasons: 1) the original trial used a short follow-up interval of 240 to 450 days, and so there was a need to extrapolate beyond the end points of the trial because CHF is a chronic condition, and 2) the intervention is expected to have an effect on the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) after the trial  [15] . Besides the TEN-HMS, we concentrated on clinical results and it was necessary to include Dutch health care costs to study the cost effectiveness."

In the clinical trial, random permuted blocks for each hospital were used to allocate 426 patients to treatment groups by an independent statistical group (Institute for Medical Informatics and Biostatistics, Basel, Switzerland).\n\nPatients were assigned randomly to HTM, NTS, and UC in a 2:2:1 ratio. The TEN-HMS study included patients who had recently been admitted to a hospital with worsening heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction o40%), and we used the characteristics of that population to model our own.

      "text": "We were interested in the cost effectiveness of two interventions, compared with one comparator, in the management of CHF: HTM and NTS compared with UC. We give an outline of how each intervention is commonly delivered.\n\nUC comprises a patient management plan  [17]  which, upon discharge from hospital, is usually sent by a nurse to the patient's primary care physician, who is asked to implement it. The protocol follows the clinical guidelines. When the usual organization of care involves the titration of drugs by a specialist nurse, this is encouraged. The patient's status is usually evaluated at a clinic every 4 months to assess intervention history, symptoms and signs, renal function, and serum electrolytes.\n\nNTS is managed as described for UC except that patients are contacted by telephone each month by a specialist heart failure nurse to assess their symptoms and current medication. The nurse can offer advice to the patient at this time and provide feedback to the primary care provider. Patients can contact the nurse by telephone at any time, either directly or by leaving a message on a telephone-answering machine. Nevertheless, in the event of an out-of-hours emergency, they are expected to contact their primary care doctor or the ambulance service.\n\nPatients on HTM receive the telemonitoring equipment and written instructions on how to use it. A service engineer visits the patient's home to install the equipment, which usually consists of low-profile, electronic weighing scales, an automated sphygmomanometer, and a single-lead electrocardiogram using wristband electrodes. Each device contains a short-range radio transmitter that allows it to communicate automatically with a hub connected to the patient's conventional telephone line. The signal is sent automatically to a central Web server and then via secure Intranet connections to a workstation at each clinical site. Data are encrypted during transmission to ensure patient confidentiality. Patients are asked to take a set of measurements every day before breakfast and before their evening meal, after emptying their bladder, while wearing light clothing, no shoes, and before taking their next dose of medication. The patient's weight, blood pressure, and heart rate and rhythm are therefore monitored twice daily."

We acted as if all those patients had been treated by the health care system in the Netherlands, by applying the EQ-5D weights and costs for the Netherlands. This was necessary because the TEN-HMS study was inadequately powered  [8] , and if we were to exclude patients from other countries, we would miss the real effect of the interventions. The utility values were derived from the EQ-5D data  [21]  in the TEN-HMS database."

The cohort progresses through the states with the passage of time, that is, the progression of the disease. From each of the NYHA states, it is possible for a patient to move to any of the four NYHA states in the next cycle of 4 months. Death is possible from each of the NYHA states. We were not tracing events that move the patient from one state to another but just the movement between the NYHA states for each of the three strategies compared.

The probabilities were constructed by dividing the number of patients who moved to an NYHA class by the total number of patients in an originating class. For instance, the transition probability from NYHA class I to NYHA class II in the HTM intervention arm (0.30159) was constructed by dividing the total number of patients who moved from NYHA class I to NYHA class II  (38)  by the total number of patients in NYHA class I (126). The transitions were time-independent, that is, not dependent on the time when they happened during the intervention.

We kept the utilities treatment-independent (utilities are NYHA class-dependent and not treatment arm-dependent) and the transition probabilities consistent throughout all analyses. The difference between the original and the current scenarios therefore lies in telenurse cost inputs (Table  2 ). The subgroup analyses were combined with the original and the current scenarios to find information on the cost effectiveness of HTM and NTS compared with UC in different stages of CHF severity (i.e., NYHA class). The subgroups were NYHA II to IV, NYHA III and IV, and NYHA IV only, where the cohort of 1000 patients was deployed according to the initial probability of group participation, adjusted for the number of NYHA classes.

Each parameter in the model was defined by the distribution according to the nature of the parameter. The polynomial transition probabilities were deconstructed in a Dirichlet matrix using a cumulative gamma function, because each draw was not independent. For the utilities, we used the beta function (which is bound from 0 to 1), and for the personnel-and hospital-related costs we used the gamma function (0 to infinity). The equipment and service fees, together with the installment fee, were parameterized by uniform function. We discerned the uncertainty not around the costs but around the volumes of care, and based it on the standard error.\n\nFor the PSA, 2500 Monte-Carlo simulations were run, where a value for each parameter was drawn at random from the probability distribution of the model parameters (transition probabilities, costs, and utility values). This led to 2500 estimates in terms of expected costs, QALYs, and life expectancy for HTM, NTS, and UC separately. We plotted the results in a costeffectiveness plane and LY plane (Figure  5 ). This procedure informed us of the \"spread\" of our scenarios and gave us a graphical representation of the uncertainty in our model. We then continued to the incremental analysis of each scenario, that is, the difference between the effects in relationship to the difference in costs, plotted again in the cost-effectiveness plane.\n\nThe results were then transferred to the net monetary benefit framework and subsequently converted into the probability of each intervention being cost-effective. Finally, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were plotted to visualize which intervention is cost-effective at each willingness-to-pay (WTP) level: \u20ac0 to \u20ac80,000/QALY to reflect the health care realities in the Netherlands  [27] .

For instance, in our analysis the background mortality is included in the transition probabilities. In our model, after the first cycle, people can die because of the probabilities that were estimated in 240 to 450 days of follow-up in the original study.\n\nAlso, the clinical trial was run in three European countries (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany), although we are modeling for the Dutch decision-making context only.\n\nOther assumptions concern the price of the telemonitoring equipment and the effectiveness of the telemonitoring service. Regarding the prices, in those 20 years of simulation they did not change in any treatment arm-not in HTM, NTS, or UC. This was a modeling assumption to make a 4-month cost contribution to Markov model constant. We based our analysis on the information found via the market research. The prices for the current scenario are based on the information received from the Centre for Telehealth (Hull, UK), where one telehealth nurse manages 200 to 400 patients with CHF  [28] . We assumed that four such nurses would be able to deliver the necessary care for our fictitious cohort of 1000 patients in the current scenario and threshold analysis, but not in the original scenario, where they were not introduced. Costs were calculated per patient per Markov state in all three Markov chains."

For the subgroup analyses NYHA II to IV and NYHA III to IV, the results were similar. Nevertheless, the current scenario analysis revealed the greater cost effectiveness of HTM versus both NTS and UC in NYHA IV subgroup analysis. The current scenario included the cost of telehealth nurses of \u20ac30,000/y (four nurses in the model, one nurse in charge of 250 patients). Patients assigned to HTM and NTS incurred higher costs than those treated in UC, but also gained more QALYs and LYs. The results of the deterministic analysis in all NYHA classes, and in NYHA IV only, are presented in Table  5 .\n\nThe PSA results show \u20ac28,121 for HTM (95% CI \u20ac19,269-\u20ac38,722), \u20ac23,052 for NTS (95% CI \u20ac14,782-\u20ac33,426), and \u20ac16,037 Incremental net monetary benefits show \u20ac5,166 and \u20ac7,944 in HTM and NTS versus UC at a WTP threshold of \u20ac20,000, and \u20ac57,059 and \u20ac52,903 at a WTP threshold of \u20ac80,000, respectively.\n\nThe threshold analysis for NYHA IV only revealed that \u20ac20 to \u20ac36.5/mo for telemonitoring equipment and service combined is the monetary value at which HTM starts to have a greater probability of being more cost-effective compared with UC than NTS compared with UC, at a WTP threshold of \u20ac20,000 (the setup fee is kept at \u20ac50-\u20ac100 per 5 years). This represents a sharp decline of \u20ac66.7 to \u20ac125/mo from the ranges used in the original and the current scenarios (see \"Equipment and service annual fee\" in Table  2 )."

      "text": "Our model demonstrated the cost effectiveness of both HTM and NTS compared with UC for patients with CHF in various scenarios (Fig.  2 ). It also showed better survival in both HTM and NTS than in UC. In terms of survival, a cohort of patients in HTM, consisting of all NYHA classes of severity, is shown to consistently outperform a similar cohort in UC, although it lags slightly behind a comparable cohort in NTS (Fig.  3 ). In the NYHA IV class, in terms of survival the HTM treatment arm outperforms NTS and UC by some 8.7 years (26 cycles in our model) and generates more QALYs (Fig.  4 ).\n\nThe estimates from this model show cost effectiveness of both HTM and NTS compared with UC in health care systems that pay more than \u20ac14,000/QALY. Nevertheless, comparing HTM with NTS, HTM is being dominated by NTS in all subgroup analyses except NYHA IV. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in the original scenario for all NYHA classes are \u20ac12,479 for HTM/UC and \u20ac8,270 for NTS/UC. In the current scenario, the central estimate for the ICER of HTM/UC stays the same and remains below the often-quoted upper limit for the WTP threshold of \u20ac20,000/QALY in the Netherlands  [29] , whereas it changes to \u20ac8,795 for NTS/UC in all NYHA classes. \u204e HTM is dominated by NTS.\n\nThe upper limit of our analysis is set at \u20ac80,000/QALY-proposed by the Council for Public Health and Health Care (Raad voor de Volksgezondheid en Zorg)-which is not a fixed threshold but a maximum at the range commonly used in economic evaluations  [29] . Fig.  5  We searched for similar modeling studies representing the Netherlands, but without success. We compared our results with those from international studies and found the study from the United States by Smith et al.  [30]  that ascertained that telephone support is an effective strategy in disease management, with improved survival of patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms when the ICERs were $67,784 and $95,721/QALY gained, respectively. A major difference with the methods we used was that we created a Markov model with full probabilistic analysis, whereas the authors of this US study used bootstrap resample to generate ICERs. Another Markov modeling study, carried out in the United Kingdom by Thokala et al.  [13] , compared telemonitoring and structured telephone support with UC, and found HTM to be a cost-effective strategy. Telemonitoring (TM) had an estimated ICER of \u00a311,873/QALY, whereas \"human-to-human\" telephone support (STS HH) had an ICER of \u00a3228,035/QALY. The same study found that \"the monthly cost of TM has to be higher than \u00a3390 to have an ICER greater than \u00a320,000/QALY against STS HH\"  [13] . The difference in results is significant, possibly because of the different methodologies used or the intervention implementation. A direct comparison of our results with other countries' calculations might be biased because of transferability issues  [31] .\n\nThe subgroup analysis revealed that HTM is more costeffective than NTS, compared with UC, in NYHA IV patients, that is, patients with the most severe cases of CHF. The PSA suggests that in countries willing to spend more than \u20ac40,000/QALY, HTM should be the first choice for tackling what are usually gravely ill patients who take up a significant amount of health care resources. Comparing our results with those of previously published studies, we discovered that a bootstrap analysis from the Netherlands (the Telemonitoring in Heart Failure (TEHAF) study) found that telemonitoring is a preferred intervention in patients with CHF in early stages of the disease and at \u20ac50,000/QALY or higher  [32] . 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 52 55 58 61 PERCENTAGE 4-MONTH CYCLES Survival of a cohort of 1000 patients (all NYHA) Home Tele Monitoring Nurse Telephone Support Usual care \u20ac 0 \u20ac 5,000,000 \u20ac 10,000,000 \u20ac 15,000,000 \u20ac 20,000,000 \u20ac 25,000,000 \u20ac 30,000,000 \u20ac 35,000,000 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 52 55 58 61 COSTS 4-MONTH CYCLES Discounted cumulative costs for 1000 patients (all NYHA) Home tele monitoring Nurse telephone support Usual care 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 52 55 58 61 QALYs 4-MONTH CYCLES Discounted cumulative QALYs for 1000 patients (all NYHA) Home tele monitoring Nurse telephone support Usual care\n\nFig.  3  -Survival, cumulative discounted costs, and effects for the cohort of 1000 patients: original scenario for all NYHA classes with treatment arm-independent hospitalization costs.

      "title": "Limitations, Generalizability, and Recommendations",
      "text": "As in any modeling exercise, our analysis has limitations, which are governed by data availability and related assumptions. We used 15-year-old data from the TEN-HMS study and derived information about patient satisfaction (i.e., utilities) and utilization of health care resources from it. In the meantime, several changes have occurred that have improved the prospects for successful implementation of telehealth: 1) more effective technology, 2) differentiated service offering, and 3) better embedding of telemonitoring technology in daily health care practice. The WSD trial reported on all three issues: telehealth being associated with lower mortality and emergency admission rates  [14] , each study site having a different supplier and service but not being designed to \"investigate the effect of individual service configurations or technologies\"  [12, 33] , and the necessity for services of this complexity to \"organically evolve, be responsive and adaptable to the local health and social care system, driven by support from front-line staff and management\"  [34] . Modern telemonitoring systems have significantly surpassed the technology used in the TEN-HMS study 15 years ago, in terms of both effectiveness and patient-related outcomes. Current telemonitoring implementation strategies might use more dynamic offerings. For instance, more recent concepts include a tiered approach for different patient groups or disease severities, with a step-up/step-down possibility. Even with improved accountability of the modern systems, 24/7 availability is not realistic, but we did not model the system downtimes and adverse effects.\n\nOur model does not compute these \"complications,\" and neither does it take into account time dependency. The building block of our Markov model is a 4-month period for which we calculate transitions and cost per QALY per LY contributions that have happened over the whole length of the TEN-HMS trial. Also, our model has not stratified the results by sex or age, and we have not modeled other possible consequences of CHF  [35] , nor a competing risk of death (e.g., multimorbidity).

For future research, social characteristics need to be considered in cost-effectiveness analysis given the importance of such factors for health status, access to health care, and the uptake of eHealth. Lack of evidence of the benefits of telemonitoring and telephone support in the long run (improved awareness, disease management skills, behavioral changes, etc.) may mean we have missed the effect of HTM and NTS on the [quality-of-life] weights, as we understand that \"the organizational benefits of telecare go beyond finance and capacity\"  [36(p6) ] and that they may become apparent only in the long run  [37] . The telemonitoring equipment and service costs range was chosen on the basis of the market research and is in the medium to medium-high ballpark (i.e., telehealth vs. telecare implantation strategy for telemonitoring). Therefore, the current estimation of the HTM/UC ICER can be considered slightly conservative and biased against telemonitoring.\n\nIn addition, the methods applied in the analysis have a number of limitations that need to be considered when assessing its relative generalizability. First, the perspective was that of a third-party payer and not a societal one and, as such, it excluded indirect costs and/or out-of-pocket direct costs incurred by the patient (inclusion of the productivity-related costs would be minimal, considering that the average baseline age for CHF is quite high). Taking these costs into account would likely increase the cost effectiveness of the HTM and the NTS strategies. We deviated from the pharmacoeconomic guidance, which states that a societal perspective is to be preferred  [19, 38] , because we were interested in the cost perspective of a health care organization trusted with implementation of these technologies in health care. Second, the data used in our analysis were derived from a single clinical study (which was run at 16 hospital sites), a potential limitation to the generalizability of our findings to other countries or health care systems. Also, the TEN-HMS study was inadequately powered to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of an adverse event in the subgroup analysis  [8] . The original study considered three countries in Europe, thus making it applicable to the EU in general, but bringing into question its applicability to the US context. Further research should compare patient characteristics and outcomes by location to explore whether any difference emerges from such analysis.\n\nAs indicated, technological evolution and new methods of providing telemonitoring have significantly improved the cost effectiveness of providing these services to a broader range of chronically ill patients. Consequently, we advise governments and other organizations that deal with the implementation of telemonitoring to consider HTM for patients with CHF in NYHA classes II-IV. NTS may also be an alternative; this, however, poses challenges in terms of making the necessary levels of staff available, because a larger number of patients need to be supported. Telephone support intervention is to be preferred over UC in health care systems that pay \u20ac9000/QALY or higher, but this is often difficult to set up because of problems in staffing, training, and logistics  [39] . Telemonitoring, on the other hand, is to be preferred for a broad range of acuity levels and not only for the most acute patients. The trade-off between the cost effectiveness and the potential to manage populations of different sizes will be explored in future research for both HTM and NTS."
