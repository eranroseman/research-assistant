  "title": "Systematic Review of Text-Messaging Interventions to Promote Healthy Behaviors in Pediatric and Adolescent Populations: Implications for Clinical Practice and Research",
  "abstract": "Background: Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are major public health problems. Promoting positive behavior change is an ongoing challenge that warrants innovative solutions. Mobile phone use is becoming widespread across populations and merits further exploration as a strategy to promote wellness and reduce health disparities. Aims: The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence using text messaging as a tool to deliver healthy lifestyle behavior intervention programs in pediatric and adolescent populations. The following question was used to guide the systematic review, \"In pediatric and adolescent populations, how does the \n use of text-message-based interventions versus control or comparison interventions affect healthy lifestyle behaviors?\" Methods: A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted in the following databases: MED-LINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, and by hand-searching bibliographies. Evidence was compiled from experimental studies in peer-reviewed journals published from 2004 to May 15, 2011. Data were extracted using guidelines set forth by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Results: Thirty-seven articles were identified from the comprehensive search. Eight articles representing seven studies (two articles were published describing different aspects of the outcomes from one study) met inclusion for this review. Mean age of participants in the study ranged from 8.7 to 17.9 years of age. Differences between groups on healthy lifestyle behaviors were significant in five studies. Conclusions: This review supports previous literature suggesting that mobile phones are uniquely positioned to bridge gaps in health disparities and reach across demographics. Interventions using short messaging service may be most effective as a reminder system to support disease management behaviors. Existing recommendations for tailored, interactive, and family-centered care are supported with mobile technology recommended to augment clinical practice and health behavior change efforts. However, more rigorous, theory-based intervention research using mobile technology is warranted in pediatric and adolescent populations.",

To promote healthy lifestyle behaviors, cost-effective tailored solutions are needed to intervene at opportune moments  (Fjelsdsoe et al. 2009; Heron & Smyth 2010) . Promoting positive behavior change is an ongoing challenge that warrants innovative solutions. With the emergence of smartphones and the surge of the mobile market in 2007, mobile phone use is becoming widespread across populations and merits further exploration as a strategy to promote wellness and reduce health disparities.\n\nAccording to the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Wireless Association (CTIA 2010), there are over 200 million cell phone users in the United States. Text messaging has steadily continued to increase as a form of communication. Text messages can be sent through short messaging service (SMS) consisting of approximately 160 characters or less or through multimedia messaging service to include text, images, or video. In December 2009, the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that US subscribers averaged 534 messages per subscriber per month, with 95% of 18-29-year olds and 82% of 30-49-year olds sending or receiving text messages  (Smith 2010) . Onethird of 13-17-year-old users said it was \"absolutely essential\" to have the latest and greatest cell phone for their purposes  (Smith 2010) .\n\nBecause of the rapid development and commercial nature, mobile research is difficult to summarize, leading to a number of studies published in the \"gray\" literature to include newspapers, commercially funded reports, and editorials  (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009) . Educational or reminder text messages have demonstrated the ability to reach mass numbers of recipients, quickly and cost effectively  (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009; Kharbanda et al. 2010 ). Yet, there is a paucity of scholarly literature available to support programs delivered through multimedia to influence behavior change  (Roberts et al. 1999; Wright et al. 2001; Wartella et al. 2005; Papastergiou 2009 ). Behavior change is defined as an action documented to lead to better health outcomes  (Krishna et al. 2009 ). Thus, a better understanding of mobile-based, natural setting, real-time interventions in psychosocial and health behavior change is needed  (Hernon & Smyth 2010) ."

Thirty-seven articles were identified from the comprehensive search. Eight articles representing seven studies met inclusion for this review (Table  1 ). One study was represented by two articles  (Franklin et al. 2006; Franklin et al. 2008) . The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (71%) with one randomized crossover design study  (Rami et al. 2006)  and one quasiexperimental study  (Miloh et al. 2009 ). Disease management studies targeted medication adherence in liver transplant patients and physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, and HgbA1c in type 1 diabetics. Health promotion studies aimed to increase physical activity and/or decrease screen time and sweetened beverage intake  (Shapiro et al. 2008; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) .

Study locations were diverse with three located within the United States (Boston, New York, and North Carolina) and one each in Scotland, New Zealand, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Samples were recruited from clinics in the disease management studies and from schools  (Sirriyeh et al. 2010)  or a variety of sources including letters to pediatricians and schools, media and a university listservs  (Shapiro et al. 2008)  for the health promotion studies. Mean age of participants in the studies ranged from 8.7 to 17.9 years. Age of participants in individual studies ranged from 5 to 27 years. Females were overrepresented in all but two studies  (Franklin et al. 2006; Rami et al. 2006 ) with percentage of females in individual studies ranging from 44% to 70%. Ethnicity was not reported in four studies, was 3% nonwhite in one study  (Franklin et al. 2006) , and was fairly diverse in two studies  (Shapiro et al. 2008; Miloh et al. 2009) ."

      "text": "Intervention length ranged from 2 to 52 weeks (mean = 23.14, SD = 20.8, median = 12). Follow-up for all of the studies was at pre-and postintervention except for the medication adherence trial in which participants served as their own control by analyzing serum medication levels and transplant rejection from the year before study involvement. Frequency of text messaging varied between daily in five studies and weekly in two studies  (Rami et al. 2006; Newton et al. 2009 ). Type of message included re-minders to do a particular behavior  (Franklin et al. 2006; Hanauer et al. 2009; Miloh et al. 2009; Newton et al. 2009; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) , feedback on participant behaviors/advice  (Rami et al. 2006; Shapiro et al. 2008; Hanauer et al. 2009) , and information or tips/advice  (Franklin et al. 2006; Hanauer et al. 2009) . Four studies allowed participants to set either the frequency and/or timing of the messaging  (Franklin et al. 2006; Rami et al. 2006; Shapiro et al. 2008; Miloh et al. 2009) . Two-way messages were provided in five of the studies  (Franklin et al. 2006; Rami et al. 2006; Shapiro et al. 2008; Hanauer et al. 2009; Miloh et al. 2009 ) and were unidirectional in two studies  (Newton et al. 2009; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) . All studies were designed to have the participants meet for either regularly scheduled clinic visits or face-to-face sessions. The number of intervention sessions or clinic visits varied between one and four.\n\nThe number of intervention groups varied among the studies. Miloh and colleagues (2009)  conducted a onegroup intervention in which participants received textmessage reminders to take antirejection medications after receiving a liver transplant. Outcomes were compared to the participants' own measures during the year before the study. Three studies had two groups  (Rami et al. 2006; Hanauer et al. 2009; Newton et al. 2009 ). Hanauer and colleagues (2009)  had two groups of diabetic patients receiving reminders to check their blood glucose either by SMS or e-mail. Newton and colleagues (2009)  had two groups of diabetic patients with the intervention group using a pedometer and receiving weekly motivational SMS and the control group receiving standard care. Rami and colleagues (2006)  conducted a two group crossover study for patients with diabetes with one group receiving telemedicine and text messaging to support management for 3 months and then 3 months of paper diary. The other group started with a paper diary for 3 months and then received the telemedicine and text messaging for 3 months. Two intervention studies had three groups. Shapiro and colleagues (2008)  assessed the impact of self-monitoring on healthful behaviors in three groups with one group monitoring by SMS, one group monitoring with traditional paper diary, and a control group not self-monitoring. Franklin and colleagues (2006)  developed an intervention called \"Sweet Talk\" to support young diabetics via SMS reminders and tips. Group 1 received conventional insulin therapy, Group 2 received conventional insulin therapy and \"Sweet Talk,\" and Group 3 received intensive insulin therapy and \"Sweet Talk.\" Sirriyeh and colleagues (2010)  assessed the impact of the type of message sent via SMS on physical activity levels in adolescents. Four groups participated with messages being either: (1) affective, (2) instrumental, (3) affective and instrumental, and (4) neutral. Five of the studies only included text messaging with one using text messaging and e-mail  (Hanauer et al. 2009 ) and one using telemedicine and text messaging  (Rami et al. 2006 ). All five disease management studies met with participants in regularly scheduled clinic visits. In the health promotion studies, three educational sessions were held in one trial  (Shapiro et al. 2008)  and only text messages occurred in the other  (Sirriyeh et al. 2010 ). The number of clinic visits or sessions varied between one and four. Two of the studies included a theory-based intervention  (Franklin et al. 2006; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) . Participation in the intervention could be quantified in five of the studies with four studies requesting information from the participant in the form of a text message  (Franklin et al. 2006; Shapiro et al. 2008; Hanauer et al. 2009 ) and one study assessed serum drug levels through blood draws  (Miloh et al. 2009 )."

One study collected serum drug levels up to eight times during the intervention and assessed rejection via needle biopsy once during the intervention  (Miloh et al. 2009 ). Significant differences between groups for the proposed health behavior were significant in five groups  (Franklin et al. 2006; Shapiro et al. 2008; Hanauer et al. 2009; Miloh et al. 2009; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) . Hanauer et al. (2009)  reported significantly more blood glucose monitoring for the text-messaging group versus an e-mail group. In the \"Sweet Talk\" study  (Franklin et al. 2006) , intensive insulin therapy plus text messaging re-sulted in significant diabetes self-efficacy (p = 0.003), selfreported adherence (p = 0.042), and perceived social support from medical team (p = 0.05). Miloh and colleagues (2009)  found significantly less rejection and risk for rejection after liver transplantation using text messaging to support children and families. Higher participant retention rates and self-monitoring of healthy lifestyle behaviors  (Shapiro et al. 2008)  as well as significant increases in energy expenditure  (Sirriyeh et al. 2010 ) also improved as outcomes. Four of the studies had outcomes that reached statistical significance  (Franklin et al. 2006; Hanauer et al. 2009; Miloh et al. 2009; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) . Two studies included a caregiver component with either a SMS message sent if initial reminder to take medication was not responded to or to send a daily SMS of behaviors of the child  (Shapiro et al. 2008; Miloh et al. 2009 )."

The first and second authors reviewed and discussed all 27 original items of the Downs and Black checklist and agreed on 12 criteria to assess the quality of the reporting for studies included in this review (Table  2 ). Examples of items removed from the original checklist include: (1) the reporting of the distribution of principal confounders, (2) the reporting of actual probability values, and (3) the reporting of results based on \"data dredging.\" The authors averaged 20-30 minutes to assess each paper.\n\nRandomization to groups was present in all but one study  (Miloh et al. 2009 ). This randomization was concealed in four of the studies  (Franklin et al. 2006; Rami et al. 2006; Newton et al. 2009; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) . Six studies included a comparison group with one study using participants as their own controls  (Miloh et al. 2009) . Only two studies included a comparison intervention that adequately controlled for attention  (Rami et al. 2006; Hanauer et al. 2009) . All studies used a pre-posttest design. As part of the criteria to determine quality of the interventions, attrition was reported or able to be determined in all studies and ranged from 0% to 47%. All group characteristics were reported at baseline and were equivalent. Three of the studies reported how they accounted for missing data  (Miloh et al. 2009; Newton et al. 2009; Sirriyeh et al. 2010) .

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The use of mobile phones in intervention research for children and adolescents is in its early stages as only seven studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Overall, most of the studies met two-thirds of the quality assessment indicators. Sample sizes were >100 in two of the studies suggesting studies going beyond assessment of feasibility. Only one of the three studies that focused on increasing physical activity showed significant differences although this was only a 2-week study that limits the ability to assess sustainability  (Sirriyeh et al. 2010) . This finding reinforces the challenge in increasing physical activity in youth. Only two studies reported a diverse population of study participants  (Shapiro et al. 2008; Miloh et al. 2009) , which limits generalizability of the interventions. Furthermore, only three of the reviewed studies  (Franklin et al. 2006; Shapiro et al. 2008; Sirriyeh et al. 2010 ) used theoretical frameworks to guide the intervention, limiting interpretation of which element in the intervention may be pivotal for findings. The findings from this review parallels previous literature and recommendations for future research to explicitly describe the theoretical constructs being targeted in interventions, as this will assist further testing and development of behavior change theory as it applies to this new medium  (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009) . Two of the disease management interventions  (Franklin et al. 2006; Miloh et al. 2009 ) were a year in length and both had significant positive clinical outcomes. Three of the studies  (Franklin et al. 2006; Hanauer et al. 2009; Miloh et al. 2009 ) focusing on disease management with reminders to check blood glucose and support insulin therapy in diabetics or reminders to take antirejection medications in liver transplant patients showed significant improvements in the outcome behavior and/or clinical outcome. Each of these studies employed two-way SMS interventions that were tailored to the individual participants. These findings support qualitative evidence that explored the role of text messaging in pediatric, adolescent, and parent populations  (Levine et al. 2008; Lim et al. 2008; Kharbanda et al. 2009; Gold et al. 2010; Woolford et al. 2010) . In these studies, tailored, \"personal\" options appeared most beneficial to the success of the program and the use of SMS was reported as desirable. Specifically,  Kharbanda and colleagues (2009)  reported that parental response to sample text messages was stronger if the child's name was used. Woolford and colleagues (2010)  indicated that parents thought daily message reminders were sufficient, but should be timed to parallel the behavior targeted (i.e., text message reminder in the morning if in regard to eating breakfast). This finding corresponds to previous research from  Heron and Smyth (2010)  on ecological momentary interventions, wherein the interventions are provided to people during their everyday lives (i.e., in real time) and in natural settings (i.e., real world). Franklin and colleagues (2006)  also employed the strategy of using informal SMS language, which may have contributed to significant study outcomes. Gold and colleagues (2010)  reported that in a sample of eight focus groups, gender specific (n = 21 males, 22 females; ages 16-24 years), there was a preference for messages that were positive, relevant, short, and used informal language. Levine et al. (2008)  also used more informal language (i.e., \"what 2 do if ur condom broke?\"). For more sensitive topics, such as sexual health, messages targeting teens with opt-in features seem promising  (Levine et al. 2008; Lim et al. 2008; Gold et al. 2010) .\n\nFitting with previous research  (Hutchfield 1999; Ward-Begnoche & Gance-Cleveland 2005; Larsen et al. 2006) , family-centered care should remain a central element of pediatric health care, yet only two studies included a family member in the intervention  (Shapiro et al. 2008; Miloh et al. 2009) . Text message interventions have been shown to be accepted in diverse population of urban parents  (Fjelsdsoe et al. 2009; Cole-Lewis & Kershaw 2010)  and preferred to mail or phone reminders  (Kharbanda et al. 2009) . As a qualitative whole, text messaging is recognized as a feasible and culturally acceptable way to disseminate health information in pediatric and adolescent populations.\n\nFrom this review, it is not known with certainty how effective mobile interventions are long term and how much reinforcement is needed to sustain health behavior change. This gap in research is similar to previous systematic reviews. Fjeldsoe et al. (2009)  reported on 14 studies representing international research using text-message-based interventions in a variety of populations (both pediatric and adult populations). Four of the 14 studies reviewed targeted preventive health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation) and 10 focused on clinical care (e.g., diabetes selfmanagement). The trend toward positive or documented significant findings, combined with already documented medium to large effect sizes  (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009) , corroborates the need to use text messaging as an adjunct to clinical care to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors. However, more research is needed to understand effects of textmessage interventions as a tool to sustain behavior change long term  (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009; Whittaker et al. 2009; Cole-Lewis & Kershaw 2010) ."

      "text": "Evidence generated from systematic reviews or metaanalyses of all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is Level I evidence and is the strongest level of evidence to support clinical practice decisions  (Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt 2011) . Based on this review, evidence using SMS to promote long-term behavior change is still unclear, yet worthy of continued exploration because of reach and mass appeal. This review supports previous literature  (Fjelsdsoe et al. 2009; Krishna et al. 2009; Cole-Lewis & Kershaw 2010; Heron & Smyth 2010)  suggesting that mobile phones are uniquely positioned to bridge gaps in health disparities and reach across demographics. Contrary to previous technologies, persons of low socioeconomic status and varying ethnicities have access to mobile technology. Mobile phone use is highest among those that are most likely to use mobiles phones as their primary means of communication, including those of socioeconomic disadvantaged populations, less educated adults, and those who rent or frequently change addresses  (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009) .\n\nThoughtful consideration to patient receptiveness and proficiency with mobile technology is prudent. Children and adolescents of today have grown up surrounded by multimedia. As documented  (Smith 2010) , younger populations are more comfortable with mobile technology. Children prefer tailored, technology-based, interactive programs versus more traditional paper diary programs  (Shapiro et al. 2008) . Therefore, interventions using these methods may be a more favorable adjunct to clinical care compared to traditional methods. With the growth of mobile technology, timely, tailored interventions may better fit with lifestyles than more traditional treatments  (Heron & Smyth 2010) . The appeal of tailored, user friendly interventions delivered by mobile phones seems to be an attractive option for both clinicians and patients, with documented short-term compliance.\n\nFurthermore, it is suggested that tailored, familycentered interventions are most likely to yield success when targeting routine health behaviors. The frequency of text messages sent widely varied across populations and targeted behaviors. Therefore, effective dosages of textbased interventions have yet to be determined. However, similar to previous research  (Fjeldsoe et al. 2009) , the dosage and timing of the SMS intervention appeared to parallel the targeted behavior.\n\nStandards regarding patient privacy and confidentiality must be upheld. To date, universal are not in place to support mobile health implementation. However, with the integration of electronic medical records, mobile and other technologies are likely to permeate clinical practice. As technology is integrated into clinical care, nurses and other health professionals are encouraged to stay abreast of institutional and organizational policies."

      "title": "Implications for Future Research",
      "text": "As mobile health continues to progress, future research that employs rigorous methods is needed to guide best practice. Significant gaps in the literature exist with regard to mobile-based interventions in pediatric and adolescent populations that warrant further exploration. Research using text messaging to promote health and wellness in pediatric populations is less developed. The potential for mobile-based adjuncts to clinical care, particularly in primary care settings where healthy lifestyle behaviors can be promoted, have yet to be explored. The results of such research are innovative and have the potential to transform clinical practice. To date, studies using text messaging tend to focus on health outcomes versus targeted behaviors, thus hindering the assessment of the interventions. The sparseness of scholarly literature stands in stark contrast to that of marketing and popular use of media by young children  (Wartella et al. 2005) . Further qualitative and quantitative research is needed to build knowledge and influence practice. Future randomized controlled trials should be conducted that assess both short-and long-term outcomes of the interventions as well as how much of a dose of the intervention is needed to sustain positive outcomes over time. Dosage may be specific to a given health behavior and population of interest. Cost outcomes of interventions also should be measured. In addition, it is important that future studies explore mediating variables to determine the process through which these interventions work along with assessing moderating variables that may impact the efficacy of the interventions. Finally, additional intervention components could be included in mobile-based interventions, such as education and skills building, which may add to the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention while continuing to be a low cost intervention."

      "text": "Mobile phones are an integral part of our daily lives and have the potential to transform health promotion efforts. The omnipresent nature, the broad range of capabilities, and the fluidity of use make mobile phones an attractive option for researchers and clinicians to deliver health behavior interventions  (Fogg & Eckles 2007; Fjeldsoe et al. 2009; Krishna et al. 2009) . Mobile phones are superior to other modes of technology-based interventions provided the broad range of users, diverse functions, and the ability to intercede at the most opportune moments. Text messaging is a quick, easy way to overcome barriers of time and access to reach populations most at risk for health disparities. As such, text messaging should be considered in conjunction with clinic care as a mode to target a variety of health behaviors. More rigorous, theory-based intervention research using mobile technology is needed to contribute to the growing body of knowledge and inform clinical practice."
