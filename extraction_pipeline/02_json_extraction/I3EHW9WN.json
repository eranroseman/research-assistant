  "title": "Motivational Interviewing and Dietary Counseling for Obesity in Primary Care: An RCT",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Few studies have tested the impact of motivational interviewing (MI) delivered by primary care providers on pediatric obesity. This study tested the efficacy of MI delivered by providers and registered dietitians (RDs) to parents of overweight children aged 2 through 8. METHODS: Forty-two practices from the Pediatric Research in Office Settings Network of the American Academy of Pediatrics were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 (usual care) measured BMI percentile at baseline and 1-and 2-year follow-up. Group 2 (provider only) delivered 4 MI counseling sessions to parents of the index child over 2 years. Group 3 (provider + RD) delivered 4 provider MI sessions plus 6 MI sessions from a RD. The primary outcome was child BMI percentile at 2-year follow up. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, the adjusted BMI percentile was 90.3, 88.1, and 87.1 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The group 3 mean was significantly (P = .02) lower than group 1. Mean changes from baseline in BMI percentile were 1.8, 3.8, and 4.9 across groups 1, 2, and 3. CONCLUSIONS: MI delivered by providers and RDs (group 3) resulted in statistically significant reductions in BMI percentile. Research is needed to determine the clinical significance and persistence of the BMI effects observed. How the intervention can be brought to scale (in particular, how to train physicians to use MI effectively and how best to train RDs and integrate them into primary care settings) also merits future research.",

The pediatric primary care office represents an important, underutilized source of intervention. There is a need to test the efficacy of motivational interviewing for pediatric obesity in primary care.\n\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is among the first large-scale randomized trials to show significant reductions in BMI and that motivational interviewing, delivered by trained providers in the primary care setting, can be an important and feasible part of addressing childhood obesity.\n\nRates of childhood obesity in the United States remain at historic highs.  1  Consensus exists that ameliorating childhood obesity rates in this country will require concerted intervention at multiple levels and in multiple settings.  2, 3 The pediatric primary care office represents an important, underutilized intervention channel, as children have regular contact with their primary care providers (PCPs) during grade school. Pediatricians believe that they should be involved in the detection, prevention, and treatment of childhood overweight/obesity.  4 merous family-based pediatric weight control interventions have been tested,  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  but most were conducted outside the primary care setting. Few have been conducted where the PCP delivered the core intervention.  7, [12] [13] 3] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Results of major outcome studies in primary care have not shown significant effects on BMI,  19  with 1 recent exception.  18 The latter study, conducted in Italy, comprised 5 PCP-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) sessions delivered to 372 overweight youth in primary care.\n\nCoordinated care models recommend that dietitians be engaged through primary care to provide more intensive dietary intervention.  3 In 2 studies in which registered dietitians (RDs) were included in the care team, positive effects on adiposity were reported.  6, 13 ll effects on adiposity in previous PCP counseling studies may be related to insufficient intervention delivery.  14, 15 Barriers to PCP counseling include lack of time and reimbursement.  4, 20, 21 Even more pivotal appears to be PCPs' perceived lack of counseling skills and the confidence to use those skills.  22 One approach to improving parent motivation and PCP counseling skills is MI.\n\nMI is a client-centered communication style used extensively to modify health behavior and is a recommended counseling style for pediatric obesity.  23, 24 However, its efficacy in treating pediatric obesity has been examined in only a few, generally small-scale studies,  13, 14, 18, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]  only 2 of which showed positive effects.  13, 18 There is a need to test the efficacy of MI for pediatric obesity in primary care in a fully powered trial. This 3-group study was designed to test the efficacy of moderate-intensity (4 sessions) PCP MI-based counseling and the effect of adding 6 MI-based counseling sessions by trained dietitians delivered to parents of overweight youth aged 2 to 8 years recruited through primary care offices."

      "text": "BMI 2 (Brief Motivational Interviewing to reduce Body Mass Index) was a cluster-randomized, 3-group intervention trial with clinical practices serving as the unit of randomization and analysis. Group 1 (usual care) measured BMI percentile at baseline and at 1-and 2-year follow-up and provided routine care by the PCP, as well as standard educational materials for parents. Usual care PCPs and their study staff attended a half-day orientation session that included current treatment guidelines.  24, 31 Group 2 (PCP only) included the same assessment points as group 1. In addition, group 2 PCPs received 2 days of in-person training in MI and behavior therapy led by the first author as well as an interactive MI DVD training system focusing on pediatric obesity developed for this study. PCPs in group 2 were asked to schedule 3 counseling sessions with a parent of the index child in year 1 and 1 additional \"booster\" visit in year 2, although they were given latitude in their appointment scheduling. Group 3 (PCP+RD) included the same intervention components as group 2 but added MI-based counseling from a trained RD who was linked to the practice. RDs were asked to deliver 6 MI-based counseling sessions over 2 years. RDs were given flexibility in scheduling counseling sessions, although again they were encouraged to provide more visits toward the beginning of the intervention. The RD sessions were delivered either in-person or by telephone. Similar to PCPs, RDs received 2 days of in-person MI and behavior therapy training and the MI DVD.\n\nEthics approval was obtained from the University of Michigan and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Most PROS (Pediatric Research in Office Settings) practices (n = 38) operated under the AAP Institutional Review Board, whereas the remaining practices (n = 4), obtained local institutional review board approval. All parents gave written informed consent for their and their child's participation."

This person attended the protocol training.\n\nAll practices were asked to enroll at least 20 and up to 25 eligible children. Given the higher rates of overweight and obesity in minority children, we oversampled practices with at least 25% black and/or Hispanic patients. PROS sites were matched on race and urban/suburban status, whenever possible, and then randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment arms.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Overweight children, whose parents received MI counseling from their PCPs supplemented by RD counseling, showed a significant reduction in BMI percentile over 2 years compared with children whose parents received usual care. The net difference in BMI reduction between these 2 groups was 3.1 BMI percentile units. This is among the first counseling interventions using MI and delivered in primary care to yield significant effects on adiposity.  14, 15, 18, 19 The 1 previous positive MI study in primary care yielded a 0.3 net effect on raw BMI, whereas our net effect on raw BMI between usual care and groups 2 and 3 was 0.4 and 0.6 BMI units, respectively; their positive results were limited to girls.  18 The larger effects herein may be because that study used only PCPs to deliver the MI intervention, whereas our study also used RD counseling.\n\nThe group that received only the PCP counseling in our study showed a net difference of 2.0 BMI percentile units compared with usual care; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Whereas a 2.0 percentile reduction in BMI may confer health benefits, there are no published studies that have specifically examined the clinical impact of this size change.\n\nIn general, PCPs in both groups 2 and 3 delivered most of the recommended dose of MI counseling. The mean MI session completion rates for PCPs in groups 2 and 3 were 3.4 and 3.3 (out of 4), respectively. However, intervention completion by RDs was less successful. Out of the expected 6 RD sessions, the mean number completed was only 2.7 (out of 6). Dose-response analyses suggest that even larger effects on BMI might have been achieved had either the PCP or RD counseling been delivered at a higher rate.\n\nInability of RDs to complete their counseling sessions was likely due to several factors. At study's end, we interviewed 7 of the project RDs.\n\nAlthough RDs attempted to reach parents during the evening, parents were often too busy with family responsibilities. Anecdotal data from parents also indicted that scheduling difficulties limited their ability to complete the RD counseling. Several RDs noted that their PCPs did not share their counseling summaries, and RDs did not feel fully integrated into the care team. RDs were added to the practice solely for this study and, unlike the PCPs, were not treating their own patients. They also felt some PCPs did not adequately encourage patients to participate in the RD counseling.\n\nOne somewhat surprising finding was the relatively large BMI reduction in the usual care group: 1.7 BMI units. A few factors likely contributed to usual care response. First, the study attracted PCPs who had an interest in pediatric obesity and MI. Consequently, we recruited practitioners who were motivated to treat their overweight patients and improve their counseling skills. Usual care practitioners, based on a baseline provider survey, were younger than those in the 2 intervention arms combined: 48 vs 54 years, respectively. They were more likely to be women: 80% compared with 70% among group 2 and 3 practitioners. Finally, they were more likely to perceive their weight management counseling as effective. Debriefing interviews also found that some practices added an RD to their staff during the trial, and others noted that their patients were motivated to lose weight \"to make their doctor look good.\" Together these factors at least partially explain the higher than anticipated usual care group changes.\n\nAlthough the effects on BMI observed in group 2 were slightly better than the usual care group, they were not statistically significant. The policy and practice implications of this finding are somewhat unclear. Had the usual care group exhibited the degree of change we expected, then these effects would have achieved statistical significance. Thus, it is possible that the PCP intervention alone, perhaps with slightly increased dose, merits further exploration.\n\nWe lost \u223c30% of the baseline sample.\n\nAlthough this was in the anticipated range of attrition and consistent with previous studies,  42  the fact that those lost to follow-up differed on several demographic variables (eg, race, income, and education) limits generalizability. The less-thananticipated completion of the RD counseling complicates interpretation of our results. Although completer analyses suggest that a higher dose might yield greater BMI response, such analyses are potentially confounded. Reverse causality may explain the effects among completers (ie, those families doing better may have been more likely to participate in the RD calls). Another generalizability issue is that we only enrolled PROS practices that had previously completed a research protocol. How our findings generalize to other PROS practices and the general pediatric profession merits study. There was no attention control for the MI counseling. Thus, we cannot discern whether the effects observed in groups 2 and 3 were due to generic attention effects rather than MI per se. CONCLUSIONS This is among the first large-scale trials to show statistically significant reductions in BMI by using MI delivered by PCPs and RDs. Research is needed to determine the clinical significance and persistence of the BMI effects observed. Given the relatively modest dose, the intervention appears to have considerable dissemination potential, which can be explored in future studies. How the intervention can be brought to scale (in particular, how to train physicians to effectively use MI and how best to train RDs and integrate them into primary care settings) merits future research. a national practice-based research network: comparing pediatric research in office settings with the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

Attrition in paediatric weight management: a review of the literature and new directions. Obesity Rev. 2011;12(5):e273-e281\n\nCUDDLY CUDDLERS: My wife and I have been married a long time (\"forever and a day,\" as she likes to say) and we tend to snuggle a lot. While watching TV, before sleep, or even first thing in the AM, we like to cuddle. It seems that lots of adults like to cuddle but do not always have someone around to cuddle them. As reported in The Wall Street Journal (A-Hed, January 8, 2015), cuddling services have sprung up around the country to address that problem. One can now hire professionals to cuddle for a fixed rate. Professional cuddlers charge approximately 60-80 dollars an hour and 400 dollars a night, and generally use poses or positions described in a book called \"The Cuddle Sutra.\" While people have always cuddled, the industry got its start in the U.S. approximately 5 years ago when a former psychology studentfrustrated by restrictions against touch between therapists and their clientsstarted a cuddle business. Since then, interest has exploded, and now there are websites where members can swap information and find others interested in non-sexual cuddling. An app allows users to find people near them interested in cuddling. There are even plans for a cuddling convention. To date, professional cuddlers are not licensed but they must follow local ordinances regarding businesses in residential properties. While professional cuddlers are strictly platonic, enforce clothes on policies, diagram what parts of the body can or cannot be touched, and even insist on personal grooming before cuddling, not everyone is excited about the business. Since the businesses are often in private residences, neighbors sometimes worry about attracting unsavory clientele. As for me, I am happy to report that I have no need to hire a professional cuddler. My wife is doing a great job.\n\nNoted by WVR, MD"
