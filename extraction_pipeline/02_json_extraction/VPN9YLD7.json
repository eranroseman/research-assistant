  "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in medical applications but are hindered by limited specialized medical knowledge. We present Me-LLaMA, a family of open-source medical LLMs integrating extensive domain-specific knowledge with robust instruction-following capabilities. Me-LLaMA is developed through continual pretraining and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 models using diverse biomedical and clinical data sources (e.g., biomedical literature and clinical notes). We evaluated Me-LLaMA on six text analysis tasks using 12 benchmarks (e.g., PubMedQA and MIMIC-CXR) and assessed its clinical utility in complex case diagnosis through automatic and human evaluations. Me-LLaMA outperforms existing open medical LLMs in zero-shot and supervised settings and surpasses ChatGPT and GPT-4 after task-specific instruction tuning for most text analysis tasks. Its performance is also comparable to ChatGPT and GPT-4 for diagnosing complex clinical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of combining domain-specific continual pretraining with instruction tuning to enhance performance in medical LLMs. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in improving medical applications such as clinical documentation, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care management 1-3 . However, general-domain LLMs often lack specialized medical knowledge because they are primarily trained on nonmedical datasets 4 , limiting their effectiveness in healthcare settings. Although commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 4 , offer advanced capabilities, their closed-source nature restricts the flexible customization and accessibility required for medical use. This limitation has spurred the research towards developing open-source LLMs such as LLaMA  5, 6  ; Yet these models still fall short due to their general-domain training  [7] [8] [9]  . To address these challenges, researchers have explored strategies to develop domain-specific LLMs for the medical domain. Instruction finetuning of general-domain models, as seen in MedAlpaca 3 , ChatDoctor 10 , and AlpaCare 11 , attempts to enhance medical capabilities but is limited by the base models' lack of specialized knowledge; instruction fine-tuning alone cannot compensate for this deficiency. Training models from scratch using medical corpora, exemplified by GatorTronGPT 8 , overcomes this limitation but demands substantial computational resources and time. A more costeffective alternative is continual pretraining, enabling models to acquire specialized medical knowledge while leveraging existing model architectures; notable examples include PMC-LLaMA 2 , Meditron 9 , and Clinical LLaMA 12 . Despite these advances, existing LLMs of continual pretraining in the medical domain exhibit notable limitations: (1) Although both domain knowledge and instruction-following capabilities are crucial, only PMC-LLaMA 2 has combined continual pretraining with instruction fine-tuning, revealing a gap in leveraging the synergy between these two aspects. (2) Only one model (Clinical LLaMA) used clinical notes from electronic health records, which is crucial for real-world clinical applications as it provides context-specific information from direct patient care. None of the existing models used both biomedical literature and clinical notes, which is one of the goals of this project. (3) Due to the limited medical datasets utilized for model development, these models still lack essential domain knowledge, which hampers their effectiveness.",

      "text": "clinical notes, we generated the largest biomedical pre-training dataset (129B tokens), compared to the previous efforts (i.e., 79B tokens in PMC-LLaMA as the highest). (  4 ) Evaluations have predominantly centered on medical question-answering (QA) tasks, lacking comprehensive assessments on the generalizability of those foundation models across diverse medical tasks.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we present Me-LLaMA, a novel family of open-source medical large language models that uniquely integrate extensive domain-specific knowledge with robust instruction-following capabilities. Me-LLaMA comprises foundation models (Me-LLaMA 13B and 70B) and their chat-enhanced versions, developed through comprehensive continual pretraining and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 6 models. Leveraging an extensive medical dataset-combining 129 billion pretraining tokens and 214,000 instruction samples from scientific literature, clinical guidelines, and electronic health record clinical notes-Me-LLaMA excels across a wide spectrum of medical text analysis and real-world clinical tasks. Prior studies  2, 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]  have primarily focused on evaluating the QA task. For example, PMC-LLaMA  2  and Meditron 9 evaluated their model performance on medical QA tasks derived from domain-specific literature, while MedAlpaca  3  and ChatDoctor  10  focused on conversational QA. In contrast, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation covering six critical tasksquestion answering, relation extraction, named entity recognition, text classification, text summarization, and natural language inference-across twelve datasets from both biomedical and clinical domains. Our results demonstrate that Me-LLaMA not only surpasses existing open-source medical LLMs in both zero-shot and supervised settings but also, with taskspecific instruction tuning, outperforms leading commercial LLMs such as ChatGPT on seven out of eight datasets and GPT-4 on five out of eight datasets. Furthermore, to evaluate Me-LLaMA's potential clinical utility, we assessed the models on complex clinical case diagnosis tasks, comparing their performance with other commercial LLMs using both automatic and human evaluations. Our findings indicate that Me-LLaMA's performance is comparable to that of ChatGPT and GPT-4, despite their substantially larger model sizes.\n\nOur findings underscore the importance of combining domainspecific continual pretraining with instruction tuning to develop effective large language models for the medical domain. Recognizing the significant resources required, we have publicly released our Me-LLaMA models on PhysioNet under appropriate Data Use Agreements (DUAs) to lower barriers and foster innovation within the medical AI community. Alongside the models, we provide benchmarks and evaluation scripts on GitHub to facilitate further development. We anticipate that these contributions will benefit researchers and practitioners alike, advancing this critical field toward more effective and accessible medical AI applications."

      "text": "Overall performance of medical text analysis Table  1  compares the performance of our Me-LLaMA 13/70B foundation models against other open LLMs in the supervised setting. The performance of Meditron 70B on the PubMedQA, MedQA, and MedMCQA datasets is cited from the meditron paper to have a fair comparison. We can observe that the Me-LLaMA 13B model surpassed the similar-sized medical foundation model PMC-LLaMA 13B on 11 out of 12 datasets and outperformed the general foundation model LLaMA2 13B on 10 out of 12 datasets. Moreover, it is noticed that the Me-LLaMA 13B model was competitive with LLaMA2 70B and Meditron 70B, which have significantly larger parameter sizes, on 8 out of 12 datasets. As for 70B models, Me-LLaMA 70B achieved the best performance on 9 out of 12 datasets, when benchmarked against LLaMA2 70B and Meditron 70B.\n\nTable  2  shows the zero-shot performance of Me-LLaMA chat models and other instruction-tuned open LLMs with chat ability on various tasks. Among 13B models, Me-LLaMA 13B-chat outperformed LLaMA2 13B-chat, PMC-LLaMA-chat, Medalpaca 13B in almost all 12 datasets. Me-LLaMA outperformed AlpaCare-13B in 9 out of 12 datasets. Among models with 70B parameters, Me-LLaMA 70B-chat consistently outperformed LLaMA2-70B-chat on 11 out of 12 datasets. It is worth noting that Me-LLaMA13B-chat showed better performance than LLaMA2-70B-chat-a model with a significantly larger parameter size-on 6 out of 12 datasets and was competitive with the LLaMA2-70B-chat in 3 out of 6 remaining datasets.\n\nFigure  1  further compares the performance of Me-LLaMA models in the zero-shot and supervised learning setting, against ChatGPT and GPT-4. Due to privacy concerns, which preclude the transmission of clinical datasets with patient information to ChatGPT and GPT-4, we conducted our comparison across 8 datasets that are not subject to these limitations. The results of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on three QA datasets are referenced from the OpenAI's    https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01533-1\n\nand zero-shot learning across a broad spectrum of medical tasks, underscoring its efficiency and potential in the field."

We can see Me-LLaMA-70B-chat model achieved comparable performance with GPT-4 and ChatGPT and significantly outperforms LLaMA2-70B-chat. The human evaluation result in Fig.  3  again shows that Me-LLaMA-70B-chat outperformed GPT-4 in both top-1 and top-5 accuracy. These results demonstrated the potential of Me-LLaMA models for challenging clinical applications."

      "title": "Impact of continual pretraining and instruction tuning",
      "text": "Table 3 demonstrates the impact of continual pre-training and instruction tuning on zero-shot performance across medical NLP tasks. It clearly demonstrates that both continual pre-training and instruction tuning significantly enhanced the zero-shot capabilities of models. Instruction tuning alone provides significant performance improvements over the base LLaMA2 models, as seen in LLaMA2 13B, where accuracy on PubMedQA increases from 0.216 to 0.436. This suggests that instruction tuning is highly effective in enhancing the model's ability to follow task-specific prompts. In contrast, continual pre-training on medical data yields relatively modest improvements, particularly for smaller models. Me-LLaMA 13B shows only slight gains over LLaMA2 13B, likely due to the smaller scale of domain-specific pre-training data compared to LLaMA2's original training corpus, which exceeds 2 T tokens. Additionally, continual pre-training may not provide as strong of a task-specific signal as instruction tuning, limiting its impact in zero-shot settings. However, for larger models like Me-LLaMA 70B, continual pre-training results in more notable improvements, with performance gains ranging from 2.1% to 55% across various datasets, demonstrating its value in capturing specialized domain knowledge. The best results are consistently achieved when both continual pre-training and instruction tuning are applied together, as seen in Me-LLaMA-70B-chat, which outperforms all other configurations. This indicates that while instruction tuning is the most efficient approach for improving task performance, continual pre-training provides a complementary boost, particularly for larger models where additional domain adaptation enhances overall effectiveness."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "We introduced a novel medical LLM family including, Me-LLaMA 13B and Me-LLaMA 70B, which encode comprehensive medical knowledge, along with their chat-optimized variants: Me-LLaMA-13/70B-chat, with strong zero-shot learning ability, for medical applications. These models were developed through the continual pre-training and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 models, using the largest and most comprehensive biomedical and clinical data. Compared to existing studies, we perform the most comprehensive evaluation, covering six critical text analysis tasks. Our evaluations reveal that Me-LLaMA models outperform existing open-source medical LLMs in various learning scenarios, showing less susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting and achieving competitive results against major commercial models including ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our work paves the way for more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive medical LLMs, and underscores the potential of LLMs on medical applications. Despite these strengths, we observed certain challenges in specific tasks, such as NER and RE  14, 15  , where even advanced models like GPT-4 exhibited low performance. When compared with other NLP tasks with higher performance, we noticed that one of the main reasons for low performance is that LLMs' responses often lacked the conciseness and precision expected, with instances of missing outputs noted. The unexpected outputs also cause significant challenges to automatic evaluation metrics. Therefore, more investigation is needed to further improve medical LLMs' performance across tasks in the zero-shot setting and enhance the automatic assessment of these medical LLMs' zero-shot capabilities. For the complex clinical case diagnosis, the Me-LLaMA-chat model had competitive performance and even outperformed GPT-4 in human evaluation. Existing studies have demonstrated GPT-4 is arguably one of the strongest LLMs in this task  16  . The robust performance of Me-LLaMA showed potential in assisting challenging clinical applications. It is noticed that variations in test sizes and evaluation methods across different studies contribute to the observed differences in performance between GPT-4 in our paper and other studies. We also noted that both the Me-LLaMA-chat model and GPT-4 faced difficulties identifying the correct diagnosis within the top ranks, underscoring the difficulty of this task. Additionally, while the NEJM CPCs offer a rigorous test for these models, they do not encompass the full range of a physician's duties or broader clinical competence. Therefore, complex clinical diagnosis remains a challenging area that demands more effective models and improved evaluation benchmarks to better capture the complexities of real-world clinical scenarios.\n\nOur results also emphasize the importance of data diversity during model development. Our empirical results revealed that the PMC-LLaMA 13B model, which employed a data mix ratio of 19:1 between medical and general domain data, exhibited around 2.7% performance drop across both general and biomedical tasks. On the other hand, the Meditron models, 7B,   https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01533-1\n\nand 70B, with a 99:1 mix ratio, demonstrated improvements in biomedical tasks, yet they still saw around 1% declines in the performance of general tasks. In contrast, our models, which adopt a 4:1 ratio, have shown enhancements in their performance for both general and medical tasks. This suggests that the integration of general domain data plays a vital role in mitigating the knowledge-forgetting issue during pre-training  2, 9  . However, determining the optimal balance between general domain data and specialized medical data is nontrivial, requiring careful empirical analysis. Future studies should examine methods to better determine the optimal ratio.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of instruction tuning is another important consideration. Pre-training, exemplified by the LLaMA2 70B model, is notably resource-heavy, requiring about 160*700 GPU hours per epoch. Conversely, instruction tuning is far less resource-demanding, needing roughly 8*70 GPU hours per epoch, making it much more affordable than pre-training. While continual pre-training aims to incorporate specialized medical knowledge into the model, the observed performance improvements, particularly for smaller models like Me-LLaMA 13B, are relatively modest. This limited improvement can be attributed to several factors. First, the amount of domain-specific pre-training data used is significantly smaller compared to the original pre-training data of LLaMA2, which exceeds 2 T tokens. This discrepancy suggests that larger amounts of domain-specific data may be required to fully activate the model's potential. Second, the continual pre-training strategy itself could be optimized further. As noted earlier, the process faces challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general-domain knowledge during adaptation to specialized data. Despite this, models trained only with the instruction tuning demonstrate that instruction tuning alone can significantly enhance performance at a fraction of the computational cost. This highlights instruction tuning as a practical and cost-effective alternative, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are limited.\n\nThe Me-LLaMA models, available in both 13B and 70B sizes, as well as in base and chat-optimized versions, enable a wide array of medical applications, guided by the crucial balance between model size and resource availability. The base models provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning on specialized tasks, while the chat-optimized versions excel in instruction-following and zero-shot scenarios. Larger models, like the 70B, deliver superior reasoning capabilities but require significant computational resources, making the 13B models a practical alternative for broader accessibility. Notably, the Me-LLaMA 13B model achieves performance comparable to its 70B counterpart across most datasets, demonstrating its utility for diverse medical tasks in resource-limited settings. These features suggest that Me-LLaMA models could be explored for various medical applications. Potential areas of use include: (1) clinical decision support, where these models might assist in analyzing patient records, generating differential diagnoses, and synthesizing medical literature to support evidence-based decision-making; (2) medical education, where chatoptimized versions could serve as interactive tools for teaching medical students and trainees by providing explanations for complex medical topics and simulating diagnostic reasoning; and (3) administrative tasks, where these models may help streamline workflows by summarizing clinical notes and generating discharge summaries, potentially reducing the documentation burden on clinicians. Further research and evaluation are warranted to assess Me-LLaMA's real-world effectiveness and limitations in these clinical application settings.\n\nDespite these advancements, it is crucial to acknowledge the current Me-LLaMA models still have certain limitations that require further attention. Like all existing LLMs, they are susceptible to generating information with factual errors or biased information. To mitigate this, future studies could incorporate methodologies like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)  17  . This approach could align the models' responses more closely with human values and ensure they are grounded in factual medical knowledge. Another limitation is the current token handling capacity, capped at 4096 tokens, which is a constraint inherited from the backbone LLaMA2 model. Addressing this limitation could involve extending the models' capability to handle longer contexts. This could be achieved by integrating advanced attention techniques, such as sparse local attention  18  , that are able to handle extensive contexts.\n\nAdditionally, while MIMIC is the largest publicly available EHR dataset, its size is still relatively small compared to other data sources, which Haven Health and the University of Florida Health. However, the terms of distribution and dissemination for models trained on such proprietary data will need to be carefully negotiated with our institutions' data governance committees to ensure the safety and confidentiality of clinical data."

We employed the AdamW optimizer with hyperparameters set to \u03b2 1 to 0.9 and \u03b2 2 to 0.95, alongside a weight decay of 0.00001 and a learning rate of 8e-6. We used a cosine learning rate scheduler with a 0.05 warmup ratio for gradual adaptation to training complexity and bf16 precision for computational efficiency. Gradient accumulation was set to 16 steps, and training was limited to one epoch. We utilized DeepSpeed 24 for model parallelism.\n\nWe further fine-tuned Me-LLaMA base models to develop Me-LLaMA chat models, using the developed 214k instruction samples. In this phase, the models are trained to produce accurate and contextually appropriate responses to specific input instructions. Executed using 8 A100 GPUs, the fine-tuning process was set to run for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5. We used a weight decay of 0.00001 and a warmup ratio of 0.01 for regularization and gradual learning rate increase. We utilized LoRAbased  25  parameter-efficient fine-tuning."

      "text": "Existing studies  2, 3, 9  in the medical domain have primarily focused on evaluating the QA task. In this study, we build an extensive medical evaluation benchmark (MIBE), encompassing six critical text analysis tasks: QA, NER, RE, Text Classification, Text Summarization and NLI. These tasks collectively involve 12 datasets meticulously sourced from biomedical, and clinical domains as shown in Table  6 .\n\nWe further assessed the effectiveness of Me-LLaMA in diagnosing complex clinical cases, a critical task given the increasing burden of diseases and the need for timely and accurate diagnosis to support clinicians. Recent studies demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to address this challenge  26  . Specifically, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Me-LLaMA on 70 challenging medical cases from the New England Journal of Medicine clinicopathologic conferences (NEJM CPCs) published between January 2021 and December 2022, as collected from an existing study  27  . The NEJM CPCs are well-known for their unique and intricate clinical cases, which have long been used as benchmarks for evaluating challenging medical scenarios. In line with previous research  26, 27  , we employed automatic evaluations based on top-K (where k = 1,2,3,4,5) accuracy, defined as the percentage of cases where the correct diagnosis appeared within the top-K positions of the differential diagnosis list predicted by the assessed models. We utilized GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM, to automatically assess"
