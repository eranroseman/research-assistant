  "title": "Statistical models for the analysis of skewed healthcare cost data: a simulation study",
  "abstract": "Skewed data is the main issue in statistical models in healthcare costs. Data transformation is a conventional method to decrease skewness, but there are some disadvantages. Some recent studies have employed generalized linear models (GLMs) and Cox proportional hazard regression as alternative estimators. The aim of this study was to investigate how well these alternative estimators perform in terms of bias and precision when the data are skewed. The primary outcome was an estimation of population means of healthcare costs and the secondary outcome was the impact of a covariate on healthcare cost. Alternative estimators, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) for Ln(y) or Log(y), Gamma, Weibull and Cox proportional hazard regression models, were compared using Monte Carlo simulation under different situations, which were generated from skewed distributions. We found that there was not one best model across all generated conditions. However, GLMs, especially the Gamma regression model, behaved well in the estimation of population means of healthcare costs. The results showed that the Cox proportional hazard model exhibited a poor estimation of population means of healthcare costs and the \u03b2 1 even under proportional hazard data. Approximately results are consistent by increasing the sample size. However, increasing the sample size could improve the performance of the OLS-based model.",

      "text": "Statistical models are often used in many healthcare economics and policy studies. The main issues in such studies are the estimation of mean population healthcare costs and finding the best relationship between costs and covariates through regression modeling  [1] . However, these cannot be implemented by simple statistical models as the healthcare costs data have specific characterizations  [2] . Healthcare costs data demonstrate the substantial positive skewness and are sometimes characterized by the use of large resources with zero cost  [3] . These specifications of data impose a number of difficulties in using standard statistical analysis, such as implementing linear regression causes unreliable results  [2] .\n\nTwo-part models based on mixture models are performed when excess zeroes are present in data  [3] . Further, logarithmic (or other) transformations are commonly used to decrease the skewness and drive them close to normal distribution, in order to implement linear regression models. The logarithmic transformation with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a very common approach in applied economics. However, it also presents several drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that the predictions are not robust enough to detect the heteroscedasticity in the transformed scale  [1, 4] . The general consensus is that estimating the mean cost using a logarithmic regression model leads to biased estimation  [2, [4] [5] [6] .\n\nAn alternative approach is using nonlinear regression models, of which exponential conditional mean (ECM) models in generalized linear models (GLMs) are examples  [7] . Generally, GLMs extend the linear modeling framework to allow response variables that are not normally distributed. In healthcare studies, generalized linear modeling through log-link function avoids the weakness and problems of OLS regression. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model has been a controversial issue for healthcare data modeling. It has been used as a special flexible model for skewed healthcare data in many studies  [8, 9] . In recent years, extensive research efforts have been done to propose suitable regression methods for the analysis of skewed healthcare data  [1, 3, 10, 11] . Many studies also set out a clear framework for comparing these methods from a variety of aspects  [5, 6, 12, 13] . Moreover, a few have provided prominent reviews of the statistical methods for analyzing healthcare data  [2, 7] .\n\nHowever, there is no comparative study that investigates the different methods using different sample sizes. This paper was conducted to compare the proposed statistical models in the available literature using different sample sizes. We specifically focused on comparing proposed statistical models for positive skewed healthcare costs, but not zero mass problems. It was developed based on a Monte Carlo simulation to find appropriate methods to get the unbiased and precise estimates of the mean costs. This aspect is particularly important in the literature  [5, 13] . Furthermore, in this paper, the coefficient estimations of covariates are also evaluated in our simulations using different sample sizes."

The first was the mean prediction error (MPE), which measures the bias and predictive accuracy, and the second was the mean absolute prediction error (MAPE):\n\nActually, MPE indicates how the mean of predicted healthcare expenditures from a particular model compares with the mean of healthcare costs. Models with lower values of MPE have smaller biases than models with higher values. However, MAPE indicates how values of individual predicted healthcare expenditures from a particular model compare with values of actual healthcare expenditures in the sample  [6] .\n\nMean square of error (MSE) and 95% confidence interval of the estimate of \u03b2 1 coefficient were calculated to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the estimated parameter. A more precise estimator should be closer to the true value. A Goodness of fit test provided by Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the Akaike information criteria (AIC) used as an aid to choosing between competing models. Lower values of the AIC indicate the preferred model criterion were also used to evaluate. The mean of the residuals across deciles of x was also plotted in order to assess a systematic bias in the predictions."

      "text": "Mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis for the y in various data-generating mechanisms are presented in Table  1 . Based on this result, the log-normal and Weibull models provided greater skewness than the Gamma model. It should be noted that the skewness of data from the log-normal and Gamma models increased monotonically as the sample size increased.\n\nThe results in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were based on 10,000 times batch replication, in sample sizes of 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000, respectively. These tables show the results of the estimates of population means and \u03b2 1 for each model under the various data-generating processes. Minimum deviance (MPE) and absolute deviance (MAPE) of predicting the value of the response variable (health-care costs) considered as adequacy of methods.\n\nGenerally, entire models exhibited lower MPE by declining skewness and increasing sample size. However, the Gamma regression model had the smallest biases across all data-generating processes. Moreover, our results indicated that its ability to predict the expenditures in a small sample size was as good as for large sample sizes. Furthermore, OLS for Ln(y) and Weibull regression models showed a lower bias than the Cox proportional hazard model, even in proportional hazard data-generating process (Figure  1 ). a b c Figure 6 Mean residual from different estimators across deciles of 'X' for Weibull data (n=50) with shape parameter a: 0.5, b: 1, c: 5.\n\nIn addition, evaluating MAPE as an accuracy measure showed that Gamma and Weibull regression models have almost equal MAPE values. In many conditions, such as the log-normal model with \u03c3 2 = 1.5, 2, the Gamma model with shape equal to 0.5 (monotonically declining pdf ) and the Weibull model with shape equal to 0.5 (linearly increasing hazard), as higher skewness data-generating mechanisms, the MAPE from Weibull regression model was always lower than Gamma regression model.\n\nInterestingly, as the sample size increased, the MAPE of OLS for Ln(y) became very similar to that of the Gamma regression model. However, the MAPE of all models had an insignificant upward trend as the sample size increased.\n\nSince there was also a concern about consistency and precision in the estimates of \u03b2 1 coefficients, MSE and 95% simulation intervals were investigated. All three regression Gamma and Weibull and OLS for Ln(y) models provided approximately similar MSEs of \u03b2 1 as data generated using log normal. However, the Gamma regression model showed minimum MSE values. We also found that MSE decreased by reducing skewness and increasing sample size. For the Weibull-generated data, Gamma and Weibull regression models exhibited similar and minimum values of MSE. Under all data-generating mechanisms, 95% simulation intervals were closer to true values in all three regression models. Surprisingly, the Cox proportional hazard model revealed maximum MSE and less accurate 95% simulation intervals, even within proportional hazards data-generating scenario.\n\nComparison goodness of fit tests (Hosmer-Lemeshow test and AIC criterion) revealed that, under a different range of data conditions, Gamma and Weibull regression models were better behaved. Finally, investigation of the pattern of the residuals as a function of X, which have been implemented by the mean of the residuals across deciles of X, showed more bias for the Cox proportional hazard model across all generated data and sample sizes (see Figures  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 )."
