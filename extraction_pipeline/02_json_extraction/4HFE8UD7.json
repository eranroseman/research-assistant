  "abstract": "Background: Information and communications technology (ICT)-based tailored management (TM) intervention is a novel automatic system in which smartphone application for management of hypertensive and diabetic patients, the provider web, and Bluetooth devices are linked. However, little evidence exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of the interventions using mobile application. Objective: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TM intervention for adult patients with hypertension or diabetes in primary care compared with usual care (UC). Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was conducted from the Korean healthcare system perspective. Based on 6-month outcome data from an ICT-based tailored chronic disease management (ICT-CM) trial, effectiveness over a lifetime beyond the trial periods was extrapolated using a cardiovascular disease risk prediction model. Costs were estimated using ICT-CM trial data and national health insurance claims data. Health utility weights were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. \n Results: In the base-case analysis, compared with UC, TM was more costly ($23,157 for TM vs. $22,391 for UC) and more effective (12.006 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] for TM vs. 11.868 QALYs for UC). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $5556 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of TM being costeffective compared with UC was approximately 97% at an ICER threshold of $26,515 (KRW 35 million) per QALY gained. Conclusions: Compared with UC, TM intervention is a cost-effective option for hypertensive or diabetic patients in primary care settings. The study results can assist policymakers in making evidence-based decision when implementing accessible chronic disease management services.",

      "text": "Hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) associated with mortality and morbidity, imposing huge economic burdens  [1, 2] . Adequate blood pressure (BP) and glycemic control are important in health promotion and healthcare systems worldwide  [3, 4] . However, despite significant advances in evidence-based lifestyle modifications and pharmaceutical interventions, less than 40% of patients treated for hypertension or diabetes achieve the recommended target BP or blood glucose levels in Korea  [5] . Therefore, novel interventions are needed to support patient efforts for behavior changes to promote healthy lifestyles and disease self-management  [6, 7] . Mobile health (mHealth) based on information and communication technology in primary care is an innovative approach to such interventions  [8] . The widespread use of mobile phones combined with the ability to process and communicate data instantly, enables real-time individually tailored healthcare delivery and overcomes barriers of time and place  [9] .\n\nA national pilot project for chronic disease management was recently conducted under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and Welfare to evaluate the effectiveness of information and communications technology (ICT)-based monitoring service for tailored chronic disease management in primary care in Korea  [10, 11] . The ICT-based tailored management (TM) using automated advanced systems for hypertensive and diabetic patients provides a continuous and integrated customized health management service by linking the mHealth service platform (smartphone application), and the provider (primary care physician and care coordinator) web combined with the patient's health information (examination and drug prescription information data from the National Health Insurance Service). Several mHealth interventions (e.g., mobile phone text messages, wearable monitoring devices, and telemedicine) for managing hypertension and diabetes have demonstrated efficacy  [12] , but evidence for interventions using smartphone applications is limited. Moreover, their costeffectiveness varied substantially based on the target disease and type of technology, and the results of economic evaluations have been inconsistent  [13] . In particular, the costeffectiveness of interventions using complex smartphone communications in older people cannot be judged due to a lack of information  [14] .\n\nTo our knowledge, no studies have examined the long-term cost-effectiveness of tailored management interventions for patients with hypertension or diabetes using automated advanced mobile technology in primary care. Although a large pilot project on TM intervention based on the highest smartphone penetration rate globally and advanced IT technology was conducted  [15] , it remains unclear whether the additional benefits from TM are sufficient to justify its use over and above usual care (UC) alone in terms of economic efficiency. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TM for adult patients over 19 years of age with hypertension or diabetes in primary care compared with UC, using data collected in a pragmatic trial of ICT-based tailored chronic disease management (ICT-CM)."

      "text": "The ICT-CM Trial The ICT-CM was a pragmatic trial designed to test the real-world effectiveness of the ICT-based monitoring program among patients with chronic diseases in primary care  [16] . Study participants were patients aged 19 years or older diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes, recruited from 8 clinics in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. Patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease, or liver failure within one year were excluded. Among the participants (n=1004) in the ICT-CM trial, those aged between 60 and <70 accounted for the highest proportion at 39.0% (392/1004), while those under 60 accounted for 36.8% (369/1004), and those aged 70 and older accounted for 24.2% (243/1004). The average age was 62.4 years.\n\nThe study included a TM intervention group and a UC control group. Participants who received UC for hypertension and diabetes were treated at primary care institutions according to Korean clinical practice guidelines, and UC encompasses continuous monitoring and follow-up, appropriate medication management based on the patient's condition, and lifestyle modifications to promote healthy habits  [17, 18] . Participants who received TM intervention were treated using automated advanced mHealth systems by physicians and care coordinators.\n\nA care coordinator trained participants who received TM on how to use the technology, downloaded the mobile application Carecrew (Huraypositive Inc, Seoul, Korea) available for both Android and iOS onto their own smartphones, and were given Bluetooth-enabled devices: sphygmomanometer and glucometer. Physician established personalized management goals for each patient (referred to as tailored care plan) based on the lifestyle survey results and clinical examination at baseline. The care plan, including each participant's target BP or blood glucose level, daily measurement frequency, and management priorities, was automatically sent to the Carecrew. The participants were asked to record their lifestyle such as diet and body weight and periodically check their blood glucose, BP, and medication use. Results measured by the devices were automatically uploaded to the provider's operation web (CareCrew Web by Huraypositive Inc, Seoul, Korea). The physicians and care coordinators had access to this system to monitor the patient's condition constantly. Patients who missed self-recording were encouraged to self-measure and input lifestyle data through messages and phone calls. When the system reported out-of-range BP/glucose readings, a tailored mobile message was sent to the patient, and mobile-based feedback was performed for high-risk patients requiring intensive care. A customized examination voucher was issued for each patient, and assessments were conducted at the clinic visit at 6 months. Source data from ICT-CM trial was verified through periodic on-site monitoring. Monitors identified any discrepancies between all case report form entries and the source data, and issued queries. The queries were resolved by investigators, cooperating with monitors. The ICT-CM trial is described in detail in Multimedia Appendix 1."

A target cohort population comprising Korean hypertensive or diabetic patients diagnosed in primary care, which consistent with the populations examined in the ICT-CM trial. The Markov model was designed to mirror the natural progression of conditions in the population and the clinical pathway based on clinical guidelines. This model reflects the shortterm outcomes of treatment (controlled-uncontrolled status of BP or blood glucose) in hypertensive or diabetic patients, their characteristics that were considered CVD risk factors, and the risk of long-term complications that patients may experience. The short-term outcomes were as observed in the ICT-CM trial at 6 months, and subsequent long-term outcomes were extrapolated from the trial data. The model was programmed in Microsoft Excel, supporting macro programming through Visual Basic for Applications. This study is reported according to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist  [19] ."

      "text": "The structure of the Markov model is presented in Figure  1 . The model structure's validity was checked by reviewing the literature and expert opinion  [20, 21] . A Markov cohort could experience one of several health states, including \"Well\" with no major complications (i.e., CVD), \"CVD,\" \"Death due to CVD,\" or \"Death due to other cause.\" \"CVD\" was defined as a composite outcome of coronary heart disease (CHD, i.e., myocardial infarction and angina), cerebrovascular diseases (i.e., cerebral infarction, hemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischemic attack), heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. All patients in the TM or UC groups started the Markov process in the \"Well\" state. Patients could remain in the \"Well\" state or transfer to another state at every cycle length of 6 months, corresponding to the frequency of assessments in the ICT-CM study. From any health state, patients could transit to the \"Death due to other cause\" state, and from the \"CVD\" state, patients could transit to the \"Death due to CVD\" state.\n\nBecause the age of the patient cohorts on entry into the model was 60 years, a treatment discontinuation rate of 5% was assumed, considering that TM intervention could be discontinued in the real-world setting. Patients who discontinued TM intervention continued with UC. Patients receiving the UC at the model start were assumed to remain on the treatment until the end of the time horizon or death, whichever occurred first.\n\nFigure1. Model structure.

      "text": "The outcomes derived from the ICT-CM trial used in the study are presented in Table  1 .\n\nThrough post hoc analysis using individual patient data from the ICT-CM trial, the CVD risk factor outcomes were measured for each treatment arm. Demographic information including age, and medical history were examined in screening tests, and smoking history was assessed in health surveys using a complete self-health questionnaire at both baseline and 6 months. Total-C, HDL-C, and HbA1c levels were assessed during clinical examinations at both baseline and 6 months, while blood pressure (BP) was measured through body assessments at the same intervals. Details regarding the measurements and the outcomes assessed in the analysis are described in Multimedia Appendix 1. Employing the input values associated with CVD risk factors obtained from the trial, the 10-year cardiovascular risk for each patient was calculated using the Framingham CVD risk prediction model  [22] . The average risk estimate for each treatment arm was then converted into an annual probability of CVD events. The risk of CVD increased with the age of the patient cohort based on the age-related relative risk of CVD obtained from Kim et al.  [23] . The base-case regarding the long-term effect persistence assumed that the 6-month difference in BP or blood glucose between TM and UC decreased by 10% after 5 years, reflecting that the effectiveness may decline with age.\n\nTable 1.

The utility weight of \"Well\" status was higher than that of \"CVD\" by 0.05 for patients in their 60s, and the utility weight decreased with age.

Running costs comprised costs associated with training and care coordinator. Through the ICT-TM trial, the number of manageable patients per care coordinator was investigated, and the annual running cost was calculated by dividing the care coordinator's labor cost by the number of managed patients (approximately 250 per year). Running and equipment, annuitized based on a lifespan of 5 years, were included in intervention costs over the lifetime time horizon.\n\nThe cost of \"Well\" and \"CVD\" health states were derived from data analysis of the national health insurance claims data  [29] , and were applied equally to 2 arms. Each health state's costs comprised expenditure for diagnostic test, medication, surgical treatments, and resources use associated with inpatient/outpatient services.

      "title": "Cost-effectiveness Analysis",
      "text": "In a base-case analysis of all patients with hypertension or diabetes, the cost-effectiveness analysis of TM compared with UC was conducted from the healthcare system perspective. A result was presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated by dividing the incremental cost by the additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. A 4.5% annual discount rate for both cost and QALY were performed with half-cycle corrections. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to address parameter uncertainty. The parameters, including probabilities, utility weights, costs, number of manageable patients per care coordinator, and discount rate, were varied through deterministic sensitivity analyses. PSA of 1000 Monte Carlo simulations was undertaken, in which each of the parameter estimates was sampled from its distribution listed in Table  2 . PSA results were expressed as a cost-effectiveness plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) that shows graphically the probability of cost-effectiveness for all alternatives across a range of an ICER threshold of $26,515 (KRW 35 million) per QALY  [30] . In addition, several scenarios were explored to assess the structural uncertainty associated with model assumptions. The assumptions regarding the effect persistence between 2 arms were tested by varying the period during which the 6-month effect difference lasts, from the 3 years beyond the trial period to the remainder of the lifetime. In consideration of treatment persistence, the scenario considering a treatment discontinuation rate of 0% or 10% in patients receiving TM was also evaluated. Finally, the model's time horizon varied from a lifetime to between 10 and 20 years.\n\nA subgroup analysis was performed for hypertensive and diabetic patients. The Framingham risk model used in the base-case was reported to overestimate the risk of CVD in Koreans  [31] , and underestimate the risk of CVD in diabetic patients  [32] . Therefore, other CVD risk models were used in each subgroup. The Korean Hypertension cardiovascular (KH-CVD) risk model for hypertensive patients  [33]  and the United Kingdom prospective diabetes study (UKPDS) model that estimates risk of CHD and stroke  [32, 34]  for diabetic patients were employed to predict long-term effects. Table  S1  in Multimedia Appendix 2 shows model inputs, such as probability of CVD events, utility, and costs, estimated for each subgroup."

      "text": "In the results of the sensitivity analyses, the ICER was mainly affected by the effect persistence of TM, time horizon, the probability of CVD events for UC, the probability of CVD events for TM, and TM intervention costs, in that order (Table  3  and Figure  S1  in Multimedia Appendix 2). When a 10% decrease in the TM intervention's effectiveness was applied at 6 months, and 7 years after the start of the intervention, all ICERs remained below a threshold of $26,515. However, when the additional effect due to TM intervention disappeared at 3 to 5 years beyond the trial period, the ICER increased above the threshold after 3 years. The ICER was the highest at $25,201/QALY in the 10-year time horizon scenario. When the probability of CVD events for UC was decreased by 20%, the ICER increased by 256.1% ($19,787/QALY). As the time horizon and the probability of CVD events for UC decreased, the additional QALY gains in TM decreased significantly. A 20% decrease in the TM intervention costs and an increase in manageable patients per care coordinator showed cost-saving results. However, TM was the cost-effective strategy in all variations assessed in the sensitivity analyses, except for the assumption that the TM effect lasts only 3 years.\n\nThe results of the PSA were presented in cost-effectiveness planes showing the distributions of incremental costs and effects between the 2 arms (Figure  2-(A) ). Most values were distributed below the cost-effective threshold in the northeast quadrant, indicating that the base-case results were robust. The CEAC (Figure  2-(B) ) showed that the value of ICER lies below the threshold of $26,515 per QALY gained was 97%."

The probability that TM would be cost-effective was 99% for treating hypertensive patients, and 86% for diabetic patients (Figure  S2  in Multimedia Appendix 2). When the long-term effect was estimated using the KH-CVD model for hypertensive patients and the UKPDS model for diabetic patients, the ICER was $8699 per QALY gained for hypertensive patients and $10,409 per QALY gained for diabetic patients. Consequently, TM was a cost-effective alternative in all subgroups (Table  4 )."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "In the economic evaluation modeled based on the CVD Risk Prediction Model with data from the ICT-CM pragmatic trial, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of TM for patients with hypertension or diabetes in primary care, compared to UC. The study found that TM, despite being more costly than UC, resulted in better quality of life due to reduced cardiovascular events, making it cost-effective option. PSA indicated that the probability of the ICER value lying below the threshold WTP was 97%.\n\nMobile technology is increasingly used to manage the chronic diseases of hypertension and diabetes because of its efficacy and accessibility  [35] . Several devices using mobile technology improve patient care and health outcomes through lifestyle modification, promoting behavioral changes and increasing medication adherence  [12] . Previous studies have shown that mHealth interventions using mobile phone text messages, wearable monitoring devices, and telemedicine are cost-effective to manage chronic diseases  [13] . With the continuous advance of technology, novel mobile system using software programs such as smartphone application and device has recently emerged in Japan  [36] , and these have proven to be costeffective for reducing BP  [37] . Our study confirmed that automated algorithm-based advanced systems, in which mobile application for patients with hypertension and diabetes, patient management software for primary doctors, and Bluetooth devices were linked, had better treatment outcomes. This study is significant in that it proved the cost-effectiveness of the automated advanced mHealth system in patients with hypertension and diabetes in South Korea.\n\nThe model extrapolated effects over a lifetime based on the intervention effects at 6 months after starting the trial. The initial improvement in the HbA1c levels at 6 months in the tailored mobile coaching group, including mobile application, continued until 12 months in the randomized controlled trial despite partial cessation of interventions  [38] . Another study showed that tailored phone and home-monitoring interventions resulted in a sustained greater improvement in systolic BP compared to usual care over a 2-year period  [39] . Therefore, it was assumed in a base-case to be a 10% decrease in effect difference between the TM and UC groups after 5 years from the start of the intervention, which seems reasonable. In the sensitivity analyses that explored that assumption of effect persistence, the study demonstrated that the TM intervention in primary care was cost-effective compared with UC, even though the effect difference decreased by 10% immediately after the trial period. Conversely, if the added benefits of the TM intervention over UC were eliminated after 3 years, the intervention would not be cost-effective. However, as the discontinuation rate of TM intervention was expected to be low (conservatively, 5% was applied in the model), the assumption that the effect disappears after 3 years despite ongoing treatment is considered unlikely in the real-world.\n\nIn the subgroup analysis, diabetic patients were associated with higher incremental costs and lower incremental QALYs in the TM group versus the UC group compared with hypertensive patients. Reduced equipment costs per capita due to a higher prevalence of hypertension than diabetes  [23]  may have contributed slightly to this result. Furthermore, 6-month outcomes, such as systolic BP and total cholesterol [C] of the TM group compared with the UC group, improved more in hypertensive patients than in diabetic patients, which would have resulted in better long-term effects and better QALY in hypertensive patients. While the rate of reduction in BP is relatively rapid after treatment  [40] , significant changes in HbA1c may not occur in the short-term period after treatment change as A1C reflects average glycemia over several months  [41] . In a study evaluating long-term changes in HbA1c for 7 years after visiting a tertiary hospital in diabetic patients, HbA1c decreased most strongly at 12 months and then was maintained thereafter  [42] . Thus, in the subgroup analysis for diabetic patients, the effect of the TM group might be underestimated compared with versus UC group. Nevertheless, our study found an 86% probability that the TM group would be cost-effective among diabetic patients. Hypertension and diabetes are common comorbidities; each accelerates the other by being linked through vascular mechanisms and risk factors  [43] . Therefore, implementing the TM program for patients with chronic illnesses such as hypertension or diabetes would efficiently prevent and manage CVD.\n\nThe Framingham model was used to estimate the long-term CVD outcome in a base-case, which is widely used to predict the risk of developing CVD worldwide. However, it has been reported to overestimate the CVD risk in the Asian population  [31, 44] . The accuracy of the Framingham model for diabetic patients has also been debated  [32] . As only 6% of the Framingham cohort was known to have diabetes, it was reported that the Framingham model tended to underestimate the risk in diabetic patients  [45] . Therefore, the study used other CVD risk models to evaluate the uncertainty due to the risk model. The KH-CVD model for hypertensive patients was developed from data from Korean Hypertension Cohort of 11,043 patients who were followed for 10 years at 6 national university hospitals, and the model validation demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy  [33] . In tertiary hospitals, the risk of CVD may be underestimated due to strict patient management. The UKPDS model includes glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a continuous variable, while the Framingham model includes dichotomous variables such as the presence or absence of diabetes as risk factors. The UKPDS model, which is sensitive to HbA1c improvement, demonstrated enhanced precision in predicting CVD among diabetic patients  [32] . It exhibited acceptable discriminative performance for CVD  [46] . However, the 6-month outcome from the ICT-CM trial in our study was insufficient to confirm significant improvement in HbA1c; thus, it is speculated that the difference in effect between the 2 groups was underestimated. Hence, the ICER increased when estimating the CVD risk using the KH-CVD and UKPDS models compared with using the Framingham model. However, our results indicated that there was no significant change in the cost-effectiveness of TM.\n\nThe intervention cost of mHealth is a crucial factor for cost-effectiveness. Nomura et al. indicated that the cost of mobile application-based intervention for hypertension had the greatest impact on the ICER  [37] . Although our deterministic sensitivity analysis results showed that the cost of TM intervention was not the most determinant, similar to previous studies  [37, 47] , a reduction in intervention costs resulted in good cost-effectiveness. In particular, it might be possible that annual running costs, which account for the largest share of the TM intervention costs, could substantially decrease over time. The number of patients managed per care coordinator is expected to increase as the automation model using artificial intelligence is enhanced and care coordinators become more proficient, enabling efficient operation. This leads to reduced running costs and greater cost-effectiveness of intervention. The study found that the ICER decreased by more than 70% when the number of managed patients increased by 40% from 250 to 350 per year."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Our study has some limitations. First, the TM intervention effect after the observed periods of the ICT-CM trial was unknown, but it was assumed to last for 5 years and then decline in the base-case. Our sensitivity analyses showed that the results remained robust to various potential reductions in effect, with the exception of no additional effect of TM after 3 years, which might be perceived as a very conservative approach. Further studies are needed to support the long-term use of various mHealth systems. Second, we used a Framingham CVD risk prediction model that was not specifically designed to predict outcomes among adults in South Korea. However, sensitivity analysis using the KH-CVD model developed in Korea demonstrated that TM intervention would still be cost-effective. Furthermore, the Framingham model has been retrospectively validated in a multiethnic Asian population in primary care settings in a 10-year cohort study  [48] . Third, we could not consider whether costeffectiveness differs in relation to lifestyle and metabolic risk changes by the amount of application usage. Nevertheless, various sensitivity analyses supported that the base-case result was robust."
