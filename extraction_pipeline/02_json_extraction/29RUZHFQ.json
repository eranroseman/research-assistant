  "title": "Pareto optimization to accelerate multi-objective virtual screening \u2020",
  "abstract": "The discovery of therapeutic molecules is fundamentally a multi-objective optimization problem. One formulation of the problem is to identify molecules that simultaneously exhibit strong binding affinity for a target protein, minimal off-target interactions, and suitable pharmacokinetic properties. Inspired by prior work that uses active learning to accelerate the identification of strong binders, we implement multi-objective Bayesian optimization to reduce the computational cost of multi-property virtual screening and apply it to the identification of ligands predicted to be selective based on docking scores to on-and off-targets. We demonstrate the superiority of Pareto optimization over scalarization across three case studies. Further, we use the developed optimization tool to search a virtual library of over 4M molecules for those predicted to be selective dual inhibitors of EGFR and IGF1R, acquiring 100% of the molecules that form the library's Pareto front after exploring only 8% of the library. This workflow and associated open source software can reduce the screening burden of molecular design projects and is complementary to research aiming to improve the accuracy of binding predictions and other molecular properties.",

      "text": "Molecular discovery aims to identify molecules that balance multiple, o\ue09den competing, properties. The need to simultaneously optimize multiple properties is especially notable in drug discovery work\ue104ows. Small molecule drugs operating through direct single-target binding interactions must exhibit not only strong binding affinity for the target protein but also minimal off-target interactions and suitable pharmacokinetic properties.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  One formulation of small molecule drug discovery is to identify compounds that bind strongly to a protein of interest and subsequently modify them to ful\ue103ll remaining property constraints.  1, 4, 5 A candidate molecule with high activity but a poor pharmacokinetic pro\ue103le may ultimately be abandoned, resulting in wasted time and resources.  3, 6 electivity is one property that is o\ue09den considered only a\ue09der a hit with promising primary activity is identi\ue103ed.  1 Selectivity may be measured with binding assays against off-targets that are structurally similar to the primary target or known to be associated with adverse side effects (e.g., cytochromes P450 and the hERG channel).  3, 7 Non-speci\ue103c ligands that bind to many proteins in addition to the target may require additional optimization steps when compared to their selective counterparts.  2, 8 onsideration of promiscuity early in a drug discovery project may aid in deprioritizing chemical series that are inherently nonselective.  9, 10 In other settings, binding interactions with multiple targets can be advantageous.  11 Therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease  12, 13  and thyroid cancer  14, 15  have exhibited improved efficacy through affinity for multiple protein targets. Optimizing affinity to multiple targets is another goal that can be brought into earlier stages of hit discovery.  16, 17 nticipating protein-ligand interactions that contribute to potency and selectivity is possible, albeit imperfectly, with structure-based drug design techniques that employ scoring functions to estimate energetic favorability. Docking to offtargets has been applied to improve the selectivity pro\ue103les of identi\ue103ed compounds.  [18] [19] 9] [20]  These demonstrations have revealed that falsely predicted non-binders may incorrectly be categorized as selective because scoring functions designed for hit-\ue103nding typically aim to minimize the false positive rate (i.e., weak binders predicted to bind strongly), not the false negative rate (i.e., binders predicted not to bind).  20, 21 Although structurebased methods like docking are limited in their predictive accuracy,  [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  docking-based virtual screens can still effectively enrich a virtual library for molecules that are more likely to exhibit target activity.  [28] [29] ] [30] [31] [32]  The computational cost of virtual screening  33  has motivated the development of model-guided optimization methods that reduce the total number of docking calculations required to recover top-performing molecules.  [34] [35] 5] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40]  As one example, Graff et al.  37  only require the docking scores of 2.4% of a 100M member virtual library to identify over 90% of the library's top-50 000 ligands. Similar principles apply when using more expensive evaluations such as relative binding free energy calculations,  41  where a reduction of computational cost can be particularly bene\ue103cial. These methods are designed to optimize a single property and are inherently single-objective optimizations.\n\nThe need for model-guided optimization methods in virtual screening is heightened when multiple properties are screened. The resources required for a multi-objective virtual screen scale linearly with the number of screened properties (\"objectives\") and library size. In some settings, exhaustive screens of large virtual libraries (millions to billions) may be infeasible. Modelguided multi-objective optimization has the potential to reduce the computational cost of a multi-objective virtual screen without sacri\ue103cing performance. Mehta et al.  42  have previously applied Bayesian optimization to identify molecules that simultaneously optimize the docking score to Tau Tubulin Kinase 1, calculated octanol-water partition coefficient (clogP),  43  and synthetic accessibility score (SA_Score).  44 Their implemented acquisition function is a product of acquisition scores for individual objectives,  42  leading to the recovery of over 90% of the most desirable molecules a\ue09der scoring only 6% of the virtual library. Multi-objective virtual screens involve multiple design choices primarily related to the acquisition strategy, which have not yet been compared in the context of virtual screening. Further, existing methods for multi-objective virtual screening do not implement Pareto optimization. Pareto optimization aims to identify the molecules that form or are close to the Pareto front, for which an improvement in one objective necessitates a detriment to another. Molecules that form the Pareto front optimally balance multiple desired properties, illustrate which combinations of objective values are possible, and reveal trade-offs in the objective space; this is not possible with scalarization.\n\nIn this work, we extend the molecular pool-based active learning tool MolPAL 37 to this setting of multi-objective virtual screening. MolPAL is publicly available, open source, and can be adopted for multi-objective virtual screening with any desired set of objective functions, including those beyond structure-based drug design. We demonstrate through three retrospective case studies that MolPAL can efficiently search a virtual library for putative selective binders. We compare optimization performance across multi-objective acquisition functions and demonstrate the superiority of Pareto-based acquisition functions over scalarization ones. We also implement a diversity-enhanced acquisition strategy that increases the number of acquired scaffolds by 33% with only a minor impact on optimization performance. Finally, we apply MolPAL to efficiently search the Enamine Screening Collection 45 of over 4 million molecules for selective dual inhibitors of EGFR and IGF1R as an exemplary 3-objective optimization. A\ue09der exploration of only 8% of the virtual library, 100% of the library's nondominated points and over 60% of the library's top \u223c0.1%, de\ue103ned by non-dominated sorting, are identi\ue103ed by MolPAL."

      "text": "MolPAL applies the multi-objective pool-based work\ue104ow described in ref. 46, combining multi-objective Bayesian optimization and surrogate models to efficiently explore a virtual library for molecules that simultaneously optimize multiple properties (Fig.  1 ). Similar work\ue104ows have been demonstrated for the design of battery materials  [47] [48] [49]  and other functional materials.  [50] [51] 1] [52]  As summarized in Algorithm S2, \u2020 objective values are \ue103rst calculated for a subset of the library, and surrogate models that predict each objective are trained on these initial observations. A\ue09der objective values are predicted for all candidate molecules, an acquisition function selects a set of promising molecules for objective function evaluation. The surrogate models are then retrained with new observations, and the iterative loop repeats until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nRelative to its initial release in ref. 37, MolPAL was extended primarily through modi\ue103cation of the acquisition strategy and handling of multiple surrogate models. The multi-objective extension of MolPAL allows users to select between Pareto optimization and scalarization strategies.\n\nScalarization reduces a multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective problem, o\ue09den through a weighted sum:\n\nwith each l i denoting the relative importance of objective f i . Weighted sum scalarization requires the relative importance of objectives to be known before the optimization in order to assign weighting factors l. Alternative scalarization strategies beyond a weighted sum include random scalarization  54, 55  and Chebyshev scalarization,  56, 57  but these are not yet implemented in MolPAL. Scalarization enables the use of single-objective acquisition functions, which include probability of improvement (PI)  58  or expected improvement (EI)  59  (Fig.  2A ), greedy, and upper con\ue103dence bound (UCB)  60  (Table  1 ). Scalarization is implemented prior to surrogate model training, i.e., only one single-task surrogate model is necessary. Algorithm S1 \u2020 summarizes MolPAL's implementation of scalarized multi-objective optimization.\n\nPareto optimization is a multi-objective optimization strategy that reveals the trade-offs between objectives and does not require any measure of the relative importance of objectives. Further, Pareto optimization aims to identify the entire Pareto front, a feature not guaranteed by single-objective methods such as weighted sum scalarization.  61, 62 Common multi-objective acquisition functions include the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHI),  53  expected hypervolume improvement (EHI),  53  non-dominated sorting (NDS),  63, 64  and Pareto upper con\ue103dence bound (P-UCB).  65 These are natural extensions of single-objective acquisition functions (Table  1 ) that instead aim to increase the region, or hypervolume, dominated by the acquired points (Fig.  2 ). P-UCB and its single-objective analog UCB are not considered in this work.    extend the principles of PI and EI to multiple dimensions using the observed Pareto front (grey dashed line) rather than f*. Probability of hypervolume improvement (PHI) represents the likelihood that acquisition of an unobserved point would increase the hypervolume by any amount. Expected hypervolume improvement (EHI) estimates the increase in hypervolume if the objective function value of such a point is scored.  53 Objectives are defined so that optimization corresponds to maximization.\n\nTable  1  Common single-objective acquisition functions and their multi-objective analogs. \u2119 and E represent probability and expected value, respectively. f* is the current best objective value, HV is hypervolume, and rank is the Pareto rank. Surrogate models provide prediction means m and standard deviations s for the objective value f of candidate point x. X acq is the set of points acquired in previous iterations. Bold variables are vectors. N \u00f0m; s\u00de implies that the covariance matrix is treated as diagonal with entries s i 2 , i.e., uncertainty is uncorrelated across objective functions"

[68] [69] 9] [70] [71] [72] [73]  Other strategies use heuristics to select batches that are diverse in the design space or objective space in order to improve the utility of a batch.  [74] [75] 5] [76] [77] [78] [79]  MolPAL implements both naive top-k batching and diversity-enhanced acquisition strategies that apply clustering in both the design space and in the objective space (Section 5.5)."

      "text": "We test MolPAL with three retrospective case studies with an emphasis on docking-predicted binding selectivity to compare optimization performance across acquisition functions. The pairs of objectives used in these case studies are exclusively docking scores even though the framework of MolPAL is more general. For example, this work\ue104ow may be used to optimize docking scores to an ensemble of protein structures  80  (\"ensemble docking\") or optimize multiple docking scoring functions provided with a single target.  [81] [82] ] [83]  Each case explores a virtual library of approximately 260k molecules and optimizes two competing docking score objectives from the DOCKSTRING benchmark.  84 Case 1's goal is modeled a\ue09der identifying antagonists of dopamine receptor D 3 (DRD3) that are selective over dopamine receptor D 2 (DRD2), which may enable effective treatment of various conditions without the side effects triggered by DRD2 antagonists.  [85] [86] 6] [87]  Case 2 treats Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), a lukemia target, as the on-target and lymphocyte-speci\ue103c protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) as the off-target.  88, 89 Finally, case 3 aims to identify selective inhibitors of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)  90, 91  that do not bind to cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4),  92, 93  an off-target known to impact the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs though metabolism.  [94] [95] 5] [96]  The property tradeoffs for each case are shown in Fig.  3 . Because both positive docking scores and scores of 0 should be interpreted as nonbinders, we clip docking scores to 0.\n\nWe employ single-task directed message-passing neural networks  97, 98  for each objective as surrogate models (Section 5.4). An initial set of 2602 molecules is randomly sampled at the zeroth iteration, and 1% of the library (2602 molecules) is acquired in each subsequent iteration. Scalarization weighting factors (l 1 and l 2 in eqn (1)) were set to 0.5. Five trials with distinct initialization seeds were completed for each acquisition function. Section 5 contains full implementation details."

      "title": "3.2. Pareto acquisition functions outperform scalarization",
      "text": "We characterize optimization performance with three metrics: fraction of the top \u223c1% acquired, hypervolume (HV), and fraction of non-dominated points acquired. We motivate the selection of these metrics and describe their implementation in Section 5.6.\n\nAll Pareto optimization acquisition functions show substantial improvement over random acquisition according to the top \u223c1% metric, with PHI performing most consistently across cases (Fig.  4A-F ). Analyzing the same metric, greedy is clearly the best scalarized acquisition function despite its poor performance in case 3 relative to PHI and EHI. Only in case 1 does the best scalarization acquisition function outperform the best Pareto acquisition function. Performance metrics using the acquisition function described by Mehta et al.  42  (MO-MEMES) are included as an additional baseline in Tables  S1-S3 . \u2020 Pareto optimization acquisition functions consistently outperform MO-MEMES.\n\nWhen performance is measured by the fraction of nondominated points acquired, EHI and PHI outperform scalarization acquisition functions (Fig.  5 ) even though the degree of improvement varies across cases. The sensitivity of the hypervolume metric to outliers on the Pareto front leads to noisy hypervolume pro\ue103les (Fig.  S2 \u2020 ). Similar trends are observed when measuring the inverted generational distance metric (Fig.  S3 \u2020 ). Overall, Pareto optimization acquisition functions strongly outperform or match the performance of scalarization for the pairs of objectives and virtual library considered.\n\nThe variation in relative performance of different acquisition functions across evaluation metrics is noteworthy. For example, greedy scalarization performs quite well in the top \u223c1% metric for all cases but worse than random acquisition according to hypervolume and fraction of non-dominated points in case 3. The results shown here highlight the importance of assessing the performance across different sets of objectives. Despite the variation across cases and metrics, EHI and PHI consistently perform as well as scalarization or substantially better than scalarization. These acquisition functions are suitable choices for new sets of objectives. Alternatively, when a previously unexplored set of objectives is to be optimized, a retrospective study on a scored subset of the library can inform the selection of a suitable acquisition strategy. Each reported metric corresponds to distinct optimization goals (Section 5.6); the primary application of a multi-objective virtual screen should inform which metric to use for acquisition function comparison and selection."

      "title": "3.3. Clustering-based acquisition improves molecular diversity",
      "text": "Scoring functions used in structure-based virtual screening can exhibit systematic errors that bias selection toward speci\ue103c interactions.  99 This poses a risk for experimental validation if speci\ue103c scaffolds are overrepresented in the top-scoring molecules. Selecting a structurally diverse set of candidates is one strategy to mitigate this risk and can be achieved via a diversity-enhanced acquisition strategy (Section 5.5). First, a set of molecules larger than the target batch size is selected according to the acquisition function and is then partitioned into a number of clusters equal to the batch size in feature (e.g., molecular \ue103ngerprint) space. The molecule with the best acquisition score in each cluster is acquired. We analyzed the performance of diversity-enhanced acquisition for case 3, using PHI as the acquisition function. All hyperparameters were the same as those used for previous experiments (Section 5).\n\nFeature space clustering slightly hinders optimization performance according to all four performance metrics (Fig.  6A-E ), but it also increases the number of graph-based Bemis-Murcko scaffolds 100 acquired by 33% when compared to a na\u00efve batch construction strategy. This degradation in measured performance is expected given that the performance metrics do not consider the overall diversity of the selected molecules. The increased structural diversity of the selected molecules can be qualitatively visualized via dimensionality reduction through UMAP 101 (Fig.  S4 \u2020 ). Certain multi-objective optimization methods such as NSGA-II 64 also incorporate objective space diversity, i.e., the selection of points better distributed along the Pareto front.  46 We \ue103nd that clustering in the objective space during acquisition (Section 5.5) mildly hinders performance in all optimization metrics (Fig.  6A-E ). An acquisition strategy that considers diversity in both the objective space and feature space (Section 5.5) performs similarly to the standard acquisition strategy across most optimization metrics (Fig.  6A-D ) while acquiring a more structurally diverse set of molecules when compared to standard acquisition (Fig.  6F  and  S4 \u2020 ). Overall, we recommend the use of feature space clustering if having structurally distinct candidates is a priority for experimental validation."

To analyze performance according to the four considered evaluation metrics, we perform this search retrospectively a\ue09der docking the entire library using DOCKSTRING's protocol for each target 84 (Section 5.1). The distributions of individual objectives for the entire library are shown in Fig.  7 .\n\nWe use PHI acquisition without clustering and acquire 1% of the library at each iteration, repeating each experiment three times.\n\nMolPAL succeeds in acquiring 100% of the library's nondominated points in all three replicates a\ue09der exploring only 8% of the search space (Fig.  8C ), a 9X improvement of in the fraction of acquired non-dominated points over random acquisition. At this same degree of exploration (8% of the library), over 60% of the library's top \u223c0.1% molecules have been identi\ue103ed (Fig.  8A ). Improvements in IGD and hypervolume with MolPAL over random acquisition are also notable (Fig.  8  and Table  2 ). The results of this retrospective run indicate that MolPAL can substantially reduce the computational resources required to identify molecules that simultaneously optimize multiple properties from a virtual library of millions of molecules.\n\nThe virtual library's true Pareto front of 39 molecules, all of which were recovered by MolPAL, is visualized in Fig.  9 . The structures of all non-dominated molecules are shown in Fig.  S6-S8 . \u2020 The structures of these molecules, several of which look more like dye molecules than drug-like molecules, expose some remaining challenges of docking for selectivity prediction. Molecules predicted to be non-binders to CYP3A4, such as M4 and M20 in Fig.  9 , are relatively large molecules that do not \ue103t inside the pocket of CYP3A4, leading to steric clashes and less favorable binding energetics. The ability for such molecules to score well against the IGF1R and EGFR but poorly against CYP3A4 is exempli\ue103ed by the computed docking poses and protein-ligand interactions of M4 (Fig.  S5 \u2020 ). Although steric clashes may be a valid reason for hypothetical selectivity towards EGFR/IGF1R over CYP3A4, the molecules predicted to be most selective (e.g., M4 and M20) are not attractive candidates for experimental validation. In practice, dominated molecules that are close to the identi\ue103ed Pareto front should  also be considered for experimental validation or follow-up studies. Molecules that are obviously not suitable starting points for a drug discovery campaign, including those in Fig.  9 , should be deprioritized for experimental testing. A ligand efficiency score may also be used as an objective function to penalize very large molecules. 106 Nevertheless, given the imperfections of docking as an oracle function, MolPAL perfectly identi\ue103es the Pareto front at a reduced computational cost and scores well in terms of all evaluation metrics. We do not intend to nominate the visualized molecules as starting points for a drug discovery project but instead aim to demonstrate the ability for MolPAL to efficiently molecules that optimize any set of oracles such as those that predict binding affinity."

      "title": "4. Conclusion",
      "text": "We have introduced an open source multi-objective extension of the pool-based optimization tool MolPAL 37 and demonstrated its ability to accelerate docking-based multi-objective virtual screening. MolPAL provides a \ue104exible Pareto optimization framework that allows users to systematically vary key design choices like acquisition strategy. MolPAL is most appropriate for optimizing objectives that are more expensive to calculate than surrogate molecular property prediction models. Beyond docking, these include objectives that require binding free energy calculations, quantum mechanical simulations, or experiments to measure. Objectives that are calculable in CPU milliseconds, such as SA_Score or clogP, can be screened exhaustively and do not warrant model-guided optimization tools. MolPAL could also be applied to consensus docking by optimizing multiple scoring functions that predict binding affinity to the same target.  [81] [82] 2] [83]  MolPAL is designed to \ue104exibly accommodate custom objectives and facilitate the optimization of other property predictions relevant to molecular design. We \ue103rst assessed MolPAL on three two-objective case studies that aim to identify putative selective binders. We found that expected hypervolume improvement and probability of hypervolume improvement, both Pareto optimization acquisition functions, consistently performed as well as or better than scalarization. A diversity-enhanced acquisition strategy that applies clustering in molecular \ue103ngerprint space was found to increase the number of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds observed by 33% when compared to standard acquisition. Finally, we demonstrated that MolPAL can efficiently search large virtual libraries and optimize three objectives simultaneously through a case study aiming to identify putative selective dual inhibitors from the Enamine Screening Collection of over 4 million molecules; MolPAL acquired all of the library's non-dominated molecules a\ue09der exploring only 8% of the library in all three replicates.\n\nExploration of other multi-objective optimization approaches, such as random scalarization and Chebyshev scalarization, in the context of molecular optimization could expose bene\ue103ts of strategies not explored in this work. Other published diversity-enhanced acquisition strategies  79, 107  may have the potential to improve both molecular diversity and optimization performance.\n\nWhile the use of docking to off-targets as a proxy for selectivity is well precedented,  [18] [19] [20]  the high false negative rates of docking screens (i.e., binders predicted to be nonbinding) pose a risk for experimental validation of molecules predicted to be selective.  20, 21, 108 Pharmacophore models and scoring functions that are designed for off-target activity 9,19,109 could be more appropriate for cross-docking for selectivity in the future. Because MolPAL is a general multi-objective optimization strategy that can be applied to any combination of oracle functions, it will maintain its relevance as these oracle functions improve in time. Future efforts applying MolPAL to hit discovery and early-stage molecular design are necessary to validate the bene\ue103ts of considering multiple objectives at early stages of molecular discovery."

Feature space clustering is performed according to 2048-bit atom-pair \ue103ngerprints 117 calculated using the function in RDKit 110 with the minimum length and maximum length of paths between pairs to 1 and 3, respectively. Atom pair \ue103ngerprints have been shown to outperform other extended connectivity \ue103ngerprints in recovering 3D-shape analogs 118 and ranking close analogs by structural similarity.  119 The predicted objective means were used for clustering in the objective space.\n\nThe acquisition strategy \ue103rst selects a superset of molecules according to the acquisition scores as in a standard acquisition strategy. In our trials, the size of the superset is 10X the batch size, b. Then, the superset is clustered according to molecular \ue103ngerprints or predicted objective values. We use the implementation of 120 in scikit-learn 121 with b clusters, 10 random initializations, an initialization size of 3b, and a reassignment ratio of 0 for batch size b. Although b clusters are speci\ue103ed, some clusters may be returned as empty in the case of a low-dimensional cluster basis. We ensure that b points are acquired by iteratively looping through all clusters, beginning with the largest clusters, and acquiring the molecule in the cluster with the highest acquisition score. This process is continued until b molecules are acquired.\n\nWhen clustering in both the feature and objective spaces, the superset is \ue103rst clustered in the objective space into (b/2) clusters, and (b/2) points are acquired by iterating through the clusters and selecting the molecule with the highest acquisition score. The superset is then supplemented with the b/2 unacquired candidate points that have the highest acquisition scores. Then, the superset is clustered in the atom-pair \ue103ngerprint space into b -(b/2) clusters, and the point with the highest acquisition score in each cluster is acquired. Thus, when both forms of clustering are used, effectively b/2 points are selected to improve objective space diversity, and b/2 points are selected to improve feature space diversity."

      "title": "5.6. Performance metrics",
      "text": "Four performance metrics designed for Pareto optimization were measured to holistically assess the performance of Mol-PAL. The underlying goal of a multi-property virtual screen (e.g., understanding the trade-offs between objectives, identifying a set of potentially promising selective inhibitors) can guide which evaluation metric to be deemed most important. Reported metrics and the motivation for selecting each is described below.\n\n5.6.1 Fraction of top \u223ck%. Virtual screening work\ue104ows based on active learning are o\ue09den evaluated using a top-k metric: the fraction of the true top-k molecules that have been acquired. Using a top-k metric captures the goal of separating promising molecules from the bulk while acknowledging that docking scores are imperfect and imprecise predictors of binding affinity. The best observed performance of a single compound is a less useful metric in this context, as there is a high likelihood it would not validate as a binder experimentally.\n\nFor multi-property virtual screening, the set of top-k molecules is not well-de\ue103ned. We opt to de\ue103ne the top \u223ck% through non-dominated sorting of the library (Fig.  S1 \u2020 ). The nondominated points in the library are iteratively selected and removed from the candidate pool until $k% of the library has been selected. These points then serve as the top \u223ck%. Because multiple points are selected as part of the top \u223ck% in each iteration (i.e., all points of a certain Pareto rank), the fraction is slightly larger than k%.\n\nThe top \u223ck% metric best describes virtual screens aiming to identify many molecules roughly close to the Pareto front. Compared to other metrics that consider points on or much closer to the Pareto front, it best captures the expectation that not all top-performing molecules will validate experimentally.\n\n5.6.2 Fraction of non-dominated points. In some multiproperty screens, the aim may be to elucidate as many points on the true Pareto front as possible. This enables the shape of the Pareto front and the inherent trade-off between objectives to be well-understood. A metric related to only the true nondominated points is most appropriate in these cases. The library's non-dominated points are identi\ue103ed using nondominated sorting (Section 5.3), and this metric is simply the fraction of the non-dominated molecules that were acquired.\n\n5.6.3 Hypervolume. Hypervolume is a common metric used to assess the performance of multi-objective optimization methods. 122 It measures the size of the region dominated by the Pareto front; in a bi-objective optimization, the hypervolume is the area dominated by the acquired points (Fig.  S1B \u2020 ). Importantly, the hypervolume can be very sensitive to outliers, leading to high variability across repeat experiments. Because outliers may fail to be experimentally validated, the strong sensitivity of hypervolume to speci\ue103c points makes it slightly misleading. We use the python package pygmo 113 to calculate hypervolume and report it as the fraction of the virtual library's total hypervolume. In contrast to the other evaluated metrics, the absolute hypervolume can be measured in prospective studies."
