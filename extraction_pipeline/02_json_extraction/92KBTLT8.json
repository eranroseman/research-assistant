  "abstract": "Objective To determine the net effect of different physical activity intervention components on step counts in addition to self-monitoring. Design A systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression. Data sources Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest and Discus) were searched from inception to May 2022. The database search was complemented with backward and forward citation searches and search of the references from relevant systematic reviews. Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing an intervention using self-monitoring (active control arm) with an intervention comprising the same treatment PLUS any additional component (intervention arm). \n Data extraction and synthesis The effect measures were mean differences in daily step count. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, and effect moderators were explored using univariate and multivariate meta-regression models. Results Eighty-five studies with 12 057 participants were identified, with 75 studies included in the metaanalysis at postintervention and 24 at follow-up. At postintervention, the mean difference between the intervention and active control arms was 926 steps/ day (95% CI 651 to 1201). At a follow-up, the mean difference was 413 steps/day (95% CI 210 to 615). Interventions with a prescribed goal and involving human counselling, particularly via phone/video calls, were associated with a greater mean difference in the daily step count than interventions with added print materials, websites, smartphone apps or incentives. \n Conclusion Physical activity interventions that combine self-monitoring with other components provide an additional modest yet sustained increase in step count compared with self-monitoring alone. Some forms of counselling, particularly remote phone/video counselling, outperformed other intervention components, such as websites and smartphone apps. PROSPERO registered number CRD42020199482.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis BACKGROUND Given the high prevalence of physical inactivity and its associated public health burden,  1  it is not surprising that researchers continue to explore which interventions can effectively and sustainably increase physical activity (PA).  2  Such interventions are usually complex  3  and consist of multiple components (eg, counselling, incentives, text messages and activity monitors).  [4] [5] ] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  However, these complex interventions are typically assessed in parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an intervention arm to a usual care control arm. Consequently, these studies cannot determine which specific components actually contribute to the overall intervention effect and which components may have no effect or even a deleterious effect.  11 espite implementing alternative study designs such as factorial RCTs  12  and microrandomised trials,  13  the contribution of individual intervention components is still poorly understood.  8 14 ne of the most frequent components employed in complex PA interventions is self-monitoring,  8 10  a crucial element of health promotion and disease prevention. Social cognitive theory states the importance of self-regulation as a source of behaviour change with self-monitoring one of the three core components.  15 Historically, intervention participants recorded their daily PA in diaries,  16  but selfmonitoring with pedometers, fitness trackers and smartphone apps (collectively called activity monitors) has now become a cornerstone of PA interventions.

      "text": "activity monitors leads to substantial PA increases which can be maintained long term. 9 10 16  19 20 onsidering the positive impact of self-monitoring on PA levels, it would be worth questioning if the effect of various complex PA interventions is primarily caused by self-monitoring alone and if additional components further bolster the effects or have no effects. For example, a recent meta-regression of step-count monitoring interventions compared with usual care suggested that interventions that also included counselling or incentives were not better than simpler interventions without counselling or incentives. 10 Thus, it seems pertinent to question the net effect of various intervention components above and beyond the self-monitoring effects, especially as some of these components (eg, in-person counselling) are often resourceintensive compared with self-monitoring.  21 22 ltimately, the net effect of additional components (ie, after subtracting the effect of self-monitoring) can only be isolated in RCTs comparing the complex intervention including selfmonitoring against self-monitoring alone (an 'active control' arm) rather than against a usual care control arm. Thus, this study's aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of these RCTs to determine whether complex PA interventions that combine self-monitoring using activity monitors with other intervention components provide an additional benefit to selfmonitoring alone."

Examples of these components typically involve tools such as financial incentives or smartphone apps and channels such as in-person counselling or text messages.\n\nOur use of the terms 'active control' and 'intervention' does not necessarily align with other authors' labels. For example, studies often compared three arms: (1) usual care control, (2) pedometer-only intervention and (3) pedometer-plus-counselling intervention. In this specific case, the first arm would not be included in our review, the second arm would be labelled as 'active control', and the third arm as 'intervention'. Furthermore, using the term 'active control' does not imply that this arm did not receive anything else other than the self-monitoring device. Active control arms often received print materials, education, etc, but they could still be eligible provided that the intervention arm received everything the active control arm received, plus some additional 'intervention' component(s). Studies where the active control arm received anything that was not also contained in the intervention arm were excluded, even when study authors labelled it as 'active control'.

Meta-analyses findings were presented using forest plots. The presence of publication bias was assessed using visual inspection of a funnel plot and random-effects version of Egger's regression test. To check the robustness of the primary analysis, sensitivity analyses were carried out by excluding studies with active control arms (A) not having a set goal, (B) receiving an additional PA intervention component beyond activity monitor and a set goal, (C) receiving a non-PA intervention and (D) studies with small sample size (<40 participants).\n\nThe existence of heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.  32 The I 2 values were interpreted according to the Cochrane Handbook as not important (0% -40%), moderate (30%-60%), substantial (50%-90%) and considerable (75%-100%) heterogeneity.  31 In case of substantial to considerable heterogeneity, effect moderators were explored using a series of univariate and multivariate meta-regression models. Potential moderators involved population characteristics (age, sex, body mass index (BMI), sedentariness, health status and healthcare setting) and intervention characteristics (intervention duration, presence of a set goal, intervention components including diary, print materials, website, smartphone app, text messages, incentives and human counselling).

However, Web of Science and ProQuest databases were searched instead of EMBASE; (2) As nearly all the studies reported daily step count as the PA outcome, we did not perform meta-analyses with minutes of MVPA and other outcomes as originally intended. Only 19 studies reported minutes of MVPA, and 15 of these also reported step count; (3) Consequently, not mixing step count and minutes of MVPA in one meta-analysis allowed us to use an absolute MD in daily steps instead of a standardised MD (Hedge's g) as the measure of effect; and (4) The moderator analysis was performed using the meta-regression instead of subgroup analysis."

Thirty-five studies were conducted in healthcare settings, 18 at the university or college, and the remaining 32 studies were conducted in community or mixed settings. Three studies were cluster randomised trials.  38 91 117 he studies compared two (n=47), three (n=27), four (n=10) and five (n=1) arms. However, only 10 studies had 3 or more arms relevant to, and included in, the review. The number of study participants (counting only those from the relevant arms) ranged from 9 to 906 (median 80). In total, 12 057 participants were included in the review (9300 in the primary meta-analysis); of those, 60% were female. Participants' mean age ranged from 20 to 76 (median 50), and their mean BMI ranged from 22 to 47 (median 30). Thirty-four studies specifically reported recruiting sedentary adults. Forty-four studies recruited adults with chronic conditions (type 2 diabetes, overweight or obesity, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, breast cancer or Parkinson's disease).\n\nIntervention duration ranged from 1 week to 48 months (median 12 weeks); only 26 studies were longer than 3 months. Length of follow-up beyond the intervention ranged from 4 to 48 weeks (median 12 weeks).

To further explore the effect of different types of human counselling, we replaced the 'counselling' variable in this final model with dummy-coded binary variables representing individual counselling types. Of those, the addition of phone/ video counselling had the largest effect on daily step count, followed by group counselling which, however, did not fall within the predefined statistical significance level.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Combining other intervention components with self-monitoring using activity monitors provided an additional benefit of approximately 1000 steps/day compared with self-monitoring alone when assessed postintervention. At follow-up postintervention, this benefit reduced to less than half, but remained statistically significant at various time points.\n\nOur findings are in contrast to Chaudhry et al's conclusion that additional counselling/incentives offer no further benefit over simple self-monitoring interventions. 10 However, their meta-regression primarily searched for studies examining the effects of step count monitoring devices compared with usual care; hence, their conclusion was based on indirect comparison of studies with and without counselling/incentives. In contrast, our systematic review and meta-analysis directly compared interventions combining self-monitoring and counselling/incentives with self-monitoring alone.  121 owever, the net effect of additional components in our review (approximately 1000 steps/day) was substantially smaller than the effects of many complex interventions that also included self-monitoring, commonly ranging between 1500 and 2500 steps/day.  17 18 122 Taken together with the previous evidence of the effect of self-monitoring alone (500-2000 steps/day), 10 123 we can conclude that complex PA interventions owe part of their benefits to simple self-monitoring and their net effect is actually smaller than reported.\n\nThis conclusion is aptly illustrated by PACE-UP, the largest PA intervention trial to date.  83 This 3-month complex intervention comprising three practice nurse consultations and pedometer self-monitoring increased PA by 1172 steps/day compared with usual care. A third active control arm, in which participants received a pedometer with a set step count goal, delivered by post without any counselling or support, increased their PA by 692 steps/day compared with usual care controls. Consequently, the nurse consultation net effect was only 480 steps/day, less than half of the intervention effect when compared with usual care. Thus, we argue that all studies exploring complex PA interventions that combine self-monitoring with other components should compare their intervention against an active control Review arm of self-monitoring with a set goal to isolate the additional components' net effects, particularly as these additional components are often costly and resource-intensive. The active control arm's importance is further emphasised when addressing the maintenance of the intervention effect. At the 9-month follow-up of PACE-UP, the MDs between usual care and the (1) nurse counselling intervention and the (2) selfmonitoring alone (active control group) were 677 steps/day and 642 steps/day, respectively. The nurse counselling net effect completely disappeared by the 9-month follow-up, while the pedometer-based self-monitoring effect was maintained in the same period  83  and up to 3 years.  124 Unlike PACE-UP, our metaanalysis demonstrated that the net effect of additional intervention components could be maintained for a certain period of time (median 3 months) if only reduced by half. Still, this finding does not weaken but rather supports our call for designing studies with active control arms."

      "title": "Moderator analysis",
      "text": "Only intervention duration, the presence of a set goal, and the addition of human counselling (especially via phone/video calls) demonstrated significant moderating effects in the metaregression models. However, none of these models explained more than 18% of the heterogeneity (as measured by R 2 statistics), which suggests that the between-study variability in effect sizes is being driven by other sources, which were not captured in the models.\n\nIntervention duration had a negative effect on increases in step count: each additional week decreased the step count on average by approximately 10 steps/day. Even though this finding may seem intuitive as participant engagement can decrease over time,  28 125  most meta-analyses did not detect any effect of intervention duration,  5 9 16 19 126  and some found that longer interventions had a greater effect on PA.  127  Thus, the impact of intervention duration on PA outcomes remains to be elucidated.\n\nOur finding that setting a specific goal was associated with an increase of approximately 600 steps/day supports Bravata et al's 2007 finding that 'having a step goal is the key predictor of increased PA',  16  as well as numerous subsequent metaanalyses.  8 9 17 Indeed, given that provision of a set goal is so powerful, does not require any additional resources, and is closely interconnected with self-monitoring, we argue that a set goal should be an integral part of active control arms together with self-monitoring.\n\nHuman counselling was the only intervention component with a significant moderating effect with phone/video counselling having the greatest effect. We are unaware of any review directly comparing phone/video with in-person or other types of human PA counselling. However, several remote feedback reviews indicated that phone/video calls are indeed a promising way of PA counselling. 128 129 Thus, the use of phone/video counselling in PA interventions should be further explored as it offers a potentially highly effective and flexible tool, especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic.  130 t is important to realise that not having a significant moderating effect, as was the case for financial incentives, text messages or in-person counselling, does not mean that the addition of these components had no impact on PA. The regression coefficients and their p-values reported in table 2 represent the moderating effect of the intervention component on the MD between the intervention and active control arms, not the total effect of interventions including this component. Therefore, the results of our moderator analyses do not contradict previous meta-analyses that demonstrated a significant effect of text messages,  5 131  in-person counselling, 132 financial incentives 4 127 133 and smartphone apps  17 134  on PA levels.\n\nStudies exploring the financial incentives commonly use some form of objective self-monitoring and a set goal (frequently expressed in daily step count), as the incentives are usually contingent on meeting this goal. Similarly, most smartphone apps aimed to increase PA also include self-monitoring, either using internal smartphone accelerometers or accompanying wearables. However, unlike studies of financial incentives that almost always use self-monitoring alone as the active control arm, 4 127 133 studies of smartphone apps rarely do.  17 125 134 Therefore, the previous meta-analyses of smartphone apps  17 125 134  could not distinguish whether the effect of the apps resulted mostly from self-monitoring alone or other additional features of the app. Thus, in line with our previous reasoning, we argue that future RCTs of smartphone apps should always consider including an active control arm (using an app with stripped features but still allowing the self-monitoring) as is already common in RCTs of financial incentives."

      "title": "Strength and limitations",
      "text": "This is the first meta-analysis capable of isolating the additional benefit of various intervention components above and beyond simple self-monitoring. The high number of included studies allowed for robust detection of the net effect of these components at both the postintervention and follow-up time points. Additionally, we conducted a series of meta-regression models sufficiently powered to demonstrate the moderating effect of intervention duration, set goal and additional human counselling, especially phone/video counselling, supporting the findings of previous meta-analyses.\n\nA potential limitation is in our identification of all eligible studies. As there is no easy way to detect studies comparing a PA intervention against an active control arm (only 11 out of 85 included studies used the term 'active control'), our search relied on proxy terms, such as 'three arms', 'with and without' or 'selfmonitoring alone'. Thus, we could not be sure that our initial database search identified all eligible studies. We, therefore, applied a rigorous backward and forward citation search and also searched reference lists of six relevant systematic reviews to strengthen the database search. Even if we cannot ensure that we identified all eligible studies, the high number of studies included in the meta-analysis (n=75) makes it unlikely that a few more studies would have considerably affected our findings, as suggested by the series of sensitivity analyses.\n\nA further limitation is the lack of clarity around the term 'component'. Our review identified studies employing conceptually very different approaches (eg, text messages, counselling, and financial incentives). While the scheme developed for coding the components is well fit for the purpose of this study, it has not been rigorously validated and limits comparability with other studies. Furthermore, some codes are very broad and involve components with various levels of sophistication (eg, the 'website' category spans simple educational websites as well as advanced gamified online programmes). Thus, future research would benefit from the development of a standardised taxonomy of intervention components, analogous to Michie's taxonomy of behaviour change.  135 While it was not the objective of this study, a refined coding of the intervention components using Michie's taxonomy could also provide us with a more robust insight into precisely which behaviour change techniques act as moderators."

Indeed, meta-regression can be subject to many pitfalls, 121 and our conclusions on the differential effect of various components must be considered preliminary and need to be confirmed in future RCTs isolating the effects of individual components using active control arms or a factorial design.\n\nIn addition, the active control arms of many of the studies included in the meta-analysis also included some intervention components in addition to self-monitoring. Even though these components were usually minimal (eg, a leaflet with general information on the benefits of PA, one short educational session), they might have reduced the estimated effect of the additional component in intervention arms. However, the results of the sensitivity analysis excluding studies with active control arms receiving an additional PA intervention component beyond activity monitor and a set goal showed only a little increase in the pooled effect sizes when compared with the primary analysis (1023 vs 926 steps/day).\n\nFinally, the findings of this meta-analysis can be inflated by low-quality studies. In fact, only 39 of 75 studies included in the meta-analysis at post-intervention were judged as having a low risk of bias in at least four out of six domains. The sensitivity analysis limited to these high-quality studies showed a considerable decrease in the pooled effect of additional components by approximately 150 steps/day when compared with the meta-analysis of all studies. Thus, the importance of using selfmonitoring with a set goal as active control groups seems to be all the more pertinent."

      "title": "Implications for practice, policy and future research",
      "text": "Findings from this review and other literature  8-10 16  suggest that researchers should consider including self-monitoring using a simple activity monitor (or a smartphone app) together with a set goal (eg, adding 3000 steps/day to usual PA levels) as a fundamental component of all complex PA interventions. Furthermore, researchers assessing complex PA interventions in RCTs should compare the intervention arm against an active control arm consisting of self-monitoring and a set goal to isolate the net effects of additional intervention components. Along the same lines, policy-makers and practitioners should prioritise simple self-monitoring interventions (eg, pedometerbased or via smartphone apps) unless the effects of additional resource-intensive components above and beyond selfmonitoring alone are rigorously demonstrated. Specifically, advanced smartphone apps should be researched to determine whether they are a cost-effective means of increasing PA, as their effects might predominantly result from their selfmonitoring capacities.  10 inally, this review indicated that some forms of human counselling, particularly remote phone/video counselling, can be potentially very effective components of PA interventions. Given their lower costs compared with in-person counselling, and considering their convenience and suitability in times of pandemics and other scenarios that do not allow for face-to-face contact, remote counselling (complemented with self-monitoring and a set goal) should be further explored as a promising way of combatting yet another pandemic-that of physical inactivity."
