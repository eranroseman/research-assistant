  "title": "Body Weight and Bullying Victimization among US Adolescents",
  "abstract": "chool bullying has become an increasingly significant social and public health issue in the United States (US) during the last few decades. According to the 2016 National Poll on Children's Health, US adults rated bullying as the leading child health concern. Bullying has widely affected children for all ages and races/ethnicities across many countries.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Although there has been some variation in the way how bullying is defined, a consensus has emerged. Bullying is a form of aggressive behavior in which there is an imbalance of power favoring the perpetrators who purposely hurt or distress others.  4 In addition, bullying repeatedly occurs between bullies and victims through a variety of actions, including physical contact, verbal abuse, social exclusion, and misusing electronic devices.  [5] [6] 6] [7]  Bullying victims normally suffer from a wide range of negative health outcomes including feeling sad or hopeless, having low self-esteem, performing poor academically, abusing substances, and even attempting suicide.  [8] [9] [10] [11]  Two theoretical frameworks, such as Conflict Theory and Social Comparison Theory, have been used to explain differential vulnerabilities to bullying. 12,13 A bullying victim is normally a loner, according to the Conflict Theory, may feel powerless against perpetrators, and tends to have a different appearance (eg, underweight or obese) from the majority.  12, 14 According to the Conflict Theory, both underweight and overweight/obese children would be more likely to become bullying victims than their normal weight peers.

      "text": "studies demonstrated a statistically significant association between overweight/obesity and bullying victimization in children and adolescents. However, the association of bullying victimization with underweight youth has been studied less extensively and findings are inconsistent. For example, some research found underweight boys but not underweight girls were more likely to be bullied, whereas others found both underweight boys and girls were more likely to be physically and relationally bullied compared to their normal weight counterparts.  15, 16 urthermore, Reulbach et al  17  and Sweeting et al  18  found that neither underweight boys nor girls were more likely to become bullying victims than their normal weight peers. Moreover, some limitations have been identified in previous studies, such as small sample sizes and failures to consider sex differences on victimization.  [17] [18] ] [19] [20]  Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between body weight status at all levels (including underweight, slightly underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity) and bullying victimization among US adolescents using a nationally representative sample. In particular, we sought to determine if there is a linear or quadratic (U-shaped) association between body weight status and bullying victimization and if the association varies by sex."

YRBS is a biennial survey sponsored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since 1991 to monitor risk behaviors among US high school students. A 3-stage cluster sampling design was used to produce a nationally representative sample of public and private high school students from 9th through 12th grades in the US. Students completed a self-administered questionnaire during a regular class period. Responses were recorded directly on computer-scannable questionnaire booklets. Weighting was applied to each record to adjust for nonresponses and oversampling of black and Hispanic students. Survey procedures were designed to ensure anonymous and voluntary participation. Additional information about the YRBS can be found elsewhere.  21 r the 2013 YRBS, 13,633 questionnaires were completed in 148 public and private schools. Among the completed questionnaires, 50 failed quality control (ie, having < 20 completed responses or having the same answer to \u2265 15 consecutive questions) and were excluded from analysis, resulting in 13,583 usable questionnaires.  21 The school response rate was 77%, and the student response rate was 88%. The national data set was cleaned before data analysis. Missing data were not imputed because of its complex sample design and large sample size."

Students who reported yes to either or both of the 2 questions were considered to be bullied.\n\nBody weight status. Self-reported height and weight (without shoes on) were used to calculate body mass index (BMI, k/m 2 ). BMI percentile was derived according to CDC BMI-for-age-and-sex growth charts for youth aged 2-20 years. A body weight status variable was created to categorize participants into 5 groups:\n\n(1) underweight (< 5th percentile), (2) slightly underweight (5th to < 15th percentile), (3) normal weight (15th to < 85th percentile), (4) overweight (85th to < 95th percentile), and (5) obese (\u2265 95 percentile) groups.  22 otential behavioral confounders. Based on the literature for health-related behaviors that might be associated with both bullying and body weight, 7 behaviors assessed in the YRBS were identified and further tested for the study. For this analysis, behavioral variables were coded dichotomously using cut-points suggested by the YRBS Data User's Guide.  21 The potential behavioral confounders include:\n\n(1) missing school (\"did not go to school \u2265 1 day because felt unsafe at school or on the way to or from DOI:  https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.42.1.1  school during the past 30 days\"),\n\n(2) feeling sad/hopeless (\"stopped doing some usual activities almost every day for 2 weeks or more in a row\"),\n\n(3) having suicidal ideation (\"seriously considered attempting suicide during the 12 month before the survey\"), (4) not being physical active (\"were not physically active that increased heart rate and made breathe hard for a total of at least 60 minutes/day on \u2265 5 of 7 days before the survey\"), (5) watching TV (\"Watched television\u2265 3 hours/ day on an average school day\"), (6) playing sports (\"Played on at least one sports team during the 12 months before the survey\"), and (7) playing video games excessively (\"Played video or computer games \u2265 3 hours/day on an average school day\")."

Approximately 7.7% of students were underweight or slightly underweight, and 30.1% were overweight or obese. The body weight distribution for both female and male students demonstrated a bell-shaped curve (Figure  1 ). Appropriately 25.3% of the students reported having been bullied at least once in the past 12 months (32.1% for girls and 18.4% for boys) as Table  1  shows.\n\nThree potential behavioral confounders (feeling sad/hopeless, having suicidal ideation, and excessive video game playing) were significantly associated with both body weight status and bullying victimization (Table  2 ). Thus, they were included along with demographic variables in the final logistic regression models. While controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and other confounding behaviors, a significant quadratic association emerged between body weight status and bullying victimization overall. Such a significant quadratic association was only in male (p < .001) but not female students (p = .838) (Table  3 ).\n\nBecause the significant quadratic (U-shaped) association between body weight status and bullying victimization only existed in boys (p = .001), adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of independent variables\n\nTable 1 Prevalence of Body Weight and Bullying Victimization, U.S. Adolescents, 2013 Underweight/Slightly Underweight\u1d43 (N = 910) Overweight/Obese\u1d47 (N = 3665) Bullying Victimization c (N = 2992) % 95% CI % 95% CI % 95% CI Total (N = 11825) 7.7 6.8-8.6 30.1 28.4-31.8 25.3 23.9-26.8 Age \u226416 years 7.1 6.3-7.9 30.2 28.2-32.1 28.0 26.1-29.8 >16 years 8.5 7.2-9.8 30.0 27.8-32.1 21.4 19.5-23.3 Sex Girls 3.8 3.2-4.3 13.9 12.5-15.2 32.1 30.1-34.1 Boys 3.9 3.4-4.5 16.2 15.2-17.2 18.4 16.7-20.1 Race/ethnicity White 7.9 6.6-9.2 28.6 26.0-31.2 27.6 25.3-29.9 Black 5.9 4.6-7.2 34.8 31.8-37.8 17.4 15.4-19.3 Hispanic 5.8 3.9-7.6 35.3 31.3-39.4 19.5 17.3-21.7 Other 9.3 7.8-10.7 28.5 25.9-31.2 27.1 24.1-30.0 for bullying victimization were examined only for boys.

DOI:  https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.42.1.1\n\nthe Conflict Theory that a bullying victim tends to have a different appearance (eg, underweight or obese) from the majority. The higher rate of bulling victimization among obese boys is consistent with many previous studies.  2, [23] [24] 4] [25] [26] [27] [28]  Obese youth are likely to be bullied by their peers probably because of the body-weight stigma associated with obesity, which is often depicted in our current society as being lazy, sloppy, incompetent, and lacking in willpower.  [29] [30] 0] [31] [32]  A noteworthy finding from this study is that underweight boys are more likely to be bullied than obese boys. The reason may be because underweight boys are viewed as weak, less masculine, and abnormal based on the sex stereotype for men, which, therefore, makes them more likely to be bullied than any other groups  33  However, these findings should be interpreted with caution as some studies suggest that obese boys but not underweight boys are predominantly the bullying victims.  2, [34] [35] [36]  Another interesting finding is that white boys are more likely to be bullied than black and Hispanic boys. This finding is different from the perspective of Conflict Theory that minority youth are at higher risk for victimization than the ethnic majority youth. However, our finding is consistent with another nationally representative study about adolescents bullying in different racial groups using the Health Behaviors in School-Aged Children survey.  37 The reason presented in that study is that ethnic minority youth may experience more victimization than ethnic majority youth during elementary school but engage in more perpetration during high school years, which has made them less likely to perceive to be bullied.  37 o statistically significant quadratic (U-Shaped) association between body weight status and being bullied was detected in girls. Instead, the prevalence of bullying victimization among girls increased in a slightly linear pattern from underweight to normal weight to obesity, which is inconsistent with the assumption of the Conflict Theory that both underweight and obese girls are more likely to be bullied than their normal weight peers. The relatively lower rates of bullying victimization among underweight girls may be mediated by the female sex stereotype, that is, girls are more likely to conform to the thin ideals communicated by society.  [38] [39] 9] [40] [41]  Thinness is typically a female ideal. Therefore, underweight girls may be less likely to be bullied than any other weight groups including normal weight, overweight, and obese peers.  42, 43 The reasons that obese girls having the highest rate of being bullied may be because of the body-weight stigma associated with obesity. It also may be due to the inequality and imbalance of power of obese girls from the majority based on the Social Comparison Theory.  10, 35 Adolescent girls are in the period when they are heavily reliant on physical cues, such as appearance and body weight status. Obese girls can be less socially accepted by their peers through indirect (eg, appearance-related conversation) and direct (eg, victimization) process.  10, 44 Consequently, they could develop dissatisfied attitudes towards their body shape or body size in their social interactions. This body dissatisfaction could lead to further low selfesteem or low self-worth, which communicates a psychological vulnerability through their behaviors and has been identified as a robust predictor for bullying victimization.  20, 24, 39, 42, 45 Girls are more likely to become bullying victims than boys across all the 5 body weight groups nationwide, which is rarely reported in the literature.  46 From the perspective of the Social Comparison Theory, girls are more likely to be influenced by \"appearance culture\" and more likely to have body dissatisfaction than boys, which might have put girls in a vulnerable position regarding bullying victimization.  [38] [39] 9] [40] [41]  Another explanation is that cyberbullying has increased dramatically within the past decade.\n\nCyberbullying is often considered a potent strategy to hurt more girls than boys, especially via text messages and phone calls, which has led more girls to be bullied than boys.  3, [47] [48] [49]"

      "title": "Limitations and Strengths",
      "text": "Our study has limitations. First, caution is war-ranted in inferring a causal relationship between body weight status and bullying victimization because data were obtained from a cross-sectional study.  17, 24, 50 Second, body weight status and the prevalence of bullying victimization in this study was based on self-report, which might have led to some biased subjective responses. Lastly, due to the nature of secondary data analysis of this study, the analysis may not have controlled for all the major covariates of bullying victimization. Despite these limitations, our study makes an important contribution to the literature. We examined the association between 5 different levels body weight status (including both underweight and obese youth) and being bullied in a nationally representative sample of US youth. We found that a quadratic association between body weights and bullying victimization only for boys but not girls. Interestingly, underweight boys are the most likely to be bullied groups among males whereas underweight girls are least likely to be bullied group among females. By comparison, girls are more likely to be bullied than boys on school property or electronically across all the 5 weight groups. Given the increasing prevalence of bullying victims and the detrimental health outcomes associated with bullying among youth, our findings have special meanings to help researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the adolescents' bullying behaviors.In conclusion, a U-shaped association between body weight and bullying appears to exist in boys but not girls. For female students, the heavier, the more likely to be bullied. The different relations between body weight and bullying victimization among US boys and girls may be mediated by the different body weight stigmas and sex stereotypes in social settings. Future studies are warranted to further investigate the different risk factors associated with bullying victimization in different sexes and weight groups, therefore, to develop targeted anti-bullying interventions, particularly for the most at-risk youth (ie, underweight boys and obese girls)."
