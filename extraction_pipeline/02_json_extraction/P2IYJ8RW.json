  "title": "Effectiveness of Mobile Applications on Medication Adherence in Adults with Chronic Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is frequently suboptimal in adults with chronic diseases, resulting in negative consequences. Traditional interventions to improve adherence are complex and not widely effective. Mobile applications may be a scalable means to support medication adherence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of mobile apps on medication adherence in adults with chronic diseases. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of any mobile application (app) intervention directed at patients with chronic disease to improve medication adherence in comparison with usual care. A random-effects model was used to pool the outcome data. Risk of bias and quality of study were assessed per Cochrane guidelines. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this systematic review involving 1,785 participants, 940 of whom were randomized to a mobile app intervention group and 845 to the usual care group. The meta-analysis showed that the use of mobile apps was associated with a significant improvement in patient adherence to medication (Cohen's d = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.27-0.52; P < 0.001), with a low quality of GRADE evidence. There was no evidence of publication bias (Egger's test; P = 0.81) or substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 29%). In the sensitivity analysis, our findings remained robust to change in inclusion criteria based on study quality (Cohen's d = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33-0.54; P < 0.001). The included apps incorporated 9 features, sorted from high to low based on relative weights (RW): documentation (RW = 0.254), medication reminder (RW = 0.204), data sharing (RW = 0.148), feedback message (RW = 0.104), clinical decision support (RW = 0.097), education (RW = 0.081), customization (RW = 0.049), data statistics (RW = 0.041), and appointment reminder (RW = 0.041). In the subgroup analysis, the effect was not sensitive to study characteristics or app features (0.37 \u2264 P \u2264 0.95). App acceptability was reported by participants in the intervention group in 8 studies: 144 of 156 participants (91.7%) were satisfied with all aspects of the apps. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional care, mobile apps are effective interventions to help improve medication adherence in adults with chronic diseases. Although promising, these results should be interpreted with caution given the low level of evidence and short intervention duration. Future research will not only need to identify ideal app features and the costs to providers but also need to improve the apps to make them user friendly, secure, and effective based on patient-centered theory.",

      "text": "Risk of bias was assessed by 2 reviewers, using the quality rating tool from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  22 We graded the potential bias as high, low, or unclear for each of the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. devices to improve health outcomes, health care services, and health research-can solve this part of the problem.  11, 12 ome mHealth interventions, such as short message service (SMS) and electronic pillboxes,  13, 14  have demonstrated improved medication adherence. However, their availability within usual health care is low and presents a challenge for translation into routine clinical practice. As a type of mHealth, mobile applications (apps) are more diverse and interactive than SMS and cheaper and more convenient than electronic pillboxes.  15 Mobile apps are defined as computer programs or software installed on mobile electronic devices that support a wide range of functions and uses, including television, telephone, video, music, word processing, and Internet service.  16 Industry analysts reported that the number of worldwide mobile subscriptions was around 8 billion in 2019,  17  which means that mobile apps cover a wide range of patients. According to the report from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, the number of mHealth apps available to consumers exceeds 165,000.  18 lthough there are thousands of health apps available, there is minimal evidence for their effectiveness in improving medication adherence. A review article by Mohammadi et  al. (2018) concluded that app interventions were effective for improving medication adherence on patients with cardiovascular disease.  19 However, the main aim of Mohammadi et al.  was to analyze the effects of apps on blood pressure management rather than medication adherence. Only 3 of the articles included in their study demonstrated the effectiveness of apps on medication adherence, and meta-analysis could not be performed. Therefore, it was necessary to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and availability of the apps on medication adherence. The objectives of our systematic review were to (a) assess the effectiveness of mobile apps on medication adherence in adults patients with chronic disease, (b) describe and examine the effect of characteristics of app interventions, and (c) describe participant's perceptions and acceptability of apps."

      "text": "We used the mean effect size approach to pool estimates, which has been widely accepted to guarantee the independence assumption in meta-analysis.  5, 13, 23 Although the adherence measures varied across studies, differences in outcomes between the intervention and control groups can be measured and pooled with appropriate meta-analysis methods.  24 In our study, Cohen's d was calculated as the mean effect size to determine the magnitude of the difference in medication adherence between the intervention and control groups. We calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) for primary study and used an inverse variance random-effects model to pool estimates. A Cohen's d value of 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8 can be respectively considered as small, medium, and large effect size, respectively.  25 e used statistical approaches from the Cochrane Handbook to re-express odds ratios as SMD when missing data were not collected from investigators.  22 The effect size was weighted according to the study sample size. We used the I 2 statistic to measure heterogeneity across the trials for the analysis of each outcome.  22 The substantial heterogeneity was defined as the I 2 statistic exceeding 50% with P < 0.05. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression test, with P < 0.1 considered to indicate the presence of publication bias.  26 r primary analysis included examining the effects of mobile app interventions on medication adherence. Medication adherence can be measured in a variety of ways, when multiple measures were reported for adherence in 1 study, we chose the more objective and reliable measure (e.g., electronic monitoring over pill count and self-report; continuous scale over dichotomized scale).  27 he quality of evidence of primary outcomes was assessed based on the criteria of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and reporting bias as described in the GRADE Quality Assessment Checklist.  28 he relative weighting of each feature of the app was calculated by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP).  29, 30 A 9-point valuation scale ranging from 1 to 9 was used to compare pairwise each feature with each other feature by 2 reviewers."

      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and metaanalysis of the efficacy of mobile apps for medication adherence in patients with chronic disease. The efficacy of apps found in this meta-analysis is close to that of the meta-analysis of Thakkar et al. (2016), which found that SMS interventions medication adherence, with a nearly doubling of the odds of patients achieving medication adherence (Cohen's d = 0.41, OR = 2.11).  13 In other words, if the medication adherence rate of patients with chronic disease is assumed to be 50%, SMS interventions can increase the rate to 67.8%, while app interventions remain consistent. Although the quality of some articles included in this study was not high, the effect estimate was still significantly positive even when we included only high-quality studies. In addition, our analyses found no evidence of publication bias or substantial heterogeneity; therefore, our results are credible.\n\nThe effect size of apps in this study is higher than previously reported in meta-analyses of motivational interviewing (SMD = 0.23),  7  educational (SMD = 0.33),  27  and psychological interventions (SMD = 0.34).  45 It might suggest that mobile apps are more effective on medication adherence of patients with chronic diseases than traditional (non-mHealth) interventions. The effect of apps in this study is also higher than previously reported for electronic reminders, which included SMS, alarm devices, pagers, and beepers (Cohen's d = 0.29).  23 Therefore, we think that apps may improve the medication adherence of patients more effectively than other electronic reminders.\n\nOne review showed that most health apps do not have a unified theoretical basis, which is similar to the result of this study.  46 Without health behavior theory guiding app design, apps may be perceived by patients as not being helpful in promoting medication adherence. The self-determination theory of motivation posits that inner motivation (personal endorsement of health behaviors) promotes long-term behavioral change, but it requires support for 3 behavior needs: (a) competence of medication self-management, (b) personalized choice, and (c) relatedness or connectivity.  47 Therefore, apps need to provide incentive support for patients based on theory to effectively help patients manage their medication, such as providing personalized education for patients or promoting health care providers by sharing health data and reports.\n\nAnother area of interest is the effect of mobile app characteristics. Maybe it's because almost all apps included in our study are advanced, the effect did not change with different functions 278 participants (84.5%) felt that apps improved their independence in managing their medications,  35,36,39,41 (d)  191 of 220 participants (86.8%) believed it could improve effective communication between doctors and patients,  31, 35, 36, 38  and (e) 75 of 98 participants (76.5%) said they would continue to use and share with friends.  41 One study observed that intermittent Internet connectivity issues would affect usage of apps.  42 nother study found about a 25% reduction in the use of apps over the 3-month trial because apps lacked continuous innovation of functions, such as updating contents of health education\n\nVariable Number of Trials Pooled Within Subgroup (95% CI) P Value for Heterogeneity Sample size \u2264 100 7 0.35 (0.05-0.65) 0.66 100 7 0.42 (0.31-0.53) Mean age \u2265 60 5 0.33 (0.14-0.51) 0.37 60 9 0.44 (0.27-0.62) Region Developing countries 3 0.51 (0.29-0.74) 0.28 Developed countries 11 0.36 (0.21-0.52) Type of chronic disease Cardiovascular diseases 6 0.41 (0.28-0.53) 0.50 Stroke 2 0.86 (0.15-1.57) Diabetes 2 0.25 (-0.16-0.66) Other types of diseases 3 0.56 (-0.05-1.17) Intervention duration > 3 months 5 0.35 (0.15-0.55) 0.56 \u2264 3 months 9 0.43 (0.25-0.60) Type of outcome assessing method Self-report 7 0.37 (0.25-0.49) 0.90 Pill count 3 0.44 (-0.51-1.40) MEMS 3 0.43 (0.10-0.77) Unspecified 1 0.56 (0.05-1.07) Medication reminder Yes 10 0.40 (0.23-0.57) 0.95 No 4 0.41 (0.22-0.60) Medication education Yes 7 0.46 (0.20-0.71) 0.46 No 7 0.35 (0.22-0.47) Clinical decision support Yes 4 0.41 (0.23-0.59) 0.93 No 10 0.40 (0.22-0.57) 2-way communication Yes 7 0.41 (0.26-0.55) 0.95 No 7 0.40 (0.16-0.63) Intervention components Application only 7 0.41 (0.29-0.52) 0.90 Not application only 7 0.39 (0.09-0.69) CI = confidence interval; d = effect size; MEMS = medication event monitoring system.\n\nTABLE 3"

      "text": "Effectiveness of Mobile Applications on Medication Adherence in Adults with Chronic Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of apps in the subgroup analysis. Briefly, advanced medication reminder apps are those that have interactive and custom features in addition to a single function for text messaging, education, and data upload.  48 For advanced apps, in addition to medication reminders, the main function that can theoretically improve medication adherence is still unclear. In 1 of the studies we included, there was no significant difference in patients using the app versus the advanced app.  41 However, because it was a small study with short-term follow-up and had limited power to detect meaningful differences in clinical outcomes measures, future research is still needed to verify which features of apps make them more effective. In addition to the effect of medication adherence, complex features may attract more users to download apps, help add to their interest, and contribute to the longevity of their engagement.\n\nIn addition, chronic disorders are more common among elderly people, who may not have good digital literacy, and it may be more difficult for them to use apps.  49, 50 Most current apps are conceived for patients familiar with these technologies,  51  and elderly patients have not been consulted about the design, although it's important to involve patients in the design of apps.  52 We need to be patient-centric and explore additional apps with a novel friendliness user interface that can be applied to most patients. What's more, most apps have been designed for just 1 particular disease, which could be a challenge to long-term use. We also encourage developers and researchers to develop apps and devices suited to patients with multimorbidity. Another area of concern is the privacy and security of patients data. More than 50% of smartphone users refused to use an app because they feared their personal information would be compromised. 53 So all medication apps need a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant server to keep the patient's medication information private.\n\nIn general, the acceptance rate of the participants for mobile apps is relatively high. Most of them were satisfied with the functionality, usability, usefulness, and simplicity of the apps. However, the patients who agreed to participate in the application-based intervention studies generally have good digital literacy. One study found that 37%-39% of patients with chronic disease did not own a smartphone or owned phones without IOS or Android operating systems.  54 But with the growth of smartphone users around the world, barriers to technology and ownership are likely to be rapidly overcome. In the near future, the number of patients who download and apply medication apps will likely increase. All participants obtained the apps free of charge from the app stores or researchers. A systematic review showed that 79.5% (147/185) of the apps that improve medication adherence found in Google Play were free to download, and the rest required a payment at a median cost of AUD 1.88 ($1.23 in U.S. dollars).  48 This shows that mobile phone apps are accessible due to low costs for users who want to improve medication adherence through the mobile apps.\n\nAlthough our study shows that mobile apps are beneficial in improving patient medication adherence, there are still many problems waiting to be further improved. The overall strength of evidence was low as evaluated using the GRADE approach, meaning that further research is very likely to change these estimates of effect. The overall quality of the articles included was also not high. In addition to the lack of rigorous research design, the poor reporting was also an important reason for this result. In the future, researchers should design and conduct studies rigorously based on the quality rating tool for RCTs, especially paying attention to random allocation and the triple blind. In addition, the included RCTs had short intervention duration and follow-up (median, 3 months), suggesting the uncertainty of effect duration. Thus long-term (> 1 year) studies are also needed to estimate the effect of apps on patients who are treated for more than 1 year. What's more, only 2 included studies have provided a cursory report on physicians' satisfaction with the mobile apps, so the usability of apps for health care professionals is still unclear. When using apps in the context of clinical care, a large amount of interaction can take up too much time for the physicians, and too many alerts can exhaust them. It may be a barrier to widespread clinical care use. In addition to the time cost, the costs of developing and managing apps is also unclear. None of the included studies conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the development and use of apps. Future studies must take into account the significant clinical relevance of apps. How much time and money does the providers spend on it? And what frequency of alert and interaction can promote patients adherence and reduce staff workload?"

      "text": "There are several possible limitations in this study. First, although we did not find publication bias by meta-analysis, publication bias cannot be ruled out because this review was restricted to published studies.  55 econd, pooling different adherence measures might be a methodologic defect, although Cohen's d was used to standardize these measures and an agreed meta-analysis method was used to size the pooling effect by us. Third, many studies determined the outcomes by self-reporting, which may cause social desirability bias or recall bias.  56 inally, several moderators factors examined in the subgroup analyses may be cross-confounding, although we found no significant heterogeneity of effects across subgroups. Also, the small number of included trials limited the subgroup analyses, meaning that the findings cannot be considered conclusive."

Future research will need to not only identify ideal app features and costs to providers but also to improve the apps to make them user friendly and secure and to help them remain effective based on patient-centered theory."
