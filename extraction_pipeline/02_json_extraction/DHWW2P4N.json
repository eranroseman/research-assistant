  "title": "Cost-Utility Analysis of a Medication Adherence Management Service Alongside a Cluster Randomized Control Trial in Community Pharmacy",
  "abstract": "Background: It is necessary to determine the cost utility of adherence interventions in chronic diseases due to humanistic and economic burden of non-adherence. Purpose: To evaluate, alongside a cluster-randomized controlled trial, the cost-utility of a pharmacist-led medication adherence management service (MAMS) compared with usual care in community pharmacies. Materials and Methods: The trial was conducted over six months. Patients with treatments for hypertension, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were included. Patients in the intervention group (IG) received a MAMS based on a brief complex intervention, whilst patients in the control group (CG) received usual care. The cost-utility analysis adopted a health system perspective. Costs related to medications, healthcare resources and adherence intervention were included. The effectiveness was estimated as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), using a multiple imputation missing data model. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated on the total sample of patients. Results: A total of 1186 patients were enrolled (IG: 633; CG: 553). The total intervention cost was estimated to be \u20ac27.33 \u00b1 0.43 per patient for six months. There was no statistically significant difference in total cost of medications and healthcare resources per patient between IG and CG. The values of EQ-5D-5L at 6 months were significantly higher in the IG [IG: 0.881 \u00b1 0.005 vs CG: 0.833 \u00b1 0.006; p = 0.000]. In the base case, the service was more expensive and more effective than usual care, resulting in an ICUR of \u20ac1,494.82/QALY. In the complete case, the service resulted in an ICUR of \u20ac2,086.30/QALY, positioned between the north-east and south-east quadrants of the cost-utility plane. Using a threshold value of \u20ac20,000/QALY gained, there is a 99% probability that the intervention is cost-effective. \n Conclusion: The medication adherence management service resulted in an improvement in the quality of life of the population with chronic disease, with similar costs compared to usual care. The service is cost-effective.",

      "text": "Multi-morbidity in an aging population requires treatment with complex medication regimens leading to polypharmacy.  1  Medications are one of the most frequently used and effective therapeutic tools to treat diseases. Patients' adherence to medication, a complex and multifactorial concept, is a key factor to achieve optimal benefits.\n\nFrom the perspective of the patient and the healthcare system, non-adherence is a pressing worldwide health problem. The World Health Organization reported in 2003 that approximately half of patients with chronic treatments are not adherent.  2 Generally, it is estimated that 4% of patients do not initiate treatment, 30% are not adherent after 100 days, and 40% discontinue medications after one year.  3 Lack of medication adherence may lead to poor health outcomes and higher healthcare cost, due to additional physician visits, emergency care, hospitalizations and premature deaths.  4, 5 A systematic review identified the cost of non-adherence for different diseases, with values ranging from $949 to $44,190 per patient per year (values adjusted to 2015).  6 Patients with chronic conditions, such as hypertension, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are particularly vulnerable to non-adherence behaviors, with estimated rates of 50% in patients suffering hypertension,  7  50-60% in asthma,  8  and 70% in COPD.  9 An inadequate management of these diseases may lead to an increased use of healthcare resources, with higher costs associated with CV events attributable to hypertension,  10, 11  poor asthma control  12, 13  and COPD complications.  13, 14 ulti-component interventions  15, 16  have been proposed to improve adherence. A systematic review summarizing the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions found that, although most interventions were cost-effective or cost-saving, variation existed with intervention types.  17 In 2020, a Cochrane review concluded that welldesigned randomized controlled trials were needed to investigate the effects of interventions for improving medicationtaking ability and medication adherence in older adults who were prescribed multiple medications.  18 At an international level, there is extensive evidence supporting the role of pharmacists in adherence management  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  and several programs have eventuated from research. These adherence programs, implemented in several countries, vary in approach and population. For example, the Interdisciplinary Medication Adherence Program in Switzerland,  30  the Cardiovascular medication non-Adherence Tailored Intervention (CATI)  31, 32  and the Medication Monitoring and Optimization (MeMO) in the Netherlands,  33, 34  the Italian medicines use review (I-MUR) for asthma patients,  35  or the New Medicine Service (NMS)  [36] [37] [38]  and the Pharmacy Care Plan (PCP)  39  in England. However, the existing literature on economic evaluations is limited and with none being found in the Spanish community pharmacy setting.\n\nIn Spain, adherence management is identified as a national priority and has been included in a portfolio of Professional Pharmacy Services.  40 A randomized controlled trial in 2017-2018, AdherenciaMED, 41 evaluated in community pharmacy the impact of a novel Medication Adherence Management Service. The service was delivered by community pharmacists trained in a multicomponent intervention based on behavior change models and supported for a practice change facilitator. Patients were followed for six months. Effectiveness at improving medication adherence and clinical outcomes had been reported.  42 The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of the pharmacist-led Medication Adherence Management Service (MAMS) compared with usual care, in patients with treatment for chronic conditions (hypertension, asthma or COPD). This paper reports on the total sample of patients."

It was conducted in six Spanish provinces from October 2017 to April 2018. The target population were patients with pharmacological treatment for one of the three chronic conditions, hypertension, asthma or COPD. All the patients were provided a patient information sheet and signed an informed consent before inclusion. Patients attended six face-to-face monthly visits in the pharmacy's counselling area. More details of study design and characteristics of this cRCT are described in a previous article.  42 tervention Group: Medication Adherence Management Service (MAMS) Service), a tailored service to identify and address adherence or non-adherence, with the aim of improving, maintaining or reinforcing medication adherence. The service consisted of a brief complex intervention based on a combination of multicomponent strategies (behavioral change models, educational, technical) which was personalized according to the characteristics and needs of each patient. The intervention was delivered following a sixstep protocol in monthly face-to-face consultations (Figure  1 ). All data were recorded by the pharmacist in an intervention electronic Data Collection Platform (eDCP), which guided the consultation. The pharmacist \u00b4s fidelity to the intervention protocol was monitored by a practice change facilitator (PCF)  [45] [46] [47]  during their support visits. Full details of the intervention can be found in a published article.  42 ntrol Group: Usual Care Patients attending CG community pharmacies received usual care and completed a total of six visits, in which the pharmacist registered in the control eDCP for control pharmacies the sociodemographic data and other variables defined for this group of patients."

The IG pharmacists recorded the time employed in each visit with the patients, which including time taken for the patient's interview time and data collection. The mean time per patient for the six months for each pharmacist was calculated. Using the salary in the Spanish community pharmacy agreement,  56  the estimated labor rate used was \u20ac0.239/min. The pharmacy cost (investment and maintenance), training and facilitation to support the service were included in the IG arm. Firstly, the costs of the resources required to deliver the MAMS in the community pharmacies and maintenance costs over the time were included. This information was obtained from a previously published Spanish project, related to the cost of implementation of a pharmaceutical service.  57 The investment cost included the patient counselling area, equipment and bibliographic resources. Maintenance cost included rent for the counselling area, utilities, equipment materials and subscriptions. General expenses and marketing were also included. These data were adjusted by the length of this study. Secondly, training cost for each pharmacist in IG was calculated by multiplying the estimated cost of labor rate of a provider pharmacist by total training time. And thirdly, the cost of the pharmacist\u00b4s time spent during the visits with the PCF over six months was assessed. The cost of support visits to the pharmacy by PCF were calculated using the duration of visits and the estimated cost of labor rate.\n\nThe total number of potential patients who could benefit from the adherence service was estimated, based on the population per pharmacy ratio, the prevalence of study diseases in Spain and the estimated prevalence of nonadherence. It resulted in a potential number of 375 patients per pharmacy for 6 months. Using the total time employed by a provider pharmacist and the estimated potential number of 375 patients, the mean cost \"per patient\" was estimated for pharmacy, training and facilitation. https://doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S330371  DovePress Patient Preference and Adherence 2021:15 The HRQoL was measured with the Spanish version of EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L),  58  which was completed by patients of IG and CG at baseline, three and six months. Utility was estimated using the published Spanish tariff.  59 ALYs were calculated as the area under the curve.  60 or missing data for the EQ-5D-5L data at three and six months, a multiple imputation with chained equations was used in order to allocate data at the different times of the study (baseline, 3 and 6 months). The multiple imputation missing data model included as predictive variables EQ-5D-5L indices at baseline and follow-up, province and study disease. Firstly, the missing data were imputed under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, the main analysis (base case). Secondly, completed case analysis was performed corresponding to a scenario where patients who completed all follow-ups can be considered representative of all the sample who initially agreed to participate, assuming data are missing completely at random (MCAR). The utilities shown in both cases have been adjusted for sex, province and disease. A simple pattern mixture model was implemented, following the approach recommended by Faria et al.  61"

These findings are supported by van Boven in two studies for patients with COPD,  34, 68  who reported an increase in medication costs associated with a greater adherence after the pharmaceutical intervention, while other studies the opposite effect was found.  32, 69, 70 For example, Khdour et al-  69  reported that the costs of oral steroid and antibiotic courses were reduced in the intervention group in an intervention directed to increase adherence due to the decrease in exacerbations.\n\nNo significant difference was found in the cost of healthcare resources, such as self-reported visits to the primary care physician, specialist physician, emergency visits and hospital admissions. A small non-significant reduction was observed in all these variables in the intervention group. Other authors  34, 37, 69, 71  have found similar results, although the components used to estimate these costs do vary between studies. Similarly in other studies,  34, [68] [69] [70]  the greatest reduction in costs was mainly associated with the decrease in hospital resources. These results however contrast with those described in two other programs,  32, 39  which reported a non-significant increase in costs associated with the use of healthcare resources after the intervention.\n\nThe MAMS was shown to deliver clinical outcomes 42 with low additional costs of intervention. The global cost of providing the service per patient for six months was estimated around \u20ac27.5 (\u20ac4.55 per patient per month). In the literature reviewed, the intervention cost varies greatly between studies, due to the differences in the intervention schedule (number and type of consultations, training and materials provided, participating agents, duration of the program, etc.), the different methods and units for calculation and country. The intervention cost of the service estimated used in our study is in the lower range between \u20ac25 -\u20ac100, compared to other programs.  32, 34, 35, 37, 68 Other studies have obtained higher intervention costs, due to more complex and longer interventions  39  or by setting a fixed fee of \u00a351.50 for the pharmacist irrespective of the time involved.  70 Therefore, even though our program opted for an intensive intervention (that is, monthly faceto-face interviews) in order to establish and monitor changes in adherence behavior in patients, it has resulted in an intervention cost which is lower than that described in other studies.\n\nThe pharmacist's time costs constituted the highest proportion of costs, 91.2%, with 8.8% spent on costs related to the structure of the pharmacy, initial training and support by the practice change facilitators. As in many health services in primary care, the major investment should be directed to staff time. On average, the pharmacist devoted approximately 20 minutes per patient per monthly visit to service delivery, similar or a bit lower compared to the mean consultation times found in other studies, of 38 min 68 or a mean of 26 min for the initial interview and 14 min for the follow-up interview.  34 Brief complex interventions,  72  due to their brevity, may facilitate pharmacists to incorporate an adherence service as part of their existing workflows.\n\nIn real-world practice, this intervention time and therefore the major cost, for service delivery would be expected to diminish with the accumulated experience and the repetitive practice of the intervention. MAMS is a service that, due to its methodological characteristics and the nature of interventions, based on behavior change models, follows a learning curve, that is, the more times it is practiced by the pharmacist, the better the provision of the MAMS may work. Learning curves are specifically studied in healthcare education and professions where resources are limited.  [73] [74] 4] [75] [76]  Applied to our intervention, it means that to lower the cost of the new service, it should increase experience and practice of pharmacists, obtaining better effects after a repetition practice to complete a learning curve. Tersalvi et al 77 reported similar effects. In addition, a learning synergy may occur in pharmacists who are already providing other different but related services in their pharmacy.  78 espite the costs associated with the use of medication and healthcare resources not differing significantly between study groups, MAMS had a significant positive effect on health-related quality of life of patients. During the study, in the intra-group comparison, the HR-QOL  https://doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S330371"

      "text": "Patient Preference and Adherence 2021:15 2372 increased in both groups of patients. In the case of the control group, it may be due to the increase contact between pharmacist and patient (Hawthorne effect). However, patients in the intervention group experienced almost double the increase of the control group by the end of the study. This is higher than that found in other studies after 12 months of intervention.  39, 69 In the intergroup comparison, a significant difference was observed after the third month. There was also a tendency to increase as the study progressed, similarly to that reported by other authors,  35  although this effect did not become significantly different until the sixth month. MAMS seems to add to well-being and perceived health of the population and that could be due not only to the impact of adherence but to the complexity and components of the pharmacist-patient interaction that used different models of behavior change.\n\nIn the two cost-utility sub-analyses performed, the incremental cost-utility ratio obtained showed that MAMS would be located between the north-east and south-east quadrants of the cost-utility plane. It is interesting that the literature reports conflicting results of the economic impact of adherence interventions with some studies  35, 38, 68, 69  reporting a dominant ICUR and others  39  which reported an ICUR higher than in our study, although this particular program included a more complex intervention on the management of medications. These differences are difficult to interpret but could be due to the use of different interventions, research design and methodologies used.\n\nFinally, in this study, considering a cost-effectiveness threshold in Spain of \u20ac20,000/QALY, the probability of MAMS being cost-effective was 99%. Similar results have been obtained in other programs, with values of 89%, 38 95% 69 and 97%  39  of probability of being cost-effective, while the economic evaluation of the CATI program 32 obtained a higher ICUR and a 0.36 probability of being cost-effective with a willingness to pay of \u20ac20,000/QALY.\n\nAlthough not evaluated in this study, the longer term improved clinical control and management, with the resultant economic benefits, are to be expected. However, since the evidence suggests that adherence is a dynamic process and is subject to change these benefits would be dependent on the continued reinforcement of adherence. Over time, an increased ability in efficacy and efficiency of the pharmacists to deliver the intervention would also be expected, which in turn may have a greater impact on adherence rates with a potential to reduce the time to deliver the intervention which was a critical cost in the cost-effectiveness analysis."

      "text": "A health system perspective was chosen since the main direct healthcare costs, such as medication, visits to physicians and hospitalizations could be robustly collected. However, to use a societal perspective would have been challenging to include with our research design and thus is a limitation. Also, data related to treatment dosages and utilization of healthcare resources were obtained from the patient's self-report, although this methodology is used in other studies.  34 The length of the study may not have allowed the effects of adherence on other variables such as the use of medications or use of healthcare resources to be observed. In contrast, the methodological characteristics and human resources allowed to recruit a large sample of patients. Additionally, the professional skills of the pharmacists who participated and the essential role of the practice change facilitator has been decisive to rigorously measure the fidelity of the intervention."

Longer term studies may be needed as it is suspected that the true gains from patients adhering to their medications may take longer than six to twelve months to have an impact on issues such as control of diseases, hospitalizations rates and use of other healthcare resources. Similarly, costs of intervention may reduce as pharmacists gain greater experience with the service.\n\nThe study highlighted the role of the community pharmacist in addressing adherence and health behavior change in patients about medication use, without overlapping the roles and responsibilities of other healthcare professionals. Community pharmacies-led MAMS may be considered as a valuable service to be integrated in primary care."
