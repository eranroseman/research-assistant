      "text": "Several workers have investigated methanol oxidation in bacteria and none has reported evidence of a pyridine nucleotide-linked me- thanol-oxidizing enzyme (1-3). Tani et al. (6)  described methanol oxidation in yeast that occurs via an oxidase. The data suggest that a flavine nucleotide was involved.\n\nThis paper describes the nicotinamide ade- nine dinucleotide (NAD)-linked methanol-oxi- dizing enzyme in methanol-assimilating yeasts, Pichia pinus and Candida boidianii.\n\nA previous study showed that this enzyme is present in P. pinus and Kloeckera sp. 2201 (4)."

      "text": "Organisms. P. pinus NRRL YB-4025 and C. boi- dianii NRRL Y-2332 were obtained from the Northern Regional Laboratory, Peoria, Ill. Cultures were main- tained as described previously (4).\n\nGrowth conditions. Both cultures were grown as described previously (4) in a synthetic medium con- sisting of: NH4NO, 0.5%; K2HPO 0.2%; MgSO4. 7H3O, 0.05%; yeast extracts, 0.2%; and methanol, 2%.\n\nChemicals: Methanol was purchased from Fisher Scientific Co., Fairlane, N.J. NAD and its phosphate form (NADP), dichlorophenol indophenol, and gluta- thione (GSH) were from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.\n\nPreparation of cell extracts. The cultures were centrifuged at 27,000 x g at 4 C and washed twice with deionized water. The washed cells (5 g, wet weight) were suspended in 30 ml of 0.001 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 5 g of washed, superfine glass beads (Superbrite type 110, 3M Com- pany, St. Paul, Minn.). The suspension, contained in a 100-ml beaker placed in dry ice, was treated in an ultrasonic disintegrator (Branson Sonifier, Stamford, Conn.) fitted with a 2.5-cm probe for 5 min at 1 C and then centrifuged at 27,000 x g for 30 min at 4 C. The clear supernatant was then assayed for the enzyme.\n\n'Present address: Department of Microbiology, Smith Kline & French Laboratories, Philadelphia,  Pa. 19101. Methanol dehydrogenase was assayed, as described previously (4), in a 1-ml system containing: potas- sium phosphate buffer, 100 gmol; NAD, 1 Amol; GSH, 1 umol; and enzyme protein, 10 to 20 ug. To start the reaction, 20 Amol of methanol was added. Protein was measured by the method of Warburg and Christian (7)."

      "text": "Table  1  shows amount of methanol dehydrogenase activity in both yeasts at different pH values; pH  7.5  is optimum for both.\n\nCofactors required to oxidize methanol in a cell-free system. The results in Table  2  indicate that different cofactors affect methanol oxidation in a cell-free system. GSH stimulated the activity; this oxidation requires NAD (NADP cannot replace it).\n\nReplacement of GSH by other thiol com- pounds. Several thiol compounds were tested for their ability to replace GSH. It was found that methanol oxidation in both yeasts depends strongly on GSH; dithiothreitol, cysteine, and sodium dithionite cannot replace it.\n\nPartial purification of enzyme from P. pinus. A crude extract (40 ml) was applied to a column (95 by 2.5 cm) of diethylaminoethyl-cellulose that had been equilibrated with 0.01 M phosphate buffer. The charged column was treated with 300 ml of 0.01 M buffer, 200 ml of 0.1 M buffer, and 500 ml of 0.3 M buffer, each containing 0.001 M GSH. The enzyme was eluted when the column was washed with 0.3 M phosphate buffer. By this method, the enzyme was purified fourfold (Table  3 ). When purified further by ammonium sulfate fractionation or Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, it became inactive. By an alternate method  (Table 3, no. 2) using ammonium sulfate frac- tionation, about fourfold purification was ob- tained. Minus cell-free extract 0 0 Minus NAD plus NAI)P 0 0 a The complete system contained (in a total volume of 1 ml): potassium phosphate buf'fer (pH 7.0), 200 Amol; NAD, 1 ,umol; GSH, 1 gmol; and enzyme protein, 10 to 20 Ag. Reaction was initiated with 20 jlmol of methanol. \" Nanomoles of NADH f'ormed per minute per milligram of' protein.\n\nTABLE :3. Partial purification of the methanol dehy'drogenase of P. pinus TVl Total aTotal sp Puriifi- Method Step (m l)IproeI activity acta cation Stability. At 4 C the enzyme lost all ability to oxidize methanol within 24 h after fourfold purification by ammonium sulfate fractionation or diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatogra- phy; at 50 C it lost its activity within  5 min. Methanol-oxidizing activity did not stabilize when dithiothreitol, GSH, substrate, or a com- bination of GSH and substrate was added during purification, possibly because protecting proteins were removed and sulfhydryl groups oxidized rapidly at the active sites. An inhibition study supported this observation.\n\nInhibitor studies. Para-chloromercuric ben- zoate or iodoacetamide at a concentration of 10-6 M inhibited methanol-oxidizing activity from both yeasts after the enzyme was preincubated for 15 min. Substrate specificity of a partially purified enzyme from P. pinus. The partially purified enzyme showed broader substrate specificity for various primary and secondary alcohols (Table  4 ).\n\nElectron acceptor specificity. Methanol de- hydrogenase activity from the partially purified enzyme is specific for NAD and GSH but not for NADP, potassium ferricyanide, dichlorophenol indophenol, and phenazine methosulfate.\n\nEffect of metal ions. The effect of various metal ions on the oxidation of methanol by the enzyme is shown in Table  5 . None of the metal ions tested stimulated the activity, and it was completely inhibited by Cu and Hg at a concen- tration of 10-4 M. Zn gave 50%c inhibition at this concentration. ZnSO47* H,0 50 CuSO4,5H20 ( MnC12 4H20 102 HgCl20 CaCl22H20 85 aThe enzyme was preincubated at a concentration of 10-' M for 1 h at room temperature and then as- sayed for activity.\n\nI DISCUSSION The results of this study demonstrate that the methanol-assimilating yeasts P. pinus and C. boidienii contain NAD-specific and GSH- requiring alcohol dehydrogenases that oxidize methanol.\n\nIn contrast, methanol dehydrogenases of Pseudomonas strains M27, AM1, and RJ1 were shown to be independent of pyridine nucleo- tides, and required phenazine methosulfate and dichlorophenol indophenol  (1) (2) (3) . An oxidase enzyme that utilizes molecular oxygen has been described for Kloeckera sp. 2201 and C. boidianii (5, 6). The pH optima are 8.5 to 9.0 for the methanol dehydrogenase enzyme in bacteria (2, 3), 7.5 to 9.5 for the methanol oxidase in yeasts, and 7.5 for the enzyme described here.\n\nThe methanol-oxidizing enzyme in bacteria (1, 2) and yeast  (5, 6)  is quite stable, but the partially purified Pichia methanol-oxidizing enzyme is very unstable.\n\nMethanol dehydrogenases reported in the literature have broad specificity toward primary alcohols; the enzyme described here also ex- hibits similar broad specificity.\n\nAn unusual affinity was observed with the Pichia enzyme in that isopropanol was oxidized very rapidly. This reaction has not been ob- served with other alcohol dehydrogenases."
