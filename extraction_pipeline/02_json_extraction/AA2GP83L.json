  "title": "The Cost-Effectiveness of Digital Health Interventions on the Management of Cardiovascular Diseases: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: With the advancement in information technology and mobile internet, digital health interventions (DHIs) are improving the care of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The impact of DHIs on cost-effective management of CVDs has been examined using the decision analytic model-based health technology assessment approach. \n Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the decision analytic model-based studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of DHIs on the management of CVDs. Methods: A literature review was conducted in Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Center for Review and Dissemination, and Institute for IEEE Xplore between 2001 and 2018. Studies were included if the following criteria were met: (1) English articles, (2) DHIs that promoted or delivered clinical interventions and had an impact on patients' cardiovascular conditions, (3) studies that were modeling works with health economic outcomes of DHIs for CVDs, (4) studies that had a comparative group for assessment, and (5) full economic evaluations including a cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and cost-consequence analysis. The primary outcome collected was the cost-effectiveness of the DHIs, presented by incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The quality of each included study was evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. Results: A total of 14 studies met the defined criteria and were included in the review. Among the included studies, heart failure (7/14, 50%) and stroke (4/14, 29%) were two of the most frequent CVDs that were managed by DHIs. A total of 9 (64%) studies were published between 2015 and 2018 and 5 (36%) published between 2011 and 2014. The time horizon was \u22641 year in 3 studies (21%), >1 year in 10 studies (71%), and 1 study (7%) did not declare the time frame. The types of devices or technologies used to deliver the health interventions were short message service (1/14, 7%), telephone support (1/14, 7%), mobile app (1/14, 7%), video conferencing system (5/14, 36%), digital transmission of physiologic data (telemonitoring; 5/14, 36%), and wearable medical device (1/14, 7%). The DHIs gained higher QALYs with cost saving in 43% (6/14) of studies and gained QALYs at a higher cost at acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 57% (8/14) of studies. The studies were classified as excellent (0/14, 0%), good (9/14, 64%), moderate (4/14, 29%), and low (1/14, 7%) quality. \n Conclusions: This study is the first systematic review of decision analytic model-based cost-effectiveness analyses of DHIs in the management of CVDs. Most of the identified studies were published recently, and the majority of the studies were good quality cost-effectiveness analyses with an adequate duration of time frame. All the included studies found the DHIs to be cost-effective.",

      "text": "The application of information technology and mobile internet in the health care industry takes the practice of patient care to the era of digital health. Digital health is the convergence of science and technology with health, health care, living, and society  [1] . According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the broad scope of digital health includes a wide range of subsectors: mobile health, telemedicine, telehealth, wearable devices, and personalized medicine  [2] . Stakeholders, such as health care practitioners and researchers, have adopted digital health interventions (DHIs) aiming to promote access, reduce costs, personalize medicine, and improve outcomes of patient care. Various types of digital devices or technologies are used to deliver the health interventions, such as the short message service (SMS); mobile app; telephone; video conferencing system; digital, broadband, satellite, wireless, or Bluetooth for monitoring and transmission of physiologic data (telemonitoring [TM]); and wearable medical device  [3] [4] [5] [6] ."

      "text": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) cause 17.9 million deaths per year, accounting for 31% of all mortality globally  [7] . It is estimated that the global costs of CVDs will rise from US $863 billion in 2010 to US $1044 in 2030  [8] . The potential benefits of DHIs in CVDs were examined in clinical trials. TM was applied in an intensive follow-up of heart failure (HF) patients after discharge in the TElemonitoring in the MAnagement of Heart Failure study  [9] . Compared with the usual care group, all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the TM group. The number of follow-up days lost to HF-related events was also significantly reduced in the TM group. A randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of CardioFit, an internet-based expert system, in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD)  [10] . Patients in the CardioFit group received 5 Web-based tutorials over a period of 6 months for activity planning and tracking and were in contact with an exercise specialist. Physical activity, measured by a pedometer and self-report, was improved over a period of 12 months. A meta-analysis on 51 studies of DHIs in patients with CVDs or risk factors of CVDs reported that DHIs were associated with reduction of cardiovascular event rates and had a positive impact on risk factors for CVDs  [11] ."

      "text": "In addition to the improved clinical outcomes of DHIs for CVD patients, evaluating the health economic outcomes is also crucial for clinicians, patients, and third-party payers in deciding the role of DHIs for CVD management. Decision analytic modeling is an approach that synthesizes cost-effectiveness evidence of health technologies and interventions in health technology assessment (HTA)  [12] . This approach provides a framework to incorporate relevant clinical probabilities and cost items, simulates outcomes of disease management, and allows cost-effectiveness evaluation of medical interventions. Decision tree and Markov models are 2 commonly used forms of decision analytical modeling in health economic evaluation. In a decision tree, distinct branches are used to represent a potential set of outcomes for the patient cohort managed by an alternative treatment. Outcomes and costs for each branch are combined using branch possibilities to simulate the expected outcomes and costs for the treatment option. In a Markov model, hypothetical patients proceed through different health states over time based on transition probabilities between health states. Outcomes and costs expected by the patient cohort in an alternative treatment group are estimated from subject-time spent in various health states. The confidence level in the output of an economic modeling analysis, in relation to uncertainty in the model inputs, is typically quantified by techniques such as one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. By applying model-based HTA, the cost-effectiveness impacts of various types of health technologies and interventions are compared using findings from corresponding clinical trials  [12, 13] . The implementation cost of DHIs is usually substantial, and HTA is, therefore, essential to inform the decision makers on the potential impact of the DHIs on both clinical and health economic outcomes  [14] . The cost-effectiveness of DHIs is subject to the balance of 3 elements: clinical and economic benefits of DHI, cost of DHI, and payer's willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. A previous review of HTA studies on DHIs indicated that there were few health economic studies of DHIs  [15] ."

Similarly, a 10-year UK analysis also accepted CardioMEMS to be cost-effective with an ICER of \u00a319,274/QALY including direct medical costs  [28] ."

      "text": "Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) is an external device used for monitoring heart rhythm continuously. The WCD alarms the patient by vibration when ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) is detected. If the patient does not respond to the alarm, the WCD then delivers electric shocks to resuscitate the patient from presumed SCA. The cost-effectiveness of WCD against sudden cardiac death in patients who require temporary removal of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was examined  [32] . WCD gained higher QALYs and saved total cost (including direct and indirect costs) when compared with discharge-to-skilled nursing facility (by .076 QALYs and US $6681) and in-hospital stay (by .039 QALYs and US $26,001)."

      "text": "This is the first systematic review of a decision analytic model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of DHIs in the management of CVDs. This review identified a small but growing body of evidence (14 studies) evaluating the cost-effectiveness of DHIs. These findings were similar to those of a previous review (on cost-effectiveness of telehealth interventions for HF patients) where 7 studies assessed both costs and effectiveness outcomes comprehensively  [33] .\n\nThe assessment of the study quality found that the majority of the methodology items (including comparators, time horizon, choice of models and health outcome measures, and analytical methods; Multimedia Appendix 2) met the requirements of the CHEERS checklist, indicating the scientific rigor of the modeling approaches applied in the included studies. All the 14 included studies were conducted in developed countries, suggesting that DHIs were more ready to be implemented in developed regions. Most of the studies were funded by a public organization (6/14, 43%), followed by the industry (3/14, 21%), showing that both the public sectors and the technology industry have a strong interest to implement cost-effective DHIs for CVD management in the health care system.\n\nThe DHIs that showed to be cost saving were SMS for CHD patients  [19] , telephone support for HF patients  [20] , wearable medical device for patients at risk of SCA  [32] , and video conferencing systems for prenatal screening  [22]  and stroke patients  [23, 25] , whereas the DHIs found to incur higher costs were mobile app for HF patients  [21] , video conferencing systems for stroke management  [24, 26] , and TM for HF patients  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The type of DHIs is, therefore, one of the influential cost drivers in the management of CVD patients.\n\nThe impact of a technology on health economics is highly subjected to the difference between the technology cost and the change (reduction or increase) in health care resource utilization as a result of the clinical effect of this technology. For instance, the effective technologies improving the survival rate of stroke patients inevitably increased the total treatment costs associated with long-term care for stroke survivors. The cost-effectiveness of the technology was influenced by both the difference in cost and in QALY gained. In this review, all studies (except one in which the time frame was not declared  [21] ) of DHIs for HF, CHD, CoHD, and SCA patients had used a long-term time frame (ranged from 5 years to lifelong). Both short-and long-term models were used for stroke. As shown by the studies of the Telestroke network, the cost-effectiveness of DHI improved in models with lifelong versus short-term (90 days and inpatient stay) time horizon  [24] [25] [26] . The time horizon of the model needs to be adequate to capture the QALYs gained by the technology."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This systematic review was limited by the search approach. Only studies written in the English language were included, and limited databases with fixed number keywords were used. Some relevant studies, therefore, might not be identified by this search approach, limiting both the total number and origins of studies (all in developed countries) included. The search was also limited to studies conducted by decision analytic modeling. Despite the fact that the decision analytic model-based methodology allows a cost-effectiveness analysis of multiple treatment strategies (supported by the evidence of corresponding clinical trials) for disease management, economic evaluations conducted alongside clinical trials produce valid and rigorous cost-effectiveness evidence. Further review of cost-effectiveness studies of DHIs for CVDs conducted alongside clinical trials is highly warranted."

      "title": "Implications",
      "text": "Despite the small number of model-based health economic analyses on DHIs for CVD management, the majority were ranked to be good quality health economic evaluations and were conducted in the past 5 years. It showed an up-and-rising demand for cost-effective application of DHIs in the management of CVD patients. The development of DHIs has blossomed with the advancement of technology on the internet and mobile devices over the past 2 decades. An increasing number of digital health tools, including wearable and smart devices, make early or real-time detection, monitoring, and intervention possible for CVD patients to prevent events with high morbidity and mortality. Model-based health economic analysis is a well-accepted tool used in the technology appraisal process by national institutes, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, to inform the clinical criteria and intervention cost for reasonable cost-effective use of health technology. In this review, the decision analytic model-based analyses evaluated the cost-effectiveness of DHIs and identified scenarios in which DHIs were likely to be accepted as cost-effective. The evidence generated by the health economic analyses facilitates the timely implementation of digital technologies in health care systems. Quality research is, therefore, highly warranted in health economic evaluation of DHIs for the management of chronic illnesses, in both developed and developing countries."
