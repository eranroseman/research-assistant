  "title": "A Trial of Financial and Social Incentives to Increase Older Adults' Walking",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Despite evidence that regular physical activity confers health benefits, physical activity rates among older adults remain low. Both personal and social goals may enhance older adults' motivation to become active. This study tested the effects of financial incentives, donations to charity, and the combined effects of both interventions on older adults' uptake and retention of increased levels of walking. Study design: RCT comparing three interventions to control. Data collection occurred from 2012 to 2013. Analyses were conducted in 2013-2016. Participants: Ninety-four adults aged Z65 years from Philadelphia-area retirement communities. Intervention: All participants received digital pedometers, walking goals of a 50% increase in daily steps, and weekly feedback on goal attainment. Participants were randomized to one of four groups: (1) Control: received weekly feedback only; (2) Financial Incentives: received payment of $20 each week walking goals were met; (3) Social Goals: received donation of $20 to a charity of choice each week walking goals were met; and (4) Combined: received $20 each week walking goals were met that could be received by participant, donated to a charity of choice, or divided between the participant and charity. Main outcome measures: Mean proportion of days walking goals were met during the 16-week intervention and 4-week follow-up period. Results: After adjusting for baseline walking, the proportion of days step goals were met during the 16-week intervention period was higher in all intervention groups versus controls (relative risk, 3.71; 95% CI\u00bc1.37, 10.01). During the 4-week follow up period, the proportion of days step goals were met did not differ in intervention groups compared to control (relative risk, 2.91; 95% CI\u00bc0.62, 13.64). \n Conclusions: Incentive schemes that use donations to a charity of choice, personal financial incentives, or a combination of the two can each increase older adults' initial uptake of increased levels of walking.",

      "text": "egular physical activity provides substantial health benefits, but less than half of all adults achieve recommended levels of physical activity, and adults aged \u2265 65 years are the least likely to be physically active.  1  If they did exercise regularly, they might benefit from decreased risks of obesity, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and premature mortality,  2, 3  and may also have psychological and cognitive benefits.  4 One way to address this is to develop programs for older adults that promote a broadly applicable and feasible form of exercise.\n\nWalking is one such exercise. Walking programs are feasible and safe, are generally acceptable and accessible to previously sedentary individuals, and do not require additional resources, unique training, or specialized equipment.  5 Walking is also measurable, with clearly identifiable individual targets that are associated with health improvements.  6 Studies have shown that programs that implement goal setting and feedback using pedometers to record daily step counts can increase walking and improve BMI and blood pressure.  7  complementary strategy for changing health behaviors is to offer a financial incentive if a person achieves behavioral goals. This approach capitalizes on evidence from behavioral economics that suggests people generally have short time horizons and experience difficulty trading off immediate gratification for delayed health benefits.  8 In recent research, financial incentives have been found to triple long-term tobacco-cessation rates, increase weight loss, improve medication adherence,  [9] [10] [11]  and increase walking and other physical activity in the short term.  12, 13 lthough pedometer interventions to increase walking have been shown to be feasible for older adults, few studies have examined the effectiveness of financial incentives in this population. The findings to date have been mixed: One short-term study  14  found that financial incentives led to 38% of older adult participants meeting public health recommendations for weekly physical activity, compared with only 6.7% in the control arm. In another study that tested the effects of lottery financial incentives and online peer networks on older adults' walking,  15  intervention participants were no more likely to meet walking goals than comparison participants during the 16-week intervention or 8-week follow-up period. This study, however, enrolled participants with high baseline levels of walking, an important characteristic that may have reduced the intervention's effects. Further research is needed on what types of incentives would be most effective for older adults who have low levels of walking and are capable of walking more.\n\nIncentive programs for older adults can take advantage of unique characteristics of this population. Older adults may respond to incentives tied not simply to personal monetary gains but to emotionally rewarding social goals such as charitable donations.  16, 17 If money donated to a social goal is as effective as, or more effective than, money given to the person, this supports an ethically appealing and potentially more cost-effective approach to incentives.\n\nThe use of charity incentives could also avoid one drawback of financial incentives, which is that providing monetary rewards may reduce intrinsic motivation, thus making continuation of the behavior unlikely when incentives are taken away.  18 Self-determination theory  19  suggests that charitable donations may increase rather than decrease intrinsic motivation by allowing individuals to fulfill basic psychological needs, including social relatedness and autonomy, if they have control over what charity their earnings will support.  12 he objective of this study was to test the effects of social goals on older adults' initial uptake and short-term retention of increased levels of walking. The study used a four-arm design to compare the effects of donations to a charity of choice, personal financial incentives, and combined effects of social goals for charity donations and financial incentives on older adults' uptake and retention of increased levels of walking, with a no incentive control group whose participants received only feedback on their walking. It was hypothesized that walking levels would be higher in all incentive groups compared with control."

      "text": "Participants were recruited from Philadelphia-area retirement communities beginning in July 2012, with data collection ending in October 2013. Participants were adults aged Z65 years, who had access to a computer with high-speed Internet connection, could walk 0.25 miles without stopping, wanted to be more physically active, and did not report current or recent pedometer use. Participants needed to have access to a computer with a highspeed Internet connection to enable transmission of pedometer data via the Internet to a secure study server. This could be a personal computer or a shared computer within their retirement community. To ensure that participants could safely begin a walking program, exclusion criteria were serious health conditions including recent myocardial infarction or stroke; recent orthopedic surgery; severe cardiac, lung, renal, or rheumatologic disease; neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer or Parkinson disease; a major psychiatric disorder; or excessive alcohol consumption. Participants reporting serious health conditions who wished to enroll could do so after providing a clearance form signed by their personal physician. Participants with baseline walking levels 49,000 steps were excluded from the study because of the potential for a ceiling effect.\n\nThis protocol was approved by the IRB of the University of Pennsylvania and all participants provided informed consent. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01643538.\n\nParticipants completed screening through a study website or over the phone with a research assistant. Individuals who were eligible based on their screening responses then scheduled an inhome meeting with a research assistant. At the meeting, participants gave informed consent and were provided a waist-worn Fitbit Ultra activity tracker ( www.fitbit.com ). The research assistant connected the device to the participant's computer for wireless or broadband transmission of step counts and provided a detailed demonstration of use of the device and the study website. Participants then entered a 14-day run-in period during which they were asked to wear their pedometer each day and connect their pedometer to their computer each night to measure their baseline level of walking and ability to adhere to study procedures. To account for the monitoring effects of pedometer use,  7  baseline daily steps were calculated using pedometer data from Days 8-14, and data from Days 1-7 were discarded.\n\nOnce baseline levels of walking were established, participants were given the goal of increasing their daily steps by 50% on Z5 days each week for the next 16 weeks. For example, a participant who walked an average of 5,000 steps per day was given a goal of 7,500 steps per day on Z5 days each week. Walking goals were capped at 10,000 steps per day, so individuals walking more than 6,666 steps per day at baseline were given a daily goal of 10,000 steps, rather than a full 50% increase, to prevent inappropriately high goals requiring participants to walk well over the recommended physical activity guidelines.\n\nGoals were set as a proportional increase rather than a standard target (such as 10,000 steps per day) or standard increase (such as 2,000 additional steps per day) to provide appropriately challenging but achievable goals for participants with varied fitness and activity levels. A 50% increase would allow many older adults  6  to move from a \"sedentary\" (o5,000 steps/day) level of walking and attain the positive health outcomes associated with this change.  20, 21 Although some older adults will still be \"sedentary\" with a 50% increase in walking, prior research suggests that older adults can attain fitness benefits from even very modest increases in physical activity,  22, 23  and that their willingness to join a walking program decreases as the amount of additional walking required increases, suggesting that more-ambitious goals could drive away the individuals who would benefit the most.  24"

      "title": "Randomization and Intervention",
      "text": "Following establishment of walking goals, the study coordinator requested arm assignment via a web-based platform that assigned participants to the four study arms using simple central computerized randomization. Each participant had an equal (0.25) probability of being randomized to each arm. The allocation sequence was generated dynamically by a randomization program and research team members were unable to predict future assignments. Arm assignments were communicated to participants via an automated secure website message and e-mail. Owing to the nature of the interventions, participants and research coordinators could not be blinded to arm assignment. Data analysts and investigators were blinded to arm assignment until collection and analysis of primary outcome data were complete.\n\nControl arm participants wore their pedometers each day and connected the device to their computers each evening to upload their walking data via the Internet to the study server. Each morning they received an automated e-mail or text message that their data were received by the data tracking system. Each week, participants received automated e-mail feedback about how often they met their walking goal in the previous 7 days.\n\nFinancial Incentive arm participants received the same information as Control arm participants. In addition, they received $20 each week that they met their walking goal on Z5 of the past 7 days. Each week, participants received an automated e-mail that described how often they had met their walking goals in the last 7 days and therefore whether they would receive a $20 payment. If the goal was met, participants received a mailed check.\n\nSocial Goals arm participants received the same information as Control arm participants. In this arm, $20 was donated to a charity of their choice each week that they met their walking goal on Z5 of the past 7 days. At the beginning of each week, participants used the online platform to select the charity they would donate their earnings to if their goal was met. An initial list was provided by the study team, and participants could contact the team if they wished to donate to a charity that was not yet listed. Each week, participants received an automated e-mail that described how often they had met their walking goals in the last 7 days and therefore whether their chosen charity would receive a $20 payment. If the goal was met, participants received a mailed donation acknowledgement. The charities received the names of participants who donated along with the donations.\n\nCombined arm participants received the same information as Control arm participants. In addition, $20 was available for them to receive directly, donate to a charity of their choice, or share between the two for each week that they met their walking goal on Z5 of the past 7 days. At the beginning of each week, participants used the online platform to select whether they wanted to keep, donate, or share their earnings if they met their goal. If they chose to donate or share the money, they also selected which charity they would donate their earnings to, and if they shared the reward, they selected the dollar amount they would keep and the amount they would donate. An initial list of charities was provided by the study team, and participants could contact the team if they wished to donate to a charity that was not yet listed. Each week, participants received an automated e-mail that described how often they had met their walking goals in the last 7 days and therefore whether they, their chosen charity, or both would receive a payment. If money was donated, participants received a mailed donation acknowledgement. If money was kept, participants received a mailed check.\n\nAfter the 16-week intervention, all participants entered a 4-week follow-up period during which the interventions were no longer available but participants continued to wear their pedometers and connect the devices to their computers each night. They continued to receive daily automated messages that their step counts were received by the study server and weekly automated messages about how often they had met their walking goal in the previous 7 days."

All data were transmitted to the Way to Health integrated research platform.\n\nParticipants completed an online survey to provide baseline information on their gender, age, educational attainment, employment status, annual household income, race/ethnicity, mood, health behaviors, and health status.  25 The survey also included the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire to assess participants' locus of motivation for increasing their walking  26  and the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, a measure of time perspective.  27 Also, participants completed assessments of walking Harkins et al / Am J Prev Med 2017;52(5):e123-e130 e125\n\nMay 2017 barriers, walking confidence, current weekly minutes of moderate physical activity, and social support.  [28] [29] ] [30] [31] [32]  The primary outcome was the mean proportion of days that step-per-day goals were achieved by participants in each experimental group during the 16-week intervention period. This outcome was chosen rather than mean steps per day as the high variability in the latter would require a very large sample size to detect differences between groups. Secondary outcomes were the mean change from baseline in the number of steps per day during the intervention period, the mean proportion of days step-per-day goals were attained during the 4-week follow up, and proportion of days step-per-day goals were attained during intervention compared with follow up."

      "text": "The primary outcome of interest was the mean proportion of days that step-per-day goals were achieved in each experimental group during the 16-week intervention. It was estimated that a sample of 80 participants would result in 85% power to detect an increase of 0.2 in the proportion of days in which step-per-day goals were met in any intervention arm. This estimate made a Holm-Bonferroni correction of the Type I error by doing a sequential test initially at an alpha level of 0.025 (assuming no interaction between the personal financial incentives and the social goals incentives). The desired sample size was inflated by 25% to accommodate projected attrition with plans to enroll 100 participants in the study.\n\nDescriptive analyses were completed and differences across groups were examined. All analyses were intent-to-treat testing for differences between the four arms. Analysis of variance or Wilcoxon tests were used to test differences between groups for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. For the primary analysis, a generalized estimating equations approach accommodating repeated, weekly measures of the outcome of interest was implemented. The proportion of days the step goal was met was operationalized as the number of days the step goal was met during the week divided by 7 days; therefore, missing step data on a particular day were treated as not meeting the step goal on that day. Analyses included adjusting for baseline levels of walking. Descriptive analyses were used to analyze process data including the distribution of charity and personal financial incentive selections for the combined treatment group. SAS, version 9 was used for all analyses. Analyses were conducted in 2013-2016."

      "title": "RESULTS",
      "text": "Ninety-four participants from four retirement communities were randomized, out of 125 people who completed the eligibility assessment (Figure  1 ). Participants' average age was 80.3 years. Seventy-four percent were female, and 98% were Caucasian. Sixty-one percent had at least a bachelor's degree, and 98% were retired. Only 12% reported being in fair or poor health.\n\nAt baseline, participants walked an average of 4,556 (SD\u00bc2,624) steps per day. Based on arm-specific corresponding daily step goals, this translated into an average daily goal of approximately 6,379 steps per day, across all study arms (Table  1  includes arm-specific daily step goals). Participants in the Combined arm had lower levels of mean baseline steps (4,110) compared with participants in the Control (4,851), Financial Incentives (4,794), and Social Goals (4,654) arms (p\u00bc0.001). There were no significant differences between groups in demographic characteristics (Table  1 ), baseline locus of motivation, time perspective, walking barriers, walking confidence, current weekly minutes of moderate physical activity, and social support (data not shown).\n\nSeventy-nine participants (84% of those randomized) completed the full 16-week intervention and 4-week follow up. There were no differences in age, gender, baseline walking, or arm between those who completed the study and those who dropped out. During the 16week intervention period, the proportion of days step goals were met was significantly higher in all intervention groups compared with control (relative risk, 3.71; 95% CI\u00bc1.37, 10.01) (Figure  2 ). No significant differences were found between the three intervention arms.\n\nDuring the 4-week follow-up period, daily steps declined in all groups and proportion of days step goals were met did not differ in intervention groups compared to control (relative risk, 2.91; 95% CI\u00bc0.62, 13.64). The overall probability of meeting walking goals was higher Harkins et al / Am J Prev Med 2017;52(5):e123-e130\n\nduring the intervention period compared with the follow-up period for participants in all arms (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI\u00bc1.10, 1.34).\n\nAverage daily step counts during the intervention were 1,046.17 (SD\u00bc1,711.06) steps higher than baseline in the Control arm, 2,348.51 (SD\u00bc2,007.71) steps higher than baseline in the Financial Incentives arm, 2,562.26 (SD\u00bc1,946.77) steps higher than baseline in the Social Goals arm, and 1,692.80 (SD\u00bc1,068.34) steps higher than baseline in the Combined arm (Figure  3 ).\n\nThough the mean change in daily steps from baseline to intervention period appeared higher in intervention groups compared with control, these measures had large CIs and did not reach significance (average mean difference in any treatment group versus control, 384.99; 95% CI\u00bc -90.16, 860.15). Mean differences in   Social Goals arm participants had the opportunity each week to select the charity they would donate their earnings to if their goal was met. Of the 24 receiving the intervention, two participants (8%) elected to donate to more than one charity throughout the course of the study.\n\nCombined arm participants had the opportunity each week to select whether they wanted to keep, donate, or split their earnings if their goal was met. Of the 28 participants receiving the intervention, 17 participants (61%) selected only to keep their earnings and 8 (29%) selected only to donate their earnings. Two participants (7%) sometimes selected to keep their earnings and sometimes selected to donate, and one participant (4%) selected to split earnings between self and charity."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This RCT showed that incentives that use donations to a charity of choice, personal financial incentives, or combined charity donations and personal financial incentives each increase older adults' initial uptake of increased levels of walking. However, the effects decreased and were no longer significant after the interventions were discontinued. The absence of a difference between the three intervention groups suggests that these interventions may be equally effective, though this study was powered only to show a difference between each intervention and the control group. The study design was conservative, as dropouts were included in analysis as treatment failures; thus, the true intervention effects may have been even larger.\n\nAlthough absolute changes in daily walking were modest, previous studies have shown health and fitness benefits associated with physical activity increases of as little as 1 hour a week for older adults  22, 23  and older adults may be less willing to enroll in programs requiring a more drastic increase in walking.  24 Future studies should consider graduated approaches in which participants' step goals continue to increase over time to reach recommended levels of physical activity.\n\nWhen given the choice between personal financial incentives and charitable donations, as in the combined group, participants were more likely to keep their earnings than to donate or share them. Future research should examine the comparative effectiveness of these interventions and further explore participant preferences. This work builds upon previous studies examining the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase walking in older adults. One previous study found that financial incentives successfully increased older adults' walking.  14 owever, the study duration was only 4 weeks, participants were relatively young (average age, 60 years), and no follow-up occurred to ascertain whether effects persisted after incentives were removed. Another recent study found that lottery financial incentives and online peer networks had no effect on older adults' walking, but high baseline levels of walking may have limited intervention effectiveness.  15 his study attempted to address limitations of the previous trials in the study design. In particular, individuals with high baseline levels of walking were excluded to prevent inappropriately high daily step goals and to assure that the intervention was targeted at those most likely to benefit. In addition, the charitable donations were added as an incentive scheme to capitalize on older adults' increased focus on emotionally important goals.  16 he results suggest that charity-based incentives may be an effective part of an exercise program to motivate walking among older adults who want to increase their daily exercise. This result has potentially great public health importance as it suggests an incentive-based exercise program can achieve both a personal health benefit and a socially important goal.\n\nFuture studies should build on this work with a focus on sustainability of behavior change over time. Potential strategies include examination of how study design could contribute to the development of daily walking as a habit.  33 At least one trial using a habit formation model to increase activity in older adults is currently underway.  34, 35 In addition, the optimal size, nature, and timing of incentives to encourage long-term behavior maintenance are still to be determined. Also, variations such as combinations of immediate and delayed incentives, periodic incentives, and commitment contracts, which have shown promise in increasing exercise in workingaged populations, 36 should be explored.\n\nThe idea of charity incentives for exercise is not new. Relay for Life and other charity runs and walks combine physical activity with charitable fundraising, and now smartphone apps, websites, and specially designed pedometers permit individuals to earn for a cause outside of organized events. The presence of these programs suggests their feasibility and appeal, and a large-scale trial is currently underway in Singapore, comparing the effects of financial incentives and charitable donations on physical activity in workplace populations.  37 However, prior to this study, the effect of this type of incentive on older adults' exercise levels had not been tested."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study has limitations. Because the study population was primarily highly educated older white women in relatively good health, the results may not be generalizable to other socioeconomic and racial groups, or to individuals with poor health status. In addition, only participants who were interested in increasing their walking were enrolled. These results may not generalize to individuals who do not already desire to be more active. The sample size was relatively small, which limited the ability to detect differences in secondary outcomes with high variability, such as mean actual step count. Power may have been reduced by unequal distribution of participants between arms, which resulted in a smaller than planned control group. The study period was relatively short, and it is uncertain whether the effects would be sustained even if incentives were continued for a longer time period."
