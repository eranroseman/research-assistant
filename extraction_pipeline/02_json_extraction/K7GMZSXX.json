  "title": "Improving multimodal physical function in adults with heterogeneous chronic pain; Protocol for a multisite feasibility RCT",
  "abstract": "Background: Chronic pain is associated with substantial impairment in physical function, which has been identified as a top concern among persons with pain. GetActive-Fitbit, a mind-body activity program, is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvement in physical function among primarily White, sedentary individuals with pain. In preparation for a multisite efficacy trial, we must examine feasibility across multiple sites with diverse patient populations. Here we describe the protocol of a multisite, feasibility RCT comparing GetActive-Fitbit with a time-and attention-matched educational comparison (Healthy Living for Pain). We aim to 1) test multisite fidelity of clinician training; 2) evaluate multisite feasibility benchmarks, including recruitment of chronic pain patients taking <5000 steps/day and racial and ethnic minorities; and 3) optimize fidelity and study protocol in preparation for a future multisite efficacy trial. Methods: Clinician training fidelity was assessed via roleplays and mock group sessions. Feasibility (i.e., recruitment, acceptability, credibility, adherence, satisfaction), multimodal physical function (e.g., self-report, 6-Minute Walk Test, step-count), and other psychosocial outcomes are assessed at baseline, posttest, and 6 months. Protocol optimization will be assessed using exit interviews and cross-site meetings. Results: The trial is ongoing. Clinician training is complete. 87 participants have been recruited. 54 completed baseline assessments and randomization, 44 are mid-intervention, and 9 have completed the intervention and posttest. Conclusions: This study addresses the critical need for feasible, acceptable mind-body-activity interventions for chronic pain that follow evidence-based guidelines and improve all aspects of physical function across diverse populations. Results will inform a future fully-powered multisite efficacy trial.",

      "text": "Chronic pain (i.e. pain that persists for >3 months  [1, 2] ) is highly prevalent, engenders a significant economic burden  [3] , and is challenging to treat  [4] . It is among the most common chronic conditions in the US, with 50.2 million adults (20.5%) reporting that they experience pain on most days or every day  [5] . Physical function, a marker of overall health and wellbeing  [6] , is a multidimensional construct defined by the ability to perform activities of daily living  [7] , and has consistently been identified as a top concern by patients with chronic pain  [8] . A substantial body of research documents the relationship between chronic pain and physical function  [6, 9] , and indicates that this relationship persists regardless of pain location or severity  [10, 11] .\n\nWalking, one of the simplest, safest, and most accessible forms of physical activity, has been shown to improve physical function outcomes among patients with chronic pain  [12, 13] . Indeed, among persons with pain, who tend to be more sedentary on average (i.e. taking <5000 steps per day)  [12, 14, 15] , walking has been identified as a preferred method of activity  [14] , and is acceptable, beneficial, and unlikely to cause harm in this population  [14, 16] . Nevertheless, among some individuals with chronic pain, pain catastrophizing and fear of increased pain as a result of walking have been identified as important barriers and may be associated with decreased walking program uptake or adherence  [14] [15] [16] [17]  as well as decreases in physical function  [18] [19] [20] [21] . Mind-body skills addressing catastrophic thinking about pain and fear avoidance can bypass these barriers to activity and may be an effective way to increase walking and thereby increase physical function among individuals with chronic pain.\n\nAlthough the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations specify that physical function should be a required outcome in pain clinical trials, few studies include it  [22] [23] [24] . Further, to our knowledge, no trials to date have included the recommended comprehensive assessment of physical function using self-report, performance-based, and objective outcomes. To address this critical gap, we used the fear avoidance model and iteratively designed, developed, and refined the GetActive-Fitbit program (Fig.  1 )  [25] .\n\nGetActive-Fitbit is a feasible, acceptable, and credible mind-body program that targets increased walking and utilizes Fitbit step tracking to provide real-time feedback and reinforcement of step goals  [26] . GetActive-Fitbit is associated with sustained improvement in all aspects of physical function among sedentary adults with heterogenous chronic pain, as well as with improvement in its putative mechanisms  [26] . Although successful, our feasibility trial had several limitations. First, we recruited participants from an urban hospital that sees primarily non-Hispanic White patients, which limited racial and ethnic diversity in the sample. Given the high prevalence of chronic pain among racial and ethnic minorities  [27] , as well as underrepresentation in clinical trials  [28] , it is important to test the feasibility and acceptability of our intervention among a sample representative of US population demographics with respect to racial and ethnic diversity. Second, our feasibility study recruited from only one site. Given our goal of eventually implementing the intervention in routine care across pain clinics in the US, it is important to test our ability to implement our study procedures across geographically diverse clinics. Third, despite global improvements in self-reported physical function in our feasibility trial, we observed improvement in objective physical function (i.e., stepcount) only among individuals who took fewer than 5000 steps/day at baseline (e.g., sedentary  [26, 29] ). Before conducting a fully-powered efficacy trial it is important to accurately select sedentary participants who are best positioned to benefit from the intervention. Fourth, the initial study did not include an attention-matched control group to compare against the group receiving mind-body and activity skills. Establishing the feasibility of our comparison condition is an important part of preparing for a future efficacy trial.\n\nThe current study builds upon our prior work and aims to address its limitations. We will conduct a multisite feasibility randomized controlled trial of GetActive-Fitbit versus a time-and attention-matched educational control (Healthy Living for Pain; HLP) among a diverse sample of sedentary adults with chronic pain recruited from pain clinics in three medical centers distributed across the South, the Midwest, and the Northeast. The present study has three aims: (1) Testing multisite fidelity of training and implementation of GetActive-Fitbit vs HLP among adults with heterogeneous, non-malignant, musculoskeletal chronic pain; (2) Evaluating multisite feasibility benchmarks, including ability to select chronic pain individuals who are sedentary, retain participants through 6-month follow-up, and recruit >38% racial and ethnic minorities (i.e., non-White and/or Hispanic/Latino  [30] ) and (3) Optimizing and refining our fidelity and study implementation procedures in preparation for a future fully-powered multisite efficacy RCT. Here we describe the study protocol."

Fidelity to the study protocol was assessed via recorded mock group sessions at each of the study sites. Mock groups were attended by research assistants assigned to roleplay case studies, which were scripted and developed by a clinical psychologist based on prior clinical and research experience with chronic pain patients.

Participants receive home practice assignments to reinforce session content, such as reviewing the manual and listening to skills-based audio recordings (e.g., deep breathing).\n\nParticipants also receive daily text message reminders with a survey that logs home practice.\n\n3.6.1.1. Fitbit step count. Participants randomized to GetActive-Fitbit receive a Fitbit Inspire 3 and charger free of cost. An RA distributes the Fitbit at the first in-person group session and instructs each participant to sync the device to a Bluetooth-compatible smartphone using the free Fitbit application. Participants are expected to wear the Fitbit from the first session to post-assessments, excluding sleeping, bathing, and swimming. The RA uses Fitabase, a secure web-based platform, to remotely track participant wear adherence. The RA sends weekly emails to remind participants to charge and sync their device. The RA also uses Fitabase to calculate individualized weekly step count goals, which are emailed to participants prior to the group session. Consistent with prior work  [26, 39] , step goals are increased by 10% if participants reach their weekly goal, maintained if they do not reach their goal, and set to 10% more than their actual step count for the week if they miss their step goal for 2 weeks in a row. The RA manually adjusts step count goals in each participant's Fitbit application by remotely logging into their Fitbit account on an encrypted computer."

In an RDA framework, the process of transcription and in-depth coding is bypassed in favor of organizing the data immediately following qualitative interviews. Organizing templates will be created from the interview scripts immediately following each interview; these templates will be comprised of prespecified domains identified prior to exit interviews related to program implementation preferences, population needs, and barriers and facilitators to program implementation. Following guidelines for RDA, completed templates will be reviewed by a member of the research team and entered into a response matrix  [44] , which will be organized in a hybrid inductive-deductive manner.

      "text": "We describe the methodology for a multisite feasibility study of GetActive-Fitbit, a mind-body activity program aimed at improving multimodal physical function and other relevant outcomes among a racially and ethnically diverse sample of individuals with chronic pain recruited from 3 pain clinics from across the US. The study is focused on establishing a training protocol for clinicians, determining feasibility and fidelity benchmarks of our RCT protocol comparing GetActive -Fitbit versus HLP, and optimizing our protocol for a future fully-powered multisite efficacy trial.\n\nEstablishing multisite feasibility is essential as it allows for stronger generalizability and is necessary to generate a rate of recruitment for a targeted sample that will permit timely enrollment and long-term follow up in our planned future efficacy trial  [45] . Additionally, multisite feasibility testing will allow us to address limitations of our prior singlesite study including recruitment of racially and ethnically diverse populations, accurate recruitment of the population of interest (i.e., individuals with chronic pain who take <5000 steps/day), and ability to follow up with participants after program completion to understand the sustainability of improvements. We will also be able to further optimize the protocol and explore systemic barriers (through focus groups with staff) to enhance the rigor and success of the future efficacy testing. The information gleaned from the present trial will allow us to more fully understand barriers to implementing the GetActive-Fitbit program that may exist as a result of developing the program at a medical center in the Northeast among a primarily White population. The identification of differences in site culture that act as barriers or facilitators to the feasibility of the protocol will help us improve our ability to implement the protocol more widely, and to tailor it to region-specific populations.\n\nThere have been several lessons learned during the ongoing trial. First, following differences in self-reported sedentariness between screening and baseline (resulting from participants changing jobs or introducing new activities into their schedules), we have amended our screening procedures to allow for the screening of smartphone device information related to average step count. This allows us to get a rough estimate of current activity level during the screening process and identify individuals who may not actually be part of our target population. Second, we solicited feedback from participants about their step goals, and adjusted step goals above 10,000 steps/day with participant input. Third, we streamlined the explanation of skills in the GetActive-Fitbit manual to increase opportunities for skills discussion during the check-in period of each session. Lastly, we have adapted the protocol to address needs specific to different sites to better support their recruitment and study implementation efforts, such as incorporating medical record review at Duke to facilitate recruitment. Differences in clinician availability across sites has resulted in a staggered start for group recruitment; this has allowed clinicians from MGH to share information (e.g., questions to anticipate from group participants, examples of effective skill use) to help increase clinician preparedness at other sites. Adjusting the protocol to address the needs of multiple sites is expected to substantially improve our ability to efficiently implement the protocol Note. Participants included in the present table have been consented and randomized/completed baseline assessments.\n\nat new sites in the future. Additional modifications are expected as we continue learning from the present trial."

Each of the groups will be offered in-person, which may present a barrier to participation among individuals who live far from the hospital or who experience mobility difficulties. Prior participants expressed preference for in person groups because they allow a more intimate atmosphere that can enhance social connection. To mitigate this, we offer $15 for parking and/or transportation for each session attended, with an additional $50 if 8/10 sessions are attended. Future iterations of the program may be delivered remotely to increase accessibility of the intervention."

Future iterations of GetActive-Fitbit may include cultural adaptations stemming from collaboration with community partners and telehealth adaptations to increase the program's accessibility and generalizability. The refinement of the protocol used within the present study is a critical step towards this goal, and helps ensure the rigor and success of the subsequent efficacy trial."
