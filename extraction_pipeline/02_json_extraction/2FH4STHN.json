      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "The uptake of mobile technologies in healthcare has grown rapidly in the past years. This opened entirely new opportunities and innovative ways to improve health and healthcare delivery  [1] . In general, term mobile health (mHealth) is used to refer to any use of mobile applications (apps) and wearable devices for health  [2] [3] [4] . Compared to earlier computer-based or internet-based solutions, mobile health devices have novel characteristics that are specific to the field as they enable delivery of health-related services and applications through general-purpose tools such as smartphones or tablets  [5] . Smartphonebased passive sensing, in particular, has opened new possibilities for health and wellbeing because data recorded by multiple built-in sensors can be combined with behavioral data. As such, smartphone-generated data can be used to address not only the health status but also the wellbeing of an individual  [6] . On a more general ground and from a healthcare systems perspective, mHealth can be a powerful facilitator for addressing key challenges such as: accessibility and affordability of services and technology, cost efficiency and quality of services for people living in resource limited settings, sustainable matching of resources, and increased efficiency across the continuum of care  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The range of uses of health apps is large. It includes, for example: exchange of medical information, access to patient data, implementation of clinical and personal services, support to diagnosis and treatment through integration with medical records, and monitoring of chronic conditions, e.g. in older adults  [2, 3, 12, 13] .\n\nHealth apps can be classified into broad functional categories, i.e.: general solutions for healthcare professionals (e.g., drug-referencing tools, clinical decision-support tools, electronic medical record systems, and medical knowledge sources); apps for medical education, teaching, and learning; telemedicine support tools; apps for patients and for the general public over a wide array of services; and disease-specific apps for patients  [14] . A recent survey showed that, among the health apps specifically designed for patients, patients preferences leaned towards informative apps (66%), followed by apps to access healthcare services (52%), fitness apps (51%), apps to improve treatment compliance (47%), apps to monitor physical parameters (42%), nutrition/diet apps (35%), and symptoms checker apps (22%)  [15] .\n\nEffective use of mHealth may translate into benefits for health and wellbeing by helping people to manage their own health, support healthy living, and gain access to useful information, at any time and place  [1, 16] . Potential benefits of using apps in healthcare include, e.g., increased patient awareness, motivation towards behavior change, promotion of preventive behaviors and self-care, improved patientdoctor communication, patient empowerment, and implementation of patient-centered care  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Interestingly, a recent survey confirmed positive expectations among patients and favorable opinion about the usefulness of health apps, mainly due to increase of patient empowerment (90%), improvement in treatment compliance (82%), enhancement of communication between patient and physicians (74%), and expected reduction of health-related costs (56%)  [15] . At the same time, the debate about the potential challenges and risks of the mobile revolution in healthcare is open. For example, there can be important potential issues of security, data protection and data reuse, possible risks related to safety and misuse, poor regulation and lack of standards for validation, effectiveness, and quality  [22] [23] [24] [25] . Recent systematic reviews highlighted the need to raise the quality of mHealth intervention studies and to address the issues related to app use (e.g., inaccurate data input, misinterpretation, misuse, security and confidentiality)  [20, 26] .\n\nThe global market of health apps is large and is driven by a very high number of developers  [27] . However, only a few apps have been validated and tested for effectiveness  [28]  and the actual quality of most of the apps on the market is largely unknown. Specifically, the concept of quality is complex, subjective in nature, and can hardly be standardized. The assessment of quality of health apps is challenging as it is difficult to identify the core components of quality as well as appropriate measures to assess them  [3] .\n\nThe need to identify, characterize, and assess health apps has inspired a significant amount of research in the past years  [29] . An emerging area of investigation is related to the development of methods that can effectively retrieve, structure, and process information related to health apps with the ultimate aim of providing potential users of health apps with relevant, meaningful knowledge about apps  [31] . This is a timely research question as, in the ongoing digital transformation in healthcare, potential users can hardly find comprehensive, reliable resources to guide them in informed adoption of health apps. A still unmet need of healthcare professionals is how to find guidance for recommending and prescribing apps to their patients  [32, 33] . Empowering clinicians to identify, characterize, and assess mobile apps in their own practice can be the key to enable effective use of mHealth solutions by patients  [34] .\n\nThe following sections will describe and categorize, by discussing some specific examples, the diverse methodologies introduced throughout the past years for the identification, characterization, and assessment of health apps. An outline of these methodologies is shown in Table  1 . The objective of this commentary is to systematize a broad and evolving area of research so to provide a general picture that may serve as a basis for future systematic analyses of the available methods, towards the development of guiding principles to identify, characterize, and assess health apps and, ultimately, to define quality benchmarks for app design and development."

      "title": "2.. Resources for app identification",
      "text": "For potential users who wish to identify health apps to fulfill specific needs, diverse sources of information can be found on the web. Vendor markets provide a varied selection of health apps: a recent report estimated that in 2017 over 325,000 health apps were available on the major app stores, with an estimated 3.7 billion app downloads during the year  [27] . Studies among different target groups (medical doctors, medical students, as well as citizens) showed that users tend to be concerned about app overload and may have difficulty in keeping an overview of all the health apps that are available  [35] [36] [37] . Recently, some attempts have been made to develop user-oriented support tools for automated extraction of meaningful information from the apps' webpages  [38] [39] [40]  but app information, as reported on the app stores, has some limitations. The stores are organized by breaking down apps into different categories (e.g., 'medical', 'health & fitness', 'education') by using a taxonomy implemented by the proprietor of the app market. Categorization of apps on the store is at the discretion of developers. Moreover, developers are responsible for the app description reported on the app's webpage and on their own websites. As such, the information is not necessarily a reliable indication of quality and usefulness  [34] . Moreover, the large volume of information on the app markets is frequently fragmented so it may be a challenge for the public to distinguish good from suboptimal advice, also considering that there is frequently lack of appropriate references and supporting scientific information  [41] .\n\nTo try to overcome these limitations, several online resources have been launched to index, comment, and review health related apps. These resources include web-portals, expert-and user-communities, app repositories, or news sites. (e.g.,  [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] ). These services offer the advantage of removing the difficulties associated with app discovery and quality verification on the stores. Indeed, these resources are not exempt from limitations. In general, there is potential for bias due to the intrinsically subjective review process. In addition, measurements and reviews can take significant time, effort, and resources to be effective. Moreover, there is an inherent delay from app release to assessment, during which time the app may have undergone numerous updates and substantial revisions, making the information outdated  [34] .\n\nAnother helpful source of information, especially for researchers and healthcare professionals, is peer-reviewed literature. Journal articles can often be a good starting point to identify apps based on proven evidence base and demonstrated effectiveness. However, the time lag between app release and article publication might be very long due to study duration and, also, due to the additional time needed for the peer- Transparency, data management and data reuse, data protection and privacy User-oriented quality Usability, quality of experience, functional design and aesthetics, ease of use, perceived quality of content and function review and editing processes. As a result the newest health apps, even if scientifically sound and reliable, might be penalized due to insufficient evidence  [34] .\n\nIn general, online resources can be a first filter to gather knowledge about health apps and, as such, they can be helpful to support potential users in the identification of the most promising apps to answer specific needs. However, knowledge repositoriesalthough informativemay fail to provide users with a clear understanding of the relevant features and functions. For this purpose, a variety of descriptive methods to characterize the various features of health apps have been introduced in the past years."

      "title": "3.. Descriptive characterization of apps' features",
      "text": "The problem of conveying meaningful, accurate information about apps and their features is open. Several possible solutions have been introduced for app characterization, classification, and comparison so to answer the varying users' needs in various contexts. Some of the proposed methods are broad in scope, whereas some other methods focus on particular target users groups, diseases, or medical domains. The former make use of general features and, as such, they can be used to characterize a large range of apps across several specialties, whereas the latter address specific features that are relevant to the particular application areas or conditions considered  [48, 49] .\n\nExamples of general features include, for example, the target user (e.g., healthcare professionals, medical or nursing students, or patients), the intervention strategy (e.g., tracking health, involving the healthcare team, providing health information), or the app's function  [50] [51] [52] [53] . Categorization of the app's function may be either: (i) specific to the target user (e.g., clinical tools for healthcare professionals, medical education for students, or disease management for patients  [50] ); (ii) mapped over general functionalities (e.g., to inform, to instruct, to record, to remind, to communicate  [52] ); or, alternatively (iii) mapped over more detailed categories (e.g., appointment making, reminders, telemedicine, pharmacy, patient monitoring, clinical decision support  [53] ). Other useful general features were introduced for a broad classification of apps based on the intended use and related application area. For example: the condition or application area (e.g., diabetes, mental health, oncology), or the relevant phase of the patient journey (e.g., prevention/healthy lifestyle, service finding, education, diagnosis, prescription, compliance, and rehabilitation)  [52] .\n\nWhen homogeneous samples of apps are selected by using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, the use of specific features can be advantageous. These features are frequently related to the applications and diseases/conditions of interest. For example, to characterize apps for exercise promotion  [18] , disease prevention  [54] , and disease management  [17, 54]  for middle aged and older adults, features related to self-management models and behavior change mechanisms have been proposed (e.g., goal setting, contingent rewards, information about risks and consequences, and so on)  [18] . For apps in the area of diabetes self-management, features related to disease-management functionalities have been suggested (e.g., self-monitoring of blood glucose, medication tracking, food database, data logging, data analysis, and visualization  [55, 56] ). Similarly, functional features such as salt intake tracking, blood pressure tracking, medication adherence, and hypertension education have been introduced to characterize apps for hypertension management  [57] . Features related to vision test tools and eye exercise and tasks have been used to analyze apps for eye care  [58] , and features related to speech settings customization, word display settings, or enhancement of communication have been used to assess apps for people with communication disorders  [59] .\n\nRecently, in the attempt to develop comprehensive characterization methods, some structured multi-component models that combine miscellaneous descriptive features have been introduced. Some examples are: the Nutrition App Quality Evaluation (AQEL)  [60] , the Interactive Mobile App Review Toolkit (IMART)  [61] , the \"one-shot pictorial schema\" proposed for apps in the areas of cardiology, oncology, pharmacology, and diabetes self-care  [62, 63] , and the \"At-a-glance Labelling for Features of Apps for Hearing healthcare\" (ALFA4Hearing) model for apps in the area of audiology and related specialties  [64, 65] . The advantage of these methods is their ability to characterize apps by using a core set of features that are related to the medical specialty but belong to general components such as: the app's promoters, offered services, implementation features, target user groups, and descriptive information  [64] .\n\nOverall, the various characterization methods can be useful to evaluate specific health apps or to compare and classify apps in a given area by ranking their features. Ranking descriptive features, however, is not sufficient per se to obtain reliable estimates of app quality. The need for methods to assess app quality has led to the introduction of various approaches that are able to highlight one or more components of apps' quality, as outlined in the followings."

      "title": "4.. Assessment of app quality",
      "text": "The broad, complex concept of quality in health apps has been addressed in a variety of ways, both qualitatively and quantitatively  [48] . In general, several approaches are focused on single components of quality (e.g., evidence-base, trustworthiness, or user-oriented quality) whereas others provide more comprehensive assessment of multiple components.\n\nOne of the key components of quality in health apps is evidencebase. Evidence-base is frequently complex to assess as it encompasses diverse elements. For example, some studies highlighted the importance of evaluating adherence to clinical guidelines and recommendations. This approach can be helpful to identify apps that appropriately incorporate guidelines as well as to detect potential gaps in apps' content  [28] . For example, adherence to the US Public Health Service's Clinical Practice Guideline for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence was assessed in smoking cessation apps (e.g., assessing willingness to quit; enhancing motivation by rewards or by risk awareness; assisting with a quit plan by practical counseling or by social support; referring to treatment)  [66] . Quality of apps for exercise promotion was assessed with respect to the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines (e.g., presence, safety, and principles of the main components of: aerobic exercise, flexibility, and strength/resistance)  [67] . To assess the strategies implemented by apps for weight management, a combination of several public health recommendations and behavior change theories were proposed (e.g., self-monitoring strategies, goalsetting functionalities and motivational strategies, healthy eating and physical activity support, weight and health assessment, and social support)  [68] .\n\nAnother important element related to evidence-base is scientific verification and clinical validation. To this purpose, some studies have developed methods to assess apps based on the reliability of scientific sources, as available on literature databases (e.g., EMBASE, MEDLINE, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, and mHealth Evidence  [69] [70] [71] ). Another proposed measure of evidence-base and reliability is a documented medical professional involvement in app development  [72, 73] . Similarly, one study introduced a more general approach for assessing evidence-base in health apps, i.e. evaluating a core set of elements such as the source (the credentials of who developed the app), the sponsors and their reliability, the quality of references, the scientific methodology and the level of evidence  [74] .\n\nAnother component of app quality, that has stimulated a large number of studies, is trustworthiness. It is one of the main reported concerns from a user's perspective  [75] . Although aspects related to trust are difficult to define and to assess, some attempts have been made to try to develop frameworks to evaluate its several elements in a comprehensive and standardized way by assessing, e.g. elements of transparency, data management and reuse, data protection and privacy, purpose, reliability of content, and imprint  [24, 25, [75] [76] [77] [78] .\n\nLast, but not least, a core component of app quality is related to the users' perspective. The assessment of user-oriented elements of quality is a timely question as, for example, the information reported on the app stores (e.g. consumer ratings and reviews) may be misleading and, frequently, it is not a reliable measure of quality  [48] . Therefore, efforts have been made to try to develop methods to assess app quality as perceived by the end users. These methods may include, e.g., elements of usability  [79] [80] [81] , quality of experience  [82] , functional design and aesthetics  [83] , ease of use, and perceived quality of content and function  [84] .\n\nInterestingly, the recent literature shows some examples of methods that try to assess, at the same time, multiple components of app quality. The optimal method to use depends on the context, the needs, and the expected outcomes. A common rationale behind these multiple-components methods is to provide easy to use tools to assist app assessment in various application areas. Some examples are: the \"Mobile Apps Rating Scale\" (MARS), that organizes quality features into five components: engagement, functionality, aesthetics, information, and subjective quality  [83] ; the \"Health Apps by Design\" framework, that addresses quality elements related to self-management support, physician leadership, communication, information technology, and the general mHealth ecosystem  [85] ; the Organization for the Review of Care and Health Applications (ORCHA) framework, that includes 24 items related to data governance, clinical efficacy, and user experience and engagement  [86] ; as well as other multi-component approaches that combine miscellaneous elements, e.g. quality of app specifications, development team, interfaces, clinical content, and ease of use  [84] ."

      "title": "5.. The road towards regulation",
      "text": "The popularity and usage of mobile technology is growing along with the number and variety of health apps due to many factors such as, e.g., practicality in communicating, portability, affordability, and widespread availability. In the very large market of health apps, the information available to potential users is frequently fragmented and incomplete -and it may become challenging to understand the function, features, and quality of apps before downloading and using them. This is a rapidly developing area of research and several novel methods are emerging for systematic searches, multidimensional quality assessment, and contextualizing content assessment  [29] . As a broad approach, some general \"how-to\" strategies have been suggested for effective use of health apps in clinical practice and daily life by patients, citizens, and healthcare providers  [34, 87] . However, comprehensive recommendations for effective app identification, characterization, assessment, and use are still not available to date and further research in this direction would be important. In terms of app design, the availability of methods for app characterization and assessment is important as it can help raise the quality of apps. Based on the existing evaluation frameworks, minimum requirements could be set, for example about usability, information quality, medical involvement in app development, evidencebase, and so on  [88] . Similarly, potential risks can be categorized by using the evaluation frameworks available so that they can be minimized, whenever possible, by design. It will be important to implement strategies to involve developers, for example through existing associations whenever possible or by setting minimum requirements for app quality and transparency of related information. For example, recent studies introduced a checklist and a web platform to support health apps developers and distributors with a standardized and transparent method for providing the end users with reliable information about their products  [76, 78, 89] .\n\nIt is to note that the rising scientific interest in this area and the increasing number of approaches presented in the literature are not paralleled by a similar increase in end users' awareness. To fill the gap between current trends in research and the end users' experiences, it would be crucial to inform consumers, patients, and especially healthcare professionals about the methodologies available to identify, characterize, and assess health apps. It is important to reach the end users directly and to empower them with deeper knowledge about the available apps and their core features. This can be done, for example: by tailored training and education programs; by close cooperation between researchers and professional organizations, patient support groups, and consumer agencies; or by the introduction of guidelines. Training may be targeted effectively to healthcare professionals as they play a pivotal role to identify the most suited mobile apps to recommend to patients. It is important that healthcare professionals are provided with up-todate knowledge about the general benefits and risks of mobile health apps as well as about strategies to identify and evaluate apps for their patients. Cooperation with professional organizations, patient support groups, and consumer agencies may also be beneficial as recommendations given by end-users organizations are often held in high regard by those interested in finding a specific health app based solution, especially regarding information security and user-oriented quality  [30, 75] . On a more general ground and from a healthcare system perspective, the introduction of guidelines for app development and use may be highly effective to improve the quality standards. However, even though the landscape of research is ample, the road towards guiding principles and recommendations is still largely unpaved  [49] . A recent report, published in November 2017, outlined the regulatory environment in the US and EU for mHealth as medical devices and the related development constraints  [90] . In the US, the FDA regulates mHealth within the existing framework for medical devices. A medical device is defined based on use in the \"diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals\"  [1] . Only a limited number of apps meet the definition of medical device and are, as such, subject to the US FDA regulation  [90] . In Europe, the new regulations on medical devices entered into force in May 2017 and will apply from May 2020  [91] . To qualify as a medical device, mHealth products shall: (i) have a medical purpose; (ii) perform an action on data (other than storage) for the medical benefit of patients; and (iii) generate or manage personalized alerts based on vital parameters to drive clinical management; or (iv) use an algorithm to support medical decisions by healthcare providers  [89] . A recent Decision by the European Court of Justice in December 2017 took a broad interpretation of when software shall fall within the notion of medical devices. The Court stated that a software is in itself a medical device when it is specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used for one, or several medical purposes outlined in the definition of medical device -even without use on humans as required for medical devices  [92] . As a result, the scenario is likely to change in the near future having a major impact on the app market because the apps that support a medical diagnosis and have a medical use shall be CE marked as medical devicesbut the outcomes of mandatory certification are difficult to predict. So far the attempts made to develop general certification frameworks for apps have failed  [14] . For example, the Happtique Health App Certification Program (HACP) was suspended in 2013 due to security shortcomings  [93] . App certification is particularly challenging due to market factors such as the number of apps, the variety of features and application areas, and rapid pace of development  [14, 94] , so significant efforts are needed in this area.\n\nIn general, it becomes increasingly clear that design of high-quality health apps is related to the development of guidelines for app identification, characterization, and assessment, and that recommendations and constraints for health apps development are needed. This can be achieved only if a multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder effort is done  [95] . Scientists, physicians and healthcare professionals, developers, industries, public health authorities and the target user groups need to work together to define principles for app development and use towards the final goal of delivering apps built on the pillars of evidence-base, reliability, long-term effectiveness, and user-oriented quality."
