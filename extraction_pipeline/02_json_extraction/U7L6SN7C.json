  "title": "Mapping Inequities in Digital Health Technology Within the World Health Organization's European Region Using PROGRESS PLUS: Scoping Review",
  "abstract": "Background: The use of digital technologies within health care rapidly increased as services transferred to web-based platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inequalities in digital health across the domains of equity are not routinely examined; yet, the long-term integration of digitally delivered services needs to consider such inequalities to ensure equitable benefits. Objective: This scoping review aimed to map inequities in access, use, and engagement with digital health technologies across equity domains. \n Methods: We searched 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, ASSIA, PsycINFO, and Scopus) for quantitative and mixed methods reviews and meta-analyses published between January 2016 and May 2022. Reviews were limited to those that included studies from the World Health Organization's European region. Extracted data were mapped against Cochrane's PROGRESS PLUS (place of residence, race, ethnicity, culture, and language, occupation, gender and sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, and other characteristics) dimensions of equity. \n Results: In total, 404 unique citations were identified from the searches, and 2 citations were identified from other sources. After eligibility assessment, 22 reviews were included. Consistent evidence was found showing higher access to digital health technologies among patients who were of White ethnicity, were English speaking, and had no disability. There were no reviews that explored differences in access to digital health care by age, gender and sex, occupation, education, or homeless or substance misuse. Higher use of digital health technologies was observed among populations that were White, English speaking, younger, with a higher level of education, of higher economic status, and residents in urban areas. No clear evidence of differences in the use of digital technologies by occupation, gender and sex, disability, or homeless or substance misuse was found, nor was clear evidence found in the included reviews on inequalities in the engagement with digital technologies. Finally, no reviews were identified that explored differences by place of residence. Conclusions: Despite awareness of the potential impact of inequalities in digital health, there are important evidence gaps across multiple equity domains. The development of a common framework for evaluating digital health equity in new health initiatives and consistency in reporting findings is needed.",

      "text": "The use of digital health care has been increasing over the past decade  [1] , with a rapid acceleration in 2020 as services transferred to web-based platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic  [2] . When digital health care is provided with appropriate infrastructure, training, and engagement, it has the potential to improve population health by using artificial intelligence, big data, and precision medicine  [3] . Digital health care is especially useful where there is increasing demand and limited resources  [4] . However, the use of digital technologies within health care provision (eg, telehealth, eHealth, and artificial intelligence), termed digital health, can contribute to health inequity due to systematic disparities and social determinants of health needs and the ability to engage with digital platforms  [5] .\n\nThe development of digital technologies and digital skills initiatives for patients is beginning to appear in local, national, and global policy and practice strategies, one of which is the World Health Organization (WHO) global strategy to strengthen the international approach to the implementation of digital health  [6] . However, an understanding of the underlying barriers to digital technologies and embedding mitigation strategies at an early stage is needed if policy implementation is to be effective. For example, despite digital skills being on the European Commission's agenda since 2016  [7] , in 2021, the majority (54%) of the European Union's population (aged 16-74 years) had limited basic digital skills, and 14% had none at all  [8] , with variations present by age group, education level, employment status, and rurality. The extent of the digital inequalities and the need for digital skills in Europe became even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the reliance on digital technologies for social support and economic functions, including access to health services and public health systems  [2, 4] ."

      "title": "Key Components of Digital Health",
      "text": "Digital health equity can be explored through an individual's ability to access, use, and engage with digital health technology  [9] :\n\n\u2022 Access is defined as the ability to access the technology and other resources required for digital health (eg, digital devices, internet connection, web-based tools, and financial resources).\n\n\u2022 Use reflects having the skills, digital literacy, and ability to navigate and use digital health technologies.\n\n\u2022 Engagement refers to the variations that will occur in the level of engagement with digital health technology by individuals. For instance, some individuals may have access and the skills to use digital technology but may choose not to engage with a digital health service.\n\nThere is some evidence of digital inequities within Europe  [2, 5, 9] . This is generally reported for older individuals, rural communities, and women and is attributed to a lack of knowledge, opportunities, skill, inaccessibility  [10] , fear of discrimination, and concern for the cessation of face-to-face service  [11, 12] . However, there is limited evidence of factors contributing to digital health exclusion for subgroups of the population within the 3 components of digital health (access, use, and engagement) and in assessing the interconnected nature of social categorizations, termed intersectionality. Failure to acknowledge and account for all dimensions of equity within digital health, including the role of intersectionality, can lead to widening health inequities.\n\nUnderstanding the role of inequity in people's ability to access, use, and engage with digital health is necessary to ensure that digital health does not cause greater health inequities. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review was to map inequities in digital health technology across different equity domains to help inform future developments toward integrating digital technology into health care practices, systems, and policy within the WHO European region."

      "text": "This scoping review used the methodology outlined by Arksey and O'Malley  [13] . It comprises the following stages: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction and analysis; and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist was used to guide the reporting of the scoping review  [14] .\n\nWe conceptualized inequalities using the PROGRESS PLUS framework  [15] . The framework, first developed by Evans and Brown and further adapted by the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group  [16] , indicates the different characteristics in which health inequities may be experienced. The acronym stands for place of residence, race, ethnicity, culture, language, occupation, gender and sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, and other characteristics PLUS (eg, disability, age, and sexual orientation). On the basis of the collected data from the included reviews, the PLUS category was subcategorized further into age, disability or complex health needs, and homeless or substance misuse. In addition, for the purpose of this review, religion was combined with race, ethnicity, culture, and language."

Included search terms related to \"Digital Health\" AND \"Inequities\" AND \"Review\" (Multimedia Appendix 1). A further hand search of key relevant journals (eg, JMIR and Lancet Digital Health), gray literature databases (eg, the Health Management Information Consortium and the Turning Research into Practice databases), and citation tracking of included literature was performed to identify additional records. Once the data had been extracted and thematically mapped, a further search was undertaken for recent primary research (2018-2022) conducted in WHO Europe countries for equity domains where evidence from reviews could not be extracted. For this step, the search terms to cover \"reviews\" that were included in the initial search were omitted. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria remained the same."

Before screening and full paper review, we followed a calibration process against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the feasibility of disaggregating quantitative results into 10 equity domains and 3 components of digital health (access, use, and engagement) that we were interested in reporting. A second, and in some cases, a third reviewer resolved any uncertainty throughout the screening and full paper review process."

The form captured information including (1) author and publication date; (2) participant characteristics; (3) interventions and exposures; (4) included study features; (5) equity outcomes; and (6) solutions, limitations, and evidence gaps.\n\nScoping reviews do not critically appraise the literature, but where this information was available in the included reviews, it was captured. The results were then thematically mapped using the PROGRESS PLUS framework  [15]  to examine the role of equity within the key components of digital health: access, use, and engagement, in addition to looking for any evidence of intersectionality across the PROGRESS PLUS equity domains. This ensured that socially stratifying factors were considered throughout the review process  [15] . The thematically mapped data were summarized using a heat map for each equity domain, with a potential direction of effect being interpreted, where at least 75% of the included reviews found consistent evidence of equity or inequity."

Only 5% (1/22) of reviews reported inconclusive evidence  [32] . A higher level of education was also reported to lead to greater engagement with digital health services (2/22, 9%), but this may vary according to the type of technology.

Lower use of digital health technologies in the older population (>50 years) compared with the younger population was identified in 8 reviews  [18, 22, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 37] , and 3 reviews found mixed evidence  [4, 21, 31] , with lower health literacy being a commonly reported barrier among older people  [29, 34] . Parker et al  [31]  observed that the use of different types of digital health technology differed between age groups by Parker et al  [31] .\n\nFor instance, older adults were more likely to use telephone consultations, whereas internet-based consultations were more likely to be used by younger individuals.\n\nEngagement with digital health technology by age was documented in 23% (5/22) of reviews  [23, 26, 30, 32, 35] , with 14% (3/22) of reviews highlighting lower preference or interest among older adults  [30, 32, 35]  due to concerns over losing contact with health care professionals  [32]  and privacy and security concerns  [26, 30] . However, 5% (1/22) of reviews noted that older adults had greater sustained interest compared with younger adults once they had adopted the technology  [26] , and another review found no association  [23] ."

Owing to the digitalization of health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and their continued use, there remain key policy implications at both an organizational and governmental level to provide equal access to health care via digital platforms for all individuals within society. Given that digital health care has the potential to lower costs, enable prioritization of care, increase adherence to medicine and treatment, and increase self-care  [44] , there are widespread benefits if barriers to access, use, and engagement can be equitably addressed through policy and practice. In the subsequent sections, we present key inequities found across the 3 dimensions of digital health (access, use, and engagement) and elaborate on key areas for future development in this area.\n\nConsidering the limitations of this scoping review, our findings and the identified key areas for future development can be used to inform the development and integration of digital health technologies into everyday health care, in an equitable way."

      "text": "We conducted a comprehensive scoping review of equity in digital health technology, collating evidence across 3 key components of digital health (access, use, and engagement) and 10 domains of equity, as defined by the PROGRESS PLUS framework. However, there are some limitations that need to be considered.\n\nDespite there being evidence in the literature for a digital divide in singular domains, such as age, occupation, and sex and gender  [5, 9, 45, 46] , these divides were mainly reported without considering the interconnectedness of different social classifications (eg, women from ethnic minorities live at the intersection of multiple social, economic, and cultural disadvantages that contribute to being digitally excluded).\n\nExamining the intersectionality between access and equity is crucial to protecting against widening inequalities in digital health systems. Furthermore, there was a high level of heterogeneity in the included study populations, which could explain why there was no clear evidence identified within the included reviews for age, occupation, gender and sex, and education. There was also considerable heterogeneity in how types of digital technologies were described (eg, inconsistent and evolving definitions of eHealth modalities, such as patient portals).\n\nNo evidence could be obtained from other reviews on social capital and religion. These elements of PROGRESS PLUS are more likely to be explored in qualitative research  [27] . More research examining ethno-religious groups would increase our understanding of how diverse factors such as age, religion, and gender interact and contribute to a digital divide  [27, 41, 42] . This review focuses on providing evidence for the WHO European region, but many of the studies documenting race, ethnicity, and language come from US studies, which potentially limits it generalizability to the European context. Furthermore, the evidence within Europe is dominated by Western European countries and the situational context may be different in countries that are classified as LMIC.\n\nFinally, only quantitative studies were investigated, and future work is required to capture evidence for qualitative studies to provide a greater understanding of the current facilitators and barriers to digital health care. Nonetheless, a validation check of the results of this review against those of qualitative reviews revealed similar findings. Methodological weakness observed by those reviews that undertook a critical appraisal (12/22, 55%) should be addressed in any future work, these include low participation rate, small sample size, unblinded participants, lack of control for confounding, and biased samples that only included individuals with access to digital technologies. Another important bias that needs to be considered is the underrepresentation of non-English speakers and ethnic minorities in current literature  [47] . Efforts to include these population groups are needed to develop culturally informed digital health technologies to address their needs."

      "text": "The ability to access the resources required for digital health differs by ethnic group and disability or complex health needs status, a finding that is consistent with the literature  [48] [49] [50] . However, there was unclear evidence for socioeconomic status and place of residence, despite rural areas having a higher rate of digital exclusion compared with urban areas  [2]  owing to access and connectivity issues  [19, 20] . It should also be noted that access to digital technology is not homogenous across the WHO European region, with greater access in North-Western Europe compared with Eastern or Southern Europe  [2] . Mapping digital infrastructure and inequities in access, including pay barriers, could help identify gaps and support policy and intervention decisions to support digital health."

      "title": "Use",
      "text": "Individuals from different places of residence, ethnicity, education level, socioeconomic status, and age were found to vary in their ability to access and use digital health technology. Many of the studies within the included reviews reported a greater use of digital health technologies among patients of White ethnic background, with ethnic minorities facing greater barriers to health care at an individual, provider, and system level  [51, 52] . These barriers to the use of digital health care include a lack of alternative language formats and lower digital literacy  [33] . The lack of digital skills is also present as a barrier for older populations  [29, 34] . A failure to consider and adjust for underlying factors, such as sociodemographic characteristics  [22] , structural inequalities, and important confounding factors (eg, literacy rate and language skills), may explain the lack of clear evidence in some of the PROGRESS PLUS categories (eg, occupation, gender, sex, and disability)."

    {
      "title": "Engagement",
      "text": "No clear direction of effect was observed within any of the PROGRESS PLUS categories for engagement in digital health technologies. Having high access and ability to use digital health technologies does not necessarily translate into being more motivated or interested in engaging with digital technologies  [53] . Barriers identified include security concerns  [37] , mistrust  [54] , preference for face-to-face health care interventions  [27, 55] , and concerns that face-to-face health care interventions will cease  [11] . Understanding and exploring ways to increase engagement among vulnerable members of society is key to reducing digital health inequity, especially when there are increasing demands and pressures on health services. It is possible that qualitative data would provide a richer understanding of the barriers for user engagement and help the development of digital health care resources that address users' needs."

    {
      "title": "Suggestions for Future Work, Solutions, and User-Centered Approaches",
      "text": "Within this scoping review, it was difficult to draw conclusive evidence for all elements of PROGRESS PLUS. Reasons include the heterogeneity of the evidence, methodological weaknesses, and examination of singular domains of equity, resulting in a lack of investigation into intersectionality in the current literature. Further high-quality research is required to address key evidence gaps identified in this scoping review. This will increase our understanding of key barriers in access, use, and engagement across different regions within the WHO European region and across underrepresented population groups that need to be targeted at a policy level. We also recommend following a systematic approach to reporting the population studied to help enable more rapid learning in digital health innovation and inequalities. This systematic approach should consider how digital health should be evaluated at the design stage and ensure effective data capture during implementation  [56] . Incorporating intersectional analysis into research in this area will increase our understanding of the key drivers contributing to equity in digital health and would account for the complex systems at play  [47, [57] [58] [59] . We recommend developing a common reporting framework to monitor and collate high-quality evidence and developing a structured approach to the evaluation of digital health initiatives against equity domains. This, in turn, would support decision-making in this area and facilitate knowledge exchange at a national and regional level.\n\nSeveral reviews highlighted the importance of digital health technologies addressing the user needs in both content and design  [21, 26, 29, 31, 32, 37] . Given this, digital solutions should be designed with inclusive and participatory user-centered approaches (co-design and coproduction) to ensure that technology use is appropriate and adds value to the end user  [60] . This is particularly important for those considered as at-risk populations, such as those with disabilities and complex needs, and those experiencing language barriers.\n\nDigital skills are a key limitation in using digital health care  [29, 34] . Therefore, equipment, training, and educational resources for professionals and end users are required to increase adoption  [61] , perhaps in the form of community and patient hubs  [44] . For example, disadvantaged groups could be supported through training and provision of dedicated internet connections and digital devices within the community  [28] . Consideration must also be given to the medium in which these resources are presented  [27, 28]  and ensure information is simplified and accessible  [34] . There are opportunities to capitalize on \"quick wins,\" such as language-related solutions that could enable access to patients from ethnic minorities without the need for large infrastructure adjustments. Furthermore, creation of protocols and regulations around the privacy and security of digital health technology in accessible formats could address privacy and safety concerns  [29, 62] .\n\nFinally, any research and evaluation into digital health inequities need to be relevant to policy and practice and link in with WHO Europe's digital health action plan  [63] . Collective approaches among local, national, and international organizations, including the creation of a common definition of digital health, such as updating the WHO digital health classification tool  [64] , could help in monitoring and reporting digital inequities. This would also help develop a good practice approach when generating policy-relevant evidence. For example, the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) has a standard framework for digital health technologies that cover design, value, performance, and deployment  [65] , with equity being a standard requirement. However, the fact that not all populations are homogeneous (eg, the urban-rural divide and diverse populations) needs to be considered and a mix of regional and national policy to ensure equity in digital health may be required.\n\nOn the basis of our findings, the key areas suggested for future development are as follows:\n\n1. Understand key barriers to access, use, and engagement with digital health technologies across the WHO European region, considering the situational context between regions to reduce bias toward high-income Western European countries and underrepresented population groups through high-quality research. 2 . Develop and adopt a common framework approach to monitor and report differences, with a shared digital health definition across all equity domains that collate evidence to inform action. 3 . Identify and address potential barriers through mapping inequities in digital infrastructure, understanding the impact of intersectionality and approaches to improve knowledge, skills, and confidence. 4 . Ensure interventions are co-designed, inclusive, and participatory, with appropriate evaluation and reporting. 5 . Share and collate examples of best practices taken by health care systems to address digital health inequities."

      "text": "Within the context of the WHO European region, this scoping review has highlighted present inequities and evidence gaps across multiple domains with digital health care technologies. Rural communities, ethnic minorities, lower-educated individuals, those with lower socioeconomic status, older adults, and individuals with disabilities or complex needs face digital health inequality, and active approaches should be taken to reduce this gap. These active approaches could include the development and adoption of a common framework to support policies and procedures within the WHO European region for current and new co-designed digital solutions, in addition to mapping inequities, investigating intersectionality, and taking into consideration regional differences within the development stage of any initiative. These recommendations could be achieved through further robust research and evaluation where there is currently mixed evidence and the sharing of good practices to create sustainable solutions to reduce digital health inequalities."
