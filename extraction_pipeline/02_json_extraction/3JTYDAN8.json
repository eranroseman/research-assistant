This review studied whether sending patients appointment reminders using mobile phone text messaging (Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS)) could improve attendance. Low to moderate quality evidence included in this review shows that mobile phone text messaging reminders increase attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders, and postal reminders, and had the same impact as phone call reminders. The costs per attendance of mobile phone text message reminders are lower compared to phone call reminders. None of the included studies reported on harms or adverse effects of the text messaging reminders, nor on health outcomes or people's perceptions of safety related to receiving reminders by text message.There is a need for more research assessing the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments."

      "text": "Mobile phone messaging is an important means of human communication globally. Mobile phone penetration is rapidly increasing particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, with 90% of the global and 80% of rural population having access to a mobile network in 2010. The number of subscriptions in 2010 reached 5.3 billion, representing a 76.2% global penetration rate (ITU 2010). The penetration rates are 70% to 90% in high-income countries, with a similar rate of increase across all socio-economic groups  (Atun 2006) .\n\nMost digital mobile phones provide Short Message Service (SMS), also known as text messaging, and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) for transmitting graphics, video clips and sound files. SMS, in particular, has rapidly developed into a powerful communication medium, particularly among young adults. The total number of text messages sent globally tripled between 2007 and 2010, from an estimated 1.8 trillion to 6.1 trillion, with about 200,000 messages sent every second (ITU 2010).These short messages, where up to 160 characters of text are sent from the Internet or from a mobile phone to one or several mobile phones, could provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium of communication. The terms text message, text, or txt are more commonly used in North America, the UK, Spain and the Philippines, while in many other countries the term SMS is used. In this review we will use the term 'text messaging' to refer to the use of SMS only, distinguishing it from the term 'mobile phone messaging', which encompasses both SMS and MMS. Increasingly, the latter term also refers to mobile email and 'instant messaging' delivered to the mobile phone.\n\nText messages, compared to other communication channels, have the advantage of instant transmission and low cost. There is also a smaller chance of being misplaced compared to print materials, and of being invasive to daily lives compared to phone calls  (Kaplan 2006) . Features such as ubiquity, mobility, direct and instantaneous access and direct communication offer the possibility of using mobile phones for health information transfer  (Atun 2006) . A literature review on the use of mobile phones in health care has demonstrated the wide application and potential of mobile phones to: increase access to health care; enhance efficiency of service delivery; improve diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation; and support public health programmes  (Atun 2006; Car 2008) . Mobile phone messaging has, for example, been used to provide appointment reminders (Bos 2005), to improve patient compliance with medications  (Fairley 2003; Marquez Contreras 2004; Vilella 2004) , to monitor chronic conditions  (Ferrer-Roca 2004; Kwon 2004; Ostojic 2005)  and to provide psychological support  (Bauer 2003; Franklin 2003) . Mobile phones have also been used in managing communicable diseases (e.g. in contact tracing and partner notification for sexually transmitted illnesses  (Newell 2001) ) and in health promotion programmes (e.g. in smoking cessation  (Obermayer 2004; Rodgers 2005) ). Furthermore, the use of mo-bile phones has been shown to improve service utilization among population groups such as teenagers and young adult males who do not typically use health services, by providing the opportunity to remotely access care providers for advice (Atun 2006b). However, for older adults, some of whom are less able or willing to use mobile phones, the effect on improved service utilization could be limited (Atun 2006b).\n\nChallenges in using mobile phone applications in health care include incomplete coverage of mobile networks across regions, lack of standards, and possible information overload  (Adler 2007) .\n\nThis review is part of a series of four reviews which aim to determine the effects of mobile phone messaging in improving the processes of healthcare service delivery and service utilization.\n\nWe divided the reviews into four areas based on the specific interventions and related outcomes:\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments (this review);\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations (Gurol-Urganci 2012);\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for preventive health care (Vodopivec-Jamsek 2012 (in press));\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self-management of long-term illnesses (de Jongh 2012 (in press))."

      "title": "Description of the condition",
      "text": "Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery, with substantial monetary costs for health systems; and delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment for the nonattending patient. In England's National Health System (NHS), over a one-year period the direct costs alone were 185 million UK pounds for GP appointments, 34 million UK pounds for practice nurse appointments and estimated to be around 575 million UK pounds for hospital appointments  (DoH 2004; DPP 2003) . Economic incentives, such as imposing a fine on non-attendees, could reduce non-attendance rates, and this strategy has been suggested in Denmark and the UK (Bech 2005). A number of reviews have assessed the factors leading to missed appointments  (Deyo 1980; George 2003; Sharp 2001) , in a range of country settings, including Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hong Hong, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Singapore, Spain, UK, and USA. Studies have found differences in the appointment keeping behaviour of patients by demographic factors, such as age and gender  (Hon 2002; Mantyjarvi 1994; Moore 2001; Simmons 1997; Skaret 1998; Waller 2000) , race and ethnicity  (Clarke 1998; Gatrad 1997; Gatrad 2000) ; or socio-economic status, such as unemployment, perceived social support  (Brown 1999; Catz 1999; Ramm 2001; Reekie 1998) , lower levels of community functioning  (Coodin 2004)  and living in a deprived area  (Neal 2001) . Detailed surveys among non-attendees and their healthcare providers identify the main patient-related factors for missing scheduled appointments as: health beliefs  (Al Faris 2002; Mirotznik 1998) ; lack and difficulty of transportation  (Campbell 2000; Collins 2003; Mohamed 2002; Paul 1997; Pesata 1999) ; scheduling problems  (Campbell 2000; King 1995; Ross 1995) ; health status  (Cashman 2004; Kane 1991; Killaspy 2000; Richardson 1998; van Baar 2006) ; resistance to consultation  (Grunebaum 1996; Wogelius 2005) ; insurance status  (Canizares 2002; Iben 2000; Majeroni 1996; Weingarten 1997; Yoon 2005) ; and frustration with outpatient clinic organisation resulting in long waiting times and discontinuity of care (van Baar 2006). Health system-related factors include: inadequate communication between healthcare providers and patients  (Bottomley 1994; Lloyd 1993; Martin 2005) , which are worsened by patients missing appointments (Husain-Gambles 2004); waiting times  (Pesata 1999 ); quality of consultation; facilities in the waiting area  (Chung 2004) ; time interval between scheduling/referrals and appointments  (Grunebaum 1996; Hamilton 2002; Livianos-Aldana 1999) ; administrative and/or clerical problems  (Hull 2002; Potamitis 1994) ; and site of care  (Lasser 2005; Specht 2004 ). One of the cited reasons for missing an appointment is simply that patients forget that they had an appointment (Hong Kong (Hon 2005); Scotland  (Herrick 1994; Hull 2002 ); Saudi Arabia (Mohamed 2002); UK  (Murdock 2002; Neal 2005; Pal 1998; Potamitis 1994 ); Northern Ireland (Richardson 1998); Norway  (Skaret 2000) ; Malaysia  (Zailinawati 2006) ; USA (Carrion 1993)). Any form of reminders may thus decrease the rate of missed appointments, reducing the inefficiencies and costs generated by non-attendance. Importantly, reminders give patients an opportunity to cancel an appointment either by a return mobile phone message or a phone call."

In Table  1  we outline basic characteristics and a comparison of these modes of communication Table  1 . Existing literature on appointment reminders focuses on postal messages, phone calls, emails and text reminders."

      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "Various communication channels such as phone calls, letters and text messages have been used for appointment reminders that aim to reduce missed appointments. A study conducted in a Dutch orthodontic clinic did not find evidence that reminders reduced failed attendance rates. When given the choice, patients in this study preferred mail reminders to telephone and text message reminders. Some patients were also negative about the usefulness of reminders  (Bos 2005) . A systematic review on prompts to encourage attendance for people with serious mental illness concluded that prompts close to the time of appointment may increase attendance and that a simple orientation letter would be more effective than a telephone prompt  (Reda 2010) . A study which compared postal, manual telephone and automated telephone reminders (or all three combined) in a general dental practice in the UK found that all reminder methods resulted in net cost savings, and that both postal and manual telephone techniques were effective in improving attendance rates  (Reekie 1998 ). Benefits of using phone call reminders have also been reported in RCTs in adolescent and public health clinic settings in Australia and USA  (Dini 1995; Hashim 2001; Sawyer 2002) . Benefits of using postal reminders have been reported in RCTs in orthodontic clinic settings in the UK  (Can 2003; Thomas 2004 ). There are studies of the impact of text message reminders on missed appointments in the NHS  (Milne 2006 ), in Australia (Downer 2005; Downer 2006 ) and in Malaysia (Leong 2006), as well as reported applications in imaging diagnostics, dermatology and sexual health clinics in the UK; outpatient clinics in the USA and Norway; and private dental and chiropractic clinics in Sweden  (Atun 2006; Dyer 2003) ."

      "title": "Acceptability and risks of the intervention",
      "text": "In some UK pilots, confidentiality issues surrounding text-messaging reminders have been addressed by an 'opt-out' scheme, or information leaflets have acted as consent forms  (Atun 2006 ). Another concern regarding text-messaging reminders is their possible impact on health inequalities, as people in higher socio-economic groups, who are more likely to own a mobile phone, will be less likely to miss appointments  (Fahey 2003) . However, this concern may not be realised, given mobile phone ownership statistics and other unpublished studies regarding mobile phone use and socioeconomic status  (Ellenbogen 2003; Vernon 2003) . Patients who receive text reminders may be more inclined to ignore other paperbased communication, which may also include key information (Vodafone 2004). Possible disadvantages of using mobile phone messaging include the risk of inaccurate data input  (Norwell 2003) , lack of understanding or misinterpretation of the information, and difficulties in reading for those with poor vision or problems with literacy. Having correct patient contact information and securely stored health records are essential to adhere to privacy, confidentiality and data protection requirements. Failures or delays in message delivery are rare but possible; however, harm is unlikely as senders are usually notified instantly in cases where there was a transmission problem. There may be additional monetary and time costs, as backup systems may be needed. Lastly, risks associated with mobile phone messaging in general may apply, for instance increased risk of car accidents as a result of messaging whilst driving."

This review also complements available studies on use of telephone consultations  (Car 2003 ), email (Car 2004; Car 2004b)"

SMS messages sent as reminders for routine drug collection for managing long-term conditions were excluded from this review, but discussed in de Jongh 2012 (in press). We aimed to make comparisons between mobile phone messaging and no intervention, as well as other modes of communication such as face-to-face, postal letters, calls to landline or mobile telephones, email or via electronic health records; and if applicable, automated versus personal text messaging."

Had studies using other study designs been identified for inclusion in the review, we would have assessed these using a variation of the above tool. Two review authors (TdJ and VVJ) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, with any disagreements resolved by discussion and consensus of the team. We used a template to guide the assessment of risk of bias, and judged each domain as 'yes' (indicating a low risk of bias), 'no' (indicating a high risk of bias) or 'unclear' (indicating an uncertain risk of bias). We have presented the results of the risk of bias assessment in tables, and provided a narrative discussion of risk of bias in individual domains."

Three studies reported the use of adequate sequence generation methods (computer generated random allocation sequences or random number tables); one study did not specify the method of randomisation (Koury 2005).\n\nThough not stated in any of the studies, we assumed there was no blinding of participants, healthcare providers or outcome assessors in any of the studies. In Leong 2006, the person who conducted the randomisation was not involved in participant recruitment and intervention delivery. No mention is made in other studies of blinding of outcome assessors/researchers and this could have potentially introduced a source of bias. Because we were not able to review the original study protocols, we cannot draw fully informed inferences on potential selective reporting. In addition, only one included study reported adverse effects as an outcome (Fairhurst 2008). Intervention and control groups were sufficiently comparable in all studies. In all studies it was reported that the intervention and control groups were comparable at baseline; however, no further information is provided in Koury 2005.\n\nAlthough the time lapse between the reminder and the appointment could have had an effect on the outcome, none of the studies assessed this variable. In Fairhurst 2008, as the unit of analysis is the appointment rather than individual patient who may have more than one appointment in the study period, there is clustering of data. In Leong 2006, the effect size is likely to be underesti-mated as the definition of 'attendance' is restricted to attendance at the clinics on scheduled days. The participants in the study were accustomed to walk-in visits rather than scheduled visits and 48 % of the participants actually attended the clinic, but on days other than the appointment dates."

None of the studies included in this review evaluated potential complications from text messaging such as loss or misinterpretation of data.

The lack of blinding in all studies can be partly explained by the interactive nature of the text message interventions, which does not permit the blinding of participants or their healthcare providers.

Baseline comparability: Age and gender. Blinding: No information of blinding of researchers provided. Blinding of participants not possible due to nature of intervention Participants UK. Six randomly-selected ENT clinics in one district general hospital. 441 participants who were scheduled to attend the selected clinics were eligible. Participants who could not be contacted by telephone, who were not familiar with SMS and those not wishing to participate in the study were excluded. 291 participants were included in the study Interventions SMS group: All participants received postal reminders two weeks before appointment. Intervention group also received text message reminders 24 hours before appointment. Texts were sent through a web-based provider Control group: Postal reminder two weeks before appointment only Koury 2005 (Continued) Outcomes Attendance rate.

Participants couldn't be blinded due to the nature of the intervention Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) All outcomes Low risk Between 9 to 11 participants in each group did not receive the allocated intervention due to incorrect assignments by researchers. They were included in the intention-totreat analysis Selective reporting (reporting bias) Unclear risk Protocol is not available, however, the number of possible outcomes seems restricted to those reported Other bias High risk The definition of 'attendance' is strict, being attendance at the clinics on scheduled days. The participants in the study were not accustomed to healthcare appointments but rather walk-in visits: 48% of the participants actually visited the clinic on days other than the appointment dates The control and intervention groups were comparable at baseline D A T A A N D A N A L Y S E S Comparison 1.

Studies were conducted over 2 months (Chen 2008), 3 months (Leong 2006), 7 months (Fairhurst 2008), and 9 months (Koury 2005) respectively. All studies compared the effects of the text messaging intervention to usual practice. In three studies usual practice was no reminders. In Koury 2005, the usual practice was to send postal reminders two weeks before appointments. Chen 2008 and Leong 2006 had a second intervention arm of phone call reminders and compared the effects of the text messaging intervention to call reminders. The sample sizes for the included studies ranged from 291 (Koury 2005) to 1848 participants (Chen 2008)."
