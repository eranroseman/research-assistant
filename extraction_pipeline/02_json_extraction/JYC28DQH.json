  "title": "Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Psoriasis A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Multiple patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for health-related quality of life (HRQL) exist for patients with psoriasis. Evidence for the content validity and other measurement properties of these PROMs is critical to determine which HRQL PROMs could be recommended for use. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the validity of HRQL-focused PROMs used in patients with psoriasis. EVIDENCE REVIEW Using PubMed and Embase, full-text articles published in English or Spanish on development or validation studies for psoriasis-specific, dermatology-specific, or generic HRQL PROMs were included. Development studies included original development studies, even if not studied in psoriasis patients per Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) recommendations. If a study included multiple diagnoses, more than 50% of patients had to have psoriasis or psoriasis-specific subgroup analyses available. Data extraction and analysis followed the COSMIN guidelines. Two independent reviewers extracted and analyzed the data, including PROM characteristics, quality of measurement properties (structural validity, internal consistency, cross-cultural validity, reliability, measurement error, criterion validity, construct validity, and responsiveness), and level of evidence. PROMs were classified into 3 levels of recommendations: (1) PROM recommended for use; (2) PROM requires further validation; and (3) PROM not recommended for use. FINDINGS Overall, 97 articles were identified for extraction. This included 19 psoriasis-specific, 8 skin-specific, and 6 generic PROMs. According to COSMIN standards, most measures identified received a B recommendation for use, indicating their potential but requiring further validation. Only the Rasch reduced version of the Impact of Psoriasis Questionnaire (IPSO-11 Rasch) received an A recommendation for use given that it had sufficient content validity, structural validity, and internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study identified a significant lack of information concerning the quality of HRQL measures in psoriasis. This gap in knowledge can be attributed to the fact that traditional measures were developed using validation criteria that differ from the current standards in use. Consequently, additional validation studies in accordance with contemporary standards will be useful in aiding researchers and clinicians in determining the most suitable measure for assessing HRQL in patients with psoriasis.",

      "text": "T he International Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM) initiative is developing a Core Outcome Set for use in psoriasis clinical trials and longitudinal observational studies. This process consists of 2 consecutive steps: (1) identifying a core set of domains and (2) selecting the most appropriate instrument to measure these domains.  1  Selecting the right outcomes and valid measures for each domain is of paramount importance in the planning of clinical trials, as it enables direct comparison of interventions.  1  It is also important that the selected outcomes hold significance for key stakeholders, including patients and clinicians.\n\nIn 2018, IDEOM published a core domain set for psoriasis clinical trials and is now working on selecting instruments for identified domains. The domains included in the set consist of skin manifestations, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) symptoms, investigator global, patient global, treatment satisfaction, and healthrelated quality of life (HRQL).  2 RQL is a complex and multidimensional construct that captures individuals' quality of life relative to their health or disease status.  3, 4 Wilson and Cleary 5 have developed one of the most frequently used conceptual models of HRQL. This model describes 5 levels of outcomes including biological and physiological factors, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and overall quality of life. In this review, we defined HRQL as symptoms (physical or mental), physical functioning, social functioning (ie, interpersonal interactions/activities), role functioning (ie, academic/work achievement), and overall quality of life.\n\nPsoriasis exerts a significant effect on a patient's HRQL.  [6] [7] ] [8] [9] [10] [11]  Understanding a patient's current HRQL status is critical to support optimal disease management, informing patient-physician discussions, and delivering high-quality care.  3, 8, [10] [11] 1] [12] [13] [14]  Accordingly, multiple treatment guidelines have recommended HRQL measurement during routine psoriasis care.  [15] [16] ] [17] [18]  To date, numerous psoriasis-specific, dermatology-or skinrelated quality of life (SRQL), and generic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been used to measure HRQL in patients with psoriasis. However, little is known about which of these measures might be most appropriate to evaluate HRQL among patients with psoriasis. To establish which HRQL PROMs are best validated and guide future validation efforts, we sought to systematically review and assess the measurement properties of HRQL PROMs used in psoriasis in accordance with the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COS-MIN) guidelines.

In cases of disagreement, the reviewers discussed the case, and if needed, a third reviewer was queried.\n\nWe included any full-text article published in English or Spanish that investigated development or evaluation of measurement properties for a PROM assessing HRQL in patients with psoriasis. In studies investigating multiple dermatologic conditions, psoriasis had to be present in 50% or more of the patients, or subgroup analyses on psoriasis-specific data had to be available. In addition, studies were required to report on a PROM that aimed to measure HRQL. Only multidimensional instruments that assessed 2 or more aspects of HRQL per the Wilson and Cleary model were included. PROMs that measured only 1 aspect of HRQL (eg, only mental health or work productivity) were excluded.\n\nStudy population could include children, adolescents, or adults. Developmentstudiescouldincludeoriginaldevelopmentstudies,even if not studied in psoriasis patients per COSMIN recommendations.  [19] [20] ] [21]  Studies that only used the PROM as an outcome measurement or where PROMs were included only to validate a new PROM or other PROMs were excluded. PROMs tested among patients with PsA only were excluded. Psoriasis-specific instruments were defined as those developed for use only among patients with psoriasis and measuring psoriasis-related HRQL status. SRQL instruments were defined as instruments that were developed in patients with dermatologic conditions to measure cutaneous disease-mediated HRQL.

Findings In this systematic review, almost all health-related quality of life measures for psoriasis were missing evidence for key measurement properties according to Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments Guidelines; this gap in knowledge may arise from the fact that most of these measures, including those used routinely for registration trials, were developed using validation criteria that differ from the current standards in use.\n\nMeaning Further work is needed to demonstrate the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of other health-related quality measures in patients with psoriasis. item scores measured. Formative (sometimes called \"causal\") models measure items that directly cause changes in HRQL.  22 We characterized each instrument's original description as reflective or formative. However, when a description was not available, this determination was made by the authors using guidance such as the thought test.  23 Structural validity and internal consistency were not evaluated for formative instruments.  [22] [23] 3] [24]  If the instrument contained a mix of reflective and formative items and structural validity and internal consistency were reported, the instrument was assumed to be based on a reflective model and such measurement properties were evaluated.  20"

PROM versions in specific languages were considered separate PROMs for data extraction and analysis.\n\nThe results of each study on a measurement property were extracted and evaluated using the Criteria for Good Measurement Properties. Accordingly, each result was rated as sufficient, insufficient, or indeterminate.  19 Results from individual studies were then qualitatively summarized by measurement property per PROM. The summarized result was also compared against the same criteria and rated as sufficient, insufficient, indeterminate, or inconsistent. For hypothesis-based construct validity testing, the acceptable degree of correlation between PROMs was established a priori (eMethods 2 in the Supplement). Relatedly, hypothesis testing comparisons should be guided by the quality of the comparator. For details on comparator quality assessment and definitions see eMethods 3 in the Supplement.\n\nTo assess the comprehensiveness of PROMs, we established a priori a minimum set of domains that should be assessed by a given PROM to receive a positive rating for comprehensiveness. We defined the minimum set of required domains based on the HRQL model proposed by Wilson and Cleary, the most frequently used conceptual model of HRQL.  5  Accordingly, the comprehensiveness of a PROM would be rated positive if it included at least 1 item for the following domains: symptoms, physical functioning, social functioning (ie, interpersonal interactions/activities), role functioning (ie, academic/work achievement), depression or anxiety, and body image."

This gap in knowledge can be attributed to the fact that most measures were developed using validation criteria that differ from the current standards set by COSMIN. As a result, further validation studies in line with modern standards are needed to assist researchers and clinicians in selecting the most appropriate HRQL measures for psoriasis.\n\nAccording to COSMIN standards (sufficient content validity, structural validity, and internal consistency), only 1 measure, the Rasch reduced version of the Impact of Psoriasis Questionnaire (IPSO-11 Rasch), 86 received an A recommendation for use. However, it is important to note that data were not available for reliability, construct validity, or responsiveness for this version (though there are data to support the construct validity of its parent measure, the IPSO-16). In addition, the evidence for content validity was of very low quality (ie, only based on reviewer ratings). Therefore, al-though the IPSO-11 Rasch met the COSMIN criteria to receive an A recommendation, there is a need for additional studies to confirm its content validity and other measurement properties. The PSORIQoL, NPQ10, and the NAPPAQOL had sufficient structural validity and internal consistency, but evidence supporting their content validity was limited. If further data were available to confirm the content validity of these measures, they could receive an A recommendation for use.\n\nAmong dermatology-specific measures, both the Skindex-16  67  and the DLQI  41  have received recommendations for use, indicating their potential but requiring further validation. The US English version of Skindex-16 demonstrated sufficient content validity (very low quality), although data on its structural validity and internal consistency were not available. The DLQI had inconsistent evidence for content validity.

However, it is important to acknowledge that the assessment of comprehensiveness is challenging because items that are strongly correlated may be deleted during measure development to improve feasibility. In addition, the high prevalence of not relevant responses on the DLQI raised concerns about its content validity and potential for bias when used among diverse populations.  51, 116, 122 Results regarding the structural validity of the DLQI varied across different language versions, with the UK English version showing insufficient structural validity. In contrast, studies showed that the DLQI [Spanish,  64, 70  English US, 87,107,114 German,  37  and Danish 38 ] was able to capture change in SRQL over time. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of additional validation studies for the various versions of the DLQI. There was a lack of studies examining the content validity, structural validity, and internal consistency of generic HRQL measures such as the EQ-5D and SF-36 in the context of psoriasis. However, it is worth noting that the English versions of the EQ-5D-3L and SF-36 demonstrated high-quality evidence for sufficient responsiveness, 107 indicating their ability to detect changes HRQL over time in this population. In particular, the SF-36 has shown promise in detecting clinically meaningful treatment-associated improvements in psoriasis and has demonstrated low evidence of ceiling effects, which means it can capture improvements even when patients are already functioning at a highlevel. 123 OMERACT(OutcomeMeasuresinRheumatology)hasrecognized the value of using generic HRQL measures alongside diseasespecific measures because they capture different aspects of the effects of the disease.  [124] [125] 5] [126] [127]  Overall, these findings highlight the need for studies exploring the content validity, structural validity, and internal consistency of generic HRQL measures in the context of psoriasis to enhance their utility in clinical practice and research."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "It is possible that some studies were performed according to the standards outlined by COSMIN, but that these details were not included in the resulting publications. This issue may be particularly common among studies published prior to the COSMIN initiative start in 2005. Because only aspects of studies that were reported can be assessed, it is possible that we may underestimate the quality of the evidence for some of the examined PROMs. Another limitation is that several aspects of the COSMIN risk of bias checklist are somewhat subjective. To mitigate potential reviewer bias, we discussed and formalized assumptions for these situations a priori and created rubrics to improve consistency (see methodology for assessing comprehensiveness of PROMs, Supplement). Although the COSMIN framework has certain limitations, it offers a formal framework from which to assess the quality of PROM development and measurement properties.  [128] [129] ] [130]  Although COSMIN primarily recommends that only 1 literature search is conducted using the following strategy: (1) construct, (2) population(s), (3) type of instrument(s), and (4) measurement properties, we used an alternative 2-stage strategy also described in the COSMIN manual by which we first identified all PROMs that have been used in patients with psoriasis (stage 1) and subsequently searched for validation studies for all PROMs identified in stage 1 (stage 2). Although we suspect that this strategy would yield similar results to the recommended approach described in the COS-MIN manual, it is possible that important development, pilot, or validation studies were missed. In addition, because PROM development and validation work is an ongoing process, future updates to this review will be important to guide decisions on PROM use."

      "text": "Most of the identified measures received a B recommendation for use, indicating their potential to be recommended but requiring further validation. Only the Rasch reduced IPSO-11 was found to be sufficiently valid with respect to the COSMIN standards. Therefore, additional research that follows modern psychometric standards would be highly beneficial for researchers and clinicians in their endeavor to choose the most suitable HRQL measure for patients with psoriasis.\n\n76.
