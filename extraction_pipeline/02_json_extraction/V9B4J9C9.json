  "title": "Cost-effectiveness of Interventions to Manage Diabetes: Has the Evidence Changed Since 2008?",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To synthesize updated evidence on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of interventions to manage diabetes, its complications, and comorbidities. \n RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review of studies from high-income countries evaluating the CE of diabetes management interventions recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and published in English between June 2008 and July 2017. We also incorporated studies from a previous CE review from the period 1985-2008. We classified the interventions based on their strength of evidence (strong, supportive, or uncertain) and levels of CE: cost-saving (more health benefit at a lower cost), very cost-effective (\u00a3$25,000 per life year gained [LYG]  or quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), cost-effective ($25,001-$50,000 per LYG or QALY), marginally cost-effective ($50,001-$100,000 per LYG or QALY), or not costeffective (>$100,000 per LYG or QALY). Costs were measured in 2017 U.S. dollars. \n RESULTS Seventy-three new studies met our inclusion criteria. These were combined with 49 studies from the previous review to yield 122 studies over the period 1985-2017. A large majority of the ADA-recommended interventions remain cost-effective. Specifically, we found strong evidence that the following ADA-recommended interventions are cost-saving or very cost-effective: In the cost-saving category are 1) ACE inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for intensive hypertension management compared with standard hypertension management, 2) ACEI/ARB therapy to prevent chronic kidney disease and/or end-stage renal disease in people with albuminuria compared with no ACEI/ARB therapy, 3) comprehensive foot care and patient education to prevent and treat foot ulcers among those at moderate/high risk of developing foot ulcers, 4) telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy screening compared with office screening, and 5) bariatric surgery compared with no surgery for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (BMI \u202130 kg/m 2 ). In the very cost-effective category are 1) intensive glycemic management (targeting A1C <7%) compared with conventional glycemic management (targeting an A1C level of 8-10%) for individuals with newly diagnosed T2D, 2) multicomponent interventions (involving behavior change/education and pharmacological therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, nephropathy/retinopathy, secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with aspirin) compared with usual care, 3) statin therapy compared with no statin therapy for individuals with T2D and history of cardiovascular disease, 4) diabetes self-management education and support compared with usual care, 5) T2D screening every 3 years starting at age 45 years compared with no screening, 6) integrated, patient-centered care compared with usual care, 7) smoking cessation compared with no smoking cessation, 8) daily aspirin use as primary prevention for cardiovascular complications compared with usual care, 9) self-monitoring of blood glucose three times per day compared with once per day among those using insulin, 10) intensive glycemic management compared with conventional insulin therapy for",

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "Complementing professional treatment recommendations, our systematic review provides an updated understanding of the potential value of interventions to manage diabetes and its complications and can assist clinicians and payers in prioritizing interventions and health care resources.\n\nDiabetes is a serious, common, and costly disease, affecting 34 million Americans (1) and leading to $327 billion  (2)  in annual health expenditures in 2017. To better manage and lower the burdens of diabetes, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) annually publishes its Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (SOC) (3), the most comprehensive and up-to-date clinical knowledge regarding diabetes care. Worldwide, the SOC provides clinicians, patients, researchers, and payers with the most current evidence-based screening, diagnostic, prevention, and management recommendations for diabetes. However, the cost-effectiveness (CE) of these strategiesdin other words, the value they provide for these investmentsdvaries greatly and should be considered in management or policy decisions.\n\nCE analysis is an analytical framework that weighs the benefits and costs of an intervention by comparing it with standard care or other alternatives to see if the value of the intervention justifies its cost. The CE of different treatment options provides critical information to stakeholders at a variety of levels; this information helps in development of optimal treatment strategies or policies to lower current and future health and economic burdens and help determine use of limited health care resources.\n\nIn 2010, Li et al.  (4)  systematically reviewed all English-language studies published between January 1985 and May 2008 on the CE of diabetes prevention and management interventions recommended by the ADA's SOC 2008  (5) . The authors concluded that a large majority of the interventions recommended by ADA at that time were cost-saving or very cost-effective. Since then, however, many new technologies and medications have become available and have been added to updated iterations of the ADA's SOC, leading to important changes in the ways diabetes care is delivered, how complications are managed, and the resulting costs. Recently published CE studies on these new technologies and medications can provide evidence on how to prioritize these novel interventions together with older strategies that remain cost-effective.\n\nTo provide up-to-date guidance that aligns with the 2019 SOC (the most up-todate version at the time of data analysis)  (6, 7) , we aggregated all available data published in English regarding the CE of ADA-recommended interventions to identify diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus, manage diabetes, screen for diabetes complications, and manage complications and comorbidities. We included data from the previous review by Li et al. and systematically added data from the last decade to provide findings that are relevant to contemporary clinical practice. The result allows us to assess economic implications of changes that have occurred in the way diabetes care is delivered and how complications are managed. As a complement to the ADA's 2019 SOC recommendations, findings from this review could assist clinicians and policy makers in selecting interventions that are not only effective but also deliver value."

Briefly, we performed a thorough literature search of seven databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Sociological Abstracts [Soc Abs]) following the Cochrane Collaboration's protocol  (8)  covering the period of June 2008 to July 2017. Medical subject headings matching the previous review's search protocol were selected to create a search strategy. Our search terms were diabetes (indicating the disease of diabetes: \"type 1,\" \"type 2,\" \"gestational,\" \"impaired glucose,\" and \"insulin resistance\"), costs (\"cost or expenditure,\" \"health care cost,\" \"costs or cost analysis\"), effectiveness (\"benefit\" OR \"life year\" OR \"quality-adjusted life years\" OR \"disability adjusted life years\"), costeffectiveness (indicating CE analysis, such as \"cost-effectiveness analysis\" OR \"costutility analysis\" OR \"economic\").

We included studies of patients with undiagnosed or diagnosed diabetes, including type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\nWe included studies that used one of the three major types of economic evaluations: cost-effectiveness analyses, costutility analyses, or cost-benefit analyses, with outcomes measured as cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, cost per additional life year gained (LYG), or cost per additional disabilityadjusted life year averted.\n\nWe included original research studies published in English and excluded review articles, commentaries or letters, conference abstracts, and dissertations. For this review, we also excluded studies that focused on preventing T2D. Each study was screened for eligibility by two authors (K.R.S., X.Zho., B.P.N., S.J., K.P., and X.Zha. all participated in this stage), with disagreements resolved by group discussion and consensus."

We considered four quality score items: source of cost-specific data, categories of costs, source of benefit-specific data, and categories of benefits. We classified studies that did not report all four items as \"low quality.\" Of studies that had all four components, we assessed nine additional items (analytical time horizon, study perspective, description of the CE model, diagram for constructing the decision tree, currency and year of cost, cost discounting, benefit discounting, ICERs, and sensitivity analysis) for further classification. We assigned one point for each item that was reported. We rated each study as \"fair\" if it scored 3 or less, \"good\" if it scored 4-6, and \"excellent\" if it scored 7-9 points. We restricted our analysis to articles rated as \"excellent\" or \"good\" quality. Our quality assessment methodology mirrored that used by Li et al.

      "title": "Data Analysis and Synthesis",
      "text": "To synthesize findings, we first grouped articles into four broad categories: 1) screening for undiagnosed diabetes (including T2D and gestational diabetes mellitus), 2) managing diabetes and risk factors to prevent diabetes-related complications (comprehensive lifestyle interventions; diabetes self-management education [DSME]; self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG]; intensive glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control; integrated and coordinated care; smoking cessation), 3) screening for and early treatment of diabetes complications (cardiovascular disease [CVD], eye complications, foot ulcers, end-stage renal disease [ESRD]), or 4) treating diabetes-related complications and comorbidities (CVD, eye complications, foot ulcers, and comorbidities such as obesity, mental health, and sleep apnea). Within each of the four broader groups, we further classified studies into specific categories corresponding to each ADA-recommended intervention.\n\nTo facilitate comparisons across studies, we converted all costs and ICERs to 2017 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index  (11) . If costs were reported in other currencies, we used the annual exchange rate from the Federal Reserve Bank  (12)  to convert them into U.S. dollars. If a study did not mention the year used in cost calculations, we assumed cost was for the one year prior to publication. ICERs were expressed as dollars per QALY or dollars per LYG and were rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. We calculated a range and median ICER for each intervention category."

      "title": "Classifying the Interventions",
      "text": "We classified interventions based on their median levels of CE (five tiers) and strength of evidence (three levels). As there are no universally accepted thresholds to judge whether an intervention is cost-effective, we grouped the CE tiers of the intervention based on conventional norms according to their estimated ICERs: 1) cost-saving when the intervention generates better health outcomes and costs less than the comparison intervention or is cost neutral (ICER 5 0), 2) very cost-effective if the ICER is greater than zero but less than or equal to $25,000 per QALY or LYG, 3) cost-effective if the ICER is greater than $25,000 but less than or equal to $50,000 per QALY or LYG, 4) marginally costeffective if the ICER is greater than $50,000 but less than or equal to $100,000 per QALY or LYG, and 5) not cost-effective if the ICER is greater than $100,000 per QALY or LYG. Since there are no conventional norms for thresholds of cost per LYG, we used the same threshold for cost per QALY, which was the same approach used by Li et al.  (4) .\n\nWe classified the evidence level of the CE findings as strong, supportive, or uncertain. Strong evidence included findings from one of the following two categories:\n\nCategory 1: 1. The CE of the intervention was evaluated by two or more studies, AND 2. these studies were rated as at least \"good\" in quality, AND 3. the effectiveness of the interventions was based on either well-conducted, generalizable randomized clinical trials with adequate power or wellconducted meta-analyses or a diabetes disease simulation model that was validated, AND 4. the effectiveness of the intervention was also rated as level A or level B evidence by the ADA's SOC 2019 (13), AND 5. the ICERs of the intervention from different studies consistently fell into the same CE tier.\n\nCategory 2: 1. CE assessment meets items 3 and 4 from category 1, but only one study evaluated the intervention, AND 2. the study was rated as \"excellent\" in quality.\n\nWe considered evidence on the CE of an intervention to be supportive if:\n\n1. the CE of the intervention was evaluated by only one study AND this study was rated lower than \"excellent\" quality, OR\n\nFigure 1-Flowchart for article inclusion. care.diabetesjournals.org Siegel and Associates 1559 2. the effectiveness of the intervention was supported by level C evidence according to the ADA's SOC 2019 (13) or by expert consensus only, OR 3. the CE was based on a simulation by a diabetes disease model that was not validated (a model was considered to be validated if it was explicitly stated in the text of the article or if the model was known to be validated based on previous literature).\n\nFor each ADA-recommended intervention within each evidence-CE level category, we described its comparison intervention, the study population in which the intervention was implemented, and the ADA's level of evidence rating. We also reported the number of studies that evaluated the CE of this intervention (based on the current evidence and on the previous review), and the median and range of the ICERs across the studies."

We added the 49 relevant studies on diabetes management from the 2010 review by  Li et al. (encompassing 1985 Li et al.

Supplementary Fig.  1  provides a summary of the numbers of studies across the four broad intervention categoriesd screening for undiagnosed diabetes (8 studies), managing diabetes and risk factors to prevent diabetes-related complications (71 studies), screening for and early treatment of diabetes complications (33 studies), and treating diabetes-related complications and comorbidities (19 studies)das well as how the number of articles in each category changed from the previous review  to the current review . Except for smoking cessation, the number of articles in every category increased over time, and five new categories emerged: preventing CVD complications, treating CVD complications, and addressing comorbidities of obesity, mental health, and sleep apnea.\n\nIn Table  2 , we classified each of the ADA-recommended interventions based on their levels of CE and strength of evidence by intervention category, using all studies over the period 1985-2017.

Additionally, there were several new studies on the daily frequency of SMBG, which led to the new finding that SMBG three times per day, compared with SMBG once per day, is very cost-effective ($3,719/QALY) among adults with T2D currently taking insulin.\n\nThe ICERs for intensively managing glycemia varied according to a patient's age, duration of diabetes, and diabetes type (1 or 2). We found that intensive glycemic management compared with conventional management was very costeffective among young individuals with newly diagnosed T2D ($4,318/QALY) and older individuals (aged $50 years) with T2D ($15,398/QALY) and was costeffective when given to individuals with T1D regardless of age ($41,339/QALY).\n\nFor blood pressure management, ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapies, used either for intensive hypertension management (compared with suboptimal blood pressure management) or to prevent chronic kidney disease and/or ESRD in patients with albuminuria, compared with no ACEI/ARB therapy, emerged with strong evidence of being cost-saving.\n\nOver the period 1985-2017, studies comparing multicomponent interventions (including behavior change and medication adherence to improve glycemia, blood pressure/CVD, lipids, and nephropathy/retinopathy prevention and screening together) with usual care have shown a range of value achieved from cost-effective to cost-saving. Overall, however, we found that these multicomponent interventions were on average very cost-effective ($2,315/QALY) for individuals with T1D and T2D compared with usual care.\n\nDiabetes management interventions that remained consistent with the previous review as very cost-effective were 1) integrated, patient-centered care based on the Chronic Care Model for individuals with T2D compared with usual care ($11,339/QALY), and 2) smoking cessation for individuals with diabetes compared with no smoking cessation (,$31,750/ QALY)."

A new finding in this review was that daily aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD among individuals with T2D, compared with usual care, was very cost-effective ($2,395/QALY). There were eight studies evaluating the CE of bariatric surgery in individuals with T2D and obesity (BMI $30 kg/m 2 ) compared with no bariatric surgery.

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "Figure  2  is a comprehensive guide to our findings. Overall, the ADA-recommended interventions included in the previously published review remain cost-saving, very cost-effective, or cost-effective. The strength of the evidence improved from supportive to strong for both DSME (compared with usual care) and integrated, patient-centered care based on the Chronic Care Model (compared with usual care) due to additional studies on these topics during the 2008-2017 time period. Interventions that are cost-saving should be implemented, and those that are very cost-effective or cost-effective based on strong evidence warrant consideration for implementation. ADArecommended interventions rated as cost-saving, very cost-effective, or costeffective with supportive evidence should be adopted if extra resources are available or if similar interventions with strong evidence are unavailable or infeasible in a specific setting.\n\nOur review highlighted the value associated with new and innovative interventions to manage and treat diabetes, including technology-related innovations and those focused on addressing diabetes-related comorbidities. The focus on technological innovations and diabetes-related comorbidities is well-aligned with the ADA SOC 2019 (14) (as well as the recently updated ADA SOC 2020  [3, 14] ). In addition, the inclusion of collaborative care models for depression is a big step toward acknowledging and addressing the comorbid conditions of diabetes and depression, which is increasingly being seen as an important consideration in the care of people with diabetes  (15) .\n\nMulticomponent interventions are also featured prominently in the current review and may have implications for delivery system design, especially in the context of persistent gaps in achievement of diabetes care goals  (16, 17) . Among individuals with diabetes, interventions that included a combination of practice change, behavior change and education, pharmacologic therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, or nephropathy/retinopathy, and secondary prevention of CVD with aspirin were very cost-effective compared with usual care, based on strong evidence. Of note, our review predates the ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes) trial, which showed that the primary CVD prevention benefits of aspirin were offset by the increased risk of major bleeding events  (18) .\n\nIn some cases, CE evaluations may help to provide more insight into how ADArecommended interventions might be prioritized for specific populations receiving the intervention. For example, bariatric surgery was cost-saving among individuals with T2D and obesity but only very cost-effective among individuals with T2D and overweight, likely due to larger health risks posed by obesity. We also noted differences in the CE of statin therapy for individuals with diabetes with and without CVD; when used as secondary prevention, there is clear value to statin use (cost-saving). However, for primary prevention, statin use has been found to be less cost-effective. We found that the CE of intensive glycemic management (with a goal of reducing A1C values) depends on age and duration since diabetes diagnosis. Among young individuals with newly diagnosed T2D, intensive glycemic management, compared with conventional insulin therapy, is costsaving; indeed, recent research shows that earlier intensive management is associated with lower long-term risk of complications  (19) . For older individuals (aged $50 years) with T2D and shorter life expectancy, the ability to see benefits of intensive glycemic management is limited, in part because cardiovascular or mortality benefits may not be seen for at least 10 years  (20) . In individuals with T1D, intensive glycemic management compared with conventional insulin therapy remains cost-effective.\n\nThere are a few key areas that future economic evaluations of diabetes should consider. First, more studies are needed to evaluate the CE of interventions that fell in the \"supportive\" or \"uncertain\" evidence categories. In cases where interventions have uncertain value due to a small number of studies (i.e., incomplete knowledge), adding to the evidence base could help to clarify their value. There are also a number of new, efficacious medications and treatments for the management of glycemia (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors), lipids (PSK9 inhibitors), and heart failure (sacubitril/valsartan [Entresto]) that were not included in this review because there are no published CE studies. For studies with weaker efficacy data, further efficacy studies are needed.\n\nSecond, more studies are needed that address interventions in real-world settings, as our current review is predominantly based on randomized controlled trials or computer simulation models. In real life, however, there are many factors to consider in addition to the CE of an intervention, such as 1) coverage for the intervention in question (determine access), 2) motivation (side effects or mode of delivery [e.g., injectable versus oral] may deter patients from taking specific medications), and 3) whether the risk reduction in real life is similar to what was observed in trials and models (i.e., effectiveness versus efficacy). These are many of the unknowns that clinicians and policy makers must consider as they attempt to use the data from this review in practice.\n\nThird, there may be additional costeffective interventions that exist but have not been studied or about which the right questions are not being asked. For example, the 2010 review included one article regarding the CE of smoking cessation, which was found to be very cost-effective. There were no additional articles in this category from 2008-2017, likely because it is universally understood that smoking cessation is good and thus no one would be compelled to argue its value; a more interesting contemporary economic question might be to inquire how often a smoking cessation intervention should be implemented for it to be most costeffective and most adoptable by clinicians and their patients.\n\nThe CE of an intervention in decisionmaking is important, but it is not the only factor to consider. CE analysis does not address equity in the distribution of costs and the benefits of an intervention, societal or personal willingness to pay, social and legal aspects, or ethical issues associated with each intervention. However, with an eye toward finding diabetes management and treatment interventions that can best increase the value of our health care dollars, this review of the most up-to-date available evidence can help to guide clinicians and policymakerstowardthemostcost-effective use of their prescriptions and health care dollars."

      "text": "Supportive and Uncertain EvidenceThere were nine specific interventions for which the level of CE was based on supportive evidence. Among these, costsaving interventions are 1) reimbursement for ACEI by public insurance for individuals with diabetes compared with paying out of pocket and 2) group-based peer support for individuals with T2D compared with usual care. Very cost-effective interventions, based on supportive evidence, were both new findings in this updated review: 1) statin treatment at T2D diagnosis compared with no lipid-regulating treatment ($3,294/QALY) and 2) bariatric surgery for individuals with T2D and overweight compared with no surgery ($23,320/QALY). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for individuals with T2D and obstructive sleep apnea compared with usual care was also costeffective ($27,750/QALY). Adhering to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for adults with T2D and mixed dyslipidemia compared with usual care was marginally cost-effective ($67,873/QALY)."

      "text": "Oursystematicreviewprovidesanupdated understanding of the potential value of interventions to manage and treat diabetes from a health system perspective. Since the last review in 2010, the evidence that interventions to manage diabetes are cost-effective has grown in terms of additional evaluations to bolster existing evidence, as well as new economic evaluations of novel interventions and methods of care delivery. ACEI/ARB therapy compared with standard hypertension management, comprehensive foot care compared with usual care, and intensive glycemic management compared with conventional therapy are confirmed as very cost-effective interventions, while multicomponent interventions compared with usual care, statin therapy for secondary prevention compared with no statin therapy, T2D screening every 3 years compared with no screening, and screening for eye complications compared with no screening are confirmed as very costeffective interventions. New findings include telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy screening and bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes and BMI $30 kg/m 2 as cost-saving interventions and aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular complications, SMBG three times per day for insulin-treated patients (compared with once per day), intensive glycemic management among those aged $50 years, and collaborative care for depression as very cost-effective interventions. This review complements professional treatment recommendations and can assist clinicians and payers in prioritizing interventions in an evidence-based manner that may"

      "description": "Supportive and Uncertain EvidenceThere were nine specific interventions for which the level of CE was based on supportive evidence. Among these, costsaving interventions are 1) reimbursement for ACEI by public insurance for individuals with diabetes compared with paying out of pocket and 2) group-based peer support for individuals with T2D compared with usual care. Very cost-effective interventions, based on supportive evidence, were both new findings in this updated review: 1) statin treatment at T2D diagnosis compared with no lipid-regulating treatment ($3,294/QALY) and 2) bariatric surgery for individuals with T2D and overweight compared with no surgery ($23,320/QALY). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for individuals with T2D and obstructive sleep apnea compared with usual care was also costeffective ($27,750/QALY). Adhering to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for adults with T2D and mixed dyslipidemia compared with usual care was marginally cost-effective ($67,873/QALY)."

      "description": "Oursystematicreviewprovidesanupdated understanding of the potential value of interventions to manage and treat diabetes from a health system perspective. Since the last review in 2010, the evidence that interventions to manage diabetes are cost-effective has grown in terms of additional evaluations to bolster existing evidence, as well as new economic evaluations of novel interventions and methods of care delivery. ACEI/ARB therapy compared with standard hypertension management, comprehensive foot care compared with usual care, and intensive glycemic management compared with conventional therapy are confirmed as very cost-effective interventions, while multicomponent interventions compared with usual care, statin therapy for secondary prevention compared with no statin therapy, T2D screening every 3 years compared with no screening, and screening for eye complications compared with no screening are confirmed as very costeffective interventions. New findings include telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy screening and bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes and BMI $30 kg/m 2 as cost-saving interventions and aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular complications, SMBG three times per day for insulin-treated patients (compared with once per day), intensive glycemic management among those aged $50 years, and collaborative care for depression as very cost-effective interventions. This review complements professional treatment recommendations and can assist clinicians and payers in prioritizing interventions in an evidence-based manner that may"
