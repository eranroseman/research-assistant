  "title": "Barriers and facilitators to patient-to-provider messaging using the COM-B model and theoretical domains framework: a rapid umbrella review",
  "abstract": "Background Virtual patient-to-provider messaging systems such as text messaging have the potential to improve healthcare access; however, little research has used theory to understand the barriers and facilitators impacting uptake of these systems by patients and healthcare providers. This review uses the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to explore barriers and facilitators of patient-to-provider messaging. Methods A rapid umbrella review method was followed. Medline and CINAHL were searched for review articles that examined patient-to-provider implementation barriers and facilitators by patients or healthcare providers. Two coders extracted implementation barriers and facilitators, and one coder mapped these barriers and facilitators on to the COM-B and TDF. \n Results \n Fifty -nine unique barriers and facilitators were extracted. Regarding healthcare provider oriented barriers and facilitators, the most frequently identified COM-B components included Reflective Motivation (identified in 42% of provider barriers and facilitators), Psychological Capability (19%) and Physical Opportunity (19%) and TDF domains included Beliefs about Consequences (identified in 28% of provider barriers and facilitators), Environmental Context and Resources (19%), and Social Influences (17%). Regarding patient oriented barriers and facilitators, the most frequently identified COM-B components included Reflective Motivation (identified in 55% of patient barriers and facilitators), Psychological Capability (16%), and Physical Opportunity (16%) and TDF domains included Beliefs about Consequences (identified in 30% of patient barriers and facilitators), Environmental Context and Resources (16%), and Beliefs about Capabilities (11%). Conclusions Both patients and healthcare providers experience barriers to implementing patient-to-provider messaging systems. By conducting a COM-B and TDF-based analysis of the implementation barriers and facilitators, this review highlights several theoretical domains for researchers, healthcare systems, and policy-makers to focus",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "With the rapid adoption of virtual healthcare services seen during the COVID-19 pandemic  [1] [2] [3] [4] , and widespread acceptability of mobile devices, there has been a shift towards electronic and mobile health ('eHealth' and 'mHealth' , respectively) solutions to augment traditional in-person healthcare services  [5] . For example, adoption of eHealth and mHealth (herein referred to as 'virtual care') increased dramatically, with 86% of patients in the province of British Columbia, Canada connecting with their primary care physician virtually between April and September 2020  [6] . To enhance the effectiveness of primary care during COVID-19, primary healthcare providers employed virtual care solutions for remote triage, consultations, monitoring, and prescriptions  [7, 8] . The wide-scale adoption and implementation of equitable virtual care services has the potential to improve access to care, reduce risk of disease transmission, reduce tension on healthcare facilities, and support continuity of care  [9] .\n\nPatient-to-provider messaging is a commonly used virtual care service defined as any virtual messaging system which facilitates written communication between a healthcare provider and their patients. Some examples of patient-to-provider messaging include text messaging, emails, or messaging embedded within smartphone applications. The low overhead costs and time commitments required for patient-to-provider messaging  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  has proven useful in supplementing care services and has been shown to improve adherence to health behaviours (e.g., medication adherence, appointment attendance)  [16] . Patient-to-provider messaging also has the potential to improve continuity of care by providing patients with ongoing support from healthcare providers remotely  [15] . Despite these promises, the sudden shift to virtual care seen during the COVID-19 pandemic has been criticized as it was implemented in haste, and may have inadvertently intensified the marginalization of those already experiencing inequities in healthcare (e.g., older adults, racialized communities, etc.)  [17] . Given that virtual care appears here to stay, there is a timely need to generate evidence to inform best practices for developing and delivering equitable, person-centred virtual care via patient-to-provider messaging."

      "title": "Developing theory-based interventions",
      "text": "One effective approach to generate actionable evidence and support virtual care delivery is by incorporating theory into intervention development. The Behaviour Change Wheel is a comprehensive intervention development framework which includes both the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) model, and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)  [18] . The Behaviour Change Wheel has been widely used to guide the development of theory-based interventions for virtual care  [19] [20] [21] . The COM-B model and TDF (refer to Fig.  1 ) form the core of the Behaviour Change Wheel (refer to Fig.  2 ), and are used at the initial stages of intervention development to identify barriers and facilitators which influence a target behaviour  [22] .\n\nThe COM-B model conceptualizes behaviour as part of a system of interacting components including an individuals capability (physical and psychological), opportunity (physical and social), and motivation (reflective and automatic)  [22] . Similarly, the TDF, which is often used alongside with the COM-B model  [23, 24] , provides a framework of 14 theoretical domains used to explain theoretical constructs considered as determinants of behaviour  [25] . The 14 TDF domains map directly onto the COM-B components  [25]  (see Fig.  1 ), allowing intervention designers the ability to use the TDF in conjunction with the COM-B. Using an integrated approach allows for the expansion of each component of the COM-B model, providing more detailed insights by incorporating the TDF  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Using the COM-B and TDF to examine barriers and facilitators to patient-to-provider messaging amongst existing evidence will result in a list of modifiable factors to target; listing such factors can aid designers to create theory-informed interventions, thereby potentially improving the implementation and effectiveness of virtual care services in the future."

With that said, various barriers and facilitators exist towards its adoption and effectiveness. The current rapid umbrella review represents the first systematic analysis and integration of barriers and facilitators associated with patient-to-provider messaging using the TDF and COM-B model. While use of the TDF or COM-B model to synthesize research literature is a relatively new concept  [48] , both have previously guided data analysis in other reviews focused on health behaviours and interventions  [49] [50] [51] .\n\nThis review provides valuable insights into the factors affecting healthcare providers and patients when using virtual messaging services, and highlights that both encounter numerous barriers and facilitators to implementing and engaging with patient-to-provider messaging. Further, the barriers and facilitators identified in this review span all COM-B components and all TDF domains (except for Goals); the most commonly identified COM-B category was Reflective Motivation which was identified in 39 out of the 59 unique barriers and facilitators (66%). Of the 39 barriers which fell within Reflective Motivation, the majority were further specified as Beliefs about Consequences using the TDF (23/39; 60%)."

Barriers oriented towards healthcare providers were primarily found within the TDF domains Environmental Context and Resources, Beliefs about Consequences, Knowledge, and Social or Professional Role and Identity, and COM-B components of Reflective Motivation, Physical Opportunity, and Psychological Capability. These provider barriers focused on aspects such as the addition of technology to their scope of practice, perceived increases in workload, and a lack of training. Patient-oriented barriers were primarily found within the TDF domains Environmental Context and Resources and Beliefs about Consequences, and the COM-B components of Reflective Motivation and Physical Opportunity. These patient barriers highlight the importance of addressing issues such as digital health literacy and disparities in internet access. Notably, privacy and confidentiality emerged as a prominent barrier across studies for both healthcare providers and patients, emphasizing the significance of ensuring data security and privacy safeguards in patient-to-provider messaging."

For healthcare providers, the TDF domains Beliefs about Consequences and Social Influences and COM-B components Reflective Motivation and Social Opportunity were the most frequently identified facilitators. The asynchronous nature of messaging allows healthcare providers to consult with colleagues and provide more considered responses, thereby allowing them the opportunity to prioritize the content of their messages to build and maintaining rapport with their patients. Contrary to the experiences noted as barriers, providers reported a perceived decrease in workload once patient-to-provider messaging was integrated into their clinical practice. This finding suggests that highlighting the potential benefits of improved efficiency and productivity through messaging could enhance provider motivation to adopt messaging practices.\n\nPatient related facilitators were primarily found within the TDF domains Beliefs about Consequences, Beliefs about Capabilities, and Memory, Attention, and Decision Processes, and COM-B components of Reflective motivation, and Psychological Capability. These patient facilitators emphasized patients feeling empowered to ask questions, improved access to information, the aid of written records in recall, and reduced travel time. The findings suggest that patient-to-provider messaging has the potential to enhance patient engagement, information accessibility, and convenience, thereby enabling patients to play a more active role in their healthcare.\n\nAn interesting finding from this review is the potential impact of patient-to-provider messaging on the therapeutic relationship, as indicated by barriers and facilitators from both healthcare providers and patients. Patients reported feeling more comfortable sharing sensitive information through messaging, which they otherwise might not feel comfortable discussing in person. Additionally, the asynchronous nature of messaging allows patients to ask relevant questions at their convenience. However, providers expressed concerns about the informal nature of messaging and its potential to blur the patient-provider relationship. These results appear to underscore the importance of maintaining appropriate boundaries and ensuring clear communication channels within text-based patient-to-provider messaging."

      "text": "While the primary strength of this review is the use of the COM-B model and the TDF to categorize providerand patient-level barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of virtual care identified in previous research on patient-to-provider messaging, it is important to also recognize its limitations. In conducting this umbrella review, a rapid review methodology was used which streamlines the systematic review process while also potentially introducing bias into specific review steps. For example, a limited number of databases were searched, and inclusion was limited to English language review articles. By limiting to only review type articles, the authors did not have access to the raw data from each article within eligible reviews; therefore only barriers and facilitators that were reported within the review articles could be extracted and coded, and findings may not encompass the full range of factors influencing implementation of patient-to-provider virtual messaging. Further, the majority of screening and data extraction, and the entirety of the TDF coding was completed by a single author to expedite the review process. Future research should consider a formal systematic review that includes patient-to-provider messaging from other article types to provide more comprehensive and generalizable findings.\n\nMost of the included reviews were assessed as having low confidence (Additional file 3). Specifically, many reviews lacked an a priori study protocol, and a quality assessment of included studies. Another important limitation for this work is the lack of demographic reporting within the included reviews. Only four of the twelve included reviews summarized demographic information beyond the patient condition being treated, and none provided information on participant race, ethnicity, culture, or socio-economic status. Such important factors are likely to influence barriers and facilitators for implementing and engaging with patient-to-provider virtual messaging and limit generalizability of these results. Future research should prioritize collecting and reporting on demographic information to identify any differences in barriers and facilitators of patient-to-provider virtual messaging experienced by different populations so that potential differences in the perception of barriers and facilitators of patientto-provider virtual messaging can be identified and addressed.
