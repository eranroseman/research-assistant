  "title": "Together Care: Transforming Perioperative Care for Patients Undergoing Benign and Oncologic Gynecologic Surgery",
  "abstract": "Automated texting platforms offer the promise of interacting with patients in real time and reducing the burden on clinical teams to triage concerns. The population of patients with gynecologic cancer is characterized by high symptom burden and consequent high utilization of the ED while navigating treatment, especially in the perioperative setting. Similarly, high ED utilization has been noted among benign gynecologic patients undergoing surgery. A text-based program that triages patient concerns and promptly engages clinical teams for acute concerns could have particularly high utility in these patient populations, but as of 2021 had not been validated. In 2021, Penn Medicine began developing a novel text-based remote monitoring program called Together Care within the Division of Gynecologic Oncology with the aim of reducing unplanned patient encounters, including patient contacts, ED visits, and readmissions. This program initially used a fake backend texting platform that was iterated across multiple mini-pilots and transitioned to a fully automated texting algorithm that was scaled to other divisions within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The authors share both their utilization of innovation methodology and their key takeaways from developing this automated platform.",

The program then interprets the patient's text message and triages the response accordingly, whether alerting a care team member to call the patient, providing relevant educational materials, or, if no symptoms are reported, providing the timeline for the next checkin via text. This program's main aim was to decrease unplanned patient encounters, including patient contacts, ED visits, and readmissions within 30 days of discharge. We sought to create a platform that would reduce demand on clinical personnel, without compromising access to care or patient satisfaction. Finally, we aimed to demonstrate the acceptability and efficiency of such a platform across an expanded spectrum of postsurgical clinical care."

The fake backend technique involves humans mimicking processes for testing purposes, prior to deploying an automated solution. We enrolled 56 patients from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine (PCAM) gynecologic oncology service at the time of their preoperative appointment. At enrollment, patients were told the texting platform would supplement their care experience and not replace direct interaction with the care team. Patients were encouraged to contact their care team via phone and patient portal messages as normal but also to engage with the text messages. Notably, 13 additional patients were approached but declined to participate. Five patients cited a preference for phone calls as their reason for declination, three verbalized technology concerns, and one stated that she was concerned her recovery would prohibit texting. The reason for declination was not documented for the remaining four patients.\n\nDuring this phase, a member of the care team manually texted patients on the second day after their discharge with a postoperative texting script based on a standardized nursing assessment. Our team monitored responses and escalated concerning symptoms to the clinician as defined by the texting algorithm. We wanted to learn whether such a platform was appealing and if our algorithm appropriately captured common symptoms. Using Net Promoter Score and narrative patient feedback from 17 participants, we determined this short message service platform was acceptable to patients and adjusted our algorithm."

Unlike other pilot sites, Dickens did not have sufficient staff to consistently follow up with patients in the immediate postoperative period by phone. Given this, patients' first standardized follow-up with any clinician was at their postoperative visit, unless the patient initiated contact prior to their visit.\n\nIn Pilot 4, all 178 patients scheduled for surgery at Dickens were enrolled in the platform in an opt-out approach, thus decreasing selection bias. The 29 patients who did opt out were escalated to the clinical team immediately as needing clinician-based postoperative outreach, and the other 149 patients received the standardized texting check-ins. A member of our team monitored texting conversations daily to ensure accuracy and timely responses to escalations but did not directly text with patients. The number of active patients to monitor ranged from two to five per day.

We emphasized that program implementation would enable clinical team members to function at their highest scope of practice by focusing efforts on higher-acuity patients rather than completing repetitive, routine counseling for lower-acuity patients. Furthermore, we used data to show patient satisfaction to overcome concerns that automated, remote monitoring would not provide a high-quality experience. We did receive some patient comments pointing out the need for more precision in the automated message; for example, patients were invited to share an incision photo, even if their procedure did not include an incision (Appendix). Given this, as the algorithm cannot be personalized, algorithm wording was adjusted to be very clear that patients without incisions could ignore the photo request.\n\nAdditionally, some practices have since turned off this portion of the program for all patients. Finally, we reinforced that team members should still reach out to patients, as direct patient contact is a valuable source of meaning and fulfillment; we did not, however, capture information to identify which team members may have utilized both techniques at any point during the pilots.\n\n\" In subsequent pilots, we observed that 30 days postdischarge unplanned encounters -including phone calls, portal messages, and urgently needed outpatient visits -trended in a favorable direction.\""

In early pilots, we were most interested in learning about patient acceptability and utility (check-in response rates and Net Promoter Score). As we iterated to scale, we focused on measuring the program's impact on clinical outcomes and reducing clinician burden (ED visits, hospital readmissions, and unplanned calls and messages to the clinician teams). Our only missed triage opportunity was in Pilot 1 when a patient presented to the ED prior to initiating postoperative check-ins. There were no other mis-triages in which patient care was compromised. Alternatively, patients did learn that sending a call request in the program would prompt care team outreach faster than the baseline institutional phone tree.\n\nComparisons with pre-implementation Dickens baselines have been evaluated, showing a reduction in the percentage of both 30-day ED visits and 30-day hospital admissions for the Together Care cohort (Figure  4 ).\n\nTable 1.

All rights reserved.\n\nOnce the Together Care was fully scaled in May 2023 (Pilot 4), our team tracked ED visits and readmissions only, given the promising data from earlier pilots regarding impact on patient communication (phone and portal messages) and outpatient visits (in person and via telehealth). We believe the traditional phone call-based model meant more human hours worked. In 2021, the Division of Gynecologic Oncology, within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, performed about 1,600 surgeries and routinely each patient received a postoperative phone call, lasting about 15 minutes each. We estimated this meant 400 hours of routine postoperative calls alone. In the discovery phase, Together Care saved the nursing team 18 patient phone calls, translating to an estimated 4.5 hours saved. In subsequent pilots, we observed that 30 days postdischarge unplanned encounters -including phone calls, portal messages, and urgently needed outpatient visitstrended in a favorable direction (Table  2 ). We believe this translated into decreased burden for our care team members. In later pilots, we tried to implement a process for routine documentation of the length of phone calls performed by our care team, or full-time equivalents that could be saved by implementation of Together Care, but doing so was technically difficult. We believe the Together Care program did not significantly increase workload for providers, as ED visits and admissions were reduced. The team members most impacted were nursing team members who do routine perioperative education in addition to serving as the front line for phoneand portal-based triages. They thus benefited from the streamlining of counseling for loweracuity patients afforded by the program, which meant more time could be spent with high-acuity patients, also with presumably faster response times for patient inquiries.\n\nAs for increase in outpatient or telehealth visits, we looked at a baseline during the discovery phase in 2021 of 10 patients and there were three unplanned office visits (three in-person, zero telehealth). In Pilot 3, across the 64 patients, there were two unplanned visits (both in person).\n\nOverall, there was an increase in telehealth use during Pilot 3 as the department transitioned ED Visits and Readmissions at the Helen O. Dickens Center for Women's Health: A Comparison of Baseline with Together Care This figure focuses on Pilot 4, at the Helen O. Dickens Center for Women's Health, a high-volume university-based resident-training obstetrics and gynecology clinic. The study took place from May 6, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Notably, the Together Care pilot results for 30-day ED visits and 30-day hospitalizations were lower than the baseline data."

As part of the accelerator grant, our team received technical support to build our texting program from the Penn Medicine-owned Way to Health (W2H) texting platform at no cost to our team. Furthermore, CHTI provided additional full-time innovation specialist support during the pilot phases. Ongoing technical maintenance costs are supported by Penn Medicine's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. There are no additional costs aside from the time of our clinical and nonclinical team members to maintain the program. Together Care is now an ongoing program that is part of routine perioperative care within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Penn Medicine with departmental funding.\n\nFor other teams interested in implementing a similar program, we suggest beginning with a discovery process to understand: (1) current workflows for perioperative patient communication, (2) historical ED utilization and hospital readmissions, and (3) current patient and clinical team experience. Our team began by assembling a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and nonclinicians who could articulate each step of the patient's surgical journey. We then created a vision for a streamlined patient journey and sought direct feedback from patients about how they would like to engage with their team. We continuously iterated and remained open to feedback until we optimized the patient and clinician experience. Finally, our team partnered with W2H to bring the intervention into clinical practice by integrating it with the electronic health records. We held group and one-on-one training sessions with clinic managers and clinicians using the platform to manage patients. We continue to train team members as the platform scales to additional practices."

A Net Promoter Score above 50 is considered excellent. The score was based on responses from 17 out of 41 patients in the discovery phase, 18 out of 26 patients in Pilot 2, 30 out of 64 patients in Pilot 3, and 74 out of 149 patients in Pilot 4."
