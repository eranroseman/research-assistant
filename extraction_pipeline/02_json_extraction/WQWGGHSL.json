  "title": "A series of randomized trials of behavioral economic interventions to increase racial and ethnic diversity of research participants: Rationale and design of ITERATE",
  "abstract": "Rationale Prospective clinical research studies are essential for determining the effectiveness and safety of drugs, medical devices, and healthcare delivery interventions. However, low enrollment, particularly among Black and Hispanic patients, challenges the generalizability of results and fairness of research. Leveraging insights from behavioral economics to modify the content of messages recruiting patients to join research studies may increase enrollment and representativeness of trial populations. Primary hypothesis Method of outreach, source of outreach, message framing, and financial incentives will have important effects on enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic patients electronically approached for participation in a prospective clinical research study. Design ITERATE (NCT05827718) is a series of 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to rigorously, systematically, and iteratively test the effects of different messaging strategies informed by behavioral economic theory on the enrollment of Black and Hispanic individuals into the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), a prospective registry. For all 4 RCTs, we will identify patients eligible for enrollment in the PMBB (those with \u2265 1 encounter with the University of Pennsylvania Health System in the past 3 months, a phone number able to receive text messages or a valid email address on file, no history of consenting to or declining enrollment in the PMBB, and able to provide their own consent) and randomly assign them to receive different outreach messages. RCT 1 will test the method of outreach (email vs. text message vs. email + text message); RCT 2, source of outreach (research team vs. clinical team); RCT 3, message framing (appeal to altruism vs. appeal to social proof vs. control); and RCT 4, financial incentive (none vs. medium guarantee vs. small guarantee + small lottery vs. medium lottery vs. large lottery). In each RCT, at least 50% of the participants will be Black or Hispanic. The primary outcome of each RCT is enrollment fraction, defined as the number of participants who enroll in the PMBB divided by the total number of participants who received an outreach message, compared between arms among both Black and Hispanic patients. Secondary outcomes will include overall enrollment fraction and enrollment fraction among White patients. The \"winning\" strategies in earlier RCTs will be incorporated as the \"standard of care\" in the subsequent RCTs.",

      "text": "Prospective clinical research studies, including randomized clinical trials (RCTs), are essential for determining the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of drugs, medical devices, and healthcare delivery interventions.  1  However, Black and Hispanic patients, who are disproportionately impacted by and more likely to have uncontrolled risk factors for cardiovascular disease, are notably underrepresented in prospective cardiovascular clinical research, including RCTs.  [2] [3] 3] [4] [5] [6]  Despite funding mandates and regulatory authorities' drive to increase enrollment of Black and Hispanic patients into RCTs, a review of 143 cardiovascular clinical trials between 2008 and 2017 showed an average enrollment of 2.1% for Black patients and 2.1% for Hispanic patients.  7 Increasing representativeness of Black and Hispanic patients into prospective cardiovascular clinical research studies is important to improve external validity, increase trust in the medical establishment among groups historically underrepresented in clinical research, and equitably distribute the benefits of clinical research participation.  8 ehavioral economics is a scientific field of inquiry that incorporates principles from economics and psychology to better describe how individuals behave and to influence their behavior.  9 Central to behavioral economic theory is the recognition that individuals demonstrate \"bounded rationality,\" wherein decision-making is limited by incomplete information, thinking capacity, and/or time. Rather than thinking through the full implications of each decision, individuals use cognitive shortcuts, or heuristics, when making decisions.  10 Many of these cognitive shortcuts consider the context of the decision, rather than the content. For instance, rather than trying to assess the myriad risks and benefits of participating in a research study, individuals may decide not to participate because the invitation is not from someone whose name they recognize and trust or a perception that people like themselves do not participate. Knowledge of common heuristics can be leveraged to influence choices by modifying the context in which decisions are made, such as by changing how choices are framed, and marketing studies have shown the effectiveness of such strategies in increasing response to outreach.  11 In the context of behavioral economic research, these small changes to how choices are framed are referred to as \"nudges.\"\n\nFor many clinical research studies that recruit participants through direct outreach, the vast majority of participants do not respond to email or text messagebased contact from researchers, and strategies that increase initial responsiveness to outreach could meaningfully increase enrollment rates.  12 , 13 Challenging social circumstances can be thought of as a \"tax\" on individuals' cognitive bandwidth, meaning that those in low socioeconomic status-who, in the U.S., are often disproportionately affected by systemic factors such as racial inequality-are more likely to rely on heuristics when making decisions.  14 Black patients are less likely to respond to unsolicited email invitations to participate in clinical research.  12 Thus, outreach messaging strategies informed by behavioral economics have the potential to both increase the overall enrollment fraction and the racial and ethnic diversity of clinical research studies.  15 owever, as with any intervention delivered in the context of a complex sociocultural milieu, the effectiveness of these strategies can only be determined through rigorous RCTs.  16 , 17 ncreasing Trial Equity and Representativeness by Rapid Cycle Testing of Nudges (ITERATE) consists of a series of RCTs to rigorously, systematically, and iteratively test the effectiveness of strategies informed by behavioral economic theory to increase the enrollment fraction-the proportion of individuals who enroll in a study divided by all those contacted with an offer of enrollment-of Black and Hispanic individuals in the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB). In each RCT, participants will be contacted with an offer to enroll in the PMBB; they will be randomized to receive 1 message or another, and the \"winning\" message will be the one that results in the highest enrollment fraction among Black and Hispanic participants. The winning strategy from each RCT will inform the \"standard of care\" for the next RCT in the series. The 4 RCTs will test method of outreach (email vs. text message vs. email + text message), source of outreach (research team vs. clinical team), message framing (appeal to altruism vs. appeal to social proof vs. control), and incentive structure (none vs. medium guarantee vs. small guarantee + small lottery vs. medium lottery vs. large lottery). Though these outreach strategies will be tested in the context of enrollment into a prospective clinical registry, which has the advantage of having many eligible patients, the results will have relevance for any prospective research study that involves direct-to-patient outreach, as they will help determine the best strategy for overcoming individuals' initial reluctance to engage with unsolicited outreach."

      "title": "Study population",
      "text": "ITERATE collaborated with the PMBB and utilized existing recruitment methods to embed the research project within the PMBB. The PMBB recruits from all Penn Medicine affiliated hospitals and clinics, and, to date, has recruited more than 260,000 patients.  18 At the start of the study period, the PMBB recruited patients by including the consent form in a series of preappointment forms filled out by clinic patients on the online MyPen-nMedicine patient portal. Between the time that RCTs 2 and 3 were conducted, the PMBB changed its outreach strategy such that patients had to affirmatively choose to see the consent form.\n\nFor RCTs 1 and 2 (method of outreach and source of outreach), to avoid conflicting with existing PMBB outreach, the study population only included patients who did not have an activated patient portal account. However, due to the change in PMBB outreach processes and declining numbers of patients without activated patient portal accounts, RCTs 3 and 4 (message framing and incentive structure) included all patients, regardless of their patient portal account status. To ensure that participants were not concur rently recr uited through the PMBB processes and ITERATE study processes, RCTs 3 and 4 excluded patients who had a Penn Medicine appointment within the prior 2 days and those scheduled for an appointment in the upcoming ten days.\n\nIn addition, to be eligible for ITERATE, patients had to be eligible for the PMBB, meaning they had at least 1 encounter with the University of Pennsylvania Health System in the prior 3 months, had a phone number able to receive text messages or a valid email address on file in the electronic health record, had never consented to or declined enrollment in the PMBB, and were able to provide their own consent (e.g. \u2265 18 years old, no documented dementia or psychiatric illness, etc.). Each RCT had a unique patient cohort, such that participants outreached for RCT 1 were ineligible for RCTs 2-4. Eligible patients were identified by the PMBB using an electronic health records algorithm that considered the inclusion and exclusion cr iter ia. Impor tantly, because the enrollment RCTs focused on direct-to-patient recruitment with self-guided consent, we excluded patients who did not have a mobile phone number or email address on file, and our findings will not help determine best practices for engaging these patients in clinical research. However, 95% of U.S. adults use the internet and 90% have smartphones, including 84% of Black adults, 91% of Hispanic adults, and 79% of those with annual income < $30,000.  19 ince the study's primary outcome is the enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic participants, to optimize power we enriched each RCT such that the proportion of outreached Black and Hispanic participants was at least 50%. We also included participants who were not Black or Hispanic to better understand potential effects of the tested outreach strategies on representativeness.  20 ace and ethnicity information for prospective participants was obtained from their electronic health record, which included both self-reported and clinician-defined data.  21 udy procedures ITERATE utilized a \"fail fast and learn quickly\" approach to conduct a series of 4 iterative recruitment RCTs that applied a rapid-cycle innovation strategy.  22 At the conclusion of each RCT, the arm with the highest enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic patients was identified as the \"winning\" strategy and informed the \"standard of care\" in the subsequent RCTs. ( Figure  1  ). Trials were conducted in series for 4 major reasons: First, this enabled us to isolate the effect of each change to \"standard of care\" without having to account for potential interactions with other changes. Second, it enabled us to carry the \"winner\" forward to the next trial, increasing representative enrollment in the Biobank, a key operational goal of the study. Third, conducting the RCTs in parallel would have required us to have 90 separate arms to test all possible combinations (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 90), rather than the 13 arms that the RCTs ultimately had. Finally, conducting the RCTs in series enabled operational flexibility and adaptability.\n\nAfter eligible patients were identified by the PMBB, their information was uploaded to Way to Health, an online platform used to automate outreach, survey delivery, and data collection. Within Way to Health, uploaded participants were randomized to 1 arm of the given RCT and sent an initial outreach message with a survey link. Randomization was stratified based on race (Black vs. non-Black) and ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic) to ensure demographic characteristics were equal across all arms of each RCT.\n\nOnce participants clicked on the survey link, they were taken to a landing page on the Way to Health platform where they were asked to authenticate their identity by providing their year of birth and confirming that the first name shown matched their own. After successful authentication, patients were provided the PMBB consent form and given the option to (1) consent to participate, (2) decline participation, or (3) defer to participate until a later date. In RCT 1, authentication was conducted in real time by the Way to Health platform, and participants were sent a second link (after a several minute delay) to consent to the PMBB following a successful authentication. Because most patients who successfully authenticated did not ultimately complete the consent form, authentication was conducted after consent in subsequent RCTs, such that patients proceeded immediately from authentication to the PMBB consent form and were later notified if their PMBB consent was successful or failed due to incorrect authentication. Randomized participants received a message from Way to Health 3 times (Day 1, Day 3, and Day 8) or until the consent survey was completed, whichever occurred first. component of an invitation to participate in a clinical research study -method of outreach, source of outreach, framing of message, and incentive structure -and each column represents an RCT in which the nature of 1 component is randomized to 1 of 2 or more options. The RCTs were conducted sequentially, with the results of each previous RCT informing the \"standard of care\" for the subsequent RCTs. In RCT 1, participants were randomized to be contacted via email, text message, or email + text message, but all other components of the invitation to participate reflected the current standard of care. In RCT 2, the dominant method of outreach from RCT 1 was incorporated into a new standard of care, which otherwise remained unchanged except participants were randomized to receive an invitation from their research team or their clinic department. This continued through 4 separate RCTs, sequentially testing all components of the invitation to participate.\n\nRCT 1, Method of Outreach: This RCT examined how method of outreach impacted the enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic patients. In this recruitment RCT, 8,038 participants were randomized to 1 of 3 arms (email, text message, email + text) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Eligible participants were contacted via the cell phone and/or email information available within their electronic health record (EHR). However, since some participants were randomized to a study arm for which no information is available in their EHR, these participants did not receive any outreach messages. We allowed participants to be randomized to infeasible arms to better understand the population-level effect of method of outreach on enrollment. For example, it might be that more people respond to text messages, but fewer people have cell phone numbers on file, so text message-based recruitment could be worse than email-based recruitment, even if enrollment fraction is higher for text message-based recruitment among people able to be contacted by text message. The \"winning\" strategy of this arm was used in RCTs 2-4 as the method of outreach through which eligible patients were contacted.\n\nRCT 2, Source of Contact: This RCT examined how source of outreach affected the enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic patients. Participants were randomized to receive a message from the research team vs the name of a clinic where they have had an appointment dur ing the pr ior 3 months. The remainder of the outreach message was identical. This RCT was supported by research suggesting that Black and Hispanic individuals have lower levels of trust in clinical research than White individuals, but similar levels of trust in their personal physicians, as well as behavioral economic theory indicating the importance of authority figures in influencing decision-making.  23 , 24 In this RCT, 4,276 patients were randomized to 1 of 2 arms, research team or clinical team, in a 1:1 ratio. The \"winning\" strategy in this arm was utilized as the \"standard of care\" for the outreach messages in RCTs 3 and 4.\n\nRCT 3, Framing: This RCT compared whether appealing to altruism, appealing to social proof (\"Are people like me using this product or service?\"), or neither, increased the enrollment fraction of Black and/or Hispanic patients.  11 While RCTs 1 and 2 enrolled at least 50% of patients who were Black and Hispanic, RCT 3 only recruited patients who were Black or Hispanic In this RCT, 3,207 patients were randomized to 1 of 3 arms (appeal to altruism vs. appeal to social proof vs. control) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants who were randomized to the appeal to altruism or appeal to social proof arm received additional sentences in their outreach message specific to the framing strategy. Those randomized to the control arm only received the message from the \"winning\" strategy of RCT 2. For those randomized to appeal to altruism, the sentences, \"Clinical research studies, which help develop new and better ways to treat diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses, often do not include underrepresented communities. This means researchers have less information on how diseases might affect these groups or how new treatments can improve their health. Your participation in the Penn Medicine BioBank can help researchers better understand how to treat members of your community in the future.\" were added to their outreach. For those randomized to appeal to social proof, the sentence, \"The Penn Medicine BioBank helps our team at Penn develop new and better ways to treat diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses, but we can't do it without the participation of thousands of people like you.\" was added to their outreach. The rationale for this RCT was supported by the fact that participants in clinical trials cite altruism as their primary motivator for participating.  [24] [25] 5] [26]  If either appeal to altruism or appeal to social proof increased the enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic individuals compared with the control, the message would be incorporated into all messages in RCT 4.\n\nRCT 4, Incentive Structure: The final RCT determined the best incentive structure to encourage enrollment. In this RCT, 10,689 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 5 arms: no incentive control, a $25 guarantee, a $15 guarantee + a 5% chance at winning $200, a 5% chance at winning $500, or a 1% chance at winning $2500. For each of the arms, aside from the control arm, the expected value was $25. In each of the arms, participants' initial outreach messaging explicitly informed them of the incentive (including dollar amount and chance of winning) they would be awarded if they consent to join the PMBB. Though RCTs frequently provide participants with incentives, little work has been done directly comparing the effectiveness of different incentive designs on participation. Research highlighting over-estimation of small probabilities near zero suggests lottery-based incentives may be more effective, but the relative importance of incentive size and likelihood of winning are unknown.

      "text": "The primary endpoint for all enrollment RCTs is enrollment fraction, defined as the number of participants who consent to the PMBB divided by the total number of participants we attempt to contact, compared between arms within each RCT. Analyses will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle; if outreach to a participant (because the email address or cell phone number on file is invalid, for example), the participant will still be included in the denominator of the enrollment fraction. Across all 4 trials, outreach is estimated to have failed in 2,571 participants, which includes 25% in RCT 1, 8% in RCT 2, 1% in RCT 3, and 2% in RCT 4. This estimate is based off message failure data, bounced email notifications, and participants being randomized to infeasible arms in RCT 1. Enrollment fractions will be calculated for both Black and Hispanic patients, White patients, and the overall study population, and compared between arms using Fisher's Exact tests. For RCTs 1, 3, and 4 (which have more than 2 arms), if the overall tests suggest any differences in enrollment fraction by arm, subsequent pairwise tests will be performed, adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Bonferroni method. As a sensitivity analysis, we will conduct an \"as-treated\" analysis, excluding participants with failed outreach from the denominator.\n\nTo assess the community-level socioeconomic status (SES) of participants, we will use geolocation to associate participants' addresses with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI).  30 We will describe the proportion of individuals in the bottom quartile and bottom half of the (SES) distribution who enroll and do not enroll in the PMBB as a proportion of all those contacted. In each RCT, we will test for heterogeneity of treatment effect by using logistic regression to evaluate for interactions between study arm, enrollment fraction, and race/ethnicity, communitylevel SES, insurance status (a surrogate for individuallevel SES), and age."

      "text": "Historically, approximately 50% of people consent for the PMBB when approached for participation in person or via a consent form included in their preappointment patient portal questionnaire. As RCT 1 targeted patients without active patient portal accounts, who may be less engaged with clinical care and therefore less likely to participate in clinical research, we estimated that the enrollment fraction would be 10% in the email contact arm. There are no data on the minimum clinically important difference in enrollment fraction in clinical research studies, so we arbitrarily powered our trial to detect a 50% relative increase in enrollment fraction in one of the arms (from 10 to 15%) among Black and Hispanic patients, which required 1,338 Black and/or Hispanic patients per arm (4,014 total) for 90% power with alpha = 0.017 to account for multiple comparisons in a 3-arm RCT. Because Black and/or Hispanic participants comprised 50% of the study population in RCT 1, the overall number of patients contacted was 8,038.\n\nAfter blinded analysis of RCT 1, enrollment fraction was < 1% in all arms, but approximately 4% of patients who were contacted attempted to authenticate. Because we changed the authentication strategy for subsequent RCTs such that authentication and consent would occur at the same time, we assumed a 3.5% enrollment fraction in the control arm of RCT 2. Calculating sample sizes required to achieve adequate power with enrollment fractions of 3.5% demonstrated that conducting subsequent RCTs would be infeasible with continued adjustment for multiple comparisons. We therefore decided to set alpha = 0.05 for all subsequent RCTs and determined that 1,069 Black and/or Hispanic patients per arm would provide 80% power to detect a 75% relative increase\n\nTable 1."

      "text": "ITERATE is a series of RCTs that evaluate the effectiveness of messaging strategies informed by behavioral economic theory to meaningfully increase the enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic patients into prospective clinical research studies. The trial results will help develop best practices to increase the enrollment of Black and Hispanic patients into cardiovascular research studies, including RCTs.\n\nThe rise of direct-to-patient research studies and digital communication modalities has greatly increased investigators' options for inviting patients to participate in clinical research. Though many RCTs and cohort stud-ies have used novel strategies for recruitment and enrollment, few have rigorously evaluated the effect of these strategies on overall enrollment or representativeness. Investigators have reported var ious compar isons of the relative efficacy of contacting patients in clinic, via direct mail, via patient portal, and through targeted advertisements on Facebook.  [31] [32] 2] [33]  Together, these studies suggest that the use of electronic methods is associated with a greater number of patients contacted and consented, though the enrolled population of patients may be less diverse.  12 However, these studies did not randomly assign patients to a method of outreach or message framing, and the causal effect of method of outreach on enrollment patterns or diversity cannot be reliably ascertained given an array of confounding factors. There are vanishingly few RCTs of clinical research recruitment methods and best practices are unclear.  34 , 35 ITERATE fills this gap, rigorously developing best practices surrounding the mode of outreach, source of outreach, message framing, and incentive structure, that can be used by researchers seeking to conduct clinical research involving direct-to-patient outreach. Though the enrollment fraction with electronic outreach is low, outreach via these channels is inexpensive, highly scalable, and is not limited by personnel. As such, these strategies could be an effective complement to in-person or telephone-based recruitment for clinical research studies, and small differences in the messages' effectiveness could have large effects when scaled across thousands of potential participants."

      "text": "Figure1. Design of ITERATE. ITERATE consists of a series of 4 randomized clinical trials to rigorously, systematically, and iteratively test strategies designed to increase enrollment of Black and Hispanic individuals without diminishing trust. Each row represents 1 component of an invitation to participate in a clinical research study -method of outreach, source of outreach, framing of message, and incentive structure -and each column represents an RCT in which the nature of 1 component is randomized to 1 of 2 or more options. The RCTs were conducted sequentially, with the results of each previous RCT informing the \"standard of care\" for the subsequent RCTs. In RCT 1, participants were randomized to be contacted via email, text message, or email + text message, but all other components of the invitation to participate reflected the current standard of care. In RCT 2, the dominant method of outreach from RCT 1 was incorporated into a new standard of care, which otherwise remained unchanged except participants were randomized to receive an invitation from their research team or their clinic department. This continued through 4 separate RCTs, sequentially testing all components of the invitation to participate."
