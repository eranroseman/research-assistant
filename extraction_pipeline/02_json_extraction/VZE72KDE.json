  "title": "Effect of Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia on Health, Psychological Well-being, and Sleep-Related Quality of Life A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) is a scalable and effective intervention for treating insomnia. Most people with insomnia, however, seek help because of the daytime consequences of poor sleep, which adversely affects quality of life. OBJECTIVES To investigate the effect of dCBT for insomnia on functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life and to determine whether a reduction in insomnia symptoms was a mediating factor. \n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This online, 2-arm, parallel-group randomized trial comparing dCBT for insomnia with sleep hygiene education (SHE) evaluated 1711 participants with self-reported symptoms of insomnia. Participants were recruited between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2016, and dCBT was delivered using web and/or mobile channels plus treatment as usual; SHE comprised a website and a downloadable booklet plus treatment as usual. Online assessments took place at 0 (baseline), 4 (midtreatment), 8 (posttreatment), and 24 (follow-up) weeks. Programs were completed within 12 weeks after inclusion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were scores on self-reported measures of functional health (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System: Global Health Scale; range, 10-50; higher scores indicate better health); psychological well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; range, 14-70; higher scores indicate greater well-being); and sleep-related quality of life (Glasgow Sleep Impact Index; range, 1-100; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Secondary outcomes comprised mood, fatigue, sleepiness, cognitive failures, work productivity, and relationship satisfaction. Insomnia was assessed with the Sleep Condition Indicator (range: 0-32; higher scores indicate better sleep). \n RESULTS Of the 1711 participants included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 1329 (77.7%) were female, mean (SD) age was 48.0 (13.8) years, and 1558 (91.1%) were white. Use of dCBT was associated with a small improvement in functional health compared with SHE (adjusted difference [95% CI] at week 4, 0.90 [0.40-1.40]; week 8, 1.76 [1.24-2.28]; week 24, 1.76 [1.22-2.30]) and psychological well-being (adjusted difference [95% CI] at week 4, 1.04 [0.28-1.80]; week 8, 2. 68 [1.89-3.47]; week 24, 2.95 [2.13-3.76]), and with a large improvement in sleep-related quality of life (at week 4, -8.76 [-11.83 to -5.69]; week 8,  -17.60 [-20.81 to -14.39]; week 24, -18.72 [-22.04 to -15.41]) (all P < .01). A large improvement in insomnia mediated these outcomes (range mediated, 45.5%-84.0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of dCBT is effective in improving functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life in people reporting insomnia symptoms. A reduction in insomnia symptoms mediates these improvements. These results confirm that dCBT improves both daytime and nighttime aspects of insomnia, strengthening existing recommendations of CBT as the treatment of choice for insomnia.",

      "text": "nsomnia disorder, comprising reports of poor sleep with associated daytime effects occurring 3 or more nights per week for 3 or more months,  1  presents in 10% to 12% of adults.  [2] [3] 3] [4]  In addition, insomnia is associated with mental health disorders,  5  cardiovascular disease,  6  and type 2 diabetes.  7, 8 Increased fatigue, impaired work productivity, reduced quality of life, and relationship dissatisfaction are also common in those with insomnia.  [9] [10] 0] [11]  Such impaired functioning is an important driver for help-seeking behavior.  12 he recommended intervention for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),  [13] [14] [15] [16]  a psychological treatment designed to break patterns of maladaptive thinking and behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapy comprises a behavioral component (stimulus control, sleep restriction, and relaxation) combined with a cognitive (managing sleep-related worries, racing mind, and intrusive thoughts) and an educational (sleep hygiene) component. Meta-analyses indicate that CBT has moderate to large and durable effects on sleep quality, sleep efficiency, sleep-onset latency, and wake time after sleep onset.  [17] [18] 8] [19]  Moreover, recent meta-analyses indicate that digital CBT (dCBT), delivered using automated web platforms or a mobile app,  20  is also efficacious.  21, 22 The effects of CBT and dCBT on the nighttime symptoms of insomnia, therefore, appear robust. However, daytime symptoms are a core part of insomnia disorder, integral to its clinical presentation. Improving constructs such as functional health, psychological wellbeing, and quality of life may therefore be crucial to treating insomnia satisfactorily.\n\nWe investigated the attributable effect of a reduction in insomnia symptoms after receiving dCBT for insomnia on 3 key areas of quality of life: functional health status, psychological well-being, and patient-generated, sleep-related quality of life. Although there is evidence that CBT may yield generalized benefits in both the general population and patient groups  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  and some primary data that CBT for insomnia may reduce depressive or anxiety symptoms,  [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]  evidence is mixed,  35, 36  and an adequately powered, definitive trial investigating functional health status, psychological well-being, and a patient-generated assessment of quality of life has not yet been conducted. Moreover, we wanted to conduct a formal test of the mediating effect of improved insomnia symptoms on these outcomes.\n\nOur primary hypotheses were that dCBT for insomnia would improve functional health status and psychological wellbeing and would reduce sleep-related quality-of-life impairment at weeks 4, 8, and 24 (research question [RQ] 1) and that the effect of dCBT on these outcomes at weeks 8 and 24 would be mediated by a reduction in insomnia symptoms measured at weeks 4 and 8, respectively (RQ 2). Our secondary hypotheses were that dCBT would also improve domains of personal functioning (negative mood, fatigue, and relationship dysfunction) and daytime performance (sleepiness, concentration, and productivity) at weeks 4 and 8 (RQ 3), improvements would be maintained at the week 24 follow-up, and the effect of dCBT at weeks 8 and 24 would be mediated by a reduction in insomnia complaints at weeks 4 and 8, respectively (RQ 4)."

To account for 13% attrition, we increased the sample size to 500 per treatment arm. During the trial, we further extended recruitment because the attrition rate was larger than expected. A total of 1718 participants enrolled, and the final sample comprised 1711 participants because 7 participants entered the trial twice. For each of these 7 participants, a single entry contributed to the analyses. When both entries were randomized to the same condition, the response with the most completed data was selected; when entries were randomized to different groups, the first response was selected unless the participant accessed treatment; if treatment was accessed, the response corresponding with the treatment allocation was used. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported earlier and are available in Supplement 1.  38  Briefly, inclusion criteria comprised the following: a positive screening results based on the DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder; a score of 16 or less on the 8-item Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI; scale, 0-4; range: 0-32, with higher scores indicating better sleep); 39 aged 18 years or older; reliable internet access; and ability to read and understand English. We screened for comorbid conditions and medication use at baseline but excluded only those people whose health was expected to necessitate hospital admission or who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months, who currently received psychological treatment for insomnia or were expecting treatment within 6 months, and who reported suicidal thoughts. We did not exclude participants taking medication for sleep problems or for any other physical or mental health problem. Several methods were used to direct people to the online recruitment page. Persons who had completed previous sleep surveys (ie, Great British Sleep Survey 40 ; World Sleep Survey 41 ) were contacted by email, a recruitment button was placed on an insomnia intervention website,  42  advertisements were placed on Facebook and announce-ments on Twitter, and information about the study was presented via broadcast media."

In accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines, all participant flow is reported, including descriptive statistics of recruitment, dropout, and completeness of interventions.\n\nThe main efficacy analysis was based on randomized allocation including all participants with an outcome recorded at the relevant time point. No interim analyses for efficacy or futility were conducted.\n\nEach primary outcome was analyzed using a linear mixedeffects model to account for the repeated measures at 4, 8, and 24 weeks.  65 This method implicitly accounts for missing-at-random outcome data. The baseline outcome measure, treatment assignment, and categorical time point were included as fixed effects, with a random participant-level effect. Adjusted, absolute between-group changes in outcome at each time point were obtained by including an interaction term between time point and treatment assignment in each model. Results are presented with 95% CIs and 2-sided P values. Cohen d standardized effect sizes were estimated by dividing the adjusted between-group difference by the baseline pooled SD of the corresponding outcome. Assumptions of normality were assessed graphically using histograms. The robustness of the assumptions regarding missing outcome data were examined in a series of sensitivity analyses (pattern mixture models, inclusion of baseline characteristics associated with having a missing outcome, and last observation carried forward). Secondary outcomes were analyzed using similar mixedeffects models as the primary outcomes.\n\nA series of linear mixed-effects models were fitted to assess the extent to which the effect of the intervention on each outcome at 8 weeks was mediated by changes in insomnia at 4 weeks. The total effect of the intervention on outcome at 8 weeks was estimated from a model adjusting for baseline SCI but not the baseline outcome. The direct effect of the intervention at 8 weeks was estimated from a model adjusting for baseline SCI and SCI at 4 weeks. The effect of SCI at 4 weeks was also extracted from this model and multiplied by the estimated effect of the intervention on SCI at 4 weeks to obtain the indirect effect. This approach is similar to that described by Baron and Kenny 66 but uses linear mixed-effects models.  67 he percentage mediated, estimated as the indirect effect divided by the total effect, was obtained. The extent of mediation of the outcome effects at 24 weeks by insomnia at 8 weeks was evaluated in the same way."

There were moderate to large effects observed at weeks 4, 8, and 24 for fatigue (FFS). On the WPAI, productivity at work (presenteeism) that was attributed to sleep problems showed a small to moderate improvement after dCBT relative to control. A significant but small effect in terms of reduced absenteeism attributed to poor sleep and increased job satisfaction was observed at week 24. There were no significant effects at any time point on relationship functioning (RAS). Mediation analyses indicated that changes in insomnia symptoms also accounted for significant and size-  able proportions of effects on these secondary outcomes at both week 8 and week 24 (eTable 3 in Supplement 2, RQ 4)."

      "text": "It is well established that CBT is the first-line treatment for people with chronic insomnia  14, [17] [18] [19] 21, 22  and that sleeprelated outcomes, whether on index measures of insomnia or on derivations from sleep diaries, show sustained improvement.  17  Th  findings from this study confirm large effects on insomnia symptoms. However, we primarily addressed whether CBT for insomnia affects functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life. We used dCBT instead of face-to-face CBT to facilitate an adequately powered scientific inquiry of explanatory processes.\n\nOur findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that dCBT improved participants' functional health relative to sleep hygiene education. At 24 weeks, effect sizes were small for functional health and psychological well-being (Cohen d, 0.31 and 0.38) and large for sleep-related quality of life (Cohen d, -1.46). The greater effect on sleep-related quality of life, measured with the GSII, likely occurs because the GSII specifically asks participants to define areas of impairment attributed to poor sleep, whereas functional health and well-being were assessed with global measures (PROMIS-10 and WEMWBS). Improvements in all 3 primary outcomes were mediated by insomnia improvements associated with dCBT. These mediation effects were substantial: 51% mediation of functional health, 47% of well-being, and 46% of sleep-related quality of life at 8 weeks, and 84% of functional health, 75% of wellbeing, and 66% of sleep-related quality of life at 24 weeks' follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study demonstrating a causal relationship between CBT-mediated reduction in insomnia symptoms and perceived health status and quality of life.\n\nA report of a parallel study (Oxford Access for Students Improving Sleep [OASIS]) exploring mental health symptoms as the outcome variable of interest and likewise demonstrated a causal relationship between insomnia improvement and reductions in mental health symptoms.  33 Together, the mediation analyses in these 2 studies (with a total of 5466 participants) provide novel and convincing evidence that insomnia may be a legitimate and important target for mental health and well-being. Consideration of the secondary variables in the present study yields further data on the generalized effects of in-somnia improvement on symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleepiness, and cognitive failures and productivity, with mediation in substantial part through changes in insomnia."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "We are mindful of limitations of this research. Although participant demographic characteristics were typical of clinical populations (eg, typically female, middle-aged) and had some similar characteristics (eg, two-thirds reported diagnosed health comorbidities), participants were not drawn from patient groups or health care services and therefore reflect individuals who experience insomnia in the general population. This difference may reduce the generalizability to the insomnia patient group but increases the generalizability to those experiencing insomnia symptoms in the general population. As is typical of digital programs, and indeed of CBT in general, there was a substantial dropout from treatment (58% of participants completed \u22654 dCBT sessions); however, intentionto-treat analyses still identified significant improvements. Sensitivity and missing data analyses did not change the study conclusions. In addition, the instrument used to measure insomnia symptoms includes items around daytime functioning because these items are part of the DSM-5 insomnia disorder diagnosis; these items may have inflated the mediation effects. Finally, we note that attributed adverse effects were more common in the group receiving dCBT than in the control participants. Despite widespread generalized benefits, dCBT can have adverse effects; we hypothesize that these effects might result from the sleep restriction component that is introduced in week 3. Potentially, these adverse effects were short lived; at weeks 8 and 24, sleepiness, fatigue, cognitive failures, and mood symptoms were more common in participants receiving SHE than in those receiving dCBT."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "The results of this definitive trial suggest that dCBT not only is effective in improving insomnia symptoms but also demonstrates positive effects around the clock by improving the functional health, psychological well-being, and sleeprelated quality of life of people with positive screening results for insomnia disorder. In addition, improved insomnia is a mediator of these benefits. These findings indicate that dCBT improves both daytime and nighttime aspects of insomnia, lending further weight to the clinical guideline recommendation of CBT as the treatment of choice for insomnia."
