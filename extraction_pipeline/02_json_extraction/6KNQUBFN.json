  "abstract": "Objectives We examined the dose-response relationship between physical activity (PA) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in adults in Taiwan. Methods This study included 1 98 919 participants, aged 18-97 years, free of CVD, cancer and diabetes at baseline (1997-2013), who were followed until 2016. At baseline, participants were classified into five PA levels: inactive' (0 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week), 'lower insufficiently active' (0.1-3.75 MET-h/week), 'upper insufficiently active' (3.75-7.49 MET-h/week), 'active' (7.5-14.99 MET-h/week) and 'highly active' (\u226515 MET-h/week]. CVD risk factors were assessed at baseline and at follow-up by physical examination and laboratory tests. Analyses were performed with Cox regression and adjusted for the main confounders. results During a mean follow-up of 6.0\u00b14.5 years (range 0.5-19 years), 20 447 individuals developed obesity, 19 619 hypertension, 21 592 hypercholesterolaemia, 14 164 atherogenic dyslipidaemia, 24 275 metabolic syndrome and 8548 type 2 diabetes. Compared with inactive participants, those in the upper insufficiently active (but not active) category had a lower risk of obesity (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95), atherogenic dyslipidaemia (0.96; 0.90 to 0.99), metabolic syndrome (0.95; 0.92 to 0.99) and type 2 diabetes (0.91; 0.86 to 0.97). Only highly active individuals showed a lower incidence of CVD risk factors than their upper insufficiently active counterparts. Conclusion Compared with being inactive, doing half the recommended amount of PA is associated with a lower incidence of several common biological CVD risk factors. Given these benefits, half the recommended amount of PA is an evidence based target for inactive adults. \n How might it impact on clinical practice in the future? \u25ba Half of the recommended amount of physical activity might be an appropriate physical activity goal for some inactive adults.",

[1] [2] 2] [3]  Based on strong scientific evidence of health benefits,  3 4  many PA guidelines recommend that adults should do at least 150 min per week of moderate intensity PA or 75 min at vigorous intensity (equivalent to 7.5 metabolic equivalent of task hours per week (MET-h/ week)). A lower amount of PA can reduce all cause and cause specific mortality,  5 6  but whether this is enough to reduce the development of major CVD risk factors is unknown. Also, the US Department of Health and Human Services has recently launched a report that summarises the current evidence on PA and health, and will be used to develop the 2018 (second edition) Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.  7 This report also includes a set of research questions that the committee believes are key to build the scientific foundation for the third edition of the PA guidelines in 2028. One of these questions is whether less PA than the usually recommended amount can prevent CVD risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes.  7 t is important to elucidate this issue because it could show that even less than the recommended PA is effective for primordial prevention of CVD (preventing the development of CVD risk factors in the first place); this preventive strategy represents an important shift in the approach to CVD control because the objectives go beyond preventing CVD and deaths to attaining good cardiovascular health.  8 9 In addition, it must be noted that a third or more of adults worldwide do not reach the recommended amount of PA.  10  For some individuals who do little or no PA, meeting the PA guidelines can be an arduous or even unachievable goal. If an initial, specific and lower PA goal could also augment cardiovascular health, it could be useful for some inactive adults.\n\nTherefore, we examined the dose-response relationship between PA and incidence of some major"

Details of the MJ cohort study population and data collection procedures have been reported elsewhere.  11 12 n brief, the MJ cohort has enrolled more than 6 00 000 participants from all over the country since 1994.  11 12 Participants completed a self-administered health and lifestyle questionnaire, underwent a physical examination and provided biological samples for laboratory tests, which conformed to ISO 9001 for quality management. All participants were encouraged to return annually and data have been updated every year during follow-up visits to the MJ Health Management Institution. The study participants were mostly young and middle aged adults, but some of their offspring, parents or relatives in other age strata were also included in the cohort.\n\nFor this analysis, we selected women and men aged \u226518 years with baseline information collected during the period 1997-2016. Exclusion criteria were: (i) history of cancer, CVD or diabetes at baseline, (ii) having only one health screening up to 2016, (iii) incomplete data at baseline on PA and covariates and (iv) lack of information on the health outcome of interest during the second or successive visits. According to these criteria, a total of 1 98 919 participants were included for the diabetes risk analysis, with baseline data from 1997 to 2013. Likewise, for the analyses on the incidence of obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, atherogenic dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome, we also excluded from the non-diabetic sample those with these conditions at baseline, leaving 151 683, 173 445, 179 316, 169 811 and 159 105 individuals for each analysis, respectively. Figure  1  illustrates the flow of participants in the present analysis of the MJ cohort.\n\nStudy participants provided informed written consent, and the study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the MJ Health Management Institution and the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan.  11 12 To prevent research errors caused by the quality of the data, the MJ Health Resource Centre conducted data cleaning (eg, extreme or inaccurate values).  13 Individual identification data were removed so that the database remained anonymous during the entire study process.  14"

Participants were asked to report the intensity, frequency and duration of PA that they did during the past weeks, with several examples of activity types given for four intensity categories: light (eg, slow walking), moderate (eg, brisk walking), medium vigorous (eg, jogging) or high vigorous (eg, running). A metabolic equivalent (MET; 3.5 mL/kg/min) value of 2.5 was assigned for light, 4.5 for moderate, 6.5 for medium vigorous and 8.5 for high vigorous PA intensity.  5 To calculate the total volume of PA (MET-h/week), the MET value for the reported intensity was multiplied by frequency and duration. For participants who indicated activities in more than one intensity category, an average MET value was assigned. The MJ PA questionnaire has been slightly modified over the years and all the data were harmonised before pooling. Study participants were classified into five PA levels: 'inactive' (0 MET-h/week), 'lower insufficiently active' (0.1-3.74 MET-h/week), 'upper insufficiently active' (3.75-7.49 MET-h/ week (equivalent to 0.5-1 times the recommended amount)), 'active' (7.50-14.99 MET-h/week (equivalent to 1-2 times the recommended amount)) and 'highly active' (\u226515 MET-h/week (equivalent to 2+ times the recommended amount). This classification conforms to PA guidelines, with 'active' and 'highly active' participants meeting the recommended amount of PA for substantial and additional health benefits, respectively.  18 t baseline and follow-up visits, physical examinations were performed and overnight fasting blood samples were collected and analysed using standard analytical procedures.  19 Body weight, height and waist circumference were measured; body mass index was calculated, with values \u226525 kg/m 2 being classified as obese according to guidelines for Asian populations.  20 ypertension was identified from the medical history or as systolic/diastolic blood pressure \u2265140/\u226590 mm Hg. Hypercholesterolaemia was identified from the medical history or as serum total cholesterol \u2265240 mg/dL. 21 Atherogenic dyslipidaemia was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria  21  as triglycerides \u2265150 mg/dL and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women. Participants were also classified as having metabolic syndrome if they met \u22653 of the following criteria  21 22  : (i) waist circumference \u226590 cm in men and \u226580 cm in women, (ii) systolic/ diastolic blood pressure \u2265130/\u226585 mm Hg or on medication, (iii) triglycerides \u2265150 mg/dL, (iv) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women and v) fasting glucose \u2265100 mg/dL or on medication. Type 2 diabetes was defined as diagnosed diabetes or fasting blood glucose \u2265126 mg/dL.\n\nParticipants reported their age, sex, educational attainment and marital status. Information on smoking and alcohol consumption based on standard questions was recorded. An optimal meal pattern was defined as an affirmative answer to the following question: \"Do you eat on time and in regular amounts?\". Although the validity of this dietary variable is unknown, its prospective associations with the development of CVD risk factors in this cohort suggest good convergent validity (online supplementary file 2)."

      "text": "Baseline characteristics of the study sample were summarised as mean (SD) for continuous variables and as percentage for categorical variables. Baseline differences across PA levels were examined using analysis of variance for continuous variables and \u03c7 2 tests for categorical variables. Follow-up time was computed as the difference between the date of the baseline health screening and the date of the visit where each CVD risk factor was developed for the first time or the last visit at the end of 2016. Incident rates of CVD risk factors were calculated per 1000 person years.\n\nTo examine the dose-response relationship between PA and the study outcomes, we used restricted cubic spline Cox regressions, with knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, and 0 MET-h/week as the reference category. Total PA (MET-h/week) was truncated at the 99th percentile to minimise the influence of outliers. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was also used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each major CVD risk factor across categories of PA (inactive, lower insufficiently active, upper insufficiently active, active, high active), using the inactive group as the reference. Cox models for each CVD risk factor were adjusted for age (years), sex (men, women), educational attainment (middle school or below, high school, junior school, college or above), marital status (single, married, widowed), smoking (never, former, current), alcohol consumption (never, former, currently), body mass index (kg/m 2 ), meal pattern (suboptimal, optimal) and the baseline value as a continuous variable of the CVD risk factor (eg, both triglycerides and HDL-C for the dyslipidaemia analysis or fasting blood glucose for the type 2 diabetes analysis).\n\nLastly, we evaluated if the main results varied by age and sex because it may have relevance for primordial prevention of CVD and, additionally, by the rest of the adjustment variable subgroups. We tested for interactions in these Cox models with P values corrected for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg method.\n\nThe proportional hazards assumptions were checked by assessing the log-log survival plots. Statistical significance was set at two sided P<0.05. Analyses were performed with STATA V.14.

For example, in two cohort studies with 12 873 adults in Australia, participants who did not meet the recommended amount of PA had a 26% higher risk of obesity than those meeting the PA guidelines.  23 Among 70 102 female nurses in the USA, aged 40-65 years, those in the second quintile (2.1-4.6 MET-h/week (equivalent to 42-76 min/week of moderate intensity PA)) of PA had a 6% lower risk of diabetes compared with those in the first quintile.  24 In a cohort of 37 918 male health professionals in the USA, aged 40-75 years, there was a 10% lower rate of type 2 diabetes when comparing the second (6-13.7 METs-h/week (equivalent to 120-274 min/ week of moderate intensity)) versus the first quintile of PA.  25  In a recent meta-analysis with 16 studies including 76 699 individuals and 13 871 cases of metabolic syndrome, Zhang et al reported an inverse linear association between PA and incident metabolic syndrome, with a 8% risk reduction per 10 MET-h/ week increase (equivalent to 200 min/week of moderate intensity PA).  26  Our work addresses whether a specific amount of PA lower than the recommended reduces the development of some major CVD risk factors in adults.  7 e found no significant associations between PA and incident hypercholesterolaemia. Evidence on this issue is mixed, and some methodological issues, such as the methods used to define this risk factor, should be considered 3 4 ; a post hoc analysis in our sample using the diagnosis in the medical history as outcome (without measured total cholesterol), as widely used in the scientific literature, found that compared with inactive participants, the adjusted HRs (95% CI) for the lower insufficiently active, upper insufficiently active, active and highly active groups were 0.99 (0.91-1.08), 1.00 (0.93-1.09), 0.94 (0.86-1.03) and 0.93 (0.86-1.03), respectively (P for linear trend=0.118)."

Also, adoption of a physically active lifestyle should be safe and progressive, account for baseline fitness level and start by increasing the duration and frequency of PA and subsequently the intensity. Thus some inactive adults could benefit from this initial volume of 3.75 MET-h/week that meet the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time bound) criteria,  29  because it can be easily achieved by doing PA for 15 min, at least 5 days per week, at moderate intensity (eg, brisk walking). In the search for this clinically relevant minimum amount of PA, Wen et al  5  found that doing at least half of the recommended PA was associated with a 14% lower risk of all cause death among 416 175 individuals with baseline data from the MJ cohort. They also observed a 19% and 25% reduction in CVD and ischaemic heart disease deaths, respectively, as well as other benefits in cancer mortality and incidence.  5 In the present study, we extend these findings by showing that this same volume of PA also prevents the development of major CVD risk factors.

Most previous evidence was obtained from self-reported data, which may underestimate the incidence of CVD risk factors, as well as the strength of the associations between PA and risk factors due to non-differential misclassification.\n\nLimitations of our study include that PA was self-reported, which overestimates the amount PA and thus underestimates the true effect of PA on health. Also, we only measured total PA level in a leisure time domain; the dose-response association of PA at different intensities and in other domains (ie, occupational, household and transportation) with CVD risk factors is needed.  5 31 32 nother limitation is that participants may not represent the general population of Taiwan because they had somewhat higher socioeconomic status; however, the prevalence of CVD risk factors and the incidence of CVD and cancer and their mortality in this cohort are comparable with general population rates.  11 12 inally, although we adjusted for several sociodemographic and behavioural potential confounders, information on other potentially important variables (eg, eating behaviours, over the counter medicines, family history of CVD) was not included in the present work from the MJ cohort.\n\nIn summary, if our findings reflect a causal association, then some people who do at least half of the usually recommended amount of PA will lower their risk of CVD disease. This PA level, therefore, might be a useful initial goal for some inactive adults."
