  "title": "Digital health intervention for children with ADHD to improve mental health intervention, patient experiences, and outcomes: a study protocol",
  "abstract": "Background Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent childhood psychiatric condition with profound public health, personal, and family consequences. ADHD requires comprehensive treatment; however, lack of communication and integration across multiple points of care is a substantial barrier to progress. Given the chronic and pervasive challenges associated with ADHD, innovative approaches are crucial. We developed the digital health intervention (DHI)-CoolTaCo [Cool Technology Assisting Co-regulation] to address these critical barriers. CoolTaCo uses Patient-Centered Digital Healthcare Technologies (PC-DHT) to promote co-regulation (child/ parent), capture patient data, support efficient healthcare delivery, enhance patient engagement, and facilitate shared decision-making, thereby improving access to timely and targeted mental health intervention for children at significant risk for poor outcomes. The present paper will describe our planned protocol to evaluate the efficacy of Cool-TaCo via randomized control trial (RCT). \n Methods/design We will recruit 60 children (ages 8-12) with ADHD who will be randomized to either immediate (n = 30) or delayed (n = 30) treatment (i.e., a waitlist control group). Among those randomized to immediate treatment, half will be assigned to DHI (delivered via a smartwatch and smartphone application), the other half to an active control treatment as usual (TAU). Unlike the DHI group, the TAU group will receive the smartwatch with no assigned activities, applications, or interventions on the devices. The intervention period will last 16 weeks; after a participant has been in the delayed treatment group for 16 weeks and has completed the post-waiting period assessment, they will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or active control group. Thus, 30 participants will complete the intervention, and 30 will complete the active control, with half of the total sample completing a waitlist period. Discussion Individuals with ADHD have complex needs. Despite improvement in outcomes following cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) and pharmaceutical treatment, long-term maintenance is a challenge often not addressed by traditional medical approaches, and, as we described, ineffective approaches to information sharing across points",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent and widely recognized psychiatric condition affecting children and adolescents, marked by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity  [1] . Data from the 2016-2019 US National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) (2016-2019) revealed that an estimated 6 million (9.8%) US children aged 3-17 years have been diagnosed with ADHD  [2] . ADHD has a significant impact on academic performance, social relationships, emotional well-being, behavior, and family dynamics and can co-occur with conditions such as mood disorders and learning disabilities  [3, 4] . Therefore, ADHD treatment necessitates long-term maintenance and self-regulation  [5] . ADHD requires comprehensive treatment and typically involves multiple points of care such as primary care clinics (e.g., pediatricians), mental health clinics (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, and other therapists), and homes and schools (e.g., special education services)  [6] . Consistent and effective communication across points of care is essential to help children effectively manage their ADHD. However, such consistent communication is rare  [7] . Despite decades of research on evidencebased medical and behavioral treatments, adherence to treatment is a considerable challenge  [8] .\n\nFurthermore, long-term maintenance is challenging and presents a second significant barrier to progress that is not met by current approaches  [9, 10] . Because ADHD challenges are, for most individuals, persistent and lifelong, substantial self-regulation is needed to support initial treatment gains  [11, 12] . Moreover, as children with ADHD become adolescents, they often receive less frequent treatment and support for their difficulties despite facing increasingly challenging situations in academic (high school or college curriculum)  [13] , social settings (exposure to illicit drugs, alcohol), and interpersonal relationships (e.g., family, romantic, friendship)  [14] . Research has shown that adolescents with persistent ADHD are more likely to engage in serious risk behaviors (e.g., underage drinking, reckless driving, and illegal drug use)  [15, 16] . Self-regulation is a robust predictor of positive outcomes, and late childhood to early adolescence is a critical period for promoting self-regulation to prevent life-altering mistakes rooted in high school years  [17] .\n\nGiven the chronic and pervasive challenges associated with ADHD, innovative approaches for supporting children and adolescents are crucial  [18, 19] . Providing assistance and reinforcement with wearable and mobile technologies offers promising results for children and adolescents  [20] . Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) can promote self-regulation (which includes self-monitoring) of health behaviors and facilitate more timely and accurate information sharing between multiple points of care. DHIs could substantially alter the current paradigm, leading to long-term improvements in ADHD outcomes  [18, 21] . These technologies, however, have traditionally been designed for individual users and without substantial input from children with ADHD and their families  [22, 23] . Our goal is to evaluate an evidence-based and integrated (smartwatch and smartphone) DHI that can increase parent-child support and multidisciplinary communication  [24] . The present paper describes our planned protocol to evaluate the efficacy of the DHI Cool-TacCo [Cool Technology Assisting Co-regulation] via randomized controlled trial (RCT)."

      "text": "With funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we developed and piloted a DHI called CoolCraig, a wearable and connected system combining a smartwatch and a mobile phone application that provides self-and co-regulation strategies to support caregivers and children with ADHD  [8, 18, 21, [25] [26] [27] [28] . Our research showed that CoolCraig could support self-regulation in children and co-regulation processes between parent and child. The results also revealed a need for improved instructional guidance and coordination across the multiple points of care  [29, 30] . Such results informed our goal of expanding the CoolCraig system and developing the DHI, CoolTaCo [Cool Technology Assisting Co-regulation]."

      "text": "The CoolTaCo System will include a smartwatch app for the child and smartphone app for the parent. As a platform to develop the smartwatch and phone application, we will use the Apple digital ecosystem (i.e., Apple Watch and iPhone). In this manner, we leverage existing Apple Watch features to support intervention, collect and report data (e.g., calendar reminders, activity, sleep, and heart rate data collection and reporting), and a parent iPhone application paired with the child's Apple Watch. The application will allow parents to enter goals for children (e.g., goals established in therapy or in collaboration with a child's teacher), approve goals the children initiate for themselves, and create rewards for their child.\n\nDerived from prior ADHD RCTs and implemented in our community programs, CoolTaCo will also include mini-lessons that are created for children and parents on topics such as assertiveness and communication. Key themes of those lessons include ' Assertion, ' 'Ignoring Provocation, ' 'Organization/Executive Function Planning, ' 'Productivity, ' 'Self-Regulation, ' and 'Problem Solving. ' Brief lessons support the key themes with the aim of reducing maladaptive behaviors (aggression, whining/ complaining, avoiding non-preferred tasks, disorganization, losing items) and reinforcing the development of an increase in adaptive behaviors necessary for optimizing academic and social outcomes. Figure  1  depicts an example of a mini-lesson which is part of the unit on the social skill of ' Assertion, ' in which children are prompted to use a self-evaluation strategy when met with a challenge, disappointment, or frustration.\n\nThe CoolTaco System will also deliver parent interventions derived from evidence-based parent ADHD training programs developed and studied in prior ADHD clinical trials and delivered in our community-based parent education programs. Figure  2  depicts an example of a mini-lesson which is part of the main behavioral Fig. 2 Parent mini-lesson example\n\nparent training unit on using communication strategies in efforts to increase the likelihood that a child will follow directions. In this lesson, parents learn that some communication strategies are more effective in specific settings than others and they learn how to identify when and where to choose from a 'toolbox' or variety of different ways of using effective communication as an antecedent for increasing desired behaviors.\n\nThe CoolTaco System allow children and caregivers to build self-regulation by setting goals and monitoring and evaluating progress. CoolTaco will also support selfefficacy by helping children and caregivers to reflect on successes and behaviors that need to change. Goals can be set in multiple domains, customized to the treatment plan. In addition to behavioral goals, goals can address hours of sleep per night, amount of physical activity, and medication regimen compliance. Once goals are set, progress can be tracked both daily and weekly. The use of goal-setting, daily self-monitoring, and updating personal goals will promote self-regulation; in addition, it can provide data to be shared with parents and the child's clinician(s) or educators regarding progress meeting treatment goals. In our clinical practice and research with children with ADHD, common barriers to change include lack of consistency implementing strategies and forgetting to use strategies, both of which are addressed by the system design. CoolTaco will provide an appealing, sustainable intervention that can reinforce positive health behaviors over time."

Among those randomized to immediate treatment, half will be assigned to DHI (an intervention delivered via a smartwatch for the child and smartphone application for the parent), and half will be assigned to an active control [treatment as usual (TAU)] group. Individuals in the TAU group will receive the smartwatch with no assigned activities or applications.

Participants randomized to delayed treatment will wait for 16 weeks; they will complete an assessment before and after the waiting period. After this waiting period, they will be randomly assigned to either DHI or TAU. Thus, 30 participants will complete 16 weeks of DHI, and 30 will be followed for 16 weeks of TAU, with half of the total sample also completing a waitlist period.\n\nWe will loan smartwatches and phones as necessary for the study in both the DHI and the TAU groups.\n\nParticipants will be taught basic cybersecurity and privacy best practices, including how to lock and encrypt phone data."

These may include a pediatrician or family doctor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a counselor, a teacher, or another individual providing care/intervention for the child. We will ask for consent to approach these individuals to ask for their participation in the research; the burden on these individuals will be minimal. We will aim to gather information about the impact of the DHI on informationsharing, decision-making, and collaboration at multiple points of care.

Parents will be asked several questions at each assessment related to treatment, including whether the child is taking medications (with medications and dosage recorded, if applicable), whether the child is receiving psychotherapy (and frequency during the study period), and whether the child is receiving any other services (e.g., school-based occupational, speech, or educational therapies). These factors will be recorded in the database to examine any potential differences in outcomes based on existing treatment services. We will not ask parents to change any treatment protocols at enrollment or postpone any outside treatment services once enrolled.\n\nFailure to meet any of the inclusion criteria will result in exclusion.

This design will create a starting point for future studies of longer-term outcomes that are presently beyond the scope of the proposed study. Completing the study measures will require up to one hour for the child and parent at each assessment. For clinicians and educators, completing the questionnaires will require approximately 20 min at each time point. In addition, at each assessment time point, we will conduct semi-structured interviews (~ 30 min each) with participants focused on issues specific to different points of care and experiences with the DHI. Assessments will take place within a 7-day window at each designated timepoint. We will schedule them at a time convenient to participants and will offer remote/virtual platforms to increase adherence."

Standardized outcome measures (see Table  1 ) will be administered at each assessment timepoint. Quantitative data from outcome measures will be collected to examine both proximal and distal outcomes in a longitudinal repeated measures design. Measures will assess behavioral mechanisms (e.g., self-regulation and self-monitoring), clinical outcomes (e.g., ADHD symptoms), and process outcomes (e.g., patient or provider experience with treatment).\n\nAdditional quantitative data will be gathered from children through smartwatches and parents via the parent smartphone application. This will include usage data and data measuring treatment adherence (e.g., taking medications as prescribed, completing treatment goals and intervention modules) and brief symptom reports (behavioral and emotional). In addition, we will also collect children's sensor data related to physical activity (e.g., bouts of exercise, step counts), sleep, and heart rate."

Such analysis will examine how outcomes within each patient change over time and how individual trajectories of change differ across patients. For each outcome, a mixed-effect model will be estimated with SAS PROC MIXED to test outcome differences between treatment groups at each repeated assessment and differences in the outcome trajectories. Momentary data collected via the scheduled DHI (CoolTaCo) entries will be aggregated to the weekly level, and generalized linear mixed effect models with Poisson distribution for count data will be estimated using SAS PROC GLIMMIX. Tukey adjusted tests will be used for post-hoc comparisons to evaluate significant changes between two time points, treatment groups, or other paired comparisons when a significant interaction was revealed.\n\nPreliminary analyses will be conducted to identify potential individual characteristics (e.g., gender) to be included as covariates. An important strength of multilevel models is the ability to account for unbalanced and/ or missing data (which are common problems in ecological momentary data collection) by not placing restrictions on the number of observations obtained for each individual and allows trajectories across time to be estimated from an individual's available data."

Despite improvement in outcomes following cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) and pharmaceutical treatment, long-term maintenance is a challenge that has not been addressed by traditional medical approaches. Additionally, ineffective information sharing across points of care creates further barriers to progress. Our RCT will create new techniques and add to the latest technological advances, increase communication, and support self-regulation. The CoolTaCo system will contribute and apply to the mental health field while demonstrating the usefulness of DHI for ADHD. Our innovative research will fill a significant gap in translating early treatment investments and gains into long-term, sustainable outcomes. The study's results may provide knowledge that will be valuable for designing DHI in the future. One benefit that may accrue to the child and family is the return of assessment results and education about electronic data. Children needing medical or psychological treatment based on the level of risk assessed will also receive referrals. Further, participating may give the participants an altruistic experience in helping others by contributing to research knowledge. Participants may also develop selfregulatory skills or improve treatment outcomes and treatment experiences. Because the risks to participants are minor, the potential benefits far outweigh the risks in this project.\n\nIn summary, innovative technologies can bridge the gaps leading to many children's poor outcomes. By coupling smartphones with smartwatches, we can offer a sophisticated yet highly available solution to address existing, failing approaches to communication between points of care and long-term maintenance. Our approach will ensure that failures do not squander significant investment in mental health treatment due to lack of reliable information, ineffective communication, delays in the delivery of necessary treatment, and poor self-monitoring/self-regulation. Instead, children and families will get the interventions they need when needed, leading to long-term positive outcomes for individuals and society."
