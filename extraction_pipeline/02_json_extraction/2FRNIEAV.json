  "title": "SMART goals are no more effective for creative performance than do-your-best goals or nonspecific, exploratory 'open goals'",
  "abstract": "SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timed)   are advocated as the gold standard for goal setting. However, goals which are non-specific and exploratory, referred to as 'open goals' , may be preferred in specific circumstances. In this pre-registered experiment, we compared SMART goals, compared to do-your-best (DYB), and open goals on creative performance. We also assessed the equivalence between open and DYB goals. Participants (N = 247, M age = 30.40 years) completed the Alternate Use Task as a proxy for creative performance, before and after a goal setting manipulation in a 3 (between-groups: SMART, DYB, open goals) x 2 (within-groups: pre-and post-intervention) experimental design. There were no meaningful differences in creative performance for SMART, DYB, and open goals, DYB and open goals were not statistically equivalent. These findings cast doubt that SMART goals are always the most adaptive for human behaviour, given that open and DYB goals can be as effectual in some circumstances.",

      "text": "Goals represent the targets or objectives which provide a compass for our thoughts and actions. Scholars have devoted considerable attention to understanding the properties of goals and their effects on human performance and functioning (for reviews, see  Epton et al., 2017; Locke & Latham, 2002; Seijts & Latham, 2005) . One key conclusion from this work is that specific goals are most adaptive for human behaviour  (Locke & Latham, 2019) . One way this general conclusion has been introduced into education and other applied settings has been the widely adopted SMART goal acronym  (Day & Tosey, 2011; Doran, 1981; Latham, 2003) . From the perspective of a SMART framework, goals are typically framed as specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timed in nature. However, scholars have questioned the ubiquitousness of these principles for several reasons, firstly because SMART goals may not align accurately with goal setting theory  (Swann et al., 2023) ; secondly, because SMART goals remain underexamined relative to their application in the field  (Day & Tosey, 2011) ; and thirdly, because goals which are exploratory, non-specific, and open-ended in nature  (Swann et al., 2016 ) may be preferred for certain behaviours or situations  (McEwan et al., 2016) . For example, it has been suggested that when setting goals to improve creativity, open frameworks may be preferable  (Shalley & Koseoglu, 2013) . We aimed to experimentally test the effectiveness of two types of non-specific goals against SMART goals for creative performance. From an educational standpoint, we focus on adults because adult education is increasingly recognised as vital in our rapidly changing world, where continuous skill development and knowledge updating are essential for both personal fulfilment and professional success (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2020)."

      "title": "SMART goals, do-your-best-goals, and open goals",
      "text": "Specific, challenging goals should yield superior outcomes when compared with vague or non-specific goals such as do-your-best (DYB) goals because they precisely characterise the nature of what constitutes success  (Mento et al., 1987; Tubbs, 1986; Wood et al., 1987) . SMART goals represent one of most prominent ways by which practitioners embed specific goal setting into various practical settings, such as education, organisational management, and physical activity interventions  (Day & Tosey, 2011; Locke & Latham, 2015; Swann et al., 2023) . Specificity is central to SMART goal setting, as evidenced by SMART goals requiring individuals to establish clearly defined, measurable, and timed objectives. Having specific and measurable goals can lead to more effective goal striving compared with non-specific goals. For example, in experts, non-specific DYB goals are less effective than specific, challenging goals because they are ambiguous with regard to the required attainment standard  (Locke & Latham, 2002) .\n\nContext, however, is an important consideration for selecting an appropriate goal type. Non-specific, DYB goals can be superior to specific goals under certain conditions  (McEwan et al., 2016; Seijts & Latham, 2005) . DYB goals are superior to specific goals when one is: (i) in the initial stages of learning new knowledge and/or a complex task (as is the case in all educational contexts), (ii) given no strategy to guide effort, and (iii) pressured to perform well immediately  (Locke & Latham, 2013) . Essentially, when people are confronted with a task that is new and/or complex for them, a non-specific goal allows the systematic exploration and discovery of appropriate strategies while reducing one's focus on attainment goals, whereas a specific goal increases the difficulty of finding an appropriate strategy and can increase performance anxiety around trying to achieve the set standard  (Locke & Latham, 2013) . DYB focus goal striving towards performance targets that reflect an imagined limit, such as one's best or perceptions of what is personally achievable. Within educational contexts, DYB goal are often operationalised as personal best goals, where students set self-referenced, growth-focused targets relative to previous best performances to activate adaptive motivational and behavioural processes (e.g. Burns et al., 2021) . Meta-analytic data supports the idea that specific goals may be detrimental in situations where the individual is in the early stages of learning a complex task  (McEwan et al., 2016) . Similarly, recent empirical work comparing non-specific goals with SMART goals in the context of physical activity supports the proposition that non-specific goals are optimal for insufficiently active (and therefore presumably less experienced) individuals  (Hawkins et al., 2020) .\n\nDYB goals are just one type of non-specific goal, with open goals being another. Open goals can be conceptualised as non-specific, exploratory goals with no objective outcome (e.g. see how well you can do)  (Schweickle et al., 2017; Swann et al., 2016) . Unlike specific goals, open goals are largely ambiguous regarding the standard of performance to which goal strivings are referenced. Open goals maintain an exploratory focus where individuals actively strive towards uncovering new information or skills and/or understanding unfamiliar territories or ideas. For example, one might strive to 'see how many new words they can learn this week' or 'see how long it takes to learn the basics of algebra' . In this way, open goals can be considered more flexible than DYB goals, which remain anchored against a notional marker of performance (e.g. previous best or best possible self ), and entail an expectation of a high effort in the search for effective strategies to complete the task  (Hawkins et al., 2020) . Thus, open and DYB goals are best conceptualised as different types of non-specific goals, with the key distinction between them being the focus or 'compass' that guides goal striving efforts (exploratory versus relative to some notional limit).\n\nSeveral recent experimental tests of the differential effects of open, DYB, and SMART goals on behaviour and psychological states have been conducted. Among a sample of healthy adults who completed a 6-min walking task in a single session,  Swann et al. (2020)  found no meaningful differences in goal attainment outcomes regarding distance walked between the three goal states (i.e. open, DYB, SMART), yet supported the psychologically adaptive nature of open and goals relative to SMART goals (e.g. higher perceptions of performance, higher interest in repeating the activity, greater mental effort). Hawkins et al. (2020)  compared physically active with physically inactive healthy adults on a 6-min walking task using a within-subjects design. They found that physically active participants performed best when guided by specific goals, whereas inactive individuals achieved the greatest distance when driven by open goals. In related research that investigated specific goals rather than SMART goals explicitly,  Schweickle et al. (2017)  found that university students who were assigned open and DYB goals were more likely to report psychologically adaptive experiences (i.e. flow states, intrinsic motivation, confidence, challenge perceptions), whereas specific goals fostered a clutch state (i.e. a psychological state similar to flow, yet is more effortful and consciously demanding). In terms of cognitive performance, however, Schweickle and colleagues found that specific goals outperformed both open and DYB goals. Collectively, these studies provide early evidence for the psychologically adaptive nature open and DYB goals in some contexts, yet the effects of performance and behaviour remain in question.\n\nThere are two methodological considerations of past work  (Hawkins et al., 2020; Schweickle et al., 2017; Swann et al., 2020)  that may explain the unequivocal findings regarding the differential effects of open, DYB, and specific goals on performance. First, across all three studies, researchers assigned the specific goal to participants rather than having them generate their own evaluative standard. This operationalisation is incongruent with evidence that goals are optimal when self-generated  (Kwasnicka et al., 2021; Ogbeiwi, 2017)  and self-referenced to one's own learning trajectory (e.g. Burns et al., 2018 Burns et al., , 2021)) . Second, the behavioural tasks assessednamely a cognitive test requiring participants to identify letters or numbers among a random list  (Schweickle et al., 2017)  or distanced walked  (Hawkins et al., 2020; Swann et al., 2020)  -are intuitively amenable to goal setting in general. An alternative yet complementary test of the differential effects of goal types on performance, with specific focus on open goals, requires a behavioural task where open thinking is likely to optimise performance, such as creative tasks  (Roskes et al., 2012) . Within educational settings, curriculum designs that incorporate non-specific goals may foster explorative learning environments, particularly those approaches inspired by inquiry-based learning paradigms, where students are encouraged to explore, question, and problem-solve for knowledge construction in ways that demand creativity  (Pedaste et al., 2015; Shalley & Koseoglu, 2013) . We addressed each of these methodological limitations in the current study by (i) having participants self-assign SMART goals and (ii) assessing creative performance as our outcome of interest."

      "title": "Creative performance",
      "text": "First scientifically operationalised by Guilford in the 1950s, and then expanded by other scholars  (Allen & Thomas, 2011; Runco & Jaeger, 2012) , creativity is conceptualised as the ability to explore multiple solutions from an initial problem, and then hone in on the most appropriate response, or idea, for the context or problem. The measurement of creativity via creative performance is typically operationalised as the generation of new and original ideas, or products that are meaningful for the context  (Cortes et al., 2019; Ferr\u00e1ndiz Garc\u00eda et al., 2016) . It is widely accepted that underlying a person's creativity is their creative cognition, a neurocognitive process of recombining existing knowledge sets that initially appear unrelated or irrelevant to one another  (Cheng et al., 2008; Li et al., 2015) . Meta-analytic evidence suggests the best measurement of a person's creative cognition, and by extension their creativity, is fluid intelligence; the ability to think and reason in abstract, non-concrete terms  (Kim, 2005) . In other words, individual differences in creative performance are in-part determined by variability in fluid intelligence  (Stevenson et al., 2014) . Acknowledging the economic and social benefits of developing creativity, governments around the world have begun to emphasise developing creativity as a central part of their educational curricula; however, approaches to teaching creativity are diverse and have varying efficacy  (Wyse & Ferrari, 2015) .\n\nThe combination of creativity with goal setting is considered essential to the development of innovative ideas within industry  (Alves et al., 2007; Prather, 2005) , and educators have been encouraged to use goal setting as means for develop creativity of students  (O'Hara & Sternberg, 2001; Tsai, 2012; Wyse & Ferrari, 2015) . When creative performance is the priority, non-specific goals provide an unconstrained space to think broadly and is considered essential for new and different ideas to emerge  (Roskes et al., 2012) . Instructing people to 'be creative' is effective (e.g. Acar et al., 2020) , indicating that goal setting interventions have the potential to bolster creativity.\n\nNotably however, the nature of instruction is critical. Elaborative instructions, which provides prompts to be creative, can enhance creative output  (Niu & Liu, 2009)  but structured instructions that are overly prescriptive or performance-oriented can inhibit creativity  (Shalley & Koseoglu, 2013) . Setting SMART goals, which are inherently structured, may be restrictive because they position individuals to focus most on achievement of a specific, measurable goal (e.g. producing several items) rather than aspects of creativity that are difficult to quantify in a straightforward manner (e.g. novelty, usefulness). Thus, goals that engender less specificity around performative aspects of goal striving (e.g. open goals, DYB goals) may be more conducive to creative performance.\n\nNon-specific goals are also considered to foster adaptive psychological experiences in goal striving efforts when creative performance is the objective, including higher personal commitment to the task  (Stetler & Magnusson, 2015) , intrinsic motivation, and task enjoyment, thereby facilitating exploration of the problem space freely, and optimising persistence in the creative process  (Roskes et al., 2012) . In contrast, SMART goals are suggested to hinder creative performance and innovation by keeping people 'in the box' , which is argued to restrict broad thinking, risk taking for innovative ideas, and unexpected breakthroughs, thereby being counterproductive to expansive and novel ideas  (Prather, 2005) . Evidence regarding the adaptive nature of non-specific goals for creative performance are mixed. Early work showed that both non-specific goals, and specific, difficult goals are roughly equally effective for creative performance, when compared to a no goal condition  (Shalley, 1991) . Subsequent work demonstrated the superiority of DYB goals for creativity, relative to no goal at all  (Madjar & Shalley, 2008; Shalley, 1995) . However, others have found that specific, challenging goals maximise creative performance, relative to a DYB goal and goals that are less challenging  (Espedido & Searle, 2018; Stetler & Magnusson, 2015) . Thus, there remains a need for additional empirical invesitgations of the effectiveness of different goal types on creative performance."

We also attempted address concerns associated with SMART goals  (Swann et al., 2023)  and provide wider theoretical applicability by attempting to reconcile SMART goals with principles of goal setting theory  (Locke & Latham, 2019)  by encouraging participants to self-select 'challenging but realistic' goals. For our primary hypothesis, we expected people who set open goals will demonstrate higher creative performance when compared with individuals who set challenging SMART goals. We also tested the secondary hypothesis via an equivalence test that the difference in creative performance between open and DYB goals will be small and statistically inconsequential. In so doing, we provide the first empirical test regarding an expectation that the difference between these two types of non-specific goals is small enough to be considered trivial. Evidence which confirms the null hypothesis is important for theory development or refinement (e.g. conditions where an effect should be absent) as well as practice (e.g. different ways to operationalise concepts into educational strategies)."

We conducted this analysis, but given results were exploratory, largely inconclusive, and tangential to our main hypotheses we report these findings in Supplementary Material. We note one deviation from our preregistration plan, that is, we used jamovi instead of R to execute the analysis (The Jamovi Project, 2020)."

Power simulations indicated that approximately 260 participants would provide 90% power to detect effect sizes of d \u2265 .40 that allows for a maximum Type II error rate of .05. We used a moderate effect size for these power simulations based on meta-analytic estimates from diverse behaviours (e.g. cognitive, production, and educational targets; d = .34) (Epton et al., 2017)  and physical activity targets (d = .55) (McEwan et al., 2016) . As a complement to these power simulations, design calculations  (Gelman & Carlin, 2014)  using the retrodesign function in R indicated that statistical power is sufficient (\u2265 80%) and concerns regarding an incorrect sign and overestimation of magnitude are minimal when effect sizes are >.40.\n\nParticipants were recruited via the online platform Prolific ( https://www.prolific.co/ ) and reimbursed \u00a32.15 for completing the study.

      "text": "Participants were randomised into one of three goals conditions by the software used to run the experiment (Qualtrics). Each condition provided different instructions for the creative performance test. In the DYB goal condition participants were told: 'This time around we want you to focus on what is referred to as a 'do your best goal' , that is, do your best in 2 minutes to generate alternate ideas for this everyday item' . In the open goal condition participants were told: 'This time around we want you to focus on what is referred to as an 'open goal' , that is, see how many alternate uses you can generate for this everyday item in 2 minutes' . Participants in the SMART condition were told: 'Thinking of your previous performance on the alternate uses task with a newspaper as the target, please use the scale below to choose a specific goal for a repeat of this task [with a different everyday item] that is challenging yet realistic for you to achieve in 2 minutes. WE WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON ACHIEVING THIS GOAL IN THE NEXT TASK' . SMART goals by definition are anchored to the feature of 'challenging yet realistic' , so our instructions inevitably required us to orient participants to their baseline performance as context for self-generating this specific target. There is convincing evidence that goals are more adaptive than no goals  (Epton et al., 2017; McEwan et al., 2016; Williamson et al., in press ). We excluded a 'no goal' condition because we were interested primarily in comparing SMART goals to DYB and open goals, rather than against a no-goal control. The wording for all goal conditions is based from previous studies using instructional manipulations for the three goal types  (Hawkins et al., 2020; Schweickle et al., 2017; Swann et al., 2020) . Participants were asked to name the type of goal they were asked to focus on as a manipulation check."

In the present study, participants were provided two minutes to come up with alternate and original uses for a newspaper and paperclip at baseline and post-manipulation, respectively. The written description of the task was accompanied by a visual picture of the object, with participants requested to type their answers in separate boxes; we provided space for up to 20 different uses. We removed erroneous responses from the main analyses, including random character strings (e.g. 'wfae'), non-sense words (e.g. 'blah'), and ideas that were irrelevant to the object or context (e.g. 'spaceship'). Fluency was scored as the number of alternate ideas generated that are feasible and functional uses of the object, whereas originality was calculated as the number of uses reported by 10% or less of the total sample. Initially, SP and DG collaboratively coded approximately 15% of the total sample of responses to converge on a common mental model for application across the entire dataset. SP subsequently applied this coding framework across the entire dataset; SP and DG discussed any uncertainties to arrive at a consensus for fluency and originality scores."

Your task is to think of and list alternate uses for that item. You have 2 minutes to complete the task' . Participants were provided with 130 seconds on the following page; we allowed 10 seconds for participants to orient themselves and view the picture of a newspaper prior to listing alternate uses. There were 20 blank response boxes available to type in their answers. The page timer automatically progressed to the next page after 130 seconds had elapsed. Participants then advanced to the next screen where they were randomised to one of the three goal conditions. Participants allocated to the SMART goal condition were prompted to select, using a 1 to 20 sliding scale, a specific yet achievable goal for the number of uses they believe they could come up with for a household item based on their baseline performance with the newspaper. Subsequently, participants were presented with the AUT instructions, followed by a household item (paperclip) using the same procedure as the baseline test. On completion of the second creative performance test, participants completed an open-ended manipulation check question ('What was your goal type?')"

We used equivalence tests via the TOSTER package in jamovi to estimate the absence of a meaningful difference in creative performance between open and DYB goals  (Lakens et al., 2018) . Equivalence tests determine whether the means of two sets of scores are practically or theoretically equivalent based on whether effects fall within predetermined upper/lower equivalence bounds  (Walker & Nowacki, 2011) . Informed by meta-analytic evidence for expected effect size  (Epton et al., 2017; McEwan et al., 2016)  and effect size guidelines for individual differences in research  (Gignac & Szodorai, 2016) , we considered an effect of d between -.20 and .20 (\u03b1 = .05) as too small or statistically trivial for the purposes of the secondary study hypotheses."

Equally, the difference in creative performance (originality) between the open goal condition and the DYB goal condition was statistically indistinguishable from zero, Welch's t(158) = -1.85, p = 0.066, but not equivalent because the larger of the two p values (for upper equivalence bound d = .2) exceeded .05, t(157) = -0.56, p = 0.714.

This finding is consistent with previous experimental work that compared open, SMART, and DYB goals in physical activity contexts  (Schweickle et al., 2017; Swann et al., 2020 Swann et al., , 2022)) . Our results suggest that SMART goals do not perform worse than non-specific goals in creative tasks, yet they are not the superior goal setting strategy they are often espoused to be either. Swann et al. (2022)  have called into question both the theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence for SMART goals. Additionally, several recent studies have demonstrated that SMART goals perform equally well or worse than non-specific goals like DYB or open goals in some contexts  (Hawkins et al., 2020; Swann et al., 2020 Swann et al., , 2022)) . All these studies were conducted in physical activity settings. The present results make a novel contribution by demonstrating similar results in a creative task. The emerging evidence that SMART goals may not produce better performance than non-specific goals, at least in some circumstances, suggests that further research into the utility of SMART goals is required. This recommendation is increasingly true for educational settings. For example, in Australia, the Victorian government's Department of Education promotes SMART goals as part of their policy for the development of individual education plans for at-risk students (Victorian Department of Education, 2022). Our results in combination with similar research findings from other contexts may have important implications for both practitioners and policy makers who employ SMART goals. Although previous studies have not found differences in physical activity for SMART, open, and DYB goals, they did find several other meaningful differences. For example,  Swann et al. (2020 Swann et al. ( , 2022) )  found DYB and open goals were more psychologically adaptive than SMART goals, whereas  Hawkins et al. (2020)  found that DYB and open goals were more effective for inactive novices. We did not measure psychological variables and suggest that further research on psychological variables such as effort or enjoyment for creative tasks with different goal types is warranted. Our task was presumed to be novel for all participants, yet unlike  Hawkins et al. (2020)  we did not find that DYB or open goals were superior. We propose several possible explanations for these findings. Firstly, the inconsistent findings may be due to the drastically different nature of the task used in the current study. Factors uniquely associated with either physical activity or creative tasks could potentially have created discrepancies in performance. In a similar line of reasoning, it is easy to quantify physical activity (e.g. number of steps taken, activity duration), yet creative performance is somewhat more difficult to evaluate objectively. The AUT was chosen for the current study as an attempt to maximise the quantifiability of creative performance and thus increase comparability to prior work, nonetheless other aspects of creative performance, such as those seen in art or music, may be more amenable to non-specific goals.\n\nSecondly, the self-driven nature of the online methodology assumes participants interpreted the wording of the goal instructions correctly, without any support or clarification from the researcher. This assumption was potentially violated here with only 52% of participants correctly identifying their goal condition in the manipulation check posttest. It is possible that participants misunderstood the instructions, and therefore defaulted to their preferred approach to setting goals for task performance, which may have been incongruent with the experimental manipulation  (Campbell & Paula, 2002; Zweig & Webster, 2004) . However, other explanations of the manipulation check data are also possible. Visual inspection of the responses indicates that most participants who provided an incorrect response in the manipulation check failed to comprehend the attention check question correctly and entered the aim of the AUT task (i.e. to describe alternative uses) rather than their goal setting condition, whereas others indicated they had forgotten the name of the goal setting manipulation. Consequently, we suggest that unclear wording of the manipulation check question, or the fact that it was presented after a cognitively demanding task, is more likely to be the cause of this discrepancy.\n\nThirdly, in contrast to previous work that has employed researcher generated specific goals (e.g. Espedido & Searle, 2018; Shalley, 1991; Stetler & Magnusson, 2015) , participants in our study self-generated their target in the SMART goal condition to maximise conceptual congruence with goal setting theory. In so doing, it is possible that they set a target that maximised their self-efficacy by selecting the degree of challenge commensurate with their capabilities, which in turn optimised their creative performance when compared to open and DYB goal conditions -a notion consistent with goal theory  (Locke & Latham, 2002) . Collectively, therefore, it is possible that the goal conditions in this study may be interacting with other psychological factors absent from our experimental protocol (e.g. personality traits), thereby functioning dissimilarly when compared to past empirical and conceptual work."

      "title": "Equivalence between open and DYB goals",
      "text": "The conceptual and empirical distinctions between open and DYB goals is an important consideration because each may only be optimal in certain contexts. Open and DYB goals are suggested to be similar concepts in that both are non-specific goals that facilitate exploration of the problem space, which is an essential dimension of goal types for optimising creative performance  (Stetler & Magnusson, 2015) . Conceptually, the key distinction between open and DYB goals is the focus or 'compass' that guides goal striving efforts (exploratory versus relative to some notional limit). Empirically, past scholarly work has reported null findings for differences in the adaptive nature of open versus DYB goals for outcomes of cognitive and physical tasks  (Hawkins et al., 2020; Swann et al., 2020) . However, rejecting the null hypothesis in the absence of a meaningful effect provides little evidence for no effect all; researchers need to test the expectation of statistical equivalence directly (as we did in the current study) or use Bayesian statistics to evaluate the degree of evidence in favour of the null  (Lakens et al., 2018) .\n\nBy testing the expectation of statistical equivalence directly, the current study represents an important extension of past work on the equivalency between different types of non-specific goals. Contrary to our secondary hypothesis, differences in creative performance between the open and DYB goal conditions were statistically different from zero and not equivalent for fluency, and statistically indistinguishable from zero but not equivalent for originality. Assuming a d of \u00b1.20 as the smallest effect size of interest, our findings indicate that there is a meaningful difference for both fluency and originality in creative performance between open and DYB goals, with DYB goals producing better performance. One possible reason for the finding of non-equivalence, even though both open and DYB goals are considered non-specific goals, is that an open goal is conceptualised as a non-specific, exploratory goal with no objective outcome (e.g. see how well you can do)  (Schweickle et al., 2017)  and absent of structure. In contrast, a DYB goal is considered less flexible than the exploratory focus of an open goal because it remains anchored against a marker of 'best' and therefore attaches an expectation of a high effort in the search for effective strategies to complete the task  (Hawkins et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is possible that a DYB goal is more amenable to creative performance when compared to an open goal because it has an attached expectation of high effort. Theoretically, DYB goals, which encourage defining personal standards of excellence, and open goals, which emphasise minimal constraints, could activate different motivational and cognitive mechanisms.\n\nSome scholars argue that the notion of high effort is a requirement for a person to 'push past' common uses in the AUT to come up with original, yet feasible uses for that item  (Kudrowitz & Dippo, 2013) . It is therefore possible that the higher effort required for creative performance, and conceptual differences between goal types, resulted in a meaningful difference between open and DYB goals here. This contribution to the literature is important because to date, open and DYB goals have not been empirically shown to function differentially, with no studies formally testing the equivalency of these two goal conditions  (Hawkins et al., 2020; Schweickle et al., 2017; Swann et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that the statistical power with a sample size of 157 participants and equivalence bounds of \u00b1 .20, assuming the true effect is zero was only 61%, suggesting this finding was only slightly above a chance occurrence; the traditional benchmark of 80% power occurs for equivalence bounds of \u00b1 .23. If the equivalence bounds are defined as d = \u00b1 .23 the results for the current analyses do not change in terms of significance, indicating that the results remain even if a researcher defines slightly more conservative (but less theoretically justified) bounds for equivalency. From a practical standpoint, the difference between the two goal conditions with reference to the number of original ideas generated was only small."

      "title": "Limitations and future directions",
      "text": "There are limitations to our work that need to be considered when interpreting the findings in addition to those mentioned previously. First, participants were limited to two minutes for the AUT to reduce the likelihood of them using search engines (e.g. Google) to generate solutions. However,  Guilford (1967)  recommends that participants are provided with several minutes, or even no timeframe to capture the full scope of one's creativity. Empirical support for this proposition was demonstrated by  Kudrowitz & Dippo (2013)  who observed that original ideas (alternate ideas <10% of respondents gave) occurred, on average, after participants listed nine common alternative ideas. Thus, we recommended in future studies that researchers utilise longer timeframes for the AUT in a lab-based environment, or with additional measures in place (e.g. browser window monitoring) to control for extraneous variables (e.g. using electronic search engines) to maximise the generation of creative performance. Second, we operationalised originality of creative performance using the AUT as one that less than 10% of participants listed  (Guilford, 1967; Kudrowitz & Dippo, 2013) . However, one limitation to this approach is dichotomising originality based on an arbitrary 10%, when creativity may best be conceptualised along a continuum  (Cohen, 1989; McFadzean, 1998) . Third, meta-analytic data suggests creative performance is multidimensional in nature  (Ma, 2009) , where one may demonstrate high creative performance in one domain (e.g. alternate uses for common items), yet have differential performance in other creative domains (e.g. art, science, music). Consequently, our findings are limited to the creative domain utilised in the AUT and therefore requires future extensions to other domains to test the extent to which these findings generalise. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the design and test combination implemented in this study was sufficiently powered for the primary research question regarding the effects of goal types on creative performance, rather than for the moderation tests. The differential effects of moderators on goal types is typically small  (Epton et al., 2017; McEwan et al., 2016) . Accordingly, the current study was insufficiently powered to reveal small interactional effects between goal types and theoretical moderators. Consequently, we have not discussed results pertaining to moderators. Nonetheless, this data remains useful, as it provides preliminary evidence for further research and can be incorporated in future Bayesian or meta-analytic studies."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "Our findings suggest the differences in the effects of open, DYB, and SMART goal types on creative performance are statistically inconsequential. These results contributes to a growing body of literature that challenges the superiority of SMART goals over other goal types. Concerns regarding the superiority of SMART goals in turn raise the question of whether the ubiquitousness of SMART goals in various applied fields such as education is justified. It also may be that the question is best framed as when different goals are likely to work best for educational practice. Regarding inquiry-based learning paradigms  (Pedaste et al., 2015) , for example, optimal goal setting might work best when goal types are adapted or aligned to the inquiry or developmental phase. During the initial stages of inquiry, non-specific goals might best promote exploration without the pressure of specific outcomes. As students delve deeper into their inquiries, specific goals could be introduced to guide their research and experimentation processes, yet done so with flexibility to encourage creative approaches to problem-solving (e.g. personal best goals). Towards the end of an inquiry project, students can define specific, measurable goals to assess their understanding and articulate their findings, integrating SMART goals strategically to ensure clear and focused outcomes."
