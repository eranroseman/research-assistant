  "title": "Problems and Barriers Related to the Use of mHealth Apps From the Perspective of Patients: Focus Group and Interview Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Since fall 2020, mobile health (mHealth) apps have become an integral part of the German health care system. The belief that mHealth apps have the potential to make the health care system more efficient, close gaps in care, and improve the economic outcomes related to health is unwavering and already partially confirmed. Nevertheless, problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps usually remain unconsidered. \n Objective: The focus groups and interviews conducted in this study aim to shed light on problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps from the perspective of patients. Methods: Guided focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with patients with a disease for which an approved mHealth app was available at the time of the interviews. Participants were recruited via self-help groups. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to a qualitative content analysis. The content analysis was based on 10 problem categories (\"validity,\" \"usability,\" \"technology,\" \"use and adherence,\" \"data privacy and security,\" \"patient-physician relationship,\" \"knowledge and skills,\" \"individuality,\" \"implementation,\" and \"costs\") identified in a previously conducted scoping review. Participants were asked to fill out an additional questionnaire about their sociodemographic data and about their use of technology. Results: A total of 38 patients were interviewed in 5 focus groups (3 onsite and 2 web-based) and 5 individual web-based interviews. The additional questionnaire was completed by 32 of the participants. Patients presented with a variety of different diseases, such as arthrosis, tinnitus, depression, or lung cancer. Overall, 16% (5/32) of the participants had already been prescribed an app. During the interviews, all 10 problem categories were discussed and considered important by patients. A myriad of problem manifestations could be identified for each category. This study shows that there are relevant problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps from the perspective of patients, which warrant further attention. Conclusions: There are essentially 3 different areas of problems in the context of mHealth apps that could be addressed to improve care: quality of the respective mHealth app, its integration into health care, and the expandable digital literacy of patients.",

      "text": "Worldwide, patients can access an ever-growing number of mobile health (mHealth) apps. Six years ago, there were 325,000 mHealth apps available, which were created by 84,000 different developers  [1] . Regardless of the high number of mHealth apps, there is no fundamental quality control by app stores as distribution channels. Thus, unsafe mHealth apps are a potential threat for patient health  [2, 3] .\n\nAn indicator for safe mHealth apps is the approval as a medical device. This is achieved by the European conformity or Food and Drug Administration certification in Europe and the United States, respectively  [4, 5] . Although medical device certification focuses particularly on safety and medical-technical performance with respect to the intended purpose specified by the manufacturer, there are also other areas where problems can arise.\n\nA more extensive certification program is the \"Fast-Track Process for Digital Health Applications (DiGA)\" established in Germany. In this process, in addition to the European conformity certification as proof of \"safety\" and \"suitability,\" other requirements, such as \"data protection,\" \"information security,\" \"interoperability,\" and \"user-friendliness\" are reviewed  [6] . Despite the relatively broad testing approach in the fast-track process, it has not been conclusively clarified whether it is sufficient to face all potential problems in the context of mHealth apps. This is partly due to the novelty of the field of care.\n\nIn addition to governmental guidelines, there is also a variety of approaches in science to evaluate the quality of mHealth apps. Well-known assessment scales include the Mobile App Rating Scale  [7] , the User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale  [8] , Enlight  [9] , and the System Usability Scale  [10] . On an aggregated level, a review by Nouri et al  [11] , which was published in 2018, analyzed such rating tools. The review identified \"design,\" \"information/content,\" \"usability,\" \"functionality,\" \"ethical issues,\" \"security and privacy,\" and \"user-perceived value\" as relevant quality dimensions  [11] . However, similar to the presented governmental certification processes, it is also questionable whether these quality assessment procedures and identified quality dimensions in the scientific field are sufficient to address potential problems in the context of mHealth.\n\nKnowing the existing problems and barriers related to mHealth apps and their use is a fundamental requirement to guarantee the comprehensive quality assurance of mHealth apps. However, only few studies have aimed to identify weaknesses and problems of mHealth apps  [12] [13] [14] . A scoping review on this topic revealed 10 problem categories: \"validity,\" \"usability,\" \"technology,\" \"use and adherence,\" \"data privacy and security,\" \"patient-physician relationship,\" \"knowledge and skills,\" \"individuality,\" \"implementation,\" and \"costs\"  [14] .\n\nHowever, it remains uncertain whether these categories are relevant from the perspective of users or patients. A systematic review of qualitative studies identified 25 studies focusing on barriers of and facilitators to the use of lifestyle apps. However, the authors emphasized that the included studies have considered only healthy individuals, and thus, the obtained results are not transferable to patients with diseases  [15] . In another qualitative study from Australia, patients were recruited in a general practice setting and interviewed about barriers and enablers to the use of mHealth apps. Nevertheless, the authors emphasized that the sample size was skewed toward relatively healthy patients, and future studies should target patients with long-term medical conditions  [16] ."

      "title": "Objectives",
      "text": "As there is insufficient evidence base regarding the problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps, qualitative research methods could provide an explorative insight in this research field. Perspectives of both mHealth app users as well as nonusers should be taken into account. This is necessary to reveal existing problems with the use of mHealth apps as well as concerns and barriers preventing patients from using these apps. Therefore, this study surveyed both app using and nonusing patients in focus groups and individual interviews to identify patient-relevant problems and barriers related to the use of mHealth apps."

Patients were either actual users of DiGA and other mHealth apps or did not use any mHealth apps. The aim of the research was to shed light on the perspective of patients on mHealth apps. Questions covered \"problems and barriers,\" \"facilitating factors,\" \"reasons for attrition,\" and \"important properties\" that mHealth apps should meet. This paper focuses especially on problems and barriers identified in the underlying conversations.\n\nThe decision for a qualitative research design was made to take an exploratory step into the still poorly researched field of problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps. Conducting focus groups and interviews allowed the collection of individual opinions. Those can subsequently be used to develop new research hypotheses."

While patients with experience in mHealth app use could mainly contribute to the existing problems with use, patients without experience could mainly contribute to the barriers to use. Saturation was reached when all relevant indications for which there were approved DiGA at that time were covered.\n\nBefore conducting the interviews, participants received an informational letter about the topic \"quality assurance of DiGA\" and the proceeding of the interviews by email. Furthermore, patients were informed in the cover letter that the focus groups or interviews were part of a project (\"QuaSiApps\") funded by the German Federal Joint Committee, which aims to develop a continuous quality assurance concept for DiGA. More detailed information was not provided beforehand."

The participants were informed and asked to consent to the recording of their conversations for subsequent transcription. At the beginning of the interviews, the participants were informed that they could end the conversations at any time without giving a reason and without facing disadvantages of any type."

The onsite focus groups were conducted with self-help groups in their respective familiar settings. The web-based interviews were conducted via the videoconferencing platform Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc). The choice for the web-based setting arose from the preference of participants.\n\nNo abnormalities were observed in the study setting that could influence patient statements. All patients were in a familiar environment during the interviews. No other people except 2 relatives of participants in 1 focus group were present besides participants and researchers. In 2 web-based focus groups, people did not know each other, which could lead to patients being more reluctant to participate. There were no known relationships with participants. Notable characteristics of researchers, which could influence the participants, were not identified. There were no conflicts of interest, and the moderators did not take a firm stance for or against the use of mHealth apps."

      "title": "Data Collection",
      "text": "Each focus group or interview was conducted by 1 of 3 moderators (GDG, CA, and KB). Of the 3 moderators, 2 were female (CA and KB) and 1 was male (GDG). For quality assurance reasons, at least 2 of the moderators participated in each focus group or interview conducted. While 2 moderators hold degrees with health economics background (GDG and CA), 1 moderator originally stems from the field of medicine and holds an MD degree (KB). GDG and CA are researchers at the Institute for Healthcare Management and Research, University of Duisburg-Essen. KB is the managing director of B\u00d6RCHERS CONSULTING+ and an honorary professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen. While CA and KB are very experienced in conducting focus groups, GDG was less experienced but received a detailed briefing.\n\nA prior scoping review  [14]  on problems and barriers related to the use of mHealth apps similar to the German concept of DiGA served as a basis to develop a noninfluencing interview guideline. This provided a consistent interview framework (Multimedia Appendix 1). The guideline followed a uniform structure. Each topic started with open questions followed by some concrete questions, which were shown if the participants did not find a spontaneous answer. Personal data were not addressed in the guideline.\n\nFocus groups or interviews were recorded either onsite with microphones or web-based via the integrated recording function in Zoom. Data collection took place in the period between the end of September 2021 and the beginning of December 2021. Subsequently, to record transcription, data analysis started in February 2022 and was completed at the end of October 2022. The conduct of the interviews worked without problems, and the guide proved to be understandable. Therefore, no adjustments were made to the method of data generation during the study.\n\nThe recordings of the interviews and focus groups were transcribed and pseudonymized by project assistants or employed students. A second person, also a project assistant or student assistant, performed quality assurance of the transcripts. Afterward, the transcripts were loaded into MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH) for data analysis, and the audio recordings were deleted. After data extraction, it was no longer possible to trace back individual statements to individual participants.\n\nQualitative data analysis was based on Mayring  [19]  and performed by GDG and CA. NB supervised the process and served as the decisive authority in the event of disagreements. As recommended by Mayring  [19] , deductive codes used in the data analysis were defined before the data analysis. Deductive codes were taken from the results of a scoping review  [14] . Inductive subcodes were developed iteratively at the time of data extraction. Data analysis was conducted in 4 steps to enhance trustworthiness. In the first step, GDG coded each transcript with deductive codes. In the second step, CA checked the coding made in each transcript, and in case of disagreement, problems were solved by discussion. In the third step, GDG developed inductive subcodes, which were discussed in group (GDG, CA, NB, and FP). Finally, subcodes were applied by GDG and checked by CA."

      "text": "Our study showed that patients face a multitude of problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps. While the problem categories were determined based on a previously conducted scoping review  [14] , many new expressions of problems emerged in each category. These expressions provide a deeper insight into the thinking and attitudes of patients related to mHealth apps. There were mainly 3 different factors related to problems and barriers in the context of mHealth app use. First, the mHealth apps themselves could lead to problems. Such problems were observed, for example, in defective design, technical aspects, or low or no added value for patients.\n\nSecond, the integration into the health care system was considered partially problematic. Thus, problems were found, for instance, in remuneration and lack of time of health care providers, influences on the relation between health care providers and patients, and a lack of presence of the topic in the health care system.\n\nThird, the users themselves as well as their attitude and knowledge were found to be a barrier for mHealth app use. Several participants expressed a lack of interest in using mHealth apps and explained that they sometimes lack knowledge and skills to use the digital technology. This fact was especially pronounced for older patients.\n\nIn our study, we included patients with different diseases (migraine, tinnitus, obesity, depression, arthrosis, cancer, and alcohol addiction) to receive broad feedback from people with diverse needs. While most of the problems were overarching and concerned the general use of mHealth apps, some problems were disease specific. The latter were mainly found in the category of individuality but also included technological problems such as light sensitivity leading to an avoidance of screen use in the case of patients with migraine or other problems such as the risk of increased social withdrawal of individuals with cancer because of app use. For other indications, there are additional disease-specific problems that could not be completely covered here."

      "text": "Problems with the mHealth apps themselves were found in the categories of \"validity,\" \"usability,\" \"technology,\" \"individuality,\" \"data privacy and security,\" and \"costs.\" One approach to identify these is to use various quality assessment tools, which aim to guarantee a high quality of mHealth apps  [11, 20, 21] . Quality assessment tools provide a practicable approach to distinguish high-quality mHealth apps from low-quality mHealth apps and thereby indicate if patients might have more or less problems with app use. Furthermore, patients should be involved during the whole development process of mHealth apps. This includes (1) the need assessment, (2) the design and development, (3) the laboratory evaluation, and (4) the field evaluation. Eligible methods include qualitative data collection methods such as interviews, focus groups, observations, and think-aloud techniques as well as quantitative approaches such as self-report questionnaires  [22] .\n\nAn eligible way to do this is the participatory design  [23] . By this, patients would have the possibility to comment on problems and barriers as soon as they become apparent. By including both experienced and nonexperienced mHealth apps users during the development process of mHealth apps, problems and barriers can be minimized for all users. A good example in which a 3-phase user-centered design approach has been successfully implemented is the study by Newton et al  [24] .\n\nIn addition, problems and barriers become apparent through user feedback in app stores. Therefore, user feedback should not only be included during the development but also in the evaluation and rework of mHealth apps. One innovative approach to incorporate user text review is the ACCU 3 RATE rating scale  [25] ."

      "title": "Integration of mHealth Apps Into the Health Care System",
      "text": "The results of this study show that problems and barriers are not restricted to the mHealth apps themselves. Thus, it is necessary to obtain more knowledge about the contextual problems and barriers that patients encounter when they want to or actually use mHealth apps.\n\nThe focus groups and interviews conducted indicate that, in the perception of patients, health care practitioners are one of the most important stakeholder groups facing problems with mHealth apps. Therefore, it is a fundamental requirement that they are convinced of the positive effects and low risk of mHealth apps for their patients and of the simple and sustainable integration in their daily routine. However, this is not always the case, as shown by a study on the attitudes of physicians toward mHealth apps falling under the German concept of DiGA  [26] . In principle, general practitioners, other outpatient care physicians, and psychotherapists were in favor of prescribing DiGA but faced significant barriers, such as insufficient information, insufficient reimbursement for DiGA-related medical services, lack of medical evidence, and legal and technological uncertainties.\n\nTherefore, such problems and barriers faced by health care providers should also be further investigated.\n\nGermany was the first country in the world to incorporate certain mHealth apps (ie, DiGA) as a fixed part into the benefit package of the health care system  [26] . Although the German concept is an innovative and commendable approach, it still faces several challenges. Further investigations into problems and barriers related to integrating mHealth apps could provide insights into improving regulatory systems. This would aim to make app use easier while ensuring safety and sustainability.\n\nAnother problem, depending on the respective health care system, could be the costs of using mHealth apps for patients. In the German statutory health insurance system, however, the costs are covered and thus represent only an indirect problem for users. Therefore, prices must be negotiated between health insurers and manufacturers, in particular."

In our study as well as in the literature  [14] , it was found that low digital literacy of patients was seen as a problem in the context of mHealth app use.\n\nAccording to the technology acceptance model by Davis et al  [27] , an actual system use is the result of perceived ease of use as well as perceived usefulness. Therefore, another approach to optimize the use of mHealth apps should focus on reinforcing the digital literacy of potential users, especially older patients. This involves supporting them with app use and effectively communicating the benefits of mHealth apps  [28, 29] . Both our study and other studies  [14, 16, 30]  found that age is a problem in the context of mHealth app use. Interestingly, however, the reason for this is predominantly seen in the lack of technological affinity and digital literacy among older people. The extent to which cognitive and psychological decline plays a role should be investigated further."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Given the scarce evidence regarding problems and barriers in the context of mHealth app use, qualitative research seems to be an eligible first step to gain further evidence  [14] . Nevertheless, qualitative research is always accompanied by uncertainty. The statements made by participants are not necessarily representative for all patients, especially as participants were recruited from self-help groups and presumably had a high motivation to actively shape their to actively shape their experience of living with the disease. Thus, the problems and barriers identified in this study should serve as the first evidence to conduct further qualitative and quantitative studies.\n\nTwo points concerning the methods must still be made. First, we were not able to determine the number of people who refused to take part in our study. As we recruited our participants via self-help groups, we do not exactly know how each group distributed the information about our study to their respective members. Second, we did not calculate an agreement rate or other measurements regarding the coding discrepancies. In retrospect, however, there were very few disagreements and minimal need for discussion in this regard.\n\nTo make the research comprehensible and as free from arbitrariness as possible, we described the methods precisely. Therefore, we followed the standards by O'Brien et al  [17]  and checked the manuscript against the 32-items of the COREQ checklist  [18] . Thereby, the strengths and weaknesses of our study became very transparent.\n\nIn Germany, the use of mHealth apps in the context of diseases is not yet very common  [31] . This also became obvious in our study. Only 16% (5/32) of the participants in our study reported \u22651 prescription of an mHealth app. Thus, most participants could not contribute with experience in this field. Nevertheless, we included opinions, fears, and concerns of nonusers in our research. These should be taken into account when developing and integrating mHealth apps in health care.\n\nA limitation of the article, but not of the study or the results, is that the patient statements were originally made in German and subsequently translated into English. We have taken care not to change the meaning of the statements. The original citations can be requested from the authors of the study."

Such problems can be categorized into problems originating from the app, problems with the integration of the mHealth app into the health care system, and problems and barriers on the users' side. While problems on the level of the app and the health care system should be taken into account when developing mHealth apps and corresponding assessment tools, problems on the patients' side should be solved by increasing the digital literacy of potential users. On the basis of our findings, further research should be conducted to generate more evidence on problems and barriers as well as how to counteract them."
