      "text": "Self-management is the cornerstone of diabetes control but several problems identified in the literature related to the failure to motivate or empower people for the selfmanagement of diabetes. Developing effective and efficient strategies to promote self-management is important in order to prevent serious complications. Many diabetes intervention studies have explored how challenging it is for diabetic people to maintain active self-management  (Barlow et al., 2002; Norris et al., 2001) . However, diabetes self-management depends not only on the technical skills needed to perform regimen behaviors but also on an individual's level of motivation to engage in and maintain the self-management of their disease  (Redman, 2004) .\n\nResults from the literature showed that individual discussion and group intervention produced a greater decline in glycemic levels than the long-term behavior change in people with type 2 diabetes  (Norris et al., 2001) . However, it is clear from these studies of self-management interventions that behavioral interventions must be practical and feasible within a variety of settings. A number of examples in the literature suggested that further intervention research is needed to investigate and clarify issues relating to participation in and for the maintenance of self-management  (Barlow et al., 2002; Clement et al., 2004; Norris et al., 2001) .\n\nSeveral significant gaps in the areas of self-management and diabetes outcomes have been identified in the review of recent literature. The first gap relates to diabetes educational interventions and increased motivation to maintain diabetes management properly  (Adolfsson et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010) . Some studies identified psychological factors such as self-efficacy inhibiting the management of diabetes during daily life but few studies evaluated the outcomes  (Dalahanty et al., 2002 (Dalahanty et al., , 2006)) , a second significant gap. The control of glycated hemoglobin level is acknowledged as an important component of managing diabetes to achieve normalization of diabetes control but fewer than half the sample achieved ideal glycemic control hemoglobin of A1c < 7.0% (American Diabetes  Association, 2010) . Few studies discussed the ideal strategies for enhancing the self-management behavior, a third significant gap in the literature.\n\nMotivational interviewing (MI) has been successful in the treatment of alcohol abuse  (Beckham, 2007) , physical activity  (Schelling et al., 2009; Dutton and Provost, 2008) , tobacco use disorders  (Stotts et al., 2004) , pain selfmanagement  (Habib et al., 2005) , weight loss and glycemic control  (Huisman and de Gucht, 2009; West et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010)  but not applied systematically in the diabetes self-management field. Motivational interviewing is thought to work by increasing levels of 'change talk'  (Miller and Rollnick, 2002)  with resultant change behaviors. Using motivational interviews integrated with insights derived from the readiness for behavioral change, people may be guided from thinking about change to preparing for change, acting accordingly, and remaining committed to the changes they have made  (Miller and Rollnick, 2002) . Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether participation in a motivational interview for people with type 2 diabetes would improve their self-management, psychological and glycemic outcomes."

The parameter of medium level was used for both R 2 of covariate and effect size because the motivational interviewing intervention was newly developed and no previous research data could be used as the reference for the parameter estimation. Further 30% was added to the calculation to allow for withdrawals from the study. Therefore the sample size needed was 240."

Individuals were excluded from participating if they demonstrated: difficulty communicating in Chinese or were too ill to participate because of a terminal illness or hemodialysis.\n\nStudy subjects were recruited between 9 July and 8 November 2008 from the diabetes outpatient clinic at a community hospital in south Taiwan. The initial recruitment of the sample for this study identified 286 people with type 2 diabetes, and 254 met the selection criteria. Potential participants were invited to take part in the study. 4 people declined because they did not have enough time to participate. Overall, the participants totaled 250. 125 were randomly assigned to the experimental group, and 125 were randomized to the control group. After 3 months follow-up, a total of 214 people completed the outcome data collection, including 104 (83%) people of the experimental group, and 110 (85%) people of the control group. The participants in both group had the same chronic oral prescriptions during this 3 month period. There were no significant differences between the withdrawal participants and those who continued with respect to baseline characteristics, HbA1c, self-management, and psychological outcomes."

      "text": "Participants allocated to the intervention group received the motivational interview intervention comprising a 45-60 min interview. The researcher who conducted the motivational interviews has a nursing background and has had extensive experience conducting motivational interviews with diabetic people. The researcher introduced the motivational interview to participants as an opportunity to talk about their thoughts and feelings about diabetes, emphasizing that it was up to the participants themselves to make decisions about diabetes self-management.\n\nThe motivational interview used  Miller and Rollnick's (2002)  approach, a six step process including the following aspects. (1) Introducing oneself: all participants who were randomly allocated to the intervention group were assigned a scheduled date and time for interviewing that suited both the researcher and participant. (2) Proactive information gathering: open-ended questions were used to encourage participants to talk about their diabetes self-management. Using this friendly and sensitive approach enabled the researcher to obtain the required information by minimizing the participants' negative feelings about more direct questioning. (3) Intervention strategies for type 2 diabetes: if the participants reported lifestyle practices that reflected less than optimal self-management of their diabetes, it was proposed that the researcher who was a diabetes specialist addressed this in the motivational interview. The researcher took into account each participant's stage of readiness to change. This intervention represented an adaptation of Miller and Rollnick's motivational interviewing method  (Miller and Rollnick, 2002)  and Prochaska and DiClemente's model  (DiClemente and Prochaska, 1998)  for use in type 2 diabetes. (4) Assessment of readiness to change: to assess each participant's stage of readiness to change  (Byrd-Bredbenner and Finckenor, 2000) . The participant's answer was indicative of his/her level of stage of readiness to change. This allowed the researcher to provide intervention strategies specific to the individual. (  5 ) Strategies utilized in motivational interviewing: these strategies are mainly basic counselling skills derived from people-centred counselling. The present study used motivational interviewing to encourage participants to talk about their behavior, explore their ambivalence and verbalise reasons for changing. These strategies are adapted from previous research  (Miller and Rollnick, 2002) ."

The material addresses diet, exercise, medication and self-monitoring blood glucose, and gives a clear rationale for adopting a self-management approach to diabetes. The education sessions are conducted for 1 h/week and provided by nurse, diabetes educator, physician, dietician, pharmacist, social worker in hospital. Diabetics Club presented as an associated fellowship. The club members have one meeting per month when they share living experiences to control diabetes, request specific diabetes education and do some activities such as sport competition or a diabetes food cooking competition. The only aspect of the control group's care that differed from the intervention group was the absence of a motivational interview."

Paired t tests were used to measure the changes from baseline to 3 months follow-up with respective to each group. ANCOVAs or Johnson-Neyman methods were used to compare change differences between the intervention and control groups after the MI intervention. The Johnson-Neyman methods were conducted using the SPSS macro written by Andrew F. Hayes, Ohio State University.

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "The results of this study show that motivational interviewing can be an effective method of working with type 2 diabetes management, producing improvements in self-management, psychological outcomes and HbA1c control. This study provides evidence that motivational interview is feasible and can substantially improve health outcomes in HbA1c, and all aspects covered in the questionnaires except depression anxiety stress.\n\nA progressive reduction in HbA1c over the study period was seen in both groups, from 8.97% to 8.16% (a reduction of 0.80%) in the intervention group and from 8.53% to 8.48% (a reduction of 0.05%) in the control group. As with HbA1c the control group showed improvements from baseline that was similar but smaller than the intervention group. However, when the improvement was compared between intervention and control groups, a significant advantage to being in the intervention group was found. The decrease in the HbA1C from baseline was significant (p < 0.01) in the experiment group but not in the control group (p = 0.56).\n\nThe results confirmed a previous study that found motivational interviewing can improve glycemic control  (Calhoun et al., 2010)  and weight loss  (West et al., 2007) . This finding is also consistent with previous reports of the importance of HbA1c control in diabetes management: a 1.5% decrease in HbA1c has been estimated to lead to a 24-33% decrease in the 10-year incidence of proliferate retinopathy  (Krishnamurti and Steffes, 2001) . Participants in the intervention group achieved a 0.80% reduction in HbA1c levels. Therefore this result should achieve a significant reduction in clinical diabetes complication rates. This finding indicated important effects of motivational interviews regarding improved HbA1c levels and confirmed with previous study that the percentage point decrease in HbA1c (from 9% to 8%) showed a 40% reduction in the risk of complications  (UKPDS, 1998) .\n\nThe secondary outcome variables showed a response to the motivational interview when compared with baseline data. This included significantly increased self-management, self-efficacy and quality of life, accompanied by a decrease in the mean score of depression anxiety stress.\n\nThe results of this study show that motivational interviewing can be an effective method to improve diabetes self-management outcomes, self-efficacy outcomes and quality of life outcomes. Statistically significant results were found in diabetes self-management scores between the intervention and control groups. This finding was consistent with a previous study, which showed that a motivational interview increased engagement in pain selfmanagement behavior  (Habib et al., 2005) . The strategies of motivational interviewing can also increase active involvement in self-management and increase self-efficacy in managing diabetes. This positive finding was consistent with previous studies of ability for managing disease. Pung (2004)  reported that the motivational interview was associated with self-efficacy and reduced risk of eating disorders in fifty college women. It was concluded that motivational interviewing was a highly acceptable intervention for increasing self-efficacy to change their behaviors. Van Alphen (  2006 ) also found that motivational interviews could improve self-efficacy in order to decrease glycemic levels and increase an individual's ability to change health related behaviors. Outcome findings for the type 2 diabetes study confirmed Van Alphen's results.\n\nThe expected improvement in the quality of life could be explained by the participants' experience regarding complications. The current study found that participants did not report any severe complications or depression. The effect of the motivational interview may be even greater than direct evidence indicates, because the relationship between severe complications and depression appears to have a strong negative effect on quality of life  (Galper et al., 2003) . Perhaps in this study only a few participants suffered from severe diabetes complications such as lowerextremity pain or reduced functional status which could impair quality of life as an indirect effect of the motivational interview intervention. The results are consistent with a previous study, which found that people experiencing increase in the severity of complications or depressions report the greatest decrease in quality of life  (Goldney et al., 2004) .\n\nAlthough a previous study using a motivational interview intervention indicated that depression improvement positively effected glycemic control  (Lustman et al., 2007) , there was no significant difference in the current study. It is quite possible that the population studied was no longer distressed or depressed over their diabetes, having lived with it for some time. Conversely, perhaps the participants in this study were at an early stage in their disease or did not have severe complications.\n\nThe study reported here is the first randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing in type 2 diabetes using a large sample size. It extends the evidence and confirms the beneficial impact of motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewing strategies bridged the gap attitudinal gap between refusal to change and readiness for self-management. It also identified the benefits of motivational interviewing for successfully and positively motivating people with diabetes to change their behavior  (Clark et al., 2001) . This motivation intervention combined the benefits of appropriate selfmanagement of type 2 diabetes with cognitive, psychological, and behavioral outcomes. Thus, these findings provide strategies for better clinic practice in diabetes selfmanagement.\n\nFurther research is recommended to test the applicability of motivational interviewing interventions across a broad range of health behaviors with a variety of population groups, such as workplace populations, working-age groups, older persons, and groups with differing levels of health status. In this study it must be considered that MI can improve the people who had the higher levels of HbA1C but not the people who had the lower levels of HbA1c (nearly 7%). The findings from this research incorporating motivational interviewing strategies should be included in diabetes education development programs. The tailoring of motivational interviews to reflect the readiness for self-management of a person with a chronic illness will provide a sound foundation that can be used to guide health care providers in the implementation of strategies to encourage an individual to adopt stronger self-management behaviors.\n\nAlthough findings from this investigation supported the effects of a motivational interviewing intervention for facilitating diabetes self-management, limitations must be acknowledged. One limitation was its brevity with respect to time intervals for measurement. Follow up motivational interview outcomes were measured after 3 months followup. Although changes in HbA1c can be demonstrated after 3 months, a longitudinal design, with a least of 6 month follow-up should be employed in order to demonstrate the pattern of the intervention. Moreover, a difference of 0.76% HbA1c change between intervention and control group, but only fewer than half participants achieved ideal glycemic control hemoglobin of A1c < 7.0%. Further research, the time frame would give participants more time to implement strategies, and a stronger difference in HbA1c might have been found."
