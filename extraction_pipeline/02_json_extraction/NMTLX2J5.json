  "title": "eHealth-Based Psychosocial Interventions for Adults With Insomnia: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials",
  "abstract": "Background: Worldwide, insomnia remains a highly prevalent public health problem. eHealth presents a novel opportunity to deliver effective, accessible, and affordable insomnia treatments on a population-wide scale. However, there is no quantitative integration of evidence regarding the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions on insomnia. \n Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for insomnia and investigate the influence of specific study characteristics and intervention features on these effects. \n Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to February 16, 2021, for publications investigating eHealth-based psychosocial interventions targeting insomnia and updated the search of PubMed to December 6, 2021. We also screened gray literature for unpublished data. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions targeting adults with insomnia. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes were insomnia severity and sleep quality. Meta-analyses were performed by pooling the effects of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions on insomnia compared with inactive and in-person conditions. We performed subgroup analyses and metaregressions to explore specific factors that affected the effectiveness. Secondary outcomes included sleep diary parameters and mental health-related outcomes. Results: Of the 19,980 identified records, 37 randomized controlled trials (13,227 participants) were included. eHealth-based psychosocial interventions significantly reduced insomnia severity (Hedges g=-1.01, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.89; P<.001) and improved sleep quality (Hedges g=-0.58, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.41; P<.001) compared with inactive control conditions, with no evidence of publication bias. We found no significant difference compared with in-person treatment in alleviating insomnia severity (Hedges g=0.41, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.85; P=.06) and a significant advantage for in-person treatment in enhancing sleep quality (Hedges g=0.56, 95% CI 0.24-0.88; P<.001). eHealth-based psychosocial interventions had significantly larger effects (P=.01) on alleviating insomnia severity in clinical samples than in subclinical samples. eHealth-based psychosocial interventions that incorporated guidance from trained therapists had a significantly greater effect on insomnia severity (P=.05) and sleep quality (P=.02) than those with guidance from animated therapists or no guidance. Higher baseline insomnia severity and longer intervention duration were associated with a larger reduction in insomnia severity (P=.004). eHealth-based psychosocial interventions significantly improved each secondary outcome.",

      "text": "Insomnia is a common complaint in primary care and a prevalent public health problem  [1] . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, defines insomnia as dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep for 3 or more days per week for a minimum duration of 3 months, accompanied by considerable distress and functional impairments (eg, intellectual-, behavioral-, social-, occupational-, and mood-related impairment)  [2] . Approximately 25% of adults experience unsatisfactory sleep, and approximately 6% to 10% of adults meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia  [1] . In low-income settings in Africa and Asia, the prevalence of sleep problems can reach up to 40%  [3] . Insomnia is often persistent and debilitating, increasing the risk of other physical or mental illnesses or exacerbating existing medical or psychiatric disorders  [4, 5] . Thus, insomnia carries a heavy individual and societal burden, including the burden on the health care system, which hinders societal development and leads to socioeconomic losses  [6, 7] .\n\nAlthough a range of pharmacologic treatments and psychosocial therapies exist for insomnia, the treatment of insomnia remains a major challenge  [8] . Previous research has demonstrated that benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists have a short-term efficacy on insomnia, whereas long-term use is usually associated with potential side effects, including memory dysfunction, somatic symptoms, drug dependence, and interactions  [9] . Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia is effective with long-lasting effects when compared with medications, and is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia  [10] . However, because of the limited number of trained therapists, high costs, and time-intensive nature of in-person CBT for insomnia (CBT-I), millions of patients still do not have access to this effective treatment to improve their sleep outcomes  [11] . Hence, there is an urgent need for inexpensive, innovative delivery modalities of CBT or novel treatment options to be effective and accessible for the larger population at a lower cost  [12, 13] .\n\neHealth is increasingly being developed and implemented for the delivery of remote, timely, high-quality, and limited-contact care  [14] . eHealth can be defined as \"health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies\"  [15] . In a broader sense, it can encompass a range of services or systems that facilitate health care practice through the use of information and communication technologies, including electronic health records, e-prescriptions, digital interventions, telemedicine, and mobile health  [16] . Furthermore, eHealth is increasingly being applied to the prevention and treatment of several mental illnesses, including but not limited to smoking cessation, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation  [17] [18] [19] [20] . In these eHealth programs, information about illness, treatment, self-management strategies, health status tracking, support, and feedback are delivered via the internet and related technologies  [21] [22] [23] [24] . Their results consistently show eHealth to have high accessibility, interactivity, and effectiveness with limited cost. In addition, a meta-analysis revealed the effects of internet-delivered CBT to be equivalent to those of face-to-face CBT for psychiatric and somatic disorders  [25] .\n\nOver the past decade, a number of telemedicine interventions, smartphone apps, and websites have been created to help users develop good sleep habits and improve sleep quality through sleep monitoring, sleep hygiene, CBT-I, or mindfulness meditation  [26] [27] [28] [29] . Systematic reviews suggest that internet-based CBT-I has medium to large effects on sleep outcomes among youth and adults  [30, 31] . Meta-analyses indicate that digitally delivered CBT and telemedicine-based CBT are noninferior to face-to-face CBT  [32, 33] ; however, only a small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly comparing 2 treatments were available to be included to pool the effects (n=4 and n=2). A recent systematic review of mobile phone sleep interventions demonstrated the effectiveness of mobile health technologies for improving sleep  [34] . However, these reviews covered a single psychosocial intervention (eg, CBT-I) or particular eHealth modality (eg, mobile devices). We found no systematic review or meta-analysis summarizing and comparing the effects of multiple eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for insomnia. In addition, more novel trials with robust study designs and large sample sizes have been published in the past 5 years that were not included in the previous reviews  [12, 13, 26, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Hence, an updated systematic review is warranted to examine the effectiveness of eHealth as a treatment for adults with insomnia."

      "text": "Data were extracted in duplicate (WD and JW) using systematic extraction forms. We recorded the following information: study design, study sample (age, sex, sample size, diagnostic information, and relevant inclusion criteria), intervention (name, type, delivery mode, duration, functionality, and features of the eHealth-based psychosocial interventions), comparison conditions, and study outcomes. The delivery mode of the eHealth-based psychosocial interventions was classified as phone-delivered (eg, phone calls, apps, or SMS text messages on a smartphone or telephone), computer-assisted (eg, using a\n\ncomputer to log into a website, dashboard, or video chat room), or mixed mode (eg, an intervention delivered using both computer-assisted and phone-delivered components or an intervention that only stated the use of the internet or website). We also classified the functions of eHealth as informing, instructing, displaying, guiding, reminding, and communicating  [42] . For studies with overlapping data sets, we used the most recent study with relevant outcome measure data. If the data were abstracted or unclear, we contacted the corresponding author by email for clarification. If the author did not respond after 2 contact attempts, we excluded the study. Disagreements between reviewers regarding data abstraction were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Interrater reliability between the 2 reviewers, assessed using the Cohen \u03ba, indicated acceptable agreement (Cohen \u03ba=0.86)  [43] .\n\nA random-effects model was used in the meta-analysis, which allows for subtle differences across studies because of variability in sampling or treatment  [44] . The Hedges g was used to estimate the effect size by pooling the mean difference of the continuous measures between the intervention and the control condition, which is the unbiased standard mean difference  [45, 46] . For multi-arm studies including 2 eHealth-based psychosocial interventions, we included each pairwise comparison separately by evenly dividing the shared control condition among the comparisons  [47] . For studies comparing an eHealth-based psychosocial intervention with both in-person and inactive control conditions, corresponding comparisons were used in the meta-analyses for the different conditions. We presented pooled results using forest plots. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated using the Cochran Q and I 2 statistics. Heterogeneity was interpreted according to the following thresholds: low (0%-40%), moderate (30%-60%), substantial (50%-90%), and considerable (75%-100%).\n\nThe primary outcomes were improvement in insomnia severity and sleep quality as frequently measured using the Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Preplanned analyses of inactive and in-person comparison conditions on 2 primary outcomes were performed separately to examine whether eHealth-based psychosocial interventions were more effective than inactive controls and calculate the difference between eHealth-based psychosocial interventions and in-person controls. In addition, we conducted exploratory subgroup analyses and metaregression analyses on only those studies that compared eHealth-based psychosocial interventions with inactive controls. We did this to examine whether population or eHealth intervention aspects may affect the effectiveness of the interventions on insomnia symptom change and to exclude sources likely to be highly heterogeneous.\n\nThe following study characteristics and intervention features were assessed: population (clinically diagnosed insomnia or subclinical insomnia), eHealth delivery mode (phone-delivered, computer-assisted, or mixed mode), therapeutic approach (eHealth-based CBT [eCBT] or non-CBT), guidance modality (guided by a trained therapist, guided by an animated therapist, or no guidance), tailored feedback provided (yes or no), reminder or encouragement provided (yes or no), baseline insomnia severity, sleep medication, intervention duration (in weeks and sessions), number of intervention components, and number of eHealth functions. The secondary outcomes of interest were changes in sleep parameters derived from sleep diaries and improvements in mental health-related outcomes, including sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), number of nocturnal awakenings (NWAK), sleep efficiency, maladaptive beliefs about sleep, fatigue, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and quality of life. Outcomes reported in \u22652 studies were pooled separately.\n\nWe conducted influence analysis on all studies via the \"leave-one-study-out meta-analysis\" method recalculating the pooled effect sizes after removing each study to detect potential outliers  [48] . Publication bias was examined graphically using funnel plots. The degree of asymmetry was tested using the Egger regression test of the intercept with a 1-tailed significance level of \u03b1=.05 applied to the primary and secondary outcome analyses  [49] . Furthermore, the trim-and-fill analysis by Duval and Tweedie  [50]  was applied to adjust the effect size for missing studies. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (version 14.1; StataCorp)  [51] ."

Studies with a high risk of bias in at least one domain were rated as having a high overall risk of bias.

The sample sizes ranged from 22 to 3755 (total sample size=13,227). The total sex distribution was skewed toward female participants (9442/13,227, 71%) and male participants (3785/13,227, 29%). The average age of the participants ranged from 24.6 to 58.6 years, with a mean of 46.3 (SD 5.6) years. Approximately half (20/37, 54%) of the studies included participants with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia, with the remainder (17/37, 46%) including people with self-reported insomnia symptoms. A total of 3% (1/37) of the studies only included female participants as they examined peri-or postmenopausal insomnia  [69] , with another study including only male participants with insomnia and depression symptoms  [61] . Of the included studies, 86% (32/37) provided eHealth-based CBT-I as the intervention arm. Other studies (5/37, 14%) used eHealth-based problem-solving treatment  [53] , behavioral therapy  [13, 36, 65] , cognitive therapy  [36] , key behavior change techniques  [35] , and self-help acceptance and commitment therapy  [71] . In total, 3 studies focused on blended interventions, 1 combining adjunctive in-person treatment for depression  [61]  and the other 2 conducting the first session at the office  [69, 70] . In total, 11% (4/37) of the studies compared eCBT with face-to-face CBT  [26, 55, 67, 70] , with the rest reporting comparisons with inactive controls.\n\nThe delivery mode of the eHealth interventions ranged from mixed-mode interventions (20/37, 54%) to computer-assisted interventions (13/37, 35%) and phone-delivered interventions (5/37, 14%). Sleep Healthy Using the Internet  [82]  and Sleepio  ([83] ; Big Health Ltd) were frequently used eHealth programs, each appearing in 16% (6/37) of the studies. i-Sleep  [84]  was also used quite frequently. Regarding the guidance modality, 46% (17/37) of the included studies reported that the eHealth intervention was instructed by a trained human therapist, for example, under the guidance of an expert clinician or trained coach in vivo. A total of 19% (7/37) of the studies reported that the participants were guided by an animated therapist, with the remainder (15/37, 41%) reporting no guidance. Regarding feedback, the eHealth interventions in 86% (32/37) of the studies provided tailored feedback, including feedback on the web using real-time user data such as personal summary statistics, progress scores, or automated individual advice. In contrast, a small proportion of the studies (7/37, 19%) did not provide tailored feedback. Notably, there were 5% (2/37) of the studies comprising 2 separate eHealth intervention arms, one with tailored feedback and the other without tailored feedback  [13, 59] ; both concluded that tailored feedback could enhance the efficacy. In addition, most of the eHealth interventions in the included studies (34/37, 92%) reminded or encouraged participants to stay involved via email, SMS text message, or phone call, whereas only a minority (5/37, 14%) did not mention the use of any reminder or encouragement; 5% (2/37) of the studies included 2 eHealth arms, where only 1 arm set reminders  [13, 59]  (see Table  2  for the intervention characteristics). The duration of the interventions ranged from 2 to 12 weeks, with a mean of 7.05 (SD 2.24) weeks, and the average number of treatment sessions was 6.2 (SD 1.0) ranging from 2 to 8 sessions, with durations of 20 to 60 minutes per session. Questionnaires and sleep diaries were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the eHealth interventions in improving insomnia symptoms, sleep status, or mental health. Detailed information on the outcome indicators and assessments can be found in Table  3 . On average, the percentage of participants in the eHealth intervention groups that completed the postintervention assessment was 74.6% (SD 18.8%). The follow-up duration ranged from 3 weeks to 12 months, with a mean of 5.6 (SD 3.1) months.

There was a significant difference between populations (Q=6.83; P=.01). With regard to sleep quality, eHealth interventions had a significant effect on clinical patients (Hedges g=-0.68, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.42; P<.001; I 2 =76%) and subclinical samples (Hedges g=-0.49, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.28; P<.001; I 2 =60%); however, there was no statistically significant between-subgroup difference (Q=1.24; P=.27). Exploratory subgroup analyses pivoting on intervention features showed that \"guidance by trained therapists\" and \"tailored feedback\" were moderators that caused significant differences in effects. Specifically, eHealth-based psychosocial interventions providing \"guidance by trained therapists\" were more effective in reducing insomnia severity (Hedges g=-1.19, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.92; P<.001; I 2 =82%) than those guided by animated therapists (Hedges g=-0.96, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.78; P<.001; I 2 =75%) and those without guidance (Hedges g=-0.83, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.70; P<.001; I 2 =49%). The difference between the subgroups was approximately significant (Q=6.05; P=.05). Regarding sleep quality, eHealth interventions that provided user guidance by trained therapists had greater absolute effect sizes (Hedges g=-0.75, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.50; P<.001; I 2 =75%) than those that used animated therapists to guide participants (Hedges g=-0.50, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.24; P<.001; I 2 =0) and those without any guidance (Hedges g=-0.33, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.18; P<.001; I 2 =0). The difference between subgroups was significant (Q=8.10; P=.02). In addition, eHealth interventions providing \"tailored feedback\" were more effective in reducing insomnia severity (Hedges g=-1.05, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.93; P<.001; I 2 =79%) than those without tailored feedback (Hedges g=-0.76, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.47; P<.001; I 2 =60%). The difference between the subgroups was the marginal significance level (Q=3.27; P=.07). However, there were no statistically significant associations between therapeutic approach, eHealth delivery mode, or provision of reminders and effect sizes.\n\nThe results of the metaregression analyses are presented in Table  5 . The baseline insomnia severity and intervention duration (in weeks and sessions) had moderating effects on the study effects on insomnia severity. Higher baseline insomnia severity was associated with larger effect sizes (b=-0.11; P=.004.

      "text": "Higher baseline insomnia severity and longer intervention duration were associated with a larger reduction in insomnia severity.\n\n\u2022 With respect to secondary outcomes, eHealth interventions for insomnia had significantly small to moderate positive effects (Hedges g=-0.21 to -0.56) on sleep parameters and mental health-related outcomes. Comparison With Prior Work Our main findings suggest that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions had a positive effect on the management of insomnia symptoms. Similar results were reported in an earlier meta-analysis published in 2016, which included 11 RCTs of digital CBT-I in the adult population (effect sizes: -0.89 and -0.49) [31]. A recent meta-analysis of digital CBT-I in adolescents or college students combined the effect sizes of 4 RCTs and reported slightly larger effects on sleep quality (-0.58) [85]. These results suggest that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions are a promising solution for managing insomnia. eHealth-based psychosocial interventions had substantially larger effects on improving insomnia severity and sleep quality than inactive controls. However, we found no significant difference between eCBT and in-person CBT in improving insomnia severity despite a significant difference in enhanced sleep quality. All 11% (4/37) of the studies with an in-person comparison group concluded that eCBT offered a potentially cost-effective alternative with low-cost labor, with approximately 38% of the time investment associated with face-to-face treatment [26,55,67,78]. Intensive therapist support, high concentration of attention, prompt feedback, and substantial time commitment in face-to-face treatment may explain the differential effects in trials [26,67]. Our findings support the notion that eHealth-based treatments could be a potentially cost-effective alternative to in-person treatment. This finding is in line with previous research showing that digital CBT-I has similar efficacy to face-to-face CBT [32,86]. However, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions from only 4 original trials. Additional noninferiority trials comparing eHealth-based psychosocial interventions with in-person treatment for insomnia are warranted, and the specific psychotherapy elements used should be dissected, quantified, and evaluated in future studies [31,87].\n\nIn addition, our review showed a larger improvement in insomnia severity in the clinical samples and samples with higher baseline insomnia severity. Possible explanations for this include clinical samples with more severe insomnia symptoms having more space for improvement. In addition, user requirements and motivation may influence attention engagement and, thus, treatment effectiveness. The observed effects suggest that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for insomnia could be applicable to a broad range of populations and are well suited to be integrated into a stepped-care approach  [88, 89] .\n\nWith regard to eHealth intervention features, our results imply that professional guidance and tailored feedback are associated with greater effect sizes. Thus, this could be crucial in facilitating the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions as the involvement of trained therapist support and individualized advice seem to promote effectiveness. This further supports the view that blended interventions integrating therapeutic support in face-to-face treatment with the cost-effectiveness of eHealth could be a way to increase treatment effectiveness while saving time and reducing costs  [90] . Contrary to expectations, eCBT and other psychosocial interventions were found to be roughly equivalent in effectiveness, although caution is needed as only 4 non-CBT eHealth studies were included in this review. Alternative therapeutic techniques such as acceptance and commitment therapy, problem-solving therapy, psychodynamic therapy, mindfulness therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy are also worth exploring in conjunction with eHealth to promote sleep and well-being. Considering the structured nature of CBT, it might not be beneficial for people with complex needs, and it fails to address deeper causes or the possible underlying causes of mental illness, such as childhood experience, family history, or relations  [91] . In addition, the typical treatment period for CBT is 6 to 20 weeks, which, to some extent, requires people to adhere to a long period. Indeed, a more thorough investigation of the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques implemented in eHealth for the treatment of insomnia is necessary. Furthermore, a longer intervention duration was found to be associated with a larger reduction in insomnia severity; similar results were reported in a previous meta-analysis on CBT-I  [31] . Finally, no significant effects on insomnia were found for moderators such as delivery mode, reminder settings, sleep medication use, number of intervention components, and eHealth functions. Additional studies are needed to determine optimal intervention characteristics, including the number of treatment sessions and intervention components.\n\nWe further found that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions effectively improved sleep efficiency and TST and reduced SOL, WASO, and NWAK. These findings are in line with those of previous studies  [31, 86] . There is also evidence supporting a mixed effect on mental health-related outcomes, adjusting people's maladaptive beliefs about sleep and alleviating fatigue, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Thus, eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for insomnia could promote mental health and prevent the exacerbation of comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of eHealth interventions for cancer survivors on improving sleep and reducing fear of recurrence, depression, and anxiety  [92, 93] . These low-cost and convenient insomnia treatments can be widely disseminated, along with support for eHealth-illiterate populations, among people with mental or physical disorders accompanied by insomnia  [94] .\n\nThis meta-analysis focused on a wide range of sleep and mental health outcome measures to assess the impact of the intervention in a holistic manner. Our findings highlight several directions for future research. Given the importance of user engagement and therapist support for treatment effectiveness and adherence, future research could pay more attention to increasing user engagement and interaction in the design of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for insomnia. This could be achieved by developing blended, appealing, and adaptive interventions as well as making eHealth interventions accessible to those with a lower eHealth literacy  [22] . Furthermore, research is needed to directly compare eHealth-based psychosocial interventions in different delivery modes in noninferiority trials while assessing the cost-effectiveness, treatment credibility, satisfaction, and therapeutic alliance. This would help tremendously in the optimization of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions. In addition, given that most trials to date have been implemented in high-income countries with little cultural diversity, eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for insomnia should also be investigated in more low-and middle-income countries to increase the accessibility of eHealth."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Some limitations should be noted. First, this review only focused on adults with insomnia; further research is needed to evaluate the effects of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions in specific populations, including children, adolescents or employees of specific sectors. Second, although the random-effects model aimed to account for between-study heterogeneity statistically, our analyses still indicated significant between-study differences. Variability in the control condition was particularly identified as a source of heterogeneity. However, the heterogeneity in this study might be multivariate, which may be caused by different outcome measures or confounding bias. As not all studies used the same outcomes, the pooled effects for insomnia severity and sleep quality and the secondary outcomes were based on different numbers of studies and, to some extent, using different outcomes. The difference in outcome measures might more or less influence the treatment effects. Third, our meta-analyses focused on the immediate intervention effects. Owing to a certain level of dropout, few studies assessed insomnia symptoms for >6 months, and the included studies set different follow-up times.\n\nFuture studies could include long-term follow-ups at standardized lags to observe the prolonged effects on sleep. Fourth, this review depicted participants' completion of various questionnaires and assessments. However, because of the limited number of studies that reported the same outcome measure on treatment adherence, we failed to summarize how participants implemented treatment recommendations and how therapists followed treatment protocols, which are important factors in treatment adherence  [95] . The impact of treatment adherence on eHealth-based psychosocial interventions is worth investigating, and future RCTs should use standardized methods to comprehensively assess treatment adherence and its relationship with treatment effects."

Our findings suggest that, as a less costly intervention, eHealth-based psychosocial interventions should be disseminated widely and integrated into a stepped-care model. Professional guidance and tailored feedback should accompany eHealth interventions to improve effectiveness. Blended care integrating face-to-face care with eHealth may further improve effectiveness and benefit a more diverse population with insomnia complaints. Further investigations of intervention components and blended interventions are needed to better understand the effectiveness of different intervention components, especially as pertaining to people of low socioeconomic status or low eHealth literacy."
