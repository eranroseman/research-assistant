      "text": "n 1993, the US Public Health Service convened a panel of 13 nongovernment scientists and scholars with expertise in economics, clinical medicine, ethics, and statistics to review the state of cost-effectiveness analysis and to develop recommendations for its conduct and use in health and medicine (a glossary of terms appears in the Box).  1  The primary goals were to improve the quality of cost-effectiveness analyses and promote comparability across studies.\n\nIn 1996, the original Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine published its findings in a series of articles in JAMA,  [2] [3] [4]  and in a book.  1  The panel emphasized that the growing field of costeffectiveness analysis provided an opportunity to rationalize health policy if the technique and its application were well understood and implemented.\n\nDuring the 20 years since the release of the panel's report, the number of published cost-effectiveness analyses has increased substantially. Moreover, the field has advanced in many ways such as by strengthening its theoretical foundations; improving methods for evidence synthesis, modeling, and uncertainty analysis; considering more closely the ethical issues surrounding the use of cost-effectiveness analysis; and standardizing requirements for the reporting of results. During the same period, health care also has experienced substantial changes in terms of its use of technological advances and the organization, financing, cost, and delivery of care. New uses of cost-effectiveness analysis have also emerged in the United States and abroad. Examples from the United States include the use of cost-effectiveness analysis by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, which establishes national immunization policy recommendations on behalf of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  5  A prominent example in the United Kingdom is the use of cost-effectiveness analysis by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, which is a nondepartmental public body created in 1999 that serves England and Wales.  6 he need to deliver health care efficiently and the importance of using analytic techniques to understand the clinical and economic consequences of strategies to improve health have only increased. Health care spending in the United States comprised 13% of gross domestic product in 1995; in 2014, it approached 18%.  7 For these reasons, an update of the original panel's efforts is important."

This leadership group convened a new panel during the fall 2012 and developed a process for updating the original report.\n\nThe 13 individuals invited to join the Second Panel were invited by the leadership group (after consultation with members of the first panel and other advisors) and selected on the basis of their experience in the field to provide broad expertise in the design, conduct, and use of cost-effectiveness analyses. Three international members (D.F., M.K, and M.J.S.) reflected the per-spectives and experiences of other countries that have used costeffectiveness analysis. The group met as a full panel through regular teleconferences beginning in early 2013 and held 5 in-person meetings over the next few years to update the recommendations.\n\nThe Second Panel has updated and expanded the recommendations of the original panel in numerous ways.

For new topic areas (decision modeling, evidence synthesis, ethics), panel members drafted recommendations de novo. Throughout the process, draft recommendations were circulated first among chapter authors and then more broadly among the panel as a whole for email, teleconference, and in-person discussion and consensus. If consensus was not possible, the plan was for the panel to vote, with an 80% majority required to pass and with the option for a minority report. Consensus was reached relatively easily on most recommendations. Two exceptions were recommendations about perspectives for the reference case (whether to recommend 1, 2, or more perspectives and how to define them) and on productivity (whether to include it in the numerator or denominator of the incremental costeffectiveness ratio). After further discussion, consensus was reached on these and all other issues without the need for a formal vote and without any minority reports.\n\nThe Second Panel benefited from the active participation of some members of the original panel, and from review of its work by experts in the field through both an external review process and a public comment period (participants of this process are listed in the additional contributions section at the end of the article).\n\nThe objectives were to review the state of the field and provide recommendations to improve the quality and promote the comparability of cost-effectiveness analyses. The intended audiences are, in addition to students and researchers, government policy makers, public health officials, health care administrators, payers, businesses, clinicians, patients, and consumers.\n\nThe landscape and the set of challenges to cost-effectiveness analysis have changed since 1996. Cost-effectiveness analysis is no longer a nascent approach, and variation in published studies cannot be ascribed to the newness of its concepts or methods. Compared with the original panel, the Second Panel had the advantage of drawing on 2 decades of methodological and policy advances. However, the Second Panel also had the challenge of sifting through and trying to make sense of the diverse and sometimes contrasting opinions about and experiences with costeffectiveness analysis."

      "title": "Key Recommendations",
      "text": "Overview Cost-effectiveness analysis can help inform decisions about how to apply new or existing tests, therapies, and preventive and public health interventions so that they represent a judicious use of resources. It also can help to fill gaps in the evidence about the estimated population-level public health effect of such interventions, and can support decisions to disinvest in older interventions for which there are more cost-effective alternatives. Cost-effectiveness analysis provides a framework for comparing the relative value of different interventions, along with information that can help decision makers sort through alternatives and decide which ones best serve their programmatic and financial needs.\n\nThe full set of recommendations are included in the eAppendix in the Supplement. The complete report will be published in book form in October 2016.  8 This Special Communication summarizes key recommendations regarding the reference case and study perspectives, as well as other important aspects of the report."

      "title": "Reference Cases",
      "text": "The original panel recommended a reference case, which is a set of standard methodological practices that all cost-effectiveness analyses should follow to improve comparability and quality.  1  It further recommended that reference case analyses take a societal perspective to reflect the perspective of a decision maker whose intention is to make decisions about the broad allocation of resources across the entire population. In a cost-effectiveness analysis conducted from a societal perspective, the analyst considers all parties affected by the intervention and counts all significant outcomes and costs that flow from it, regardless of who experiences the outcomes or bears the costs. The original panel also noted that, to address specific decision contexts, analysts might also include narrower perspectives, such as that of the health care sector, to reflect the view of a decision maker whose responsibility rests only within that sector. The Second Panel endorses the reference case concept for the purposes originally intended, namely to improve the quality of cost-effectiveness analyses and promote comparability across studies."

      "title": "Societal Perspective: Experience Since the Original Panel",
      "text": "Since publication of the original panel's recommendations in 1996, there has been a substantial increase in the number of published cost-effectiveness analyses, and many have not used a societal perspective as defined by the original panel.  [9] [10] 0] [11] [12]  One study found, for example, that only 341 (29%) of 1163 cost per quality-adjusted lifeyear (QALY) analyses published through 2005 adopted a societal perspective.  11 Even when analysts have stated that they have used a societal perspective, they have often omitted potentially important elements, such as costs related to patient and caregiver time, or to transportation or non-health care sectors (eg, education), so that the perspective of the analysis is essentially a narrower one.  11, [13] [14] 4] [15]  Moreover, since 1996, decision-making bodies primarily in Europe, Australia, and Canada have formally incorporated costeffectiveness analysis into health technology assessment processes to inform coverage and reimbursement decisions, but generally have not adopted a societal perspective, preferring instead a more focused health system perspective. Others have highlighted the theoretical challenges associated with aggregating the costs and effects that fall on different sectors and individuals in a way that reflects a consensus position on social welfare.  16, 17 nel's Reference Case Recommendations\n\nThe following recommendations are important to promote quality and comparability, while also recognizing (1) the different preferences, types of interventions, needs, and authorities of decision makers, (2) the importance of preserving flexibility for analysts in accommodating those factors, and (3) the value that stems from illustrating the consequences of decisions from different viewpoints."

In addition, the health care sector perspective should include formal health care sector (medical) costs reimbursed by third-party payers or paid out-of-pocket by patients. Both types of medical costs include current and future costs both related and unrelated to the condition under consideration."

      "title": "Recommendation 3: Societal Reference Case",
      "text": "Recommendation 3A: Inclusion of an Impact Inventory | Evaluation of the broader effects of interventions designed to improve health is strongly recommended. The societal reference case analysis should include medical costs (current and future, related and unrelated) borne by third-party payers and paid out-of-pocket by patients, time costs of patients in seeking and receiving care, time costs of informal (unpaid) caregivers, transportation costs, effects on future productivity and consumption, and other costs and effects outside the health care sector. To make this evaluation more explicit and transparent, inclusion of an \"impact inventory\" that lists the health and nonhealth effects of an intervention should be considered in a societal reference case analysis (described in more detail below and in the Figure  1 ). The main purpose of the impact inventory is to ensure that all consequences, including those outside the formal health care sector, are considered regularly and comprehensively, which has generally not been the case to date.  1.

However, there are no widely agreed on methods for quantifying and valuing some of these broader effects in costeffectiveness analyses. Analysts should present the items listed in the impact inventory in the form of disaggregated consequences across different sectors. It is also recommended that analysts use 1 or more summary measures, such as an incremental costeffectiveness ratio, net monetary benefit, or net health benefit, that include some or all of the items listed in the impact inventory. Analysts should clearly identify which items are included and how they are measured and valued, and provide a rationale for their methodological decisions. Recommendation 4B: Presenting Other Perspectives | When specific decision makers have been identified, such as a particular public or private payer, analysts may want to present results from that decision maker's perspective in addition to the 2 reference case perspectives. In these cases, analysts should indicate who the primary decision makers were whose deliberations are intended to be informed by the analysis."

      "title": "Other Recommendations Regarding the Design and Conduct of Cost-effectiveness Analyses",
      "text": "It is important to focus on relevant research questions, maintain the focus as the study progresses, and avoid analytic pitfalls. A written protocol at the outset of an analysis that details key aspects of the design and conduct of the cost-effectiveness analysis is recommended (eg, the study objective; the intervention, comparators, and populations under consideration; the time horizon; sources of data; a list of key assumptions).\n\nIn terms of valuing health outcomes, the Second Panel (in agreement with the original panel) recommends that (1) the reference case cost-effectiveness analyses should measure health effects in terms of QALYs (including QALYs accruing to patients and to any other affected parties such as caregivers); (2) quality weights should be preference based and interval scaled; and (3) community preferences for health states are the most appropriate source of preferences for reference case analyses. The use of generic preference-based measures is recommended to enhance comparability across studies, but it is emphasized that the instrument used should be fit for purpose in the sense that its measurement properties are adequate to measure the differences and changes in health across the interventions under consideration. Although generic preference-based measures should be used for the reference case analyses, analysts may also want to present estimates based on scores obtained from patients or from other sources.\n\nIn a departure from the original panel, the Second Panel observes that, in general, effects on productivity are unlikely to have been captured by most preference-based measures, and that evidence is not definitive that the effects of morbidity on leisure are necessarily reflected in the utility scores or quality-of-life weights.  [19] [20] ] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]  Therefore, it is recommended that the productivity consequences related to changes in health status be reflected in the numerator of cost-effectiveness ratios for reference case analyses conducted under the societal perspective, while recognizing the possibility that the uncertainty about how productivity and the effects of morbidity on leisure activities are captured in preference-based measures could lead to double counting. Research recommendations are made to develop improved quality-of-life weights that would avoid such double counting.\n\nIn terms of estimating costs for cost-effectiveness analyses, a key departure from the original panel is the consideration of cost categories from the 2 reference case perspectives. It is now recommended that some components (eg, current and future medical costs and patients' out-of-pocket costs) should be included in both perspectives, while others (eg, time costs for patients and caregivers, transportation costs, productivity benefits, consumption costs, and other non-health-care sector costs) should be included only in the societal reference case perspective (Table  1 ). The new recommendations also suggest inclusion of future costs (ie, that costeffectiveness analyses account for related or unrelated health care costs that occur during the additional life-years produced by an intervention). The original panel discussed this issue but did not reach consensus (noting that analysts could use their discretion) due to the lack of a developed theoretical basis for including future costs at the time of its report.  [26] [27] ] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]  It is important to interpret, adjust, and synthesize evidence in a cost-effectiveness analysis, drawing on recent guidance regarding systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Among the recommendations, analysts should (1) provide a qualitative description and critique of the evidence base, (2) be explicit about whether and how bias in each study and across studies in the evidence was handled, (3) produce bias-corrected estimates, and (4) be explicit about whether and how estimates were adjusted for transferability.\n\nCosts and health effects should be discounted at the same rate in cost-effectiveness analyses. Furthermore, given available data on real economic growth and corresponding estimates of the real consumption rate of interest and to promote comparability across studies, 3% is the most appropriate real discount rate for costeffectiveness analyses. However, the panel recommends conducting sensitivity analyses that allow for a reasonable range of rates, along with more research on the topic of using different discount rates for costs and health effects in cost-effectiveness analyses."

      "text": "As noted, the new reference case recommendations mean reporting of results from both the health care sector perspective and the societal perspective. Analysts should clearly delineate the results from the 2 reference case perspectives and identify differences using the impact inventory (Figure  1 ). Analysts should consider the decision context when determining if one reference case perspective is to be presented in greater detail than the other. The discussion section of the journal article should address qualitative and quantitative differences between the 2 reference case perspectives. It is important to highlight the components of the impact inventory most affected by the condition or those that differ between the 2 perspectives.\n\nFor interventions that have substantial effects beyond the formal health care sector, such as those that address public health programs or children's health, it is important to highlight differences between the health care sector and societal perspectives. If a sector or consequence within a sector is identified but excluded from a costeffectiveness analysis, analysts should provide a brief rationale in the accompanying text or in the \"Notes on Sources of Evidence\" section of the impact inventory. The impact inventory should be completed and reported for all analyses, even those restricted to the health care sector to highlight any effects or costs not fully addressed.\n\nFor all analyses, the impact inventory should identify the sectors affected and list the specific types of impacts within each sector. If the results in the societal reference case differ substantially from those in the health care sector reference case, all identified effects should ideally be quantified, valued if possible, and reported in the results section. Items in categories not estimated quantitatively should be named in the impact inventory and addressed in the discussion section, the technical appendix, or both. Analysts should initially consider the elements of the impact inventory as part of the design exercise for an analysis and then include the completed impact inventory in the journal article (or in the technical appendix if space limitations preclude inclusion in the journal report)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The goal of the Second Panel was to promote the continued evolution of cost-effectiveness analysis and its use to support judicious, efficient, and fair decisions regarding the use of health care resources. Comparability across cost-effectiveness analyses is highly desirable if the technique is to help decision makers evaluate tradeoffs. Inclusion of standardized components, and standardization of methods within a perspective, is intended to enhance consistency and comparability across studies.\n\nDifferentiating between the health care sector perspective and the societal perspective will provide more clarity to consumers of cost-effectiveness analyses than has been the case in recent years. The common practice of presenting an analysis from the health care sector perspective and labeling it a societal perspective has created the impression that these 2 perspectives are the same when they are not. Clarity about perspective is further emphasized by the recommendations that analysts should identify any specific decision maker whose decisions are intended to be influenced by the analysis, and conduct additional analyses from perspectives specific to that decision maker if those analyses will provide useful information. Many challenges remain, such as valuation of effects outside the health care sector and coordination with other methods already used to evaluate those effects, such as cost-benefit analysis. Addressing these challenges will continue to provide opportunities to advance the field of cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\nThese reporting recommendations highlight the reference case perspectives and delineation of the impact inventory. A review of existing reporting recommendations was conducted and included a discussion of the possible adoption of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS)  38  for endorsement (one of the panel members and one of the leadership group were involved with the Delphi process for the CHEERS guidelines). However, specific reporting requirements for the reference case precluded the direct adoption of CHEERS or other available reporting guidelines. The recommendations from the Second Panel share many elements with the CHEERS recommendations, which, in turn, reflect elements of the original panel's recommendations.\n\nSubstantial attention has been focused on ethical issues in costeffectiveness analyses, reflecting the importance of the topic and developments in the field. Consideration of the opportunity cost of an intervention is ethically justified. Without such consideration, decision makers would not know if there were better uses of the resources at hand. These recommendations also reaffirm the principles that cost-effectiveness analysis is not by itself a sufficient decision-making standard and that it does not capture all relevant concerns. Maximizing the total quantity of health benefits will rarely be the only concern for decision makers. Who receives the benefitsthe distributive concern-also matters. Such decisions involve tradeoffs between effects and costs for some patients vs different effects and costs for other patients.\n\nThe use of QALYs in cost-effectiveness analysis raises possible ethical and other concerns. A key advantage of QALYs is that they reflect effects on both morbidity and mortality and provide a basis for broad comparisons of the health effects of various interventions and policies. But there are a number of disadvantages associated with the QALY framework. For instance, QALYs may not accurately reflect the burden of short-lived but intense experiences. Thus the benefits of interventions that reduce the incidence of such Target population Identify the age ranges, clinical characteristics, and other characteristics for all subgroups evaluated in the analysis."

      "text": "Summarize the key clinical or policy conclusions.\n\nexperiences may be undervalued. Furthermore, in the standard approach to estimating QALYs, the QALYs gained due to an intervention that generates marginal gains for many people may be approximately equal to the QALYs gained by an intervention that generates substantial gains for a small number of people, yet society may favor the latter. Similarly, some have argued that treating those who initially experience highly impaired health is more valuable than treating those with good baseline health. These and other issues are explored further in the forthcoming book. Numerous policy questions related to the use of cost-effectiveness analysis were considered. Even though cost-effectiveness analyses have been published widely in the United States, and have been used to inform policy in selected areas, the application of cost-effectiveness analysis has also encountered resistance. For example, the Medicare program is barred from considering costeffectiveness analysis in its decisions about whether to pay for new therapies and diagnostics. Notably, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  39  prohibited the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute from developing or using a dollars-per-QALY metric as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost-effective or recommended, and stated that the \"Secretary shall not utilize such an adjusted life year (or such a similar measure) as a threshold to determine coverage, reimbursement, or incentive programs\u2026.\"\n\nReasons for the resistance to cost-effectiveness analysis are likely multifaceted and complex but suggest an inclination on the part of many individuals in the United States to minimize the underlying problem of resource scarcity and the consequent need to explicitly ration care. Experience shows that when policy makers have incorporated cost-effectiveness analysis into decision-making processes, they have not applied it as the sole decision criterion.  40, 41 n practice, multiple factors are brought to bear on resource allocation decisions. Cost-effectiveness is only 1 element among many, including patient's expectations; legal, ethical, equity, cultural, and political concerns; and pragmatic issues of logistics and feasibility. Most health organizations involved in resource allocation decisions give the greatest weight and deepest consideration to the clinical evidence. Cost-effectiveness analysis can play an important role, however, particularly when it is recognized that costs are effectively opportunities for health improvement that other patients forgo.\n\nUpdating the original panel's work provided an opportunity to reflect on the evolution of cost-effectiveness analysis and to develop guidance for the next generation of practitioners and consumers. Similar to any consensus panel, these recommendations reflect an effort by a selected group of individuals to achieve a sensible and workable arrangement. Other groups may have developed different recommendations.\n\nSome key areas for future research include (1) the use of multicriteria decision analysis and group decision making; (2) the use of cost-effectiveness analysis in value-based pricing; (3) estimation of cost-effectiveness thresholds; (4) the link between costeffectiveness analysis and incentives for innovation; (5) the role of cost-effectiveness analysis within health plans or guideline development; and (6) the effect of the 2 recommended reference case perspectives on the cost-effective analysis and its findings. The field would also benefit from further research on QALYs, including topics such as whether and to what extent respondents consider productivity effects in their evaluations of health states, the relationship of community preferences to patient preferences for different health states, the elicitation of preference scores for path states, the sequence of states that patients experience, and the methods for measuring healthrelated quality-of-life effects on family members of ill individuals (family spillover effects)."
