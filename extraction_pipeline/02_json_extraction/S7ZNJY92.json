      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "With improved mobile hardware, software and computational power, individual-level data on substance use triggers can be collected, processed and actioned in or near real-time. A large body of research using technology-mediated ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in people's daily lives indicates that lapse risk in people attempting to quit or reduce harmful substance use is idiosyncratic (i.e. it differs between individuals), dynamic (i.e. it fluctuates over time) and multifactorial (i.e. it is driven by multiple variables, such as urge to smoke, negative affect and contextual cues)  (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . For example -highlighting the dynamic and multi-factorial nature of lapse risk -in smokers attempting to quit, experiencing a strong urge to smoke was, on average, associated with 20% greater odds of lapsing near the quit date, with odds increasing by a further 30% one week after the scheduled quit attempt. Negative affect, however, was significantly associated with the odds of lapsing near the quit date but this association levelled off shortly thereafter  (4) . To highlight the idiosyncratic nature of lapse risk, a series of N-of-1 observational studies to examine factors associated with day-to-day alcohol consumption in individuals with a history of alcohol dependence found that different psychological and social factors were important for different individuals  (7) .\n\nJust-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) aim to provide tailored support to users at moments of 'need' (e.g. there is a need for support due to low self-regulatory capacity) or 'opportunity' (e.g. there is an opportunity to act positively in line with one's goals)  (8, 9) . Due to the idiosyncratic, dynamic and multi-factorial nature of lapse risk in individuals attempting to quit or reduce harmful substance use, JITAIs are poised as particularly suited to the delivery of lapse prevention support.\n\nThere is no consensus definition of what a JITAI is -although they typically harness mobile technology to deliver support, the mode of delivery is not necessarily a defining feature. Hardeman  and colleagues propose that JITAIs can be defined in terms of three characterising features: i) the intervention corresponds directly to a need for support in real-time (e.g. the user is at risk of smoking lapse due to experiencing high levels of stress) or an opportunity to act positively in line with one's goals, ii) the content or timing of the support is tailored to that real-time need or opportunity (e.g. the intervention is tailored to the most prominent lapse risk trigger, such as stress), and iii) the support is automatically triggered by the system (e.g. app, website, healthcare professional, peer) and not directly by the users themselves  (10) . Others have argued that JITAIs can also be user-triggered (e.g. pushing a button within an app or requesting a 'CRAVE' or 'LAPSE' message from an automated text message system)  (11) . Nahum-Shani and colleagues propose that JITAIs are defined by their constituent parts, which include i) decision points (i.e. points in time at which an intervention may be delivered), ii) tailoring variables (i.e. input used to inform decisions as to when or how to intervene for each individual), iii) intervention options (i.e. the available change strategies or delivery modes) and iv) decision rules (i.e. rules that systematically link decision points, tailoring variables and intervention options)  (8) . Furthermore, some have highlighted that JITAIs are interventions which consider individual change trajectories over time (e.g. from undesired to desired states), taking into account micro-(e.g. weather, stress), meso-(e.g. seasonality, motivational cycles) and/or macro-scale changes (e.g. life transitions such as becoming a parent, retirement)  (8, 12)  (see also  http://osf.io/n3scx ).\n\nA scoping review of JITAIs within addiction science and related study designs (e.g. the microrandomised trial) has recently been conducted  (13) ; however, to date, there has been no systematic and comprehensive review of decision points, tailoring variables, intervention options, decision rules, user engagement and intervention effectiveness of current implementations of technologymediated JITAIs that aim to reduce harmful substance use. Such a review would be useful for informing the development of new JITAIs and the optimisation of existing ones. We therefore aimed to address the following research questions, taking an inclusive approach to the definition of JITAIs:\n\n1. What decision points, tailoring variables, intervention options and decision rules are used in current implementations of technology-mediated JITAIs for harmful substance use? 2. Which study designs have been used in the development, optimisation, and evaluation of JITAIs that aim to reduce harmful substance use?\n\n3. What is the uptake of, engagement with, and effectiveness of JITAIs for reducing harmful substance use?"

      "text": "We included JITAIs designed to reduce harmful substance use (e.g. tobacco, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine, heroin), delivered by any type of technological system (e.g. websites, text messages, apps, wearables). Although we were also interested in capturing JITAIs delivered by non-technological systems (e.g. a family member, peer, healthcare professional), our search strategy was not specifically designed for this purpose. We took an inclusive approach and considered an intervention to be a JITAI if the primary sensing and delivery mechanism satisfied the following conditions: i) the intervention corresponds directly to a need for real-time support or an opportunity to act positively in line with one's goals, and ii) the content or timing of the support is tailored to that real-time need or opportunity  (10) . We included systems where the delivery of support was automated and in response to either EMAs delivered at decision points ('active measurement') or location/sensor data ('passive measurement')  (8) . We considered an intervention to be a JITAI if the majority of the support it was designed to deliver met our definition. However, a text message intervention in which users could trigger support directly by requesting a 'CRAVE' message but where the majority of the support was not adapted to a real-time need or opportunity did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. In addition, to distinguish JITAIs from one-off substance use screening and brief advice (sometimes referred to as 'just-in-time interventions', or JITs), we considered an intervention to be a JITAI only if the support was delivered repeatedly over a period of time (i.e. more than once per month). Interventions targeting multiple substances/behaviours were included providing that data could be extracted on the substance use component."

The identified JITAIs targeted alcohol consumption (7/14; 50%), tobacco smoking (4/14; 29%), cannabis smoking (2/14; 14%) or a combination of alcohol and illicit drug use (1/14; 7%).\n\nStudy designs deployed were single-or two-arm, non-randomised pilot studies (5/14; 36%), two-or three-arm pilot/feasibility RCTs (5/14; 36%), two-or three-arm RCTs (2/14; 14%) and mixed-methods designs in which the analysis of app usage data was combined with qualitative interviews (2/14; 14%). None of the included studies reported the use of N-of-1 observational or experimental designs, or micro-randomised trial designs.\n\nStudies included a median of 57 participants (range = 15 to 119,713) who were aged between 15 and 75+ years with a balanced gender distribution (median % female participants = 53%). The majority of studies (9/14; 64%) were conducted in the community (including university students and participants recruited via an ongoing observational cohort study or primary care)  (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) , with the remaining studies conducted in secondary care (3/14; 21%)  (32) (33) (34) (35) , acute care (1/14; 7%)  (36)  or in a specialist addiction service (1/14; 7%)  (37) . Studies typically reported inclusion criteria related to the frequency of substance use (e.g. daily or non-daily smoking, recent use of illicit drugs) or a diagnosis of substance use disorder (e.g. alcohol use disorder). Six studies (6/14; 43%) reported that between 15% and 63% of participants experienced co-occurring mental health issues, including elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety and/or multiple drug use  (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) ."

We coded 14 BCTs in the JITAIs from the published reports or supplementary materials. On average, JITAIs included 2.5 BCTs (SD = 1.9; range = 1-7). The most frequently included BCTs were '7.1 Prompts and cues' (14/14; 100%), '3.1 Social support (unspecified)' (6/14; 43%), and '12.3 Avoidance/reducing exposure to cues for the behaviour' (3/14; 21%). We coded three different engagement features in or pertaining to the JITAIs. For example, if training was provided on how to use the JITAI feature, this was coded as a 'Guidance feature'. On average, JITAIs included 1.9 engagement features (SD = 0.8; range = 1-3). The engagement features deployed were 'Personalisation' (14/14; 100%), 'Control features' (8/14; 57%), and 'Guidance features' (5/14; 36%).\n\nIntervention durations ranged from two weeks to eight months, although they were typically four to six weeks in duration (see Table  2 ). Where reported (13/14; 93%), JITAIs were delivered via smartphones (7/14; 50%)  (21, 22, (24) (25) (26) 30, 31, 38) , mobile phones (4/14; 29%)  (28, 32, 33, 35, 36) , handheld devices (1/14; 7%)  (27)  or a combination of mobile phones and handheld devices (1/14; 7%)  (34) . Three studies reported lending study phones to participants  (31, 33, 35) . None of the studies reported that the JITAI was delivered via a non-technological system (e.g. a healthcare professional).\n\nThe majority of JITAIs (12/14; 86%) used bespoke software. None of the studies explicitly reported on whether the software used to deliver the JITAI was developed in-house or whether any open science tools were used, such as making the source code accessible to other researchers/developers via a publicly available repository (e.g. GitHub). JITAIs were typically delivered as stand-alone tools, with just over a third of studies (5/14; 36%) providing adjunct support in the form of face-to-face sessions with a trained counsellor and/or pharmacotherapy  (30, 31, 34, 35, 38)  or treatment as usual (which differed depending on treatment centre)  (37) . The majority of studies (9/14; 64%) provided monetary incentives for participation, including variable payment contingent on the number of EMAs/follow-up assessments completed  (22) (23) (24) 28, 30, 31, 34, 35, 38)  or a flat payment for study completion  (25, 36) ."

The majority of studies relied on active measurement (10/14; 71%)  (24, (26) (27) (28) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) 38)  (see Table  3 ). Of the studies that used passive measurement, the majority harnessed the phone's GPS and targeted alcohol consumption  (21) (22) (23) 37) , with one study reporting the use of multiple location sensors (including the phone's GPS) to provide support for smoking cessation  (25) . No other sensors or devices were deployed to detect moments of need or opportunity. JITAIs deployed static (i.e. timeinvariant) if-then rules, which were typically based on participants entering a given geographical location (sometimes labelled 'weak spots' by the study authors) or whether a particular psychological or contextual variable, such as negative mood, stress, urges or the presence of others who use drugs/smoke, was reported as present (vs. absent) or above a pre-specified threshold. A minority of studies from the same research team (2/14; 14%)  (30, 31, 38)  reported that the if-then rule for triggering support was developed on the basis of lapse risk data from participants in a previous study (i.e. a 'warm start') (2); the remaining studies did not report deploying data-driven algorithms. None of the included studies considered participant availability or receptivity to just-intime support in their decision rules. In addition, none of the identified JITAIs adapted the type, frequency or intensity of support according to meso-(e.g. seasonality, motivational waves) or macro-scale changes (e.g. becoming a parent, retirement)."

Where reported, the response rate to prompts/EMAs ranged from 35% to 87%, with low-to-moderate response rates (35-64%) observed in studies targeting cannabis use  (34, 35)  and moderate-to-high rates (67-87%) in the remaining studies.\n\nEase of use, message frequency and perceived usefulness were reported as common facilitators to engagement. Where reported, many participants felt that the real-time prompts were quick and easy to complete  (26, 28, 34) , that the prompt/message frequency was just about right  (25, 38)  and that the real-time messages were informative and useful for keeping track of and/or reducing substance use  (22, 25, 27, 28, 31, 33, 35) .\n\nReported barriers to engagement included technical issues, message frequency and lack of novelty.\n\nFor example, participants reported location-triggered alerts going off in the wrong place, not always being triggered when supposed to or taking a long time to recognise that the participant had entered a pre-specified location  (22, 25) . Participants in one study reported issues with an inconsistent EMA prompting schedule  (26) . Some participants felt that they received too many prompts/messages  (25, 27, 35)  or that the message content was too repetitive  (26, 27) . Less frequently reported barriers to engagement included low perceived personal relevance and unintended consequences. For example, participants in one study felt that it would have been more useful to receive alerts linked to particular events or when experiencing negative emotions (rather than when dwelling in specific locations)  (21) . Unintended consequences of JITAIs included reminding participants of smoking (when they had not been thinking about it)  (25)  and messages being perceived as guilt-inducing or condescending  (27) ."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This systematic review provides an overview of decision points, tailoring variables, intervention options, decision rules, user engagement and intervention effectiveness of current implementations of JITAIs to reduce harmful substance use. The majority of JITAIs relied on active measurement (i.e.\n\nEMAs) to deliver real-time support tailored to micro-scale changes in, for example, mood or urges.\n\nEngagement with available JITAIs was moderate-to-high, which may at least in part be related to the receipt of flat or variable payment contingent on the number of EMAs or follow-up assessments completed. The majority of studies deployed single or multiple-arm pilot designs, with two medium sized RCTs. We found mixed evidence for JITAI effectiveness; however, most studies did not report being sufficiently powered to detect group differences in substance use or did not include a comparator. In addition, many studies reported insufficient detail on the JITAI infrastructure, intervention content, development costs, and data security. Similar to Hardeman and colleagues' recent review of JITAIs to promote physical activity  (10) , as research into JITAIs is in its early stages (both in terms of the quality of current implementations and the strength of available evidence), it is premature to comment on the effectiveness of JITAIs for reducing harmful substance use. However, our review highlights important conceptual and empirical gaps for researchers, developers and healthcare professionals, as discussed below."

      "title": "Current state of the field and recommendations for future work",
      "text": "First, there is no consensus definition of what JITAIs are and how to develop them, with a minority of extant studies relying on theoretical predictions or observational/experimental data from prior participants to devise decision points, tailoring variables, intervention options and/or decision rules.\n\nThe utility of JITAIs designed to reduce harmful substance use will depend largely on their ability to account for the observed idiosyncratic, dynamic and multi-factorial nature of lapse risk (1-7); yet current JITAI implementations do not facilitate real-time optimisation for individual users. Therefore, prior to investing in large-scale RCTs, we contend that further systematic and creative conceptual and computational work -with insights from the former feeding into the latter and vice versa -is required to make progress on JITAI effectiveness. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n\nSecond, although important methodological and statistical advances to support JITAI development, testing and optimisation have been made -including the Multiphase Optimisation Strategy, microrandomised trials, supervised and unsupervised machine learning  (39, 40)  -few studies identified in our review made use of such innovative approaches. Therefore, researchers, developers and practitioners interested in JITAIs should be supported to adopt relevant new methodological and statistical skills and/or ensure that such expertise is available within multidisciplinary JITAI project teams.\n\nThird, our review identified two primary ways in which JITAIs determine whether the user is in need of support: active measurement via EMAs or passive measurement, such as via location sensors.\n\nAlthough engagement with EMAs and intervention messages was moderate-to-high across the included studies (indicating that user engagement is not itself a key barrier), payment was typically provided for completing EMAs or follow-up assessments. We therefore need evidence as to whether participants will also engage with EMAs outside controlled study settings where no payment is provided. A move from active to passive sensing of physiological or ecological indicators of lapse risk (e.g. heart rate variability  (41, 42) , step count, weather) is also an important avenue for future research, with potential for reducing user burden and costs associated with financial incentives for completing EMAs. On the other hand, based on available data, the process of completing active measurements, such as EMAs, can help people reflect on their cravings, mood, etc., which may contribute to an enduring learning experience beyond the use of the JITAI itself  (43) . There are also important ethical considerations that need to be accounted for when deciding between active developed within commercial settings, with different ethical standards (referred to by some scholars as the 'Wild West' of digital health)  (44) . A related area is the use of sensors or digital devices for passive detection of key outcomes of interest, including smartphone-enabled carbon monoxide monitors to verify tobacco smoking abstinence  (45) , gesture recognition software on smartwatches to identify cigarette (or cannabis) smoking behaviour  (46) , transdermal alcohol sensors  (47) , or alcohol and cannabis sensors in the form of \"tattoos\" and rings  (48, 49) . This may simultaneously help reduce user burden and improve confidence in results, yet requires the same careful considerations as discussed above in relation to the passive sensing of physiological or ecological indicators of lapse risk."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "The strengths of this systematic review include a comprehensive search of nine medical, psychology, engineering and human-computer interaction databases, substantial team expertise (as indicated by several team members having contributed to papers included in the review), having two reviewers independently screen studies for inclusion, the coding of JITAI content against available taxonomies and conceptual frameworks, and a quality appraisal of included studies against the mERA checklist. However, our review also had several limitations. First, the electronic search and paper screening process was challenging due to the lack of a consensus definition of JITAIs and may mean we did not capture all relevant studies. For example, our reliance on a specific three-part definition to help determine which studies to include meant that we excluded studies with a 'just-in-time' (JIT) reminder at time points pre-specified by the user (as opposed to tailored support in response to EMAs delivered at decision points or location/sensor data)  (50, 51) . Second, we decided against including conceptual or methodological papers without any empirical data due to our focus on extant implementations of JITAIs. However, such papers may have provided additional insight into JITAI decision points, tailoring variables, and decision rules, and the types of study designs that are useful for devising these. Third, although we consider the use of a quality appraisal tool a strength of the review, it was challenging to judge the quality of included studies due to insufficient reporting, particularly with regards to the infrastructure required to run JITAIs (e.g. specific hardware, software, size of message banks) and intervention options.
