  "title": "Specific hypertension smartphone application to improve medication adherence in hypertension: a cluster-randomized trial",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Digital interventions, such as smartphone applications (apps), are becoming an increasingly common way to support medication adherence and self-management in chronic illness. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in pharmacological therapeutic adherence in mild to moderate arterial hypertension (AHT), through an app installed on a mobile phone, as well as the degree of control reached by the patient with this tool. Methods: Prospective, randomized controlled trial, full study and multicenter study. Four primary care centers participated. One hundred and fifty-four hypertensive patients under antihypertensive treatment were included. Two groups were established: a control group (CG) with usual intervention (n \u00bc 77) and an intervention group (n \u00bc 77) (IG), targeting hypertensive people who owned and regularly used a mobile smartphone, specifically using the app called AlerHTA to promote health education and reminder of appointments. There were three visits: initial, 6 and 12 months. Drug adherence was measured by electronic monitors (MEMSs). The primary outcomes were average daily percentage adherence between 80 and 100%, and AHT control. Results: A total of 148 patients finished the study. Mean age was 57.5 \u00b1 9.9. Global adherence was 77.02% (CI \u00bc 70.25-83.79) and daily adherence was 74.32% (CI \u00bc 67.29-81.35%). Daily adherence was 93.15% and 86.3% in IG, and 70.66% and 62.66% in CG after 6 and 12 months respectively (p < .05). The percentage of uncontrolled patients was 28.3% (CI \u00bc 21.05-35.55%). The control of high blood pressure at 12 months was 17.8% and 38.6% for IG and CG respectively (p < .05). The number of patients needed to treat to avoid non-adherence (NNT) was 4.23 patients. Conclusions: The intervention with an app installed on the mobile phones of hypertensive patients favors pharmacological therapeutic adherence and improves the percentage of hypertensive patient control.",

      "text": "Arterial hypertension (AHT) is one of the main health problems worldwide, because it is considered a major risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal diseases  1  . Blood pressure (BP) control through pharmacological treatment has led to substantial benefits in the prevention of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease  2  . Despite the efficacy of antihypertensive agents, there is a significant problem of non-adherence to these medications in those diagnosed with hypertension, which limits the effectiveness of current treatments. The consequences of non-adherence are serious because of the resulting poor clinical outcomes and preventable health care costs.\n\nThe relationship between drug failure and inadequate BP control is well known, since nearly 75% of non-adherent patients do not achieve optimal BP  3  . Antihypertensive adherence can reduce the risk of stroke by 35-40% and myocardial infarction by 20-25%  4, 5  . However, a study encompassing the findings of 28 studies of 15 countries showed that 45.2% of hypertensives failed the treatment  6  . In Spain, antihypertensive non-adherence ranges between 7.1% and 66.2%  7  .\n\nThe term therapeutic adherence is \"the extent to which the patient assumes the rules or advice given by the doctor or health personnel, both from the point of view of recommended habits or lifestyle and the prescribed pharmacological treatment itself. It is expressed itself with it the degree of coincidence between the orientations given by the professional and the realization by the patient, made after a decision fully reasoned by the latter\"  7, 8  .\n\nDifferent studies and systematic reviews have assessed the relevance of different interventions in the improvement of therapeutic adherence  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  . However, the conclusions of epidemiological studies on the effectiveness of the intervention differ widely. Importantly, forgetting, i.e. not remembering, has been found to be the most common reason for patients not taking medication  6, 7  .\n\nWorldwide, the mobile phone has become the preferred tool for communication and access to information  14  . One of the strategies that can facilitate adherence could be the integration of the hypertensive patient's mobile phone in the provision of healthcare.\n\nThere are studies that have assessed the effectiveness of SMS text messages in improving adherence. Some, but not all studies, suggest that reminder SMS messages can improve clinic attendance and the subjective perception of adherence to medication  15  . Two other clinical trials with short follow-up periods have explored the efficacy of SMS-based interventions to improve treatment adherence and control BP. Although the results of the trials indicate small to moderate effects in improving adherence and control of BP, the results were not statistically significant  16, 17  .\n\nKumar et al.  18  focused on apps for hypertension management and found that these apps contained tools specifically for medication adherence (e.g. pill reminders) and also performed a BP-tracking function through a wireless BP monitor. Green  19  claimed that the innovative smartphone apps offer a new strategy for patients and their families to be more actively involved in hypertension self-care.\n\nHowever, we must consider whether these new technologies may also have the potential to create an undesirable burden for the patients and it remains unclear whether these technologies are feasible, acceptable and usable in the context of self-control of hypertension  20  .\n\nIn this sense, Morrissey et al.  21 , studying how patients engage with these technologies, demonstrated that patients can identify the benefits of a medication reminder and recognize that self-monitoring their blood pressure could be empowering their understanding of the condition and improve interactions with their general practitioners.\n\nOur objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of an app installed on patients' mobile phones on pharmacological adherence and control of BP in patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension."

Control group (CG): 77 patients, who received the usual intervention in HBP (control every 6 months of blood pressure, annual control of therapeutic adherence, annual analysis and biannual electrocardiogram). 2. Intervention group (IG): 77 patients who owned and used a mobile phone with iPhone or Android systems. A free app was installed on their mobile phones with the aim of promoting health education in AHT and reminders of both appointments and medication intake time. This app is called AlerHTA: it has been specially created for the Hypertensive Club of the Spanish Society of Hypertension (SEH-LELHA). It is easily accessible and free to obtain. After the patients downloaded the application, the physician instructed them on how to use it and they were given, in addition, the operating instructions of the app in writing. The app allows you to record personal data, recommended BP levels as objectives, the doctor's advice about the prescribed treatment and posology, and set reminder alarms, a calendar of appointments or events, and record the results of the BP measurement.\n\nMedication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMSs) are electronic monitoring devices that use a digital record in the form of a microchip in the lid of the drug container that automatically controls its opening and registers the time and date. Through this method we measured how many times the MEMSs were opened, assuming that one pill was taken with each opening.\n\nThe study lasted 18 months, with an inclusion period of 6 months and a follow-up of 12 months (January 2016 to June 2017). The selection of patients was made consecutively. The researcher enrolled the first seven patients attending her or his service, and they were included in the study on the same day."

Patients who lost or did not use the MEMS and those who decided not to continue with the study at some point were also withdrawn.\n\nIn the case of abandonment/modification of the prescribed antihypertensive drug at the beginning of the study, patients were not excluded from the study. In this case, the prescribed antihypertensive agents were introduced into the MEMSs again."

The final AP of the study was considered for each patient and we study the AP accumulated at the time of the end of the follow-up (at the end of the last visit or when the patients were withdrawn from the study).\n\nMean AP was calculated using the MEMSs as: (a) global percentage of doses taken (global AP)percentage of all doses taken in an established period; (b) percentage of correct days (daily AP)percentage of days on which antihypertensive drugs were taken correctly (one daily dose); (c) percentage of correct time (time AP)percentage of patients taking the medication at the prescribed time (dosage taken at the recommended time, between 7 and 9 am); (d) percentage of therapeutic cover -AP of therapeutic coverage assuming a 24 hour therapeutic effect of antihypertensive drugs.\n\nAdherence was defined as: (a) global adherenceglobal AP between 80 and 100%; (b) daily adherencedaily AP between 80 and 100%; (c) correct time adherencetime AP between 80 and 100%; (d) therapeutic cover adherencetherapeutic cover AP between 80 and 100%. The main endpoint was daily adherence (the efficacy of the investigated interventions was measured by this variable).\n\nWe calculated the relevance of the intervention made by reducing the absolute risk (ARR), the relative risk reduction (RRR) and the number of patients needed to treat to avoid non-adherence (NNT \u00bc 1/ARR).\n\nDifferent non-adherence patterns were defined  [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  according to AP as: adherencea) absolute adherence with AP of 100%, b) masked adherence with AP >80% and daily AP of <80%, c) adherence with sporadic non-adherence when AP >80% and less than 100%, and d) over-adherence with AP >100%; non-adherencea) absolute non-adherence when AP <50%, b) partial non-adherence when AP between 50% and 80%, c) treatment abandonment when the patient stopped taking the medication (as declared by the patient and as recorded in MEMS); other patterns (adherents or non adherents) -a) pharmacological holidays of at least 3 days without taking the medication, b) schedule/time non-adherence when the medication was not taken between 7 and 9 am, c) mixed non-adherence when two or more non-adherence patterns were met and d) white robe adherence, when the medication was taken the days before and after the visit, with non-adherence the rest of the time.\n\nThe following variables were also analyzed: age and sex, number of concomitant diseases, number of drugs consumed and mean BP (SBP and DBP). The percentage of controlled patients was also calculated (BP <140 and 90 mmHg)."

      "text": "A total of 154 patients were included, and 148 hypertensive patients were valid for the analysis (96.1%). The overall mean age was 57.5 \u00b1 9.9 years. There were 71 men (47.9%) and 77 women (52.02%) (mean age: 57.9 \u00b1 10.3 years and 57.2 \u00b1 9.8 years respectively (p \u00bc NS). Of the 6 patients not included (4 in IG and 2 in CG) the reasons were in 2 cases due to technical problems in the readings of the MEMSs, 2 cases did not show up to the control visits; 1 moved to another city and 1 had to abandon due to illness that required long hospitalization.\n\nSeventy-three individuals of the IG and 75 of the CG were evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in age, sex, number of diseases suffered, number of drugs consumed, initial weight, vascular risk factors and other alterations related to cardiovascular disease (Table  1 ).\n\nSignificant differences could be observed between the groups in global AP, AP of a single daily dose, AP in the correct schedule and AP of therapeutic coverage, in favor of the IG (Table  2 ). Adherence once daily was 93.15% and 86.3% in IG and 70.66% and 62.66% in CG after 6 and 12 months, respectively, the adherence percentage being significantly higher in the IG (Table  2 ).\n\nThe mean BP was similar at the beginning in the two groups (134.7 \u00b1 14 mmHg in IG vs. 134.47 \u00b1 8 mmHg in CG). Significant differences were observed in the mean decreases in BP in the IG throughout the study (final BP: 132.2 \u00b1 12, p <.05). In the CG blood pressure was not modified throughout the follow-up (134.4 \u00b1 11 mmHg) (Table  3 ).\n\nRegarding the control of blood pressure, in the whole group at the end of the study, 77.02% (CI \u00bc 70.25-83.79) of the global sample were adherent. The daily AP was 74.32% (CI \u00bc 67. 29-81.35). The percentage of uncontrolled BP patients at the end of the study was 28.3% (CI \u00bc 21.05-35.55%).\n\nThe results by groups were as follows. At baseline 35.6% and 32% in the IG and CG respectively were controlled (p \u00bc NS); at 6 months this was 20.5 and 44% (p < .05) and finally the results were 17.8% in CG (CI \u00bc 9.03-26.57) and 38.6% in IG (CI \u00bc 27.6-49.6) (p < .05).\n\nThe ARR at 12 months was 23.64%, giving a RRR of 63.61%. The NNT was calculated to be 4.23 patients.\n\nWhen assessing the adherence patterns (Table  4 ), it can be observed that among adherents the pattern of sporadic non-adherence is the most frequent and among non-adherents, the partial default pattern predominates. We found other predominant patterns to be pharmacological holidays (66.3%) and non-adherence with the pill schedule (85.34%)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Our study highlights high daily adherence, being 74.32% of the global sample, while non-adherence was 25.68%. However, it has been observed that in the CG, 3 out of 10 patients stopped taking a tablet daily, and 8 out of 10 did not take the medication at the recommended time.\n\nIn studies carried out by counting tablets or MEMSs between 1984 and 2005, non-adherence in Spain ranged between 7.1% and 66.2% with a global weighted average of 32.53%  7  .\n\nSubsequent works, such as the 2012 CUMPLE study 8 conducted with MEMSs that assessed non-adherence at 6 months in 3900 hypertensive patients with poorly controlled blood pressure and high cardiovascular risk, found a rate of 53.5% non-adherence and in another study by M arquez Contreras et al.  22  , on hypertensive patients treated in primary care with a follow-up of 2 years, non-adherence was 22.6%. In other countries, non-adherence also ranged between 31.2%  12  and 45.2%  6  . Non-adherence with other drugs such as oral anticoagulants is 26.78%  23  .\n\nIn this study, we observed clinically relevant differences in adherence percentages between the two groups, being 23.64% higher in the IG. Therefore, the effectiveness of the intervention is demonstrated. The use of free of charge mobile apps, such as the \"AlerHTA\" application, whose objective is to promote health education in AHT and give reminders of appointments and medication intake, is effective and a useful strategy to improve antihypertensive drug adherence in hypertensive patients.\n\nClinical relevance was demonstrated after obtaining an NNT of 4.23. In general, it is considered relevant to obtain an RRR of more than 50%, and the closer to 10 (or lower than 10) that the NNT gets, the greater the study benefit indicated.\n\nTherefore the required effort to prevent one non-adherent patient is small. Different studies have observed that the NNT with other adherence strategies was 2.49 in the study by M arquez Contreras et al.  24  , 5.5 in the study by Tortajada Soriano  25  , 4 in the study by Raigal 26 , 4.2 and 4.5 in the ETECUM study 27 through telephone and postal intervention, respectively, and 5.6 in the EAPACUM study through a home blood pressure self-measurement program  28  . In other pathologies, such as dyslipidemia, an NNT of 3.43 was obtained through telephone intervention, and 3.84 was obtained with anticoagulants  23  . In our study, hypertensive patients followed the indications for 12 months and achieved better adherence and better control of AHT, with a low dropout rate (only 2 patients did not show up for follow-up visits).\n\nDifferent studies show that the combination of drugs in a single pill, including the use of a polypill, improves adherence  12  , and conclude that a 10% increase in their use could result in a 6.7% decrease in cardiovascular events in 10 years  29  .\n\nThe percentage of individuals with uncontrolled BP in the total group at the end of the study was 31.2%. Initially the values were similar between the two groups (IG and GC); at the end of the study, CG reached 17.8% while IG reached 38.6%. These findings indicate that, in parallel with the improvement in adherence, a reduction in BP and better control of AHT is obtained.\n\nWhen assessing adherence patterns, it is observed that among adherent patients the pattern of adherence with sporadic non-adherence prevails, while among non-adherent patients the pattern of partial non-adherence prevails. Other patterns stand out, such as pharmacological holidays (66.3%) or non-adherence with the pill schedule (85.34%). It is important to know these patterns of non-adherence since it will need specific strategies to address them.\n\nThe data from our study could be generalizable to a large group of hypertensive patients treated in primary care, since an important sample was obtained through consecutive sampling, with a relevant number of researchers from different basic health areas. The adherence method with MEMS has been validated with respect to blood measurements of metabolites of various drugs and has the best validation compared to other methods.\n\nIt is known that this method could overestimate adherence, since it is an intervention in itself, but the intervention was the same in both the CG and the IG. The method is not exempt from limitations, such as technical problems with the records or their cost. In addition, it must be kept in mind that the opening of the container does not guarantee that the medication has been taken.\n\nThis study meets the criteria recommended by Haynes et al.  31  for adherence studies. Thus, the diagnosis of AHT has been correct and the ESH-ESC 2013 recommendations have been followed. The recommended method is a randomized clinical trial, checking the comparability of the groups, and assessing the results on adherence and on the disease (degree of control of the AHT), with a follow-up of at least 80% of the sample and a greater number of 50 individuals per group, and with a calculation of the magnitude of the clinical relevance (RRR, RRA and NNT), with statistical significance. Patients without sufficient adherence data could only have influenced the results to a small degree, since only five were excluded. Nonetheless, the analysis of non-evaluable patients showed that the initial characteristics were similar to those of the evaluated patients.\n\nThe intervention with the AlerHTA app installed on the mobile phones of hypertensive patients is effective in improving both treatment adherence, and percentage control.\n\nIn terms of practical utility, we must take into account the significant clinical relevance of this intervention. This Results expressed in percentage and confidence intervals. p value: statistically significant differences in the decreases between six (p \u00c3 ) and twelve months (p \u00c3\u00c3 ), by groups. Results expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation. p, statistically significant differences between the two groups; p \u00c3 , statistically significant differences in the reductions between the two groups. procedure does not require previous training, it would be easy to apply in practice because the introduction of smartphone apps among hypertensive patients has already started and, in our opinion, more than 50% of hypertensive patients are currently willing to take this on. It could be used universally in all hypertensive patients or patients with chronic diseases, or another option would be to use these smartphone apps with non-adherent patients for a certain period of time. As a future line of research should be conducted studies designed with the aim of finding different intervention strategies remain effective for a long time.\n\nWe can conclude that the intervention with the AlerHTA app installed on the mobile phones of hypertensive patients:\n\n(1) favors pharmacological therapeutic adherence; (2) improves the percentage of hypertensive patient control; (3) requires small effort to avoid one case of non-adherence."
