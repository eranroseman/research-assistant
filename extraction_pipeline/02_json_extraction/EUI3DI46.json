  "title": "Adolescents Just Do Not Know What They Want: A Qualitative Study to Describe Obese Adolescents' Experiences of Text Messaging to Support Behavior Change Maintenance Post Intervention",
  "abstract": "Background: Adolescents are considered a hard to reach group and novel approaches are needed to encourage good health. Text messaging interventions have been reported as acceptable to adolescents but there is little evidence regarding the use of text messages with overweight and obese adolescents to support engagement or behavior change after the conclusion of a healthy lifestyle program. \n Objective: The intent of this study was to explore the opinions of overweight adolescents and their parents regarding the use of text messages as a support during the maintenance period following an intervention. Methods: This paper reports on the findings from focus groups conducted with adolescents (n=12) and parents (n=13) who had completed an eight-week intensive intervention known as Curtin University's Activity, Food and Attitudes Program (CAFAP). Focus groups were conducted three months post intensive intervention. Participants were asked about their experiences of the prior three-month maintenance phase during which adolescents had received tri-weekly text messages based on the self-determination theory and goal-setting theory. Participants were asked about the style and content of text messages used as well as how they used the text messages. Data were analyzed using content and thematic analyses. Results: Two clear themes emerged from the focus groups relating to (1) what adolescents liked or thought they wanted in a text message to support behavior change, and (2) how they experienced or responded to text messages. Within the \"like/want\" theme, there were five sub-themes relating to the overall tone of the text, frequency, timing, reference to long-term goals, and inclusion of practical tips. Within the \"response to text\" theme, there were four sub-themes describing a lack of motivation, barriers to change, feelings of shame, and perceived unfavorable comparison with other adolescents. What adolescents said they wanted in text messages often conflicted with their actual experiences. Parent reports provided a useful secondary view of adolescent experience. \n Conclusions: The conflicting views described in this study suggest that overweight and obese adolescents may not know or have the ability to articulate how they would best be supported with text messages during a healthy lifestyle maintenance phase. Further, supporting both engagement and behavior change simultaneously with text messaging may not be possible. Intervention",

      "text": "The provision of effective health-related interventions for adolescents is a difficult task, particularly when traditional methods of communication are unlikely to be engaging  [1] . Current mobile telephone usage trends show adolescents are increasingly using text messaging as a preferred method of communication  [2] . Text messaging, also known as short message service (SMS), may therefore provide an acceptable means of delivering health messages in adolescent populations  [3] [4] [5] [6] .\n\nIn adolescent weight management programs, text messaging shows promise as a feasible and acceptable method of communication  [4, 7] . Evidence from healthy weight adolescent groups support this concept of \"acceptability\"  [8] , yet it remains unknown whether text messaging is an effective means for fostering engagement or supporting behavior change.\n\nGiven the significant dropout rates reported in pediatric weight management programs  [9]  and lack of evidence for long-term weight maintenance in adolescence  [10] , there is much to be gained from developing an effective method for keeping participants engaged with a program. Text messaging may be a useful way of maintaining this engagement. De Niet et al  [6]  found that children and adolescents randomized to a text message treatment group were 3.5 times less likely than the control group to drop out of the maintenance period of a healthy lifestyle intervention but also showed that text message engagement declined over the 9-month period. Older pre-adolescent children (12 year olds sent 0.5 texts per week) were less likely to send responses compared with younger children (7 year olds sent 0.8 texts per week)  [6] . This decline in adherence to monitoring over time has been documented previously  [11] , but adherence remains higher than other traditional methods of self-monitoring. Kornman et al  [7]  described only a modest level of adolescent engagement with their text messaging and email adjunct to the Loozit program, with adolescents responding to 22.0% of text messages over a 10-month maintenance period. The authors found that text messages asking for a response had more replies and text messages had a more immediate response than the emails. Whether text messaging can be used to maintain engagement of overweight adolescents in a healthy lifestyle program remains unclear.\n\nStudies evaluating the effectiveness of text messages offer inconsistent support for the use of text messaging to support behavior change and/or weight maintenance  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Adolescents in the Loozit program rated the text message support during the 10-month maintenance period as \"somewhat helpful\"; however, the results suggested that the use of text messages developed for this intervention did not have a significant effect on primary outcomes at 12 or 24 months post program  [7, 15, 16] . Other short-term studies assessing the effectiveness of text messaging interventions with adolescents suggest success only in those who had not previously engaged in the targeted behaviors before the intervention commenced  [12]  or who received additional intensive support (ie, intensive insulin therapy) in addition to text messages  [13] . There remains a gap in the evidence regarding the effectiveness of text messaging interventions to support behavior change in overweight and obese adolescents.\n\nThere is also limited evidence regarding the best way to construct and send text messages for use with adolescents  [17] . Factors to consider include the message tone, content and length, as well as the timing and frequency of text message delivery. Several studies have reported the wording and timing of delivered messages  [3, 6, 7, 12] , but only two studies have considered the format of text messages to be sent regularly to support behavior change in adolescents  [8]  or obese adolescents  [17] . Rigorous pilot testing of text messages has provided descriptions of what adolescents think they want  [8, 17] , but whether adolescents actually do know and can articulate what they want in text messages and whether this is desirable for either engagement or intervention efficacy is unknown. There are currently no studies that have completed a detailed post-intervention evaluation of overweight and obese adolescent experiences of text messages, including perceptions of content, style, or usefulness. A lack of synchrony between what adolescents think they want and may actually like or find useful is suggested by evidence that overweight teenagers have indicated a strong preference for directive text messages, which seems to contradict their desire for autonomy  [17] .\n\nParents have not traditionally been involved in the development or refinement of text messaging interventions for adolescents. However, parents may play an important role in supporting adolescent engagement in research  [1] , providing healthful environments  [18] , modelling healthy behaviors  [19] , and supporting adolescent behavior change  [20] . The potential for parents to offer valuable insight into adolescent experiences of text messaging interventions warrants exploration.\n\nCurrent recommendations for research into text messaging interventions advise researchers to design their study with a strong theoretical foundation  [21, 22]  and report on process evaluation after the intervention, to inform others about the best way to structure text messages, and effectively utilize this form of communication with adolescents  [7, 17, 21, 23] . Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore opinions of overweight and obese adolescents and their parents, who have participated in a multi-disciplinary healthy lifestyle program, regarding the use of text messages as a support during the maintenance period."

      "title": "Study Design",
      "text": "This study relates to focus groups held during the maintenance phase of a multi-disciplinary healthy lifestyle program for overweight and obese adolescents aged 12-16 years and their parents. A wait-list controlled trial of Curtin University's Activity, Food and Attitudes Program (CAFAP) has been conducted and is described elsewhere  [24]  along with its theoretical underpinnings  [20] . Briefly, participants enrolled in CAFAP and were placed on a three-month waiting list to allow for a control period. Following this waiting list period, adolescents and parents completed the intensive phase of the program, involving twice-weekly group sessions for eight weeks. Sessions covered healthy eating, increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behavior, and setting goals for healthy behavior change. Parents were also trained in behaviors around need satisfaction and goal setting to support their adolescent's lifestyle changes  [20] . The intensive phase was followed by a tapered maintenance phase over 12 months. The first three months of the maintenance phase were considered to be \"high intensity\" where adolescents received three text messages per week and one phone coaching session every two weeks. The next three-month period included a tapering of contact to \"medium intensity\", where adolescents received a weekly text message and a monthly phone coaching session. The \"low intensity\" phase of the maintenance period occurred between six and 12 months post intensive program and included monthly text messages and quarterly phone coaching sessions. This study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HR105/2011). This qualitative study was performed three months after the eight-week intervention period of CAFAP, which coincided with the conclusion of the high intensity maintenance period. The intent of the study was to explore adolescents' perceptions of text messages received, in combination with the observations and experiences of the parents, during the previous three months. Four focus groups were conducted with overweight and obese adolescents between September 2012 and April 2013 to cover the three waves of participants who completed the program at different times. Four focus groups were also completed by the parents of these adolescents. Focus groups were small  (3) (4)  to encourage rich discussion of the text messages."

Adolescents were offered a $30AUD gift voucher for participating in the focus group. Of the 35 adolescents invited, 16 agreed to participate and 12 attended the focus groups. Parents were recruited once their adolescent had agreed to participate in the focus group. All adolescents had a parent participate in the focus groups at the same time as they completed their own focus group."

      "title": "Text Message Development and Programming",
      "text": "CAFAP used an automated text messaging system to send predetermined but semi-tailored text messages to adolescents. During the first three months of the 12-month maintenance period, adolescents were sent a text message at 6pm on two weekdays and noon on one weekend day. The timing and frequency of text messages in this study was chosen as it reflected a midway point between previous adolescent trials  [7, 13]  and incorporated evidence from associated formative research  [25] . Adolescents chose the days that would best suit them at the conclusion of the intensive intervention phase. Two versions of the message plan were developed using the same text messages but in a different order to ensure that adolescents who were close friends would receive different messages. Texts were limited to 320 characters minus auto text (\"Hi [first name], [text message], from the CAFAP Team\"). Texts were sent to the adolescent's personal phone in most instances, except where the adolescent did not have a personal phone or did not use it consistently. Some families requested the text also be sent to a parent's phone to keep the parent involved. If text messages were not able to be delivered, research staff would follow up to manually send the text or contact the participant by phone if the text remained undelivered.\n\nThe contact during the maintenance period continued with the same theoretical base and key messages as during the intensive face-to-face contact period. Text contact was thus based on self-determination theory  [26]  and goal-setting theory  [27]  and focused on eating more fruit and vegetables, eating less junk food, being less sedentary, and being more physically active  [20, 24] . Message development also incorporated recommendations from current literature, by including a positive tone  [6, 17, 23]  and friendly but professional language  [17] . Messages were constructed so as to be perceived as deriving from the research team  [7, 17]  and were semi-tailored  [28]  by using first names and references to CAFAP or past text message contact  [4] [5] [6] [7] 13, 17, 21] . The word \"you\" was frequently used to make facts relatable to adolescents  [8]  and a maximum of two reflective questions were included in each message  [17] . Messages that provided options for behaviors were always framed to give adolescents a choice (eg, \"You might like to\u2026\") and recipes or testimonials from other teenagers (eg, \"Other teens have found it helpful to\u2026\") were used to enhance self-efficacy  [17] . Suggestions for activities were based on affective beliefs to emphasize the enjoyment and social nature of participation  [12]  and reaffirmed the benefits of healthy eating and physical activity. Negative wording or the mention of triggers for unhealthy behaviors (eg, consumption of junk food) was avoided  [17] . Adolescents were able to reply to text messages and receive a response, but were not expressly asked to reply. This approach was chosen to align with the theoretical underpinnings of text message development relating to fostering a sense of autonomy  [20, 26]  and formative work suggesting adolescents may be reluctant to spend their own money on responses  [25] . Text messages were designed to prompt behaviors and offer adolescents options for healthy behaviors, but they did not have to act on the texts if that was not their choice. The number of text messages sent to adolescents was measured on the SMS database. Five overall categories of texts were developed (general, goal setting, healthy eating, physical activity, and sedentary behavior) with messages tailored for weekday evenings and weekends. See Table  1  for examples of CAFAP text messages."

Six messages were chosen from the database of texts sent during the high intensity maintenance phase to reflect the different content and key strategies used in the main text categories as outlined in Table  1 .\n\nThe aim of using the six text messages was to explore the adolescents' response to the message content. For each of the six messages, adolescents were asked: \u2022 Did it make you think about changing your behavior (diet/activity/habit)?\n\n\u2022 How could we make it better?\n\nFor the second part of the focus group, adolescents were asked about another six text messages (see Table  2 ) to understand their responses to the specific strategies used in the messages. The final part of the focus group included questions about general responses, timing, and how the text messages were used by adolescents. a Adolescents were assigned a code to distinguish between responders.

Underlying similarities and differences were evaluated and used to form the fundamental impression of the focus group discussions  [31] . The data were triangulated with adolescent and parent interpretations compared  [31]  to give greater context to the data. By comparing and contrasting results from two groups with different viewpoints, we attempted to overcome the intrinsic biases associated with single group observations and explain the situation more fully  [32] .

      "title": "Overview",
      "text": "The present study contributes to the evidence base around experiences of overweight and obese adolescents and their parents in response to text messages designed to support behavior change in the maintenance period of a larger intervention. Adolescents described a sense of shame in response to the text message intervention, which was also observed by their parents, presenting a new issue for health researchers using text messaging with overweight and obese adolescents. In this study, overweight and obese adolescents' stated preferences for text messages differed from how they actually responded to such text messages. This suggests that pre-intervention testing of messages may not adequately simulate what happens in \"real life\". There may be differences between messages that adolescents say they like and those that are actually helpful in supporting behavior change. The consensus from adolescents was that the text messages were occasionally useful but sent too frequently and did not substantially help them to change their behaviors. Parents agreed that the text messages were too frequent and possibly too impersonal. They acknowledged there were some positive responses to the messages but the majority of the adolescents did not like to be reminded about healthy behaviors. These findings emphasize the uniqueness of overweight and obese adolescents and suggest a need to strengthen future intervention aims and evaluation methods."

    {
      "title": "Shame",
      "text": "Overweight and obese adolescents experience a sense of shame regarding their health and/or body  [33, 34] . The results of this study show that regular health-related text messages have the potential to heighten this sense of shame, which is a new issue for consideration by researchers using text messaging with overweight and obese adolescents. Based on the theoretical underpinnings of CAFAP  [20] , text messages were specifically worded to promote autonomy and support adolescent choices, yet many adolescents perceived the text messages as reminders of what they should be doing but weren't doing. This response from overweight and obese adolescents differs to that described in similar studies, albeit shorter term, in adolescents of differing weight statuses  [8]  or diabetic adolescents  [13]  who reported to enjoy receiving health-related text messages. Similarly, suggestions about what other teens had found useful were not well-received as they had been in the pilot phase of a previous study  [17] , rather, these adolescents reported they disliked being compared to others. This response is potentially a significant barrier for overweight and obese adolescents to maintain healthy behaviors, with feelings of shame being related to poor mental health  [34]  and in turn to poorer self-efficacy and reduced ability to engage in lifestyle changes  [35] . These feelings or circumstances may be unique to overweight and obese adolescents and suggest that results from trials involving non-obese adolescents may not be easily generalized to this group."
    },
    {
      "title": "Want Versus Response",
      "text": "The results from this study suggest a notable difference between what overweight and obese adolescents say they prefer in a text message as opposed to what is actually useful to them in the maintenance phase following intervention. Adolescents reported that texts relating to their long-term goals were useful to motivate them, yet they had difficulty with maintaining behavior change and parents reported significant issues with adolescent motivation. Adolescents were able to point out flaws in the text message content and suggest improvements; however, many of these included strategies previously used or previously criticized by the adolescents themselves. Similarly, adolescents expressed a desire for practical tips to use in their daily lives reflecting current evidence  [8, 17] , yet were quick to highlight reasons that would prevent them from regularly using the tips. They identified a number of barriers including lack of time or lack of resources (eg, particular foods not available), but weren't able to suggest many ideas to overcome these. Interpretation of these results suggest that adolescents are able to identify idealistic concepts for text message style and content that may make theoretical sense, but have difficulty envisioning their actual response to such messages. This has potential implications for researchers doing pre-intervention testing with overweight and obese adolescents because the views they express may indicate that the intervention will be useful but might not be a true reflection of their experience in a text message intervention. Currently, the majority of the evidence around text message development for overweight and obese adolescents is based on the assumption that adolescents know what will be helpful to them in a text message and can articulate that; however, these results suggest that this may not be the case. Qualitative post-intervention research may provide the most contextual data regarding overweight and obese adolescents' reaction to text messages, but even within these results there are inconsistencies between what adolescents say they want and what they actually respond well to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purpose of Text",
      "text": "Text messages are often used with adolescents to (1) encourage behavior change or maintenance, and (2) to foster engagement between adolescents and interventions; however, this research suggests that it may be difficult to concurrently achieve both of these aims in a weight-related intervention using text messages. The overweight and obese adolescents in this study did not like receiving text messages reminding them to maintain healthy behaviors, and thus such messages have the potential to damage the therapeutic relationship established during a face-to-face intervention and hence ongoing engagement.\n\nIn this study, overweight and obese adolescents' responses to the text messages became increasingly negative over time. This suggests that their motivation may decline over time leading to failure to maintain behavior changes. Many parents in this study reiterated that adolescents didn't like to be prompted about healthy things they could be doing, although they felt that it was sometimes useful to encourage behavior change. Despite adolescents reporting their dislike of the text messages, the healthy behavior focus may have had a positive effect on adolescents' health. The effectiveness of using texts as healthy behavior prompts is not clear, with some evidence suggesting that this may be effective in promoting behavior change in the long-term  [36, 37] , while other evidence suggests that eliciting a negative or shameful response to a message results in a reduction in self-efficacy and lack of behavior change  [35] . This delicate balance between prompting behavior change and avoiding a shameful response may account for some of the differences reported in the literature relating to effectiveness of text messaging interventions in overweight and obese adolescents  [4, 17] .\n\nConversely, messages not related to weight or healthy behaviors may be more effective at keeping adolescents engaged with an intervention. In this study, adolescents expressed a desire for more casual and positive text messages, which may have been more suited to preserving links with the intervention rather than eliciting behavior change. If the intervention aim was to preserve links with adolescents, then text messages would need to be carefully constructed to foster this sense of engagement but could be completely unrelated to the behavioral aims of the intervention. Message development based on self-determination theory would therefore aim to promote a sense of connection for the adolescent  [26] . To our knowledge, the use of text messaging interventions to foster engagement has not been tested independent of behavior change and should be explored in future research.\n\nThe current findings suggest that future studies would benefit from generating clear aims for text messaging interventions specifically relating to either behavior change or engagement, and designing the texts with these aims in mind. Similarly, evaluation methods need to be strengthened and appropriate measures used to assess whether the text messages actually achieve their intended aims."

    {
      "title": "Timing",
      "text": "Adolescents expressed a number of differing opinions regarding the timing of the text messages, suggesting that it may be most acceptable if timing is personalized to each participant's preferences. In the current intervention, messages were sent three times per week. Adolescents and parents consistently reported that the frequency of the text messages was excessive and they found that the messages became boring over time. This is in contrast to other studies with even greater frequencies of contact  [4, 5, 8, 12, 13]  where adolescents were reported to be accepting of daily texts, although 20% of participants in one study indicated that they got bored of receiving the same or similar text messages  [13] . Interestingly, only one of these studies  [4]  was directed at overweight and obese adolescents, suggesting that this group may have unique perceptions regarding the frequency of supportive text messages and this may be related to how well they are achieving their lifestyle goals. Ngyuen et al  [16]  sent a text message once per month on average to overweight and obese adolescents but suggested that this dose was possibly too low to have an impact. The desire for less frequent text messages in this study may be related to the sense of guilt overweight and obese adolescents describe when they are reminded about changes they aren't making, although it remains unclear as to whether this can prompt behavior change. These results highlight how messages can possibly invoke an undesirable response in overweight and obese adolescents. Text messages become personal because they are sent to the participant's phone and differ from other health messages on media such as television where the individual may be able to more easily ignore a message as they are perceived as not relevant to them. When an individual receives and reads the text message, they will make a decision as to how relevant or useful the information is for them. From the responses obtained, it appears that, in overweight and obese adolescents, health messages may invoke a response that reduces their motivation to change rather than stimulating them to continue to take action to increase their physical activity or improve their diet. Health researchers may therefore need to modify the logistics of text message delivery to best suit the aims of their intervention, be that engagement or behavior change."

    {
      "title": "Style",
      "text": "Focus group participants were unanimous in their call for more casually worded text messages. Adolescents have previously expressed a preference for health care providers to communicate via text using a natural tone while avoiding the use of text message \"slang\" as frequently used in adolescent-to-adolescent contact  [17] . Despite attempts to use less formal language than in the previous study, our research suggests that the tone we used was perceived as too professional by adolescents. The addition of symbols and emoticons (eg, exclamation marks and smiley faces) to text messages may help to convey a less formal tone. Although most text messaging studies have used tailored messages  [4] [5] [6] [7] 13, 17, 21, 28] , our research suggests that overweight and obese adolescents want them to be further customized to their individual goals and experiences. Adolescents also reported that negatively worded texts (eg, \"don't eat junk food\") were likely to increase the likelihood of actually performing those behaviors, supporting recent findings by Woolford et al  [17] . These authors  [17]  suggested that overweight and obese adolescents often want to avoid the psychological work associated with reflection and instead prefer tips and testimonials from other adolescents, yet our results suggest that overweight and obese adolescents in actuality do not find these helpful to assist with behavior change."

The views expressed by parents in this study were generally aligned with the opinions described by adolescents and were also useful in identifying inconsistencies described by individual adolescents whose views consistently differed from the overall group."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "As with all qualitative studies, there are potential limitations associated with participants reporting a view that may be perceived as socially acceptable, rather than their true opinion. It is possible that overweight and obese adolescents in particular may be prone to report in this way. The focus group facilitators in this study were known to the participants, which may have influenced participants to offer a more positive view on the use of text messages; however, the sometimes negative opinions expressed by parents and adolescents suggest this was not the case. The small size of the focus groups may have either encouraged or impeded discussion. It is also not possible to determine directly how the messages affected their behavior and if they took action. For example, some irritation with the messages may still have served as a reminder to increase their physical activity or improve their diet. The strengths of this study include an appropriate qualitative design to address the research question, a range of informants with directly relevant opinions for the research question, the inclusion of parents and adolescents, and provision of novel, in-depth information about the challenging topic of providing support to overweight and obese adolescents following an intensive intervention period."

      "title": "Implications for Research and Practice",
      "text": "This study presents several implications to consider in future research. First, overweight and obese adolescents may not know or have the ability to articulate how they would best be supported during the maintenance phase. Second, researchers should generate clear aims when planning a text message intervention, and develop appropriate methods of measuring success relative to the specific aims (for example engagement or behavior change). Third, timing and content of messages may need to be more individualized and may require ongoing input from adolescents to understand their preferences for receiving text messages. Fourth, reports of parent experiences may offer a useful secondary view of adolescent responses to text message interventions. Last, overweight and obese adolescents might be more susceptible to feelings of guilt or shame than non-obese adolescents when reminded about maintaining behavior change."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "Findings from this study suggest that text messages may have a useful role in interventions for overweight and obese adolescents but that adolescent opinions pre-intervention may not be very predictive of their actual experience and that it may be difficult to achieve both enhanced engagement and behavior change simultaneously. The results emphasize the importance of message tone, content, and timing as these factors appear to impact on how the messages will be received by overweight and obese adolescents. The potential to initiate feelings of shame in adolescent recipients of text messaging was identified as an important issue. The study also supported the use of process evaluation to help inform further interventions, and highlights the value of parent and adolescent reports. Future research should be clear on the engagement or efficacy aims for an intervention, develop messages to accommodate adolescent preferences in conjunction with an appropriate theory, and employ appropriate evaluation measures of engagement or effectiveness."
