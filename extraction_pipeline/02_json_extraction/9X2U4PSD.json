      "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant global public health issue, affecting approximately 294 million individuals and causing over 3 million deaths annually, ranking as the third leading cause of death globally.  1, 2 The substantial and increasing prevalence of COPD demands immediate attention as a critical health concern. The condition is associated with a range of impairments, including respiratory, physical, social, and emotional, reducing quality of life and limiting daily activities. Accurate early diagnosis and lifestyle management of COPD can play a crucial role in its long-term management. However, COPD management is complex, and the approach depends on the condition's severity, including intensity of symptoms, exacerbation frequency and severity, and hospital admissions. Access to credible information, competent providers, and effective medications pose major challenges for many patients.\n\nDigital health encompasses a spectrum of solutions that utilize digital technologies to meet health needs, including health information technology (HIT), telehealth and telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), wearable devices, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and digital therapeutics. These technologies have the potential to change how diseases are screened, diagnosed, and monitored and enable more precise profiling of disease progression, thus improving management. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and healthcare systems worldwide have been forced to rapidly adapt to digital health, particularly telehealth, now widely regarded as the \"new normal.\"  3  This review provides a comprehensive overview of the digital health landscape, including its various forms and applications in COPD management. Despite the potential benefits of digital health solutions, numerous challenges have hindered their development and implementation. Therefore, we also addressed some of the key barriers and opportunities that can facilitate development and widespread adoption of digital health services to support COPD management."

These devices, which include wristbands, armbands, smartwatches, rings, and eye wear, enable continuous monitoring in natural settings.  [21] [22] 2] [23]  For chronic diseases, wearable devices can provide longitudinal data that tracks patient progress, offering an alternative to more complex, uncomfortable, and costly monitoring methods.  24 The trend toward smaller, lighter, less obtrusive, and more comfortable wearable devices can promote higher adherence and enable sustained monitoring.  25 Additionally, wearable devices can wirelessly transmit data to mobile integration platforms, such as HUAWEI Health Kit and Apple HealthKit,  25  allowing patients and providers to better manage chronic conditions and promptly respond to exacerbations. For healthy individuals, wearable devices can track and monitor their health and fitness indicators, promoting wellness and the early detection of potential diseases.  26 leep-monitoring wearables are prevalent in such technologies. Although polysomnography is considered the gold standard for sleep monitoring, the process is demanding and costly, requiring experienced technicians. Sleep-monitoring devices are compatible with use at home, reducing the measures required for the process in hospital settings and minimizing \"first night bias\" effects. The data can be transmitted to cloud-based platforms, contributing to their popularity given the accessibility, convenience, and cost-effectiveness.  27 rist-worn sleep devices can capture daily steps and a range of sleep parameters, including heart rate, breathing volume, snoring, hours of deep and light sleep, sleep duration, and duration of awakenings.  28 Additionally, wearable devices utilizing photoplethysmography can monitor pulse wave data, while lightweight wearable sleep monitors can help in the assessment of sleep apnea and the improvement of sleep quality.  24, 29 rthermore, headband-like wearable devices can capture brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG).  30 Despite these advances, the accuracy of wearable sleep-monitoring devices remains limited and sleep hours tend to be overestimated.  31"

This is especially beneficial for patients with chronic diseases or weakened immune systems, as it helps prevent infection. Virtual visits facilitate audiovisual interactions between patients and clinicians through information communication technology, and are typically conducted synchronously.  41 They support patient health assessments, monitoring of medication regimens, and social engagement. Elderly individuals receiving home healthcare are more likely to benefit, such as through improved social integration and increased medication adherence.  42 irtual visits reduce travel and appointment wait times, making medical care more accessible and convenient,  43  and offer several advantages to patients. First, they increase the convenience of medical appointments, reduce the time and effort associated with medication management, and allow patient health to be monitored. Second, they provide easier access to information and support for patients with chronic conditions, thus improving care continuity and quality. Furthermore, patient feedback has indicated that virtual visits are often associated with increased comfort, safety, humanization, and satisfaction compared to in-person appointments. In addition, they can lower the cost of care for patients, including travel expenses and lost income from missed work. Patients may also consider asynchronous visits more convenient. These allow patients to manage visits based on their own schedule, communicate sensitive information more comfortably, and better capture guidance from providers.  44 As the demand for immediate and convenient access grows, virtual healthcare will continue to expand.  45"

Unfortunately, many patients with COPD face challenges, such as limited awareness of their condition, difficulty accessing resources, and insufficient clinical support, hindering their compliance with management requirements.  60 igital health has been used to address these challenges in COPD management, as it enables healthcare providers to remotely monitor patient situations and offer interventions. Patients can also access health information, track their condition, and communicate with healthcare providers. reduced pulmonary function is correlated with increased frequency of exacerbations and hospitalization and elevated mortality risk.  61, 62 Due to its standardization and widespread utilization, PFT is opportune for the development and implementation of AI for test result interpretation and diagnosis.  63 opalovic et al. demonstrated that AI-based software perfectly matched PFT pattern interpretations (100%) and assigned correct diagnoses in 82% of cases, while PFT pattern recognition by pulmonologists matched guidelines in 74.4% of cases and diagnoses were correct in 44.6% of them.  64 Put simply, AI can interpret PFT and reach diagnoses with greater accuracy than an individual pulmonologist, approaching the level of a panel of expert practitioners.  64, 65 However, these results should be interpreted with caution. The probabilities of the different AI-generated diagnoses were shaped by the prevalence of diseases in the training data set.

A study utilizing the EHRs of the United Kingdom's NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde demonstrated that a limited number of variables, including laboratory data and prescription information, derived from routine EHRs could predict the 90-day mortality rate of patients following hospitalization for COPD.  75 However, this model may also apply to patients with various chronic conditions and may not offer a significant advantage in terms of a more specific definition of COPD.  75 Similarly, Bloom et al. considered two primary care COPD cohorts from the UK's EHRs to develop a 12-month mortality prediction model known as the BARC index. This is a risk score that relies solely on routinely collected nonspecialist information, and is thus capable of identifying patients seen in primary care who could benefit from palliative care.  76 These studies utilized relatively straightforward statistical methods to develop risk prediction models for large patient populations. With sufficient data, such tools can be advanced by implementing ML and AI techniques.\n\nVarious factors-such as FEV1% predicted (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), prior exacerbations, demographic characteristics, health-related quality of life, laboratory results, and quantitative CT imaging-have been linked to morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD.  77, 78 The challenges in comprehending the complex and potentially nonlinear relationships among these factors and COPD could potentially be addressed through AI and ML techniques. These technologies have the potential to enhance predictive models for health outcomes, and widespread EHR use facilitates their integration into healthcare. Adibi et al. developed a mixed-effects model known as ACCEPT (Acute COPD Exacerbation Prediction Tool), which leverages ML to predict COPD progression over a 1-year period by analyzing data from clinical trials. This model enables a nuanced prediction of the rate and severity of exacerbations to assist clinicians in decision making. It can combine predicted risk with estimated effects from randomized trials to personalize treatment. The granular predictions produced by ACCEPT enable clinicians to accurately stratify patients based on their risk of exacerbations, even when two patients have similar histories of exacerbations.  79 Subsequently, the team updated ACCEPT by incorporating individual-level data from multiple studies and refining the ML methods used. ACCEPT 2.0 can predict the risk and severity of COPD exacerbations with high accuracy, regardless of a patient's history of exacerbations.  80 Use of EHRs in conjunction with ML presents several advantages in risk prediction for a variety of clinical conditions. These include the ability to conduct risk assessments remotely, the capacity for complex and sophisticated analyses to enhance prediction accuracy, and the ability to cover a broad spectrum of clinical conditions.  59"

Asynchronous telehealth refers to the \"store and forward\" approach where live interaction with the patient is not necessary during data collection. Data is collected in file format and transmitted to healthcare providers via a secure internet connection for analysis. On the other hand, synchronous telehealth involves real-time virtual interactions between patients and healthcare providers, utilizing technologies such as video, telephone, or web-based applications. This form of telehealth enables live, direct engagement between patients and providers.  83 In most studies, remote devices were used to transmit recorded data, which is then reviewed by healthcare providers asynchronously. A recent meta-analysis incorporating six randomized controlled trials found a reduction of 80% in exacerbations among patients with COPD enrolled in digital health programs compared to controls, although these studies had limited sample sizes (n < 100).  84 While the overall impact of telehealth on COPD patients compared to conventional care remains unclear, telehealth interventions may offer short-term benefits to quality of life and could decrease hospital readmissions for any reason.  83 Given the lack of evidence of harm from telehealth, such interventions may be considered a valuable supplementary healthcare resource, subject to professional evaluation and tailored to individual needs.  83"

These devices are available for different types of inhalers, including metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers, and can be integrated into the inhalers themselves or attached as separate devices.  90 They record the number, date, and time of each actuation, enabling real-time monitoring of inhaler usage. EIM devices are composed of three components: a sensor, a software application, and a data transfer mechanism.  91 atients attach electronic medication monitors to their inhalers, which passively record each actuation. The data are transmitted wirelessly to mobile devices that support the application and then uploaded to the cloud for comprehensive analysis. Sensors in EIM devices detect changes in pressure, physical switches, sound waves, inspiratory flow, or vibrations to measure each actuation.  91 Additionally, the analysis conducted using this system can provide automated feedback to patients and healthcare providers. Alshabani et al. enrolled 39 patients with COPD who had a high utilization of healthcare services, with an average duration of EIM of 280.5 days.  92 Results showed that EIM integration with a disease management program may reduce healthcare utilization in patients with COPD who have a history of high healthcare utilization.

PR performed in home settings has the potential to be more effective and result in long-term integration of exercise regimens into daily life compared to traditional facility-based programs.  101 Although the field of telerehabilitation is still evolving, it has been proposed as an alternative to traditional PR especially for patients facing significant barriers to access.  102 vidence supporting telerehabilitation is currently being established, but various studies have indicated that it can lower the risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations, both when compared to no rehabilitation and traditional rehabilitation.  101, 103 Additionally, telerehabilitation may present economic benefits compared to traditional PR.  101"

      "text": "The integration of digital health into the clinical workflow is an area of ongoing research. Digital health has the potential to play an important role in COPD diagnosis and treatment. AI and ML applied to screening of patients with COPD can aid in the assessment of lung function and may allow for COPD diagnosis using CT imaging. In COPD management, telehealth can improve the approach for patients, including through the use of AI and ML to predict exacerbations and digital technology to enhance inhaler use and increase patient compliance. The foundation for digital health is established through EHRs, whereas mobile health, IoT, virtual visits, and wearable devices serve as interconnected components with AI and ML enabling these methods. However, despite its potential, digital health in large and complex health systems remains limited. Its implementation in the care process presents challenges, and there are currently few strategies to facilitate integration into the workflow of large health systems.  104 To address this, Marwaha et al. identified nine key considerations to help organizations strategically adopt and implement digital health, including product selection, return on investment, clinical value, internal champions, implementers, data assets needed for functionality, alignment with institutional priorities, implementation requirements, and long-term operations. By taking these into account, health systems can determine the best course of action for selecting or developing a digital health solution, assess the value of existing tools, ensure sufficient resources for deployment and long-term use, and develop an implementation plan.  104"

      "title": "| DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE REGULATORY STANDARDS FOR DIGITAL HEALTH",
      "text": "Integrating digital health into healthcare practice is complex and involves multiple stakeholders, including patients who transmit data, healthcare providers and universities who receive it, and service delivery platforms comprising both private and public entities. Digital health is associated with several potential risks, including that of telehealth not meeting the standard of care; equipment or system failure; potential for abuse and manipulation of electronic data; inadequate data protection with regard to security, authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy; and difficulties determining the responsibilities and obligations of all parties involved.  105 rom a legal standpoint, clarifying the responsibilities of each stakeholder is essential through comprehensive documentation, including policies, contracts, and agreements. 106 However, there is currently no universally applicable solution to the legal challenges associated with digital health.\n\nSafeguarding patient privacy in digital health is critical. Compliance with legislative and regulatory frameworks alone does not guarantee privacy, but is necessary to establish privacy as the default operating mode. This implies that privacy protections must be proactively established to prevent potential violations. Despite being a relatively new and experimental field in terms of scientific, technical, and economic advancements, the complexities of privacy-related issues must be considered at every stage of the development process, from conceptualization to implementation. Acknowledgment that privacy in digital health cannot be treated lightly is imperative.  106 ata management is a critical aspect of digital health. Regulating potential data mismanagement by healthcare providers and companies while promoting digital access to EHRs for patients is essential. 107 Shifting toward a scenario in which individuals hold control over their personal health data, as opposed to large commercial organizations, may prove effective in mitigating the risk of data mismanagement. Both the US and the EU have taken steps toward enhancing patient rights to access their health data. 108,109 However, further measures and laws are needed to strike a balance between enabling patients to access their health data and ensuring the protection of such data from unauthorized or unintended access."

      "title": "| THE FUTURE OF DIGITAL HEALTH",
      "text": "The advent of information technology has rendered digital health an integral aspect of medical care. Digital health has applications in various healthcare domains, including disease screening and prediction, clinical decision analysis, and disease management. COPD management, in particular, has the potential to benefit significantly from digital health approaches. Through mobile health applications, patients with COPD can record relevant daily entries, such as related to their respiratory symptoms, workouts, and mood. This data can be shared with healthcare providers via EHRs, and interventions can be facilitated through telehealth services to enhance medication adherence. AI and ML can then analyze this data to predict the risk of exacerbations, which can inform the necessity of virtual or in-person visits. Digital therapeutics may also be developed to help patients monitor disease activity.\n\nAlthough digital health offers numerous benefits, including a reduced workload for clinicians and improved service efficiency, several challenges are yet to be addressed. From a clinical standpoint, the AI and ML components of digital health introduce a level of uncertainty that could cause skepticism and limit their practical application in the short term. The current diagnostic process for exacerbations primarily depends on the subjective evaluation of COPD symptoms, and validated digital methods for objectively predicting exacerbations are lacking.\n\nFurthermore, digital health may amplify existing healthcare inequalities, particularly among the elderly. Although digital interventions can benefit elderly individuals with chronic illnesses who require longterm care, digital exclusion remains an important concern.  110 Estimates suggest that 37% of the world's ~7.8 billion population are digitally excluded.  111 In China, approximately 200 million elderly individuals lack Internet access, limiting their ability to utilize Internet-based health services.  112 This digital divide negatively impacts the elderly, and it is crucial that this issue receive the necessary attention and consideration. Although barriers to digital equity exist for the elderly, they are not insurmountable. First, the challenges they face in accessing digital health can be mitigated through clear communication of the benefits and drawbacks of digital health, as well as the provision of supplementary support and resources. Second, health applications can be adapted to accommodate limitations they face.  113 hird, they can be proactively educated on the use of smartphones, applications, and online medical services. Finally, the government can play a role in promoting the advantages of digital health and increasing its reach in rural communities, particularly among the elderly.  112 vidence has shown that the digital equity gap is narrowing in regions where the elderly are encouraged to become familiar with new technologies.  114 As digital health adoption grows, ensuring it is adapted to meet the needs of this segment is essential to fully close the gap and provide equal access to all.\n\nThe digital health revolution is a cultural transformation that brings disruptive technologies to both patients and healthcare providers, thereby altering the traditional doctor-patient relationship.  115 It not only supports ongoing efforts to achieve collaborative health management but also provides opportunities for selfmanagement, particularly for those suffering from chronic conditions, keeping patients informed about their health and promoting healthy behaviors.  116 It also allows patients to gain a deeper understanding of their condition, which is characterized by increased patient empowerment and a growing recognition of the biopsychosocial-digital approach to health. As a result, clinicians are shifting from gatekeepers of medical knowledge to guides for their patients navigating the complex landscape of health information.  117 To adapt to these changes, clinicians must possess knowledge of and a positive attitude toward digital technologies, the doctor-patient relationship should become a partnership, and compassionate healing must remain the cornerstone of healthcare.  117 Patients, in turn, should engage with their clinicians about the information they receive and screen it for accuracy to enhance the doctor-patient relationship and improve medical services. Effective doctor-patient communication can lead to improved clinical outcomes.  118"

      "title": "| CONCLUSION",
      "text": "The mainstream integration of digital health into medical practice is a potential future scenario as technology advances, leading to the creation of new clinical models. However, the absence of established best practices poses challenges. While some studies are exploring the integration of digital health for COPD management into clinical care, these initiatives lack a comprehensive framework and face limited funding. To achieve successful implementation, strategies promoting the adoption of new technologies must be developed concurrently. This requires the design and evaluation of new technologies based on established guidelines to build a robust evidence base that supports digital health. The design of digital health features and functionality should also be user-centered to promote long-term utilization. Finally, appropriate regulatory processes and adequate tools and security measures are crucial for managing the large amounts of data generated."
