  "title": "Bidirectional Text Messaging to Monitor Endocrine Therapy Adherence and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Breast Cancer",
  "abstract": "Introduction Up to 40% of patients with breast cancer may not adhere to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Therapy-related adverse effects (AEs) are important contributors to nonadherence. We developed a bidirectional text-message application, BETA-Text, that simultaneously tracks adherence, records symptoms, and alerts the clinical team. Patients and Methods We piloted our intervention in 100 patients. The intervention consisted of text messages to which patients responded for 3 months: daily, evaluating adherence; weekly, evaluating medication-related AEs; and monthly, regarding barriers to adherence. Concerning responses prompted a telephone call from a clinic nurse. The primary objective was to assess patient acceptance of this intervention using self-reported surveys. To compare participants with the general population at our institution, we assessed 100 consecutively treated patients as historical controls using medical record review. Results We approached 141 consecutive patients, 100 (71%) of whom agreed to participate and 89 of whom completed the intervention. A majority of patients reported that the intervention was easy to use (98%) and helpful in taking their medication (96%). Four patients discontinued therapy before 3 months, and 93% of patients who continued therapy took \u2021 80% of their medication. The frequency of AEs reported by participants via text was higher than that reported in clinical trials: hot flashes (72%), arthralgias (53%), and vaginal symptoms (35%). Approximately 39% of patients reported one or more severe AE that prompted an alert to the provider team to call the patient. Conclusion A daily bidirectional text-messaging system can monitor adherence and identify AEs and other barriers to adherence in real time without inconveniencing patients. AEs of endocrine therapy, as detected using this texting approach, are more prevalent than reported in clinical trials.",

      "text": "The standard of care for women with hormone receptor (HR) -positive breast cancer is 5 to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI); these agents reduce recurrences by 30% to 50% and improve survival.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  However, 30% to 40% of patients may discontinue adjuvant ET before completing the recommended 5 years, which may compromise the ultimate outcome.  [4] [5] ] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  Many questions remain regarding what factors drive nonadherence, how these change over time, and, most importantly, how to increase adherence.\n\nRetrospective studies have shown decreased survival in patients who discontinue ET early or are nonadherent to ET. Analysis of a large provider database showed an 81% survival rate at 10 years for women who continued adjuvant ET compared with 74% for those who discontinued.  12 Among those who continued therapy, survival was 82% for patients who were adherent to therapy compared with 78% in women who were nonadherent; both early discontinuation and nonadherence were independent predictors of mortality.  12 Given that approximately 75% of breast cancers are HR positive, new mechanisms to improve adherence to ET could have a profound impact on survival. common.  [4] [5] [6] [7] 7] [8] [18] [19] [20]  During treatment with ET, visits with providers are infrequent (one to four times per year),  21  and patients may be nonadherent until their next appointment to discuss concerns. Other factors include forgetting to take the medication, concern about polypharmacy, financial constraints, and belief that the medication is not necessary. Fear of future AEs may prevent some patients from initiating or adhering to therapy.  12, [22] [23] 3] [24] [25] [26]  Therefore, any attempt to improve adherence should address multiple potential contributors.\n\nWe developed a bidirectional text-messaging application, BETA (Breast Cancer Endocrine Therapy Adherence) -Text, which allows patients to report adherence and express concerns about AEs in real time, thereby allowing the clinical team to address issues before adherence is affected.\n\nOur study was a pilot to assess the convenience and patient acceptance of BETA-Text in patients with early-stage breast cancer initiating adjuvant ET. We hypothesized that BETA-Text would be broadly acceptable to patients, practically feasible in a busy clinical practice, and capable of capturing patient-reported AEs and adherence patterns."

Eligible patients had histologically confirmed stage I to III HR-positive breast cancer and were recommended adjuvant hormonal therapy according to standard National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.  21 All patients were enrolled before initiating ET. Patients owned a personal cell phone and were responsible for any textmessage costs, and $50 gift cards were distributed upon study completion as compensation. Demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics were obtained via medical record review.\n\nA group of historical controls was identified to compare the participants using BETA-Text with the general population of patients at our institution. Women with stage I to III HR-positive breast cancer who initiated ET were identified consecutively via the electronic appointment calendar, starting the day before the study was opened for enrollment and looking retrospectively until 100 women were identified. ET continuation status and numbers of office visits and patient-initiated telephone calls were assessed via medical record review using an explicit abstraction instrument.\n\nAll participants signed informed consent. This study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of Yale University."

      "text": "BETA-Text used system-generated texts via CarePlanManager developed by CircleLinkHealth (Stamford, CT), with content developed by Yale investigators. The intervention is depicted in Figure  1  and consisted of three types of text messages to which patients responded: daily medication reminders, weekly AE questions, and monthly texts regarding barriers to adherence. Alerts were forwarded to the clinical team if a patient reported three consecutive missed doses (no response was considered a missed dose), more than six missed doses within the previous 30 days, or severe AEs (7 to 9 on the severity scale). Participants also received a reminder text message when their prescription refill was due.\n\nWhen an alert was created by BETA-Text, the patient was called by a practice nurse to discuss the problem. For missed doses, the reason for the missed dose was explored, and for medication AEs, standardized lifestyle modifications were recommended (Table  1 ); if further intervention was required, the patient was offered an earlier appointment with her treating physician. Reported barriers were triaged to participants' provider team, the clinic nurses, or resource specialists as appropriate.\n\nPatients were given an in-person tutorial and a written pamphlet of instructions, a scale for guidance in AE severity, and a telephone number and e-mail address to contact in case of questions. The study coordinator confirmed the patient's start date of ET by telephone or e-mail. Patients could end their participation in BETA-Text at any time."

      "text": "Participants completed questionnaires that assessed BETA-Text in terms of perceived benefit, cost, and convenience. Patients were asked to rate on a 4-point Likert scale how much they agreed with statements about perceived benefit, cost of text messaging, and convenience: very much, quite a lot, somewhat, or not at all. Patients were specifically asked whether they paid for text messages and, if so, how much. Finally, patients were asked to estimate how many doses they had missed during the previous month (none, one to two, three to six, six to 12, or . 12), with six or fewer missed doses corresponding to > 80% adherence.\n\nBETA-Text participants were classified as having initiated ET once they responded yes to one daily reminder text message and were classified as having discontinued ET if they withdrew from the study and cited discontinuation as the reason. For historical controls, initiation was the date of initial prescription, and discontinuation was determined by medical record review. The total numbers of clinic visits with a provider and telephone calls handled by the telephone triage nurse were counted from initiation of ET until 90 days afterward. Three specific AEs (hot flashes, arthralgias, and vaginal symptoms) were assessed by BETA-Text, and patients could free text additional AEs; severity was rated on a scale of 1 to 9 so that only one digit was entered in response to minimize error.\n\nAdherence to ET was measured in two ways using BETA-Text. The overall participant adherence rate was measured as the proportion of yes responses to the daily medication text reminder over the 3-month pilot. A participant was considered adherent if she responded that she took > 80% of prescribed pills during the course of the 3-month study period.  12, 22, 27 We also examined adherence by week; patients were fully adherent if they took 100% of the prescribed medication for that week, adherent if they took > 80%, and nonadherent if they took , 80%."

Of these, 53 were created for missed doses of ET. The remainder were for severe AEs. Among patients who participated in BETA-Text, there were 114 office visits with providers compared with 101 office visits among controls (P = .31); there were 32 patient-initiated telephone calls for BETA-Text participants versus 38 patient-initiated telephone calls among controls (P = .82).\n\nEnd-of-study surveys were completed by 85 participants, all of whom completed the 3-month pilot, with the results depicted in Figure  3 .

      "text": "We describe a new text-messaging application that was designed to simultaneously monitor adherence to a daily medication, capture AEs, and alert the provider team to call if the severity of AEs exceeded or adherence dropped below predefined thresholds. We found that BETA-Text was both easy to use and tolerable for patients, with minimal impact on daily clinical operations. Patients were engaged in text messaging and felt that overall, BETA-Text was helpful. In fact, nearly 70% reported that they would be at least somewhat interested in continuing BETA-Text after completion of the pilot.\n\nEnsuring adherence to ET is a significant challenge in the treatment of HR-positive breast cancer. Multiple studies have reported ET adherence rates, defined as taking at least 80% of the prescribed medications over a specified period of time, to be between 60% and 80%.  22, 23, 28 Studies have also suggested that medical records Abbreviations: AI, aromatase inhibitor; BETA, Breast Cancer Endocrine Therapy Adherence; ER, estrogen receptor; ET, endocrine therapy; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; NA, not applicable; PR, progesterone receptor. *Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; these patients had at least clinical stage I disease before chemotherapy.\n\n0.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 8 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 90.0 100.0 Fully adherent Adherent Nonadherent Discontinued Week of Intervention Percentage of Patients Patients were deemed fully adherent if they reported that they took their endocrine therapy pill every day during that week (100% adherence). Patients were adherent if they took > 80% of their pills during that week. Patients were nonadherent if they took , 80% of their pills. Patients who never started endocrine therapy or discontinued endocrine therapy completely are included as discontinued. Patients who withdrew from the study are not included as of the week of withdrawal.\n\nunder-report treatment-related AEs, and patients themselves may not bring up all AEs that they experience during a physician visit.  29, 30 though new tools and novel technologies are under development to monitor patient adherence and capture AEs in real time and in a patient-oriented way, prior attempts to improve adherence to ET have focused on unidirectional approaches using enhanced educational materials, with limited efficacy.  31, 32 The Southwest Oncology Group S1105 study examined the effect of twice-per-week unidirectional text reminders on AI adherence, with final results pending.\n\nMost patients reported being adherent to their medication. Although response by text message is an imperfect measure of adherence, because it relies on self-report, it is probably similar to a pill diary, which has been a traditional measure of adherence in many clinical trials. In our study, the reported adherence in the last month of the study was lower when reported through than via end-of-study survey.\n\nOne striking finding of our study was the prevalence of AEs. Ninety-two percent of patients reported at least one AE, and 38.8% reported at least one severe AE. The frequency of hot flashes reported by our participants via text was higher than previously reported in clinical trials, although the instruments used to collect these data were different; hot flashes were reported in 67.7% of patients receiving AIs and 80.6% of patients receiving tamoxifen, compared with 35.7% and 40.9% in the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial, respectively.  33 Arthralgias 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 1 0 0 My current treatment poses a financial hardship on me I spend too much of my own money on this treatment The cost of my treatment prevents me from buying other things The cost of the text messages was too high This application helped me with my breast cancer treatment This application helped me take my medications I found this application easy to use There were too many text messages This application took up too much of my time I would like to continue using this application Not at all Somewhat Quite a lot Very much Percentage of Patients   34  One concern that may arise with a newer technology to address adherence is that older patients might not be willing or able to use the technology.\n\nIn fact, we found that the patients who enrolled in the BETA-Text pilot study were younger than those who declined participation. However, the oldest enrolled patient was age 77 years, and she responded to 94% of text messages (and was 93% adherent to ET). Another concern might be that a text-messaging intervention might be possible only for patients with higher socioeconomic status because of costs incurred. The enrolled patients were predominantly white and had private insurance, but there was no difference between these patients and the 100 historical controls in terms of race, ethnicity, or insurance status. One patient did not have text messaging included in her mobile plan, only three patients incurred any fees related to text messaging, and no patients reported that the cost of text messages was too high.\n\nOur study has a number of limitations. We collected historical controls to assess the degree to which participants were representative of the population treated at our institution. This approach is limited by the amount of information contained in medical records; although we were able to quantify rates of discontinuation, we were unable to quantify daily adherence (ie, the percentage of pills taken) in our controls. Participants differed from controls in pathologic stage and in 21-gene recurrence assay risk category. Stage and inherent risk of the cancer itself may influence adherence to and persistence with ET; Hershman et al  22  reported an increased risk of discontinuation of ET in women with node-positive disease. In our study, seven of the controls discontinued ET before the end of 3 months, compared with four participants in BETA-Text; however, this pilot was not powered to detect a statistical difference in continuation between the two groups. Furthermore, measurement of discontinuation is limited by the detail of the documentation and the degree to which the patient is forthcoming. Nonetheless, both of these figures are consistent with prior retrospective analyses suggesting a 1-year ET discontinuation rate of approximately 20%.  22 Although as many as 12% to 16% of patients eligible for ET do not initiate this treatment,  35  we enrolled only patients who indicated that they planned to take ET and were able to confirm in 98 that they had initiated ET.\n\nOur study builds upon prior studies of adherence to ET in breast cancer in two important ways. First, we address many facets of adherence: patient education, AE management, financial constraints, and remembering to take the medication. Second, this is the first adherence-improving tool to our knowledge that allows structured patient communication with providers outside of the clinic for assistance in overcoming barriers to medication adherence. We believe that BETA-Text will improve adherence by allowing a more complete measurement of medication adherence and by identifying and addressing AEs in real time. BETA-Text represents not only an adherence-enhancement tool that can be tested in a randomized clinical trial but also a novel approach to patient engagement and patient-provider communication that could change oncology practice.\n\nDOI:  https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.17.00015 Published online on ascopubs.org/journal/cci on May 23, 2017."
