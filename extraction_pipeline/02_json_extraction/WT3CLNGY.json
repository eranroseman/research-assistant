  "title": "Empowering Patients during Hospitalization: Perspectives on Inpatient Portal Use",
  "abstract": "Background Patients have demonstrated an eagerness to use portals to access their health information and connect with care providers. While outpatient portals have been extensively studied, there is a recognized need for research that examines inpatient portals. Objective We conducted this study to improve our understanding about the role of a portal in the context of inpatient care. Our study focused on a large sample of the general adult inpatient population and obtained perspectives from both patients and care team members about inpatient portal use. Methods We interviewed patients (n \u00bc 120) who used an inpatient portal during their hospitalization at 15 days or 6 months after discharge to learn about their portal use. We also interviewed care team members (n \u00bc 331) 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after inpatient portal implementation to collect information about their ongoing perspectives about patients' use of the portal. \n Results The perspectives of patients and care team members generally converged on their views of the inpatient portal. Three features-(1) ordering meals, (2) looking up health information, and (3) viewing the care team-were most commonly used; the secure messaging feature was less commonly used and of some concern to care team members. The inpatient portal benefited patients in four main ways: (1) promoted independence, (2) reduced anxiety, (3) informed families, and (4) increased empowerment. Conclusion Inpatient portals are recognized as a tool that can enhance the delivery of patient-centered care. In addition to empowering patients by increasing their sense of control, inpatient portals can support family members and caregivers throughout the hospital stay. Given the consistency of perspectives about portal use across patients and care team members, our findings suggest that inpatient portals may facilitate shifts in organizational culture that increase the patient centeredness of care and improve patient experience in the hospital context.",

      "title": "Background and Significance",
      "text": "The patient experience during hospitalization is often stressful as each patient faces the uncertainty of changes in their health. The hospital setting, however, can serve as a trigger for patient engagement, whereby patients are integrated as active participants in their ongoing health care.  [1] [2] ] [3]  As such, aspects of patient experience in the hospital setting have been shown to positively influence health outcomes; patients reporting positive patient-provider communication  4  or optimal shared decision making  5  achieve better health outcomes including self-reported physical and mental health, adherence to quality of care measures (e.g., statin and aspirin use), and decreased emergency room visits, as compared with those reporting poor patient experience. Identifying the factors that influence the patient experience is important for implementing strategies that support patient engagement and ultimately achieve better health outcomes.\n\nWith the goal of improving patient engagement, the movement toward patient-centered care seeks to address factors such as care coordination, communication, and involvement of family and friends that influence the patient experience.  6 Hospitals that have achieved high performance in patient-centered care have identified strategies that have improved patient experience, such as a culture of commitment to serving patients and their families; an effort to enhance patient-provider interactions through responsiveness, proactive communication, and caring behaviors; and an effort to educate care providers on the importance of patient experiences.  7 In this context, patient portals have emerged as a technology that helps hospitals provide patient-centered care by increasing accessibility to health information and supporting patient-provider communication.  8, 9 ecent studies provide evidence that patients are eager to adopt patient portals to access their personal health information (PHI) as well as maintain relationships with their providers.  10 As a reflection of this interest, the use of patient portals to manage PHI and communicate with care providers has continually increased over time.  11, 12 While predominantly implemented in the outpatient setting, patient portals have nonetheless been shown to improve patient engagement with their health care and providers.  8 atient portals tailored for the inpatient experience are gaining interest as a means to improve patient-centered care during hospitalization. Studies have noted that patients find access to their PHI helpful during hospitalization, and desire additional information regarding their health care in a format that can help them remember details that may otherwise only be provided verbally from a care provider.  13, 14 Inpatient portals, like outpatient portals, provide access to medical information and a patient-provider communication platform. Currently, studies of inpatient portals lag behind those of outpatient portals, and there is a recognized need for research that examines the impact of inpatient portals on patient-centered care and health outcomes.  15"

      "text": "We conducted an extensive qualitative study, including interviews with both patients and care team members, as part of a system-wide implementation of an inpatient portal at a large Midwestern academic medical center (AMC) consisting of six hospitals and 53 outpatient units. This AMC utilizes the Epic Systems Corporation (Verona, Wisconsin, United States) electronic health record (EHR) which includes the outpatient portal, MyChart, and the inpatient portal, MyChart Bedside. Upon admission, nurses conduct an assessment to determine if the patient should be offered an Android tablet equipped with the MyChart Bedside application, based on the following criteria: over age 18, English speaking, nonprisoner, and physically and cognitively capable of managing the technology. Both tablet use and study participation are voluntary. After the patient agrees that they would like access to the tablet during their hospital stay, the care team provisions the tablet, syncs it with the patient's EHR, and instructs the patient to create an account and personal identification number. The tablet is connected to the Internet so that patients can also use it for other purposes such as accessing social media, email, and entertainment.\n\nThe MyChart Bedside application consists of eight features listed in \u25baTable 1. Each hospital unit determines their own workflow for provisioning the tablet to patients and documenting patient acceptance of the tablet. The majority of units require a nurse to assess eligibility and interest in tablet use, but the actual provisioning of the tablet to the patient is often the task of the unit's patient care assistant (i. e., a nursing assistant). All care team members were trained in the provisioning process and overall purpose of MyChart Bedside through a variety of means including in-service training, online modules, and peer-to-peer demonstrations; further, \"super users\" who received additional training were available on most units.\n\nAll interviews were conducted between January 2017 and May 2018. The Ohio State University's Institutional Review Board approved this study."

Phase 1 interviews (n \u00bc 60) took place 15 days after discharge and phase 2 interviews (n \u00bc 60) took place 6 months after discharge. We investigated these two time periods to capture Applied Clinical Informatics Vol. 10 No. 1/2019 information that went beyond initial impressions of portal use by the patient, providing immediate impressions from the first phase of interviews, and more lasting impressions 6 months postdischarge. The demographic characteristics of these interviewed patients are presented in \u25baTable 2, by phase.\n\nWe used a semistructured interview guide that asked questions about patients' experiences with the inpatient portal and benefits they perceived from using this new technology. Please see the Supplementary Material (available in the online version) for a copy of the patient interview guides. Interviews lasted approximately 15 minutes each and were audio-recorded and then transcribed verbatim. Interview transcripts were deidentified so that interviewee information was not included.\n\nCare Team Member Interviews: With care team members, we conducted three phases of in-person interviews with nurses, patient care assistants, and unit clinic assistants (i.e., unit administrative assistants) across the 53 hospital units. Phase 1 interviews (n \u00bc 105) took place within 4 weeks of implementation of the MyChart Bedside application; phase 2 interviews (n \u00bc 112) were conducted 6 months postimplementation; and phase 3 (n \u00bc 114) interviews were conducted 12 months postimplementation. We conducted multiple phases of interviews with staff because we were interested in following their perceptions about inpatient portal use over time as they gained greater exposure to the inpatient portal and observed patients' use of the portal tool. Across phases, we completed 331 care team member interviews, as shown in \u25baTable 2.\n\nWe used a different semistructured interview guide to conduct care team member interviews and asked questions about both care team members' experiences and perceptions of patients' experiences with the inpatient portal (i.e., based  Request a service or item I would like \"We had a patient order flowers for their wife and he\u2026had delivered here for when she came to visit and that kind of thing we have had a couple of those where if we hadn't of started this we wouldn't have known that was necessarily an option.\"\n\nMake notes Note to self \"I actually had a deaf patient that was unable to speak and it was much easier for him to type out his messages.\"\n\non their observations and recollections). Please see the Supplementary Material (available in the online version) for a copy of the care team member interview guides.\n\nInterviewees were invited to participate in these brief interviews by research team members who visited each unit across the six hospitals. Any care team member who was available during the hour-long timeframe when the research team was on their unit was able to participate in an interview if they were interested. Care team member interviews lasted from 5 to 20 minutes each with an average duration of 10 minutes. These interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and deidentified."

      "text": "Consistent with rigorous qualitative methods,  16  transcribed interviews were both inductively and deductively analyzed. Our first step was to develop a preliminary coding dictionary based on questions asked in the interviews.  17 The subsequent step involved four members of the research team coding four transcripts to refine the coding dictionary and explore the emergence of new codes in the data. The refined dictionary was used by two members of the research team to code all remaining transcripts. Frequent meetings were held throughout the coding process to ensure reliability of coding and agreement about the creation and definitions of new codes as they emerged, consistent with a grounded theory approach.  18 Saturation of the themes was achieved, as reflected by the consistency of comments from patients and care team members around the key concepts that emerged. This comprehensive and iterative approach to our analysis thus ensures the trustworthiness of our methods with respect to credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability of our findings.  19 We used ATLAS.ti (version 6.0) qualitative data analysis software to support our coding and analysis process.\n\nConsidering patients' and care team members' experiences with the inpatient portal, we were interested in perspectives about both use of the portal features and the implications of portal use, as we describe below."

As one patient told us, \"I was able to see my vitals, because sometimes the nurses are kind of in a hurry so they would just hurry up take my vitals and say thank you, even if it was in the middle of the night and I was sleeping or something. So, I could check the next morning and see what my vitals were the night before.\" Another patient noted how having access to that information at any time was helpful so that one could go back and review the information on their own time: \"Definitely because when you're medicated and you're in pain, you don't always remember everything when they 're telling you, test results or, you know, what you can do. So, it's helpful to have it to be able to go back and refresh, you know, what you've maybe not heard clearly.\" Care team members echoed this sentiment. As one reflected, \"So, I think that's like good for them to have it right there in front of them, so that they can look at them and know what medications they're taking and stuff like that. So, they can compare like what they're taking at home, what's new, what's old.\""

Patients reported that they liked being able to see their providers' names and faces, and this helped them to remember who was on their care team. One patient stated, \"Well if I wasn't sure of somebody's name or something, it was kind of cool because it had everyone's pictures there so I was able to remember names a lot easier...\" Several patients particularly appreciated the ability to see care team members because it helped them recognize their own physicians. As one patient noted, \"That was kind of a neat little feature of MyChart that I ran into, the care team there, with names. Sometimes the doctor comes by and introduces himself and the name goes right out of my head because I'm paying attention to other things. So, I could go back and I get that name. And the pictures with it.\" A care team member similarly explained how a patient appreciated this feature: \"And she was 92 and she's showing me, 'Look here's the care team. What's your name?

As one explained, \"I tell the patients that if you do send a message, it should be routine in nature\u2026and then two being you shouldn't be time sensitive. Usually if they put a message in there they might not get a response up to like 24 hours. So routine stuff that is not time sensitive.

Offering a portal in the inpatient environment allows the patient to do these actions on their own. For example, one patient explained, \"I liked being able to see what my bloodwork was without having to wait on the doctors, see my test results.\" Another patient reflected, \"You know, I'm the kind of person that's always thinking about the next meal, and so for me to be able to, to put that order in myself, to look and order what I want\u2026and not have to wait for somebody to come around and take it\u2026\" Care team members also noted this increased independence for patients.

The results of our study suggest patients' preferences for using the portal to order meals, look up health information, and view their care team members. Both patients and care team members were positive about the usefulness of these features. Their views on secure messaging, however, were equivocal. Although patients viewed this feature as a means to communicate with their health care providers, care team members generally did not perceive the feature as an effective method to communicate with patients, and there was concern about message response time from doctors given the presence of multiple communication options in the inpatient setting. Our findings support results from prior studies that demonstrated the ability of inpatient portals to generally help improve patients' engagement and experiences.  14, 20, 21 Moreover, the results of our study extend the literature due to our focus on a large sample of adult inpatients, as well as our inclusion of the perspectives of care team members about their patients. Within the context of designing a more personalized health care system, Umar and Mundy proposed a holistic model for understanding how patients can experience a sense of ownership with their health and build stronger relationships with their providers. Their model envisioned technology as a unifier, helping to improve patients': (1)  access to the right health information; (2) ability to develop knowledge around this information to make informed decisions; (3) means to foster meaningful partnerships with providers in regard to their health care; and (4) participation in activities that enhance their self-efficacy (i.e., accountability, responsibility, and goal management).  22 We found that the views of the inpatient portal users in our study aligned with Umar and Mundy's model. Patients noted that they appreciated the ability to do things more independently, felt reduced anxiety, liked having their family members informed, and felt more empowered with their health care. Care team members' comments confirmed that they had similarly observed these benefits of portal use by patients and their families.\n\nGiven the immense environmental and personal stressors faced by patients in isolated hospital settings, providing them with near real-time access to their health information through a portal appeared to allay many of their concerns and gave them the feeling that they had more control over their health and illness, similar to findings from other studies.  14, 23 Patients in our study appreciated being able to know what was going on with their care as well as the ability to plan during their hospital stay. Similarly, care team members recognized that their patients felt more empowered and knew what to expect with their care, suggesting alignment with Umar and Mundy's model where access to technology fosters a patient's sense of self-efficacy. It has also been shown in other studies that having patients able to manage and be in control of their care with the help of portal information may be associated with increased patient safety.  24, 25 uring hospital stays, poor access to personal information, communication barriers, and uncertainty are factors that make patients prone to anxiety.  [26] [27] 7] [28] [29] [30]  By providing patients access to their health information, inpatient portals may help alleviate some of this anxiety by helping patients and their families better understand both the care they are receiving as well as the experience of hospitalization.  31 atients in our study recognized the ability to better educate themselves about their condition and changes to their condition, while not having to wonder about the unknown quite as much. Several care team members empathized with their patients and also noted that the portal seemed to help ease patients' minds by making this information about their condition available on their tablets.\n\nIt is possible that, conversely, information sharing through portals could overwhelm patients and create more anxiety.  14, 32, 33 Further, the levels at which these factors play a role in the effective use of tablets might be influenced by patient characteristics such as educational attainment and health literacy,  6, 34  and the design of the portal application itself.  35 While our interviews did not identify such challenges, it is important to conduct more research to identify factors in the inpatient setting that facilitate or inhibit portal use among patients as well as to evaluate the impact of information sharing in this context. In addition, we also acknowledge the possibility of care team members being negatively influenced by patients' use of the portals as portals provide another source of information and means of communication during a patient's inpatient stay. For example, Hefner et al. found that inpatient portal use and associated workflows could be very confusing to care team members, highlighting the need for more training on portal use and integration into patient care processes.  36 Additional study of care team members' perceptions and experiences can help improve our understanding of these potential challenges with inpatient portal use.\n\nAs our findings show, inpatient portals can help not only patients but also their families and caregivers be more engaged in the patient's care. With the patient's consent, family members or caregivers can view laboratory and test results and plans of care, allowing the patient and family to share the same information and, together, to be more engaged. Patients in our study discussed sharing results on the portal with their family members and reported that this helped everyone to be better informed. Notably, access to a portal allows families to communicate with the care team asynchronously, a benefit previously noted to decrease stress of parents of hospitalized children.  37 Moreover, while they are visiting, family members and caregivers can use the secure messaging feature to send questions to the care team and receive answers upon their next visit, which may then result in less pressure to be present to catch the care team when they are in the patient's room. More engaged, better-informed caregivers may also facilitate better care postdischarge. Such partnerships between patients, caregivers, and their providers demonstrate a means through which a patient could be more involved in their health care, with patients subsequently taking more ownership of their health and building long-term relationships with care providers, imperatives highlighted in the Umar and Mundy model.  22 ur results interestingly demonstrated a generally unified view of inpatient portals by patients and care team members. Care team members desired an experience for their patients that converged with what patients wanted. This could signify a cultural shift toward the use of patient portals as a potential tool to provide patient-centered care and engage patients. Prior research has highlighted the misalignment between stakeholders as being a critical barrier for the cultural incorporation of inpatient portals, thus a shift in culture could facilitate the adoption, implementation, and use of portals to better empower and engage patients and their families in the care process.  31, 38 his study may be limited in some notable aspects. First, we examined patient and provider perceptions related to portal use in a single health care system. This portal is based on a platform designed by a commercial vendor and features provided across different portal systems may be common. However, some portal features and policies around portal implementation and use might vary across institutions and contribute to variations in user experience. Second, our results may be biased toward inpatient portal use, given that all patient participants had used the inpatient portal. These patients could be more engaged in their care, and their views may vary from those who are less engaged; nonetheless, their views present perspectives that can help inform research and practice. Third, while physicians are clearly vital members of care teams, physicians in this organization were not directly involved with portal provisioning and had limited direct interactions with patients that enabled them to learn about patients' experiences with the portal at the time of this study. We do recognize that physicians are also impacted by patient portals and look forward to including their perspectives in future work. Finally, responses were gathered at different points in time and participants' views may be impacted by the time that had elapsed since portal implementation (i.e., recall bias). However, our results indicated a uniformity in views across time that signifies a stability in the findings that, in turn, could be viewed as a strength of our study."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Inpatient portals are being recognized as an emerging technology that hospitals can use to enhance the delivery of patient-centered care. Our study examined portal use in this context and found important commonalities between patients' and care team members' perspectives. Specifically, many features of the portal were reportedly useful, and both patients and care team members noted that having access to health information through the portal helped patients feel independent, empowered, in control of their health, and less anxious. The shared perspectives of patients and care team members about the benefits of inpatient portal use suggest the importance of this technology in improving patients' experiences while in the hospital, as well as in enhancing the patient centeredness of care."

      "title": "Clinical Relevance Statement",
      "text": "Our findings provide early evidence supporting the potential for inpatient portals to improve the patient centeredness of care delivery. Hospital administrators should consider the specific utility of the portal features described in our study to ensure inpatient portals support their organizational and unit needs. Additionally, our study results suggest inpatient portals can help engage key stakeholders such as patients' families and care team members, in addition to the patients they support. Improved understanding of the potential influence and impact of inpatient portals can help hospital administrators and providers in efforts to enhance the health care experience for patients, their families, and their care team members.\n\nMultiple Choice Questions Correct Answer: The correct answer is option c, secure messaging. Based on our study, a majority of the patients interviewed did not indicate they had used this feature. Care team members generally did not perceive the feature as an effective method to communicate with patients, and there was concern about message response time from doctors given the presence of multiple communication options in the inpatient setting.\n\n2. What were the main ways in which the study patients found the information available via the inpatient portal to be beneficial? a. Increased ability to do things independently. b. Reduced anxiety. c. Helped keep their families informed. d. Increased empowerment. e. All of the above.\n\nCorrect Answer: The correct answer is option e, all of the above. Our study found that patients who used the inpatient portal noted they appreciated the ability to do things more independently, felt reduced anxiety, liked having their family members informed, and felt more empowered about their health care. Care team members' comments confirmed that they had similarly observed these benefits of portal use by patients and their families."
