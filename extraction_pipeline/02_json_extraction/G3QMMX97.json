  "abstract": "Objective To determine whether mobile phone based monitoring improves asthma control compared with standard paper based monitoring strategies. Design Multicentre randomised controlled trial with cost effectiveness analysis. Setting UK primary care. Participants 288 adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma (asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score \u22651.5) from 32 practices. Intervention Participants were centrally randomised to twice daily recording and mobile phone based transmission of symptoms, drug use, and peak flow with immediate feedback prompting action according to an agreed plan or paper based monitoring. \n Main outcome measures Changes in scores on asthma control questionnaire and self efficacy (knowledge, attitude, and self efficacy asthma questionnaire (KASE-AQ)) at six months after randomisation. Assessment of outcomes was blinded. Analysis was on an intention to treat basis. \n Results There was no significant difference in the change in asthma control or self efficacy between the two groups (ACQ: mean change 0.75 in mobile group v 0.73 in paper group, mean difference in change -0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.23 to 0.19); KASE-AQ score: mean change -4.4 v -2.4, mean difference 2.0 (-0.3 to 4.2)). The numbers of patients who had acute exacerbations, steroid courses, and unscheduled consultations were similar in both groups, with similar healthcare costs. Overall, the mobile phone service was more expensive because of the expenses of telemonitoring. Conclusions Mobile technology does not improve asthma control or increase self efficacy compared with paper based monitoring when both groups received clinical care to guidelines standards. The mobile technology was not cost effective.",

      "text": "Globally, an estimated 300 million people have asthma, presenting a considerable and increasing burden of disease to healthcare systems, families, and patients.  1 Despite two decades of asthma guidelines, 2 asthma remains poorly controlled in a substantial proportion of people.  3 Structured asthma management-which in the United Kingdom is predominantly delivered in primary care  4  -can improve outcomes in terms of exacerbations, admissions to hospital, and days lost from school and work.  5 The concept of supported self management, engaging both clinicians and patients in delivering and implementing regular monitoring of control and adjustment of treatment, is a key recommendation of national and international guidelines.  6 7 he theoretical model developed by Glasziou and colleagues, using asthma as an exemplar, describes the complementary and evolving roles of periodic support from professionals and Correspondence to: D Ryan, Woodbrook Medical Centre, 28 Bridge St, Loughborough LE11 1NH dermotryan@doctors.org.uk Extra material supplied by the author (see  http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e1756?tab=related#webextra ) ongoing self monitoring by patients.  8 Our recent qualitative study suggests that people with asthma perceive a role for mobile technology in aiding transition from clinician supported phases while control is gained to effective self management during maintenance phases.  9 or adherence to monitoring and drugs is a potentially modifiable factor associated with poor control.  10 In contrast with paper diary monitoring, in which as few as 6% of readings might be recorded,  11  trials with electronic recording devices have shown rates of compliance of over 60%,  12  especially if the patient is aware that their health behaviour is being observed.  13 imely feedback of results to the patient can objectively show severity of symptoms and the impact of compliance with drug treatment. Mobile phones, the most pervasive and accessible form of technology globally,  14  offer a highly convenient system for self monitoring coupled with instantaneous feedback, potentially engaging the patient in the monitoring and management of their asthma.\n\nSet within the Medical Research Council's framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions,  15 16  our phase III trial was underpinned by preliminary work that suggested that mobile phone based self monitoring of asthma care was feasible to deliver and acceptable to both patients and clinicians.  9 12 17 We hypothesised that, in adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma offered treatment according to the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (BTS-SIGN) asthma guideline,  6  the use of mobile phone based monitoring of lung function and symptoms with feedback to patients would improve both control of asthma and patient self efficacy at six months compared with paper based monitoring strategies."

Recognition of control in the context of a clinical review was discussed during the training.  29 When control was attained, the patient was discharged from monthly follow-up but was encouraged to continue monitoring on a maintenance basis, seeking professional advice if needed."

The results, however, are consistent, and it is unlikely that a smaller attrition rate would alter our conclusions. Our a priori basis of carrying the previous result forward  18  assumes that non-responders did not improve their control, which probably underestimates the degree of change in both groups.\n\nThe low recruitment rate (2.4% of those invited) reflects both the low response rate (8.4% of those invited) and our requirement that participants should have poorly controlled asthma and a compatible mobile phone system. A slightly higher proportion of the participants was female, compared with the potentially eligible population. The 10 patients excluded after randomisation because of missing baseline ACQ scores were distributed between the two arms (four in the mobile group, six in the paper group), and were recruited from eight different practices, reducing the risk that this introduced important bias.\n\nOur multicentre trial was conducted in primary care, the setting for most asthma care in the UK, and included both an intention to treat analysis and a per protocol sensitivity analysis. We built on extensive formative work, which underpinned the hypothesis and informed the practical design of the intervention and the outcomes measured.  9 12 17 23 Although the patients and nurses were clearly aware of the mode of monitoring that they were using, our trial procedures ensured that the researchers who undertook data collection and the trial statisticians were blinded to allocation (for example, randomisation was undertaken by\n\nRESEARCH Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. . by guest on 14 August 2025  https://www.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 23 March 2012. 10.1136/bmj.e1756 on BMJ: first published as the practice nurses, technical issues were dealt with by OBS Medical, patients were instructed not to reveal allocation, in the event of an inadvertent breach a second researcher attended the practice for subsequent data collection)."

      "title": "Interpretation with reference to other research",
      "text": "Our findings exemplify the challenges of evaluating complex eHealth interventions  35  and the concern that potential benefits have thus far tended not to be substantiated by subsequent empirical evidence.  36 Some studies using mobile phones  37  and internet based monitoring have shown benefit in adults  38 39  and children  40  when compared with \"usual care.\" Usual care, however, is likely to be considerably less intensive than that experienced by intervention groups, so that it is often impossible to determine whether the observed benefits in these trials were because of the enhanced clinical care or the technological intervention. To overcome this, we provided the same structured clinical and educational intervention in both groups and showed that when the only difference is the mode of monitoring and associated feedback, the link with mobile phone technology had no significant effect.\n\nOur hypothesis, building on formative work,  9 12 13 17  was predicated on the theory that using a mobile phone to monitor and receive instantaneous feedback on their asthma control would help patients to integrate management into everyday life, engage them more fully in their care, and thus potentially improve asthma control. Patients in both groups, however, attended a similar number of monthly clinical reviews, suggesting that the mobile phone monitoring did not improve compliance with care. Similarly, most patients in both groups stepped up their treatment during the course of the trial. Participation in the trial probably resulted in greater engagement of patients and asthma nurses in both groups with \"guideline standard care\" (as opposed to \"usual care\"), potentially contributing to the improvement we observed in both groups. Spontaneous improvement over the timescale of the trial is another plausible explanation.\n\nDespite the significant improvements in ACQ score in both groups, only about a fifth achieved the well controlled threshold of ACQ=0.75. While it has been shown that even better control can be achieved in trials with maximal doses of drugs in selected patients with asthma,  41  the degree of improvement we observed is of the same order as that shown in \"real life\" trials,  42  in which adherence is variable and comorbidity is common. To increase generalisability, we did not exclude smokers so some overlap with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is possible.\n\nThe cost of the t+ asthma service was additional to the health service costs, which were otherwise similar in both groups, making it the more expensive option. This might not extrapolate directly to normal clinical practice where, for example, economies of scale in a regional service could reduce the cost per patient. In addition, many other factors will affect both costs and benefits. Technological advances, such as smart phone applications, will increase functionality and widespread adoption might drive down costs. As part of the commercial arrangement with OBS Medical additional clinical support was available to the mobile group from the t+ asthma nurse, though its contribution is unclear as it was not a closely monitored component of the trial.\n\nA recent systematic review concluded that telehealthcare in asthma could have a role in reducing hospital admissions in high risk patients and in those with severe disease,  43  and some studies have suggested that those with poorly controlled asthma might be more ready to comply with novel monitoring  44  or take regular drug treatment  45  than those with already well controlled asthma. Our trial, which recruited people with poorer control and lower baseline spirometry results than other trials,  38 39  did not find a beneficial effect in this group."

      "title": "Conclusions and implications",
      "text": "In people with poorly controlled asthma, the mobile phone based model of monitoring did not offer any advantages over and above paper based care when guideline standard clinical support services were provided to both groups. While mobile phone technology will appeal to some people,  17 18  it is not the crucial ingredient and carries cost implications. Its place in clinical care might depend on whether it is a cost effective option for enhancing \"usual care\" to the standards recommended by guidelines.  46 Policymakers internationally should consider the findings from this multicentre trial when considering the merits of investment in models of asthma care based on telehealthcare.\n\nWe thank the officers of the primary care research networks for supporting practice recruitment, the practices, practice nurses, and administrative staff for their active participation, and the patients who gave their time to participate in the trial.\n\nWe thank Andrew Wilson and Neil Kendle for serving on the ITSC and Brian McKinstry and Chris Burton who offered advice as collaborators.
