  "abstract": "Employers commonly use adjustments to health insurance premiums as incentives to encourage healthy behavior, but the effectiveness of those adjustments is controversial. We gave 197 obese participants in a workplace wellness program a weight loss goal equivalent to 5 percent of their baseline weight. They were randomly assigned to a control arm, with no financial incentive for achieving the goal, or to one of three intervention arms offering an incentive valued at $550. Two intervention arms used health insurance premium adjustments, beginning the following year (delayed) or in the first pay period after achieving the goal (immediate). A third arm used a daily lottery incentive separate from premiums. At twelve months there were no statistically significant differences in mean weight change either between the control group (whose members had a mean gain of 0.1 pound) and any of the incentive groups (delayed premium adjustment, -1.2 pound; immediate premium adjustment, -1.4 pound; daily lottery incentive, -1.0 pound) or among the intervention groups. The apparent failure of the incentives to promote weight loss suggests that employers that encourage weight reduction through workplace wellness programs should test alternatives to the conventional premium adjustment approach by using alternative incentive designs, larger incentives, or both. \n N early 70 percent of adults in the United States are overweight or obese. 1 Obesity may contribute to employer costs through direct medical spending, absenteeism, and decreased worker productivity.  [2] [3] 3] [4]  Beginning in 2014 the Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased the proportion of overall health insurance premiums that could be used as outcome-based wellness incentives from 20 percent to 30 percent, or to 50 percent if tobacco use is targeted.  5 More than 80 percent of large employers now use some form of financial incentive for health promotion.  [6] [7] [8] [9] Employers commonly deploy these incentives through health insurance premium adjustments, lowering the employee contribution to health insurance premiums for those who meet targets or raising premiums for those who do not. 9,10 This practice mirrors approaches commonly used throughout the insurance industry and is easy to administer using existing communication channels. However, there has been no prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of premium adjustments in promoting weight loss. Additionally, studies of other kinds of workplace financial incentives for weight loss have been limited by their observational design  11, 12  and rel-",

      "text": "atively short-term outcomes.  13, 14 revious work in behavioral economics indicates that the design and delivery of incentives have an important influence on their effectiveness. Individuals tend to be predictably irrational and respond more to incentives that recognize their systematic tendencies to focus on the immediate costs and benefits of their actions than to incentives delivered only in the future. Other important factors of incentives include the salience of rewards, the overweighting of small probabilities, and anticipated regret.  15, 16 everal previous studies have demonstrated how financial incentives might be designed to leverage these concepts. For example, in a sixteen-week weight loss program, fifty-seven participants were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two financial incentive programs.  17 Participants offered a daily regret lottery incentive were eligible for about a 1 in 5 chance of winning $10 or a 1 in 100 chance of winning $100, but only if they had met their weight loss target on the previous day. A regret lottery uses the concept of anticipated regret by informing participants whether they won and whether they would have won if they had met their goal. Participants offered a deposit contract could contribute between $0.01 and $3.00 that would be returned and matched 1:1 with a $3.00 per day bonus for each day the weight goal was met. Participants in the control group lost an average of 3.9 pounds, while those in the lottery and deposit contract groups lost significantly more weight (averages of 13.1 pounds and 14.0 pounds, respectively).\n\nIn a thirty-two-week weight loss program, sixty-six participants were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two deposit contract groups with a design similar to that in the previous study.  18 Participants in the control group lost an average of 1.2 pounds, while those in the deposit contract groups lost more weight (averages of 7.6 pounds and 9.6 pounds).\n\nAnd in a twenty-four-week weight loss program, 105 participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an individual incentive program, or a group incentive program.  19 In the individual incentive program, participants could receive $100 for each month in which the weight loss goal was achieved. In the group incentive program, participants were placed in groups of five, and groups that achieved monthly weight loss targets split $500 among their members. Participants in the control group lost 1.1 pounds, on average, while those in the individual and group incentive arms lost an average of 3.7 pounds and 10.6 pounds, respectively.\n\nFinancial incentives whose designs used insights from behavioral economics have shown promise for promoting weight loss.  [17] [18] 8] [19]  However, the incorporation of incentives into health benefit design has not been well evaluated. Employer premium adjustments typically involve future rewards and have the downside of being bundled with larger amounts of money (paychecks). Evidence from other contexts suggests that immediate gratification may be more motivating than rewards in the future  20  and that mental accounting strongly affects how money is perceived.  21 o test these concepts, we designed a one-year randomized trial of incentive programs for weight loss to compare usual care with the following three alternatives: a typical approach to the use of premium adjustment-that is, an adjustment taking effect in the next year (delayed); an immediate premium adjustment; and immediate financial incentives using daily lotteries delivered outside of premiums."

      "text": "Study Design We conducted a twelve-month, four-arm, randomized controlled trial between April 2013 and January 2015.  22 Weigh-ins were completed in private locations within the workplace using scales from incentaHealth, which are accurate to 0.1 kilograms.  19 Each participant used a secure passcode to access the scale and had online access to a picture taken during each weigh-in. Participants were encouraged to use the scales as often as they wished and given a weight loss goal in pounds that was equivalent to 5 percent of their baseline weight-a level associated with cardiovascular health benefits.  23, 24 To simulate a real-world workplace incentive program for weight loss, participants were required to weigh in only at six and twelve months.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved this protocol.\n\nStudy Enrollment University of Pennsylvania Health System employees were recruited between April 2013 and January 2014 by e-mail or workplace fliers or at employee health fairs. Eligible participants were ages 18-70, had a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30, and received University of Pennsylvania Health System health benefits. Exclusion criteria included conditions that made participation infeasible (inability to provide consent or to read or speak English) or unsafe (history of eating disorder, binging, or laxative or diuretic use; being pregnant or breastfeeding; taking medication other than metformin for diabetes; having metastatic cancer; having had myocardial infarction or stroke within the previous six months; having a current addiction to licit or illicit drugs; consumption of at least five alcoholic drinks per day; or having a serious psychiatric diagnosis).\n\nRosemary Osman-Koss is director of employee benefits at the University of Pennsylvania Health System.

Volpp is a professor of medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine and of health care management at the Wharton School; vice chairman for health policy in the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy; and director of CHIBE, all at the University of Pennsylvania; and a staff physician at the Crescenz VA Medical Center.\n\nParticipants enrolled online using Way to Health, a technology platform at the University of Pennsylvania that integrates wireless devices, conducts clinical trial randomization and enrollment processes, delivers messages and surveys, automates financial payments, and securely captures data for research purposes.  25 Way to Health has been used in previous studies.  19, 26 fter creating an account, participants electronically provided informed consent, completed an eligibility questionnaire, and reported their height. Next, participants were instructed to weigh in at one of the workplace scales. Scales transmitted data to the study server and determined whether or not the participant met BMI criteria. Eligible participants then completed questionnaires on their sociodemographic characteristics, overall health, and physical activity using the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.  27 articipants rated their readiness to change behavior for weight loss using James Prochaska's stages of change. The stages are as follows: precontemplation (do not intend to change in the next six months), contemplation (intend to change in the next six months), preparation (intend to change in the next thirty days), action (have been trying to change for less than six months), and maintenance (have been trying to change for more than six months).  28 andomization And Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to the control group or one of the three incentive arms, each of which had the same maximum expected financial value. We stratified the randomization, so that people with a BMI of 30-40 were randomly assigned separately from those with a BMI of greater than 40 (see online Appendix Exhibit 1).  29 All participants received $25 for enrolling, $25 for the six-month weigh-in, and $50 for the twelve-month weigh-in.\n\nParticipants in the control group were not offered any financial incentives for weight loss.\n\nParticipants in the delayed premium adjustment group were informed that if they met the 5 percent weight loss target, they would receive $550 in the form of twenty-six biweekly premium discounts beginning the following year (that is, during the following year's benefit cycle). Since many wellness programs require employees to meet weight goals only once to receive rewards, participants were required to meet their weight target only once and did not have to maintain that weight.\n\nParticipants in the immediate premium adjustment group were informed that once they met their weight target, they would immediately begin receiving $550 in the form of twenty-six biweekly premium discounts.\n\nParticipants in the daily lottery incentive group were given a daily weight target, calculated to achieve gradual loss amounting to 5 percent of initial weight by six months and maintain the goal weight for the following six months. As in previous studies,  [17] [18] [19]  the weight loss goal trajectory was reset every four weeks to provide participants who had failed to meet their daily goals with a fresh start-but also a steeper reduction to the six-month level.\n\nIn the daily lottery incentive group, participants selected a two-digit number between 00 and 99. Each day one number was randomly selected as the winning number. If a participant's two-digit number matched one digit in the winning number (an 18 percent chance), he or she won $10. If the participant's number matched both digits in the winning number (a 1 percent chance), he or she won $100. Participants who won either amount were allowed to collect their reward only if they had weighed in and achieved their weight loss target on the previous day. Based on the expected value of the lottery (about $2.80 per daily weigh-in), the average time these employees were at work (about 3.75 days per week), and the study period (fiftytwo weeks), the maximum value of this incentive was approximately equivalent to the $550 incentive offered in the other two intervention arms.\n\nIn previous work in which a daily lottery was found to be effective at changing health behaviors,  17, 26, 30  participants were informed what they would have won had they met their goal, drawing on evidence that the desire to avoid regret can be motivating.  [31] [32] 2] [33] [34]  In this study, however, we did not have access to employees' work schedules and therefore could not determine whether a day without a weigh-in was because an employee was nonadherent or because he or she had the day off. Therefore, study participants did not receive any regret messaging on days when they won the lottery but did not weigh in.\n\nNeither the participants nor the study coordinator could be blinded to the arm assignments. However, all investigators, statisticians, and data analysts were blinded to those assignments until the entire study was completed. Partici-We found that a $550 premium discount was not effective in promoting weight loss.\n\npants were encouraged to lose only one or two pounds per week and were monitored for excessive weight loss, which was defined as losing more than five pounds in one week, eight pounds in two weeks, or twelve pounds in four weeks. If weight loss exceeded these thresholds, the study coordinator contacted the participant to inquire about his or her health status and unsafe weight loss practices.\n\nOutcomes The primary outcome was weight loss at twelve months. Secondary outcomes included weight loss at six months and the proportion of participants who achieved the 5 percent weight loss goal.\n\nStatistical Analysis A priori, we estimated that a sample of 200 participants (50 per arm) would ensure 80 percent power to detect an eight-pound difference between any of the intervention arms and the control arm, assuming a standard deviation of eleven pounds and a 20 percent dropout rate, and using a conservative Bonferroni adjustment of the type 1 error rate with a two-sided alpha level of 0.017.\n\nAmong the 201 participants who were randomly assigned to a study arm, four were later deemed to be ineligible (three did not receive University of Pennsylvania Health System benefits, and one had a baseline BMI of 29.9) and were not included in the analysis. All other participants randomly assigned to a study arm were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nFor missing weight loss amounts at six and twelve months (31.0 percent), we conducted multiple imputation using PROC MI in SAS, version 9.4. Predictors of missing weights were study arm, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, household income, baseline weight, selfreported health, stage of change, and total metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week reported at baseline. (The energy expended while sitting quietly is 1 MET, and the energy expended while sitting quietly for five minutes is about 5 MET minutes.) We used five imputations and conducted all planned analyses on each imputed data set, and we then combined the results using Rubin's standard rules.  35 e used t-tests to evaluate differences in mean weight loss between groups and Pearson chisquare tests to evaluate differences between the proportions of each group that met the 5 percent weight loss goal. We used a multivariate linear regression model for the primary outcome of weight loss at twelve months, adjusted for study arm, baseline weight, and baseline participant characteristics.\n\nLimitations Our study had several limitations. First, our findings were from a single organization, and participants were mostly female and well educated, which may limit the gener-alizability of our results. Second, participants were required to weigh in only at six and twelve months, so we are unable to evaluate other time points. However, this design likely reflects how a large employer would implement such a program.\n\nThird, we did not have access to employees' schedules and therefore were unable to use a lottery incentive that incorporated regret messaging. Fourth, it is possible that employees may have felt uncomfortable weighing in at work. Fifth, our study focused on the effectiveness of using incentives to promote weight loss and did not evaluate any ethical implications  36  or employer cost shifting.  37"

      "text": "Many employers use health insurance premium adjustments to target health outcomes, and the ACA contains a provision that increased the proportion of health insurance premiums that can be used as penalties or rewards to 30-50 percent of employee premiums.  5 However, there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach. In this yearlong randomized trial, we found that three different types of incentive programs using either health benefit premium adjustments or lottery-based financial incentives were not effective for promoting weight loss in a workplace setting.\n\nThese findings build upon current knowledge about using financial incentives for weight loss promotion and have several important implications. First, while many employers use health insurance premium adjustments, we found that a $550 premium discount was not effective in promoting weight loss. It is possible that a larger incentive might be effective (the ACA allows employers to use up to 30 percent of premiums, or approximately $1,800, given the average price of an individual premium in 2014).  8 However, the lack of effect resulting from a delayed premium adjustment on behavior is not surprising, because individuals might heavily discount rewards that they will receive only in the future.  20 oreover, bundling rewards with premiums means combining a relatively small incentive with larger sums of money, making the reward less visible. For example, people are more influenced by a cash reward of $500 experienced as an increase from $0 to $500 than by a premium decrease from $6,000 to $5,500 distributed over twenty-six biweekly payments.  5, 21 Providing rewards contingent on a threshold with one-time weight measurement creates an \"all or nothing\" situation without ongoing feedback that could help support progress toward a goal.  38 Immediate premium adjustments were not effective, either, which suggests that the lack of immediacy in providing this reward alone did not account for its ineffectiveness.\n\nSecond, the lottery-based incentive was also ineffective. This finding likely highlights the importance of the design and implementation of an\n\nExhibit 3 Adjusted Multivariate Model Results For Weight Change At 12 Months Characteristic Estimate 95% CI p value Study group 0.49 Control Ref Ref Standard premium discount -2.00 (-7.12, 3.11) Immediate premium discount -1.97 (-7.92, 3.98) Daily lottery incentive -1.71 (-7.86, 4.45) Baseline weight -0.02 (-0.08, 0.04) 0.49 Age -0.19 (-0.37, 0.00) 0.03 Male 0.01 (-5.49, 5.52) 0.52 Race/ethnicity 0.35 White, non-Hispanic Ref Ref African American, non-Hispanic -0.71 (-5.22, 3.80) Hispanic 3.91 (-9.99, 17.80) Other, non-Hispanic -14.67 (-32.24, 2.90) Two or more races, non-Hispanic -3.32 (-17.12, 10.48) Education 0.06 Less than college Ref Ref Some college -1.55 (-7.10, 4.00) College graduate -1.77 (-7.76, 4.22) Postgraduate degree -6.44 (-12.15, -0.74) Annual household income 0.18 Less than $50,000 Ref Ref $50,000-$100,000 -3.14 (-8.60, 2.31) More than $100,000 1.82 (-4.60, 8.23) Physical activity in the past 7 days MET minutes a 0.08 (-0.20, 0.32) 0.48 Self-reported health 0.60 Fair or poor Ref Ref Excellent, very good, or good -0.16 (-5.62, 5.29) Stage of change 0.04 Maintenance Ref Ref Action 3.33 (-0.96, 7.63) Preparation -3.99 (-8.78, 0.80) Contemplation 0.97 (-8.18, 10.12) Precontemplation 14.3 (-35.44, 64.06) SOURCE Authors' analysis of data from a multivariate adjusted model for weight change.

[31] [32] ] [33] [34]  In this study, as noted above, we were not able to inform employees that they would have won on days when they did not weigh in. Because work schedules varied by week, we did not want to send people \"regret messages\" about their not weighing in on days when they were not scheduled to be at work. Third, in previous work,  [17] [18] [19] 26, 30  participants were asked to do a task (weigh in or check their blood sugar) in the privacy of their own homes, whereas in our study they were asked to weigh in at work. The w rkplace scales were not used very often. Although they were placed in private locations and employees were assured that their employer would not be given their weight data, it is possible the participants had some reservations about workplace weigh-ins. Future studies might use home-based scales that wirelessly transmit data and allow for regret messaging because participants can weigh in every day."

However, in many programs effectiveness has been assumed rather than tested.\n\nThe ACA increased the proportion of health insurance premiums that can be used for outcome-based wellness incentives. However, most employers use far less than the allowable amounts for rewards or penalties. The average size of rewards offered by employers in 2015 was approximately $690,  7  and while this amount has been increasing,  [10] [11] [12] [13]  our study reveals that a $550 premium adjustment was ineffective in promoting weight loss.\n\nHowever, an important insight from other work is that the effectiveness of incentive programs typically depends not just on the size of the incentive but also on how it is deployed and in what context. For example, a recent study testing four programs offering financial incentives for smoking cessation  39  -each with an incentive valued at $800-among CVS Health employees found that while 6.0 percent of participants in the control arm quit smoking, 9.4-16.0 percent of participants in the incentive arms quit. While 9.4 percent is not a large improvement compared to 6.0 percent, one of the incentive arms had a 16.0 percent quit rate-nearly three times the rate in the control arm. Based on the findings from the most successful arms of the intervention, CVS Health launched an incentive program nationally among its employees called \"700 Good Reasons.\"  40 In this program, employees can put down a $50 deposit and have the opportunity to earn up to $700 in rewards for quitting smoking.\n\nOther employers would do well to take note of this example, since there is often a presumption that the size of the reward is all that matters. In reality, incentive systems vary in effectiveness according to how well designed they are and whether their designs are successful in engaging people and motivating them to change behaviors that are often difficult to change."

      "text": "Financial valued at $550 did not improve weight loss outcomes for obese adults after twelve months of participation in a workplace weight loss program, whether the incentives were offered as a premium adjustment (either immediate or delayed) or a daily lottery-based reward. This suggests that employers involved in widespread efforts to encourage employee weight loss would benefit by testing alternatives to a standard premium adjustment approachsuch as alternative incentive designs, changes in incentive magnitude, or both. \u25aa"
