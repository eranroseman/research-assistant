  "title": "Just-in-the-Moment Adaptive Interventions (JITAI): A Meta-Analytical Review",
  "abstract": "A just-in-time, adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an emerging type of intervention that provides tailored support at the exact time of need. It does so using enabling new technologies (e.g., mobile phones, sensors) that capture the changing states of individuals. Extracting effect sizes of primary outcomes produced by 33 empirical studies that used JITAIs, we found moderate to large effect sizes of JITAI treatments compared to (1) waitlist-control conditions (k = 9), Hedges's g = 1.65 and (2) non-JITAI treatments (k = 21), g = 0.89. Also, participants of JITAI interventions showed significant changes (k = 13) in the positive direction (g = 0.79). A series of sensitivity tests suggested that those effects persist. Those effects also persist despite differences in the behaviors of interests (e.g., blood glucose control, recovering alcoholics), duration of the treatments, and participants' age. Two aspects of tailoring, namely: (1) tailoring to what (i.e., both people's previous behavioral patterns and their current need states; with these effects additive) and (2) approach to tailoring (i.e., both using a human agent and an algorithm to decide tailored feedback; with these effects additive), are significantly associated with greater JITAI efficacy.",

      "text": "In recent decades, unprecedented technological advancements in mobile devices such as phones, apps, and sensors have given rise to just-in-the-moment, adaptive interventions  (JITAI, Nahum-Shani, Hekler, & Spruijt-Metz, 2015; Nahum-Shani et al., 2018) . \"A JITAI is an intervention designed to address the dynamically changing needs of individuals via the provision of the type/ amount of support needed, at the right time, and only when needed\"  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015, p. 3) . In various fields different labels have been applied to a variety of JITAI-like intervention approaches such as dynamic tailoring  (Krebs, Prochaska, & Rossi, 2010) , Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI;  Heron, 2011) , and intelligent real-time therapy  (Kelly et al., 2012) . Because all of these approaches share similar components, we use the JITAI umbrella term to refer to all of them  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015. Within health interventions, the idea of just-in-time is rooted in capturing the exact time that individual clients/intervention participants have a need and providing just the right type of support at that time. Regardless of the specific type of support for behavior change needed, be it specific skills to cope with current distress or emotional support to assist users in adhering to their exercise routines (e.g.;  Brookie, Mainvil, Carr, Vissers, & Conner, 2017) , JITAI are individualized based on ongoing situational changes."

      "text": "Although there is no known meta-analytical evidence to suggest the effectiveness of JITAIs, reviews by  Nahum-Shani et al. (2015)  have shown that JITAI may have the potential to target behaviors in ways that traditional media interventions cannot by taking advantage of new technologies to capture the exact moment of participants' needs. Technologies such as smartphones, mobile apps, and various sensors can track the conditions of the targeted participants, such that, through selfreports and sensor technology, participants' behaviors are monitored and the intervention can be adapted. For this reason, JITAI has been receiving increasing attention because of its potential to generate more effective interventions by targeting the exact moment of users' needs and providing just-intime messages or information  (Fry & Neff, 2009; Spruijt-Metz et al., 2015) . For example, JITAI could use sensors to detect and automatically provide tailored messages regarding affective states when a smoker experiences a craving (e.g.,  Free et al., 2011) . Similarly, with enabling GPS and other sensors, a JITAI intervention is able to pick up on relapse signs of a recovering alcoholic based on his or her proximity to a bar and send tailored contents to reduce a drinking urge  (Gustafson et al., 2014) . Indeed, JITAI is also gaining attention from funding agencies: A number of JITAI interventions have been funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation (e.g.,  Free et al., 2011; Gustafson et al., 2014) .\n\nRegarding the design and delivery of JITAI, two questions remain: First, how effective are JITAIs in producing desired changes regarding health behaviors? Especially, with JITAIs emerging in various health domains with a variety of behaviors of interests, we are still not sure if JITAIs could be especially effective in one particular health domain. Second, the more pressing question is how to leverage our knowledge in tailoring to cater to the increasing needs that can now be CONTACT Liyuan Wang liyuanwa@usc.edu Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, University of Southern California, Watts Way 3502, #G6, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

      "title": "Effectiveness of JITAI",
      "text": "Theories in the role of mediated platforms in health prevention also speak to the potential effectiveness of JITAIs. To be specific, effective, technology-based, tailored interventions are rooted in works that examine the role of mediated interfaces in promoting health behaviors. Nowadays, mediated interfaces provide users with an elevated level of navigability, interactivity, and customization, which are features offered on media channels or platforms for users to interact with the mediated content  (Bellur & Sundar, 2017) . Those features serve to enhance one's intrinsic motivations in preventative health. Meanwhile, they can also increase liking from the participants such that they are more likely to explore those features offered in the platform. Therefore, they are more likely to be persuaded  (Shyam, Bellur, & Jia, 2012a; Sundar, Oh, Kang, & Sreenivasan, 2012b) .\n\nThere is extensive literature on non-JITAI tailored interventions. These are similar to JITAI in that tailored interventions have components regarding the use of individualized information for targeted participants  (Lustria et al., 2013) . A series of previous meta-analysis on tailored interventions has shown the potential of JITAI. Lustria et al. (2013)  studied tailored interventions delivered via the internet (1999 through 2009) and found stronger efficacy in the non-treatment control condition. Dynamic tailoring, being very similar to JITAI, is also rooted in the idea of providing message interventions based on active assessments of in-the-moment reports  (Krebs et al., 2010) . In their meta-analysis,  Krebs et al. (2010)  further compared interventions using dynamic tailoring to those that used static tailoring from 1988 to 2009.\n\nEvaluations of Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) also yield indirect information on the potential efficacy of JITAI. EMI is a type of intervention that is built on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). While EMA focuses on using different instruments to track individual behaviors  (Stone & Shiffman, 1994) , it was not used for interventions that target changes in behaviors. EMI, similar to JITAI, makes use of those real-time assessments to provide adequate feedback for intervention purposes  (Heron & Smyth, 2010) . Indeed, a systematic review conducted by  Heron and Smyth (2010)  examined EMI studies conducted before 2009; their results documented the efficacy of EMI in various fields such as weight control, anxiety regulation, and diabetes management.\n\nHowever, JITAIs are not just delivered via the internet, as in those cases reviewed by  Lustria et al. (2013) . Instead, JITAIs rely more on the portability of mobile devices to assess one's in-the-moment states and more rigorously tailor information. Although dynamic tailoring, EMI, and JITAIs  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2018; Sharmin et al., 2015)  rely on a similar set of operating principles, with the advancements and efficacy of JITAIs since the Heron and Smyth (2010) and  Krebs et al. (2010)  reviews, it is not clear whether newer interventions are similarly, or even more, effective. Indeed, 10 years of technological advancement in mobile devices and theoretical development in effective interventions call for a systematic examination of the efficacy of recent JITAIs. Therefore, this study focuses on JITAIs conducted in the past decade and offers a meta-analytical evaluation regarding their efficacy in producing desired health outcomes. With existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of JITAIs, we hypothesize that JITAIs are more effective than (H 1a ) waitlist/non-treatment controls and (H 1b ) default non-JITAI controls, and that (H 1c ) JITAI interventions produce significant behavior change preand post-interventions."

      "title": "Tailoring components of JITAI",
      "text": "Extant reviews of tailoring have tried to keep pace with the increasing complexity of technologically enriched intervention designs. To date, a great majority of work focuses on the capacities of technologies in affording interactions between individuals and the intervention platform. This perspective exploits the role of mediated interfaces in detecting the opportune tailoring moment to elicit desired changes. Indeed, it is found that technology-enriched tailored interventions can have stronger effects on behavioral changes in physical activity  (Davies, Spence, Vandelanotte, Caperchione, & Mummery, 2012) , mammography  (Sohl & Moyer, 2007) , or smoking  (Myung, McDonnell, Kazinets, Seo, & Moskowitz, 2009) .\n\nRecent research has also suggested that interactivity is not just a fancy add-on in technology-based interventions; interactivity is already an integral part of diagnostic assessments that can predict and preempt participants' problematic behaviors  (Wang, Christensen, Jeong, & Miller, 2019) . Regarding tailoring, interactivity is the major means to retrieve participants' information and to provide diagnostic interventions. Computer-mediated health interventions, for example, can take advantages of interactive features to ask participants' information to provide tailored messages  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015) . Some studies have investigated when interactivities should occur for the sake of tailoring in computerdelivered interventions. A meta-analysis conducted by  Krebs et al. (2010)  stressed the distinction between dynamic tailoring and static tailoring. As their results have shown, tailoring can achieve a better effect when the tailored messages were based on an assessment of individuals throughout the duration of an intervention (and their dynamic changes) rather than based on a one-time, single assessment of individuals at the baseline (static tailoring).\n\nBut focusing on whenwithout the source of the decisionleaves many unanswered questions, such as who (or what) should make tailoring decisions? Various platforms rely on interactivity to send feedback/messages to participants  (Fry & Neff, 2009) . The agents who made decisions regarding what kinds of interactive messages were sent out also matter to the efficacy of an intervention. In another review by  Fry and Neff (2009) , the focus regarding tailoring is on differentiating sources of decision-making. Feedback that is automatically sent without a human counselor was classified as low-structured, whereas feedback sent with both automatic evaluation and human counselors was classified as high-structured.\n\nIndeed, when, whether, and who/what should make the tailoring decisions should be integral decision-considerations of JITAI interventions that may jointly contribute to the effectiveness of tailoring modes. Yet, no studies to date have simultaneously evaluated those two factors regarding tailoring methods. Integrating previous aspects of tailoring, this study asks how does RQ 1 high/low-structured tailoring affect the outcome of JITAI?\n\nIn addition to the interactive perspective of tailoring, scholars in JITAI also call for a \"participant-centered\" perspective regarding tailoring. This perspective starts with participants' experiences/feelings/symptoms regarding tailoring. That is, mediated tailoring is not just focusing on the technical aspects regarding properties of different interactive features on the mediated platform, participants' symptoms and unique conditions should also be an important aspect of technologybased tailoring  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015) . Nahum-Shani et al. (2015)  pointed out that technologically based interventions should start with the selection of tailoring variables, referring to \"information concerning the individual that is used to decide when (i.e., under what conditions) to provide an intervention and which intervention to provide\"  (Nuham-Shani et al., 2018, p.451) . Indeed, should we tailor to a person's current drinking cravings or should we tailor according to a person's characteristics like social drinking? This process is important for technology-based interventions today because those interventions usually have to target multiple problematic behaviors with respect to individual differences and contexts. Identifying tailoring variables can be very meaningful for the development of JITAIs. In the past, when considering how individual differences may contribute to message compliance, researchers have focused on tailoring to traits, also known as \"tailoring to people\"  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2016) . This method refers to using certain personality or trait measures to identify individual's differences. Different individuals may be more likely to focus on different aspects of a message. Recent studies focusing on providing periodic feedback (e.g., to those in a given distressed state) in JITAI also reveal the importance of tailoring to states, referring to the particular moment during which a JITAI is needed  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2018) . A smoking cessation JITAI may have to deal with cravings during the quitting period, and negative cognitive and affective reactions when relapses occur  (Brendryen, Drozd, & Kraft, 2008) .\n\nAlso, how (through what measures) might participants obtain tailoring information? In some JITAI interventions, tailoring variables can be based on \"active\" measures through self-reports, or EMA. Indeed, previous behavioral patterns in JITAI are dependent on diaries, personal recall, and selfreports. This method has raised concern regarding the cognitive burden it places upon participants, not to mention the difficulties of keeping participants engaged in such taxing reports  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2016; Sharmin et al., 2015) . With the development of sensor technology, tailoring can also be based on non-intrusive measures provided by sensors or other technologies (e.g., the proximity to a bar regarding alcohol relapses). While passive tailoring has the advantage of creating non-invasive information, we still don't know the accuracy and the validity of using passive assessment, especially in comparison to active assessments. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the extent to which active and passive tailoring affect the outcome of interventions. Similarly, questions regarding how many times tailored content should to be sent to participants is also important. Indeed, an excessive amount of information may trigger cognitive overload  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015)  or even reactance  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015) .\n\nTherefore, we ask (RQ 2 ) how does tailoring to states/traits and (RQ3) active/passive tailoring affect the outcome of JITAI?"

      "title": "Search strategy and study selection",
      "text": "In February 2018, a series of keyword searches on a variety of databases including the Web of Science, PubMed, Psych Info, and ProQuest were conducted. A combination of search terms was used: JITAI, just-in-the-moment, adaptive, EMI, ecological momentary intervention, intelligent real-time therapy, dynamic tailoring intervention, and health. We also used asterisks on some search terms such as \"health*\" to expand the search scope such that keywords related to \"healthy behaviors\" or \"health interventions\" were also included. (Note that the asterisk automatically truncates the search terms such that instead of directly searching for the word \"healthy,\" search terms like \"health*\" can find all other key terms that include the stem \"health.\") We also contacted authors who may have additional unpublished datasets regarding JITAI. (Figure  1 ).\n\nThere were three major inclusion criteria for the metaanalysis. First, (a) all studies should be empirical research studies with at least one specific health outcome. Second, (b) retrieved studies should have appropriate quantitative information such as post-intervention scores. Therefore, case studies that are not eligible to extract effect sizes were not included. Third, (c) each study should have at least one JITAI condition. Criteria on judging an intervention as a JITAI was based on criteria proposed in former reviews by  Nahum-Shani et al. (2016) . Thus, two criteria for eligibility as a JITAI study were used: (1) treatment attempted to address changes in personal states and/or changes in context (e.g., contexts that participants indicated had previously triggered a given behavior of interest), and (2) treatment was tailored to traits, states, or both for each individual participant. Based on these criteria, a number of studies focusing on using mobile app and short message were excluded because they lacked a JITAI component  (Bahena, 2015) . Finally, the (d) JITAI treatment used some form of technology (e.g., phone, tablet, wearables, sensors, pc, etc.). Using the email addresses of the eligible articles' contact author, we inquired if he or she had or knew of additional unpublished research that would meet these criteria. We also emailed authors if further information was needed for computing study effect sizes. Using the criteria above, Tables  1 2 3 show the 31 studies found to be eligible and were therefore included in subsequent analyses. Among those 31 studies, one (k = 1) was an unpublished dissertation, but all others (k = 30) were peer-reviewed journal articles. Furthermore, among those 31 studies, some (k = 9), used a waitlist control condition (WLC, e.g., comparing those who received the JITAI effects those who were on a waitlist condition), some (k = 21) used a JITAI control condition for comparison (an alternative, non-JITAI treatment), and some (k = 13) had adequate information to enable a comparison between pre-and post-JITAI changes."

      "title": "Coding strategies for moderators",
      "text": "In addition to coding basic information of each study such as publication date and authorship, a number of variables were coded. First, we aimed to evaluate whether JITAI interventions would be more effective for health topics in one topic (e.g., mental health) versus other topics (e.g., controlling diet, improving level of exercise). Therefore, each study was first coded regarding the overarching topic toward which it was targeted. For example, a number of studies were coded as \"mental health,\" focusing on managing problematic emotional reactions  (Moody, Tegge, Poe, Koffarnus, & Bickel, 2017; Proudfoot et al., 2013) . Other studies have interest in improving diet and increasing exercise levels, thus they were coded as involving the domain of increasing healthy habits  (Atienza, King, Oliveira, Ahn, & Gardner, 2008; Brookie et al., 2017) . In general, we found studies on four health topics: mental health, healthy habits, addiction (including smoking,  alcohol reduction, and substance use), and medication adherence toward chronic diseases (e.g., pain management, diabetic selfmanagement). Second, we also tried to understand whether JITAI is particularly effective for certain age groups versus others. Specifically, we want to know how JITAI affects the elderly because JITAI relies on a certain level of technological literacy. Therefore, JITAI may demonstrate stronger effects among those who are younger. To do so, we coded the mean age of participants from each study.\n\nRegarding tailoring methods, a number of aspects were coded along the lines of the tailoring characteristics described earlier. These tailoring variables include active versus passive tailoring; tailoring to traits, states, or both; and tailoring via human or machine algorithm to decide what feedback to provide (see previous sections for details). Tailoring scheme is also provided in the appendix."

      "title": "Effect size extraction and determination",
      "text": "Effect sizes were retrieved via Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 3 (CMA, 3.0). We employ Hedges' g as the effect size (ES) indicator. Defined by  Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein (2011) , Hedges' g is a derivation of the standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) effect size that is rigorous toward testing pooled variance components. Interpretation of Hedges' g is similar to the interpretation of Cohen's d where 0.8 indicates a large effect, 0.5 indicates a medium effect, and 0.2 indicates a small effect size. The magnitude of a Hedges' g specifies how much in standard deviation units (equivalent to z scores) that the two groups (e.g., JITAI and control) differ: That is, a g value of 1 indicates the groups differed by 1 standard deviation.\n\nThree sets of Hedges' g were extracted: We compared the differences of effects between (1) JITAI and minimal-treatment (e.g., waitlist or placebo) groups, (2) JITAI and non-JITAI treatment (another treatment that did not use JITAI), and (3) the changes produced by participating in a JITAI treatment (i.e., pre-and post-treatment differences). To be specific, for (1) and (2) we extracted Hedges' g using the immediate post-intervention differences between the intervention and the control group. For (2), the one-arm intervention or assessment studies, we extracted Hedges' g by using the differences between the pre-and postintervention scores. Each effect size was weighted regarding its inversive variance weight  (Boreinstein et al., 2011) . We extracted effect sizes using the primary outcome of interests from each study. A great majority of those primary outcomes were behavior measures (e.g., diabetic management skills, ability to cope with chronic pain or reduce smoking). If there were more than one primary outcome, we averaged the effect sizes as a single indicator. Two studies (under the topics of mental health) reported psychological measures as primary outcomes, and we extracted effect sizes using their primary outcomes regarding paining catastrophizing  (Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013)  and depression disorder measurements  (Proudfoot et al., 2013) . Using a moderator test upon finishing up with effect size extraction, we found no significant differences regarding the type of effect size measures (i.e., psychological vs. behavioral): Q = 0.14, p = .70. Because there was a limited number of studies with longitudinal design, we only extracted effect sizes using the immediate post primary outcomes. Similarly, a limited number of studies (k < 10) identified or reported secondary outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy of pain management skills, motivations to exercise), therefore, we didn't extract effect sizes regarding secondary outcomes. Following random effects procedures using weighted factorial models across interventions and control groups, effects sizes were evaluated, which is recommended for smaller sample sizes and for treatment-control studies  (Borenstein et al., 2011; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) ."

The I 2 statistic provides this information: It describes the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity above and beyond that which is due to chance  (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003) . To further understand where the heterogeneity comes from, we also used a series of metaregression analysis to evaluate the effects of potential moderators. Furthermore, Fisher's fail-safe N  (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001)  and funnel plots were used to estimate publication bias.\n\n\"Fail-safe N\" gives the number of additional studies with nonsignificant results that would be needed to increase the p value for the meta-analysis to above 0.05. Sensitivity analysis was performed where a single study diverged from the general pattern of the rest of the studies, to ensure that the overall effect was not unduly affected by a single study result. To do so, we used the \"one-study removed\" function offered in CMA, which answers the question regarding \"whether the conclusions reached might differ substantially if a single study or a few studies were omitted\"  (Borenstein et al., 2011, p. 368) ."

      "text": "Efficacy of JITAI treatment over WLC H 1a investigated whether the overall effects of JITAI on participants in achieving health outcomes was greater than it was for those who were in WLC. H 1a is supported: The overall efficacy of JITAI was examined regarding the overall magnitude of the test. Using a random-effects model, which is recommended when dealing with diversified populations and methods across studies  (Borenstein et al., 2011) , the weighted mean effect size for the effects of treatment versus control post-intervention was g = 1.653, (95% CI = 0.72, 2.60). This is a large effect indicating that the groups differed by more than 1.5 standard deviations. The JITAI condition has significantly stronger effects on health outcomes than nontreatment controls (for more detailed results, see Table  4 ). Heterogeneity of the weighted mean effect sizes was also examined. Q statistics indicated significant heterogeneity (Q 8 = 617.95, p < .001, I 2 = 98.71), therefore, that finding called for further tests of potential moderators.\n\nTo examine publication bias, Fisher's fail-safe N values were calculated  (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) . Results showed that 440 studies with nonsignificant findings would be needed to reduce g to a p-value that was non-significant (p < .05). Trim and fill analysis suggested no adjustment to these mean Table  5  presents the results of a sensitivity analysis. The effect sizes were re-estimated after the particular study of interests were removed. Results show that the  Proudfoot et al. study (2013)  attributed a greater proportion of the pooled effect sizes. However, we do see that even with this study removed, JITAI still demonstrated greater effects than that of WLC: g = 0.34, 95% CI: (0.07, 0.60).\n\nEfficacy of JITAI over alternative treatments H 1b posited the overall effects of JITAI are on participants in achieving health outcomes over those who were in alternative treatment conditions. Using a random-effects model, this comparison produced a significant effect; g = 0.868, (95% CI = 0.41, 1.32). Therefore, the JITAI condition has significantly stronger effects on health outcomes than non-JITAI treatments (for more detailed results, see Table  6 ). Heterogeneity of the weighted mean effect sizes was also examined. Q and I 2 statistics indicated significant heterogeneity (Q 8 = 558.40, p < .001, I 2 = 96.23), therefore, the finding called for further tests of potential moderators.\n\nTo examine publication bias, Fisher's fail-safe N values were calculated  (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) . Results showed that 1064 studies with nonsignificant findings would be needed to reduce g to a p-value that was non-significant (p < .05). Fail-safe-N suggested no adjustment to these mean effect sizes was needed. Funnel plots (see appendix) were found to be quite symmetric as well. Again, these results indicate no evidence of publication bias among the current set of studies. Table  7  presents the results of a sensitivity analysis. We see that with one study removed, the effects of JITAI over non-JITAI treatments are still much stronger, ranging from a g of 0.46 to 0.91.\n\nEfficacy of pre-post treatment-only JITAI H 1c hypothesized significant pre-and post-JITAI changes. Effect sizes of JITAI studies that only use a treatment group were extracted based on the pre-and post-intervention scores. The weighted mean effect size for the effects of pre-treatment versus post-treatment using a random effects model was significant; g = 0.789, (95% CI = 0.50, 1.08). Therefore, the JITAI condition significantly effects improving health outcomes (for more detailed results, see Table  8 ). Heterogeneity of the weighted mean effect sizes was also examined. Q and I 2 statistics indicated significant heterogeneity (Q 13 = 149.37, p < .001, I 2 = 91.39).\n\nTo examine publication bias, Fisher's fail-safe N values were calculated  (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) . Results showed that 620 studies with nonsignificant findings would be needed to reduce g to be non-significant. Fail-safe-N suggested 5 studies with nonsignificant results could adjust for potential publication biases. Table  9  presents the results of a sensitivity analysis. Even with one study removed, the effects of JITAI over non-JITAI treatments are still much stronger, ranging from a g of 0.74 to 0.83."

      "text": "This is the first meta-analysis that explores the effectiveness of JITAIs. Before this meta-analysis, the effectiveness of JITAIs was only descriptively reviewed in theoretical pieces  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015; Spruijt-Metz et al., 2015) .\n\nFrom a meta-analytical perspective, our results show significant effect sizes favoring JITAIs. Our results compared JITAI with WLC, and we saw that the JITAI condition demonstrated significant improvement regarding health over the waitlist control condition. Similarly, in the studies that compared JITAI with alternative treatment groups, we also saw that the JITAI condition demonstrated significant improvement over alternative treatments. That is, when comparing the standardized differences regarding improvement, those in the JITAI treatment groups, on average, improved 0.87 times as much on their health outcomes over those in the alternative treatment. This result was consistent with the effect sizes comparing differences between post-intervention and pre-intervention scores. Participants who were part of a JITAI intervention, on average, showed significant   (Heron & Smyth, 2010; Krebs et al., 2010) , our results contribute to the strong evidence for the efficacy of JITAI interventions.\n\nThrough our results regarding publication bias and sensitivity tests, we also identified a stronger need for more empirical studies to test JITAI such that the efficacy of JITAI could be evaluated with greater precision. Indeed, through our sensitivity test, we see one particular study  (Proudfoot et al., 2013)  that demonstrated greater effectiveness than other studies. Upon closer examination, we found the study had no quality problems regarding its design and sampling. Therefore, we didn't remove it from the analysis. But our sensitivity tests do call for the importance of introducing more studies with adequate participants. For example, in the JITAI and WLC comparison, we see a great number of pilot studies (4 out of 9) with less than adequate participants (n < 50). Similarly, in the JITAI versus alternative treatment comparison, we see 14 out of 21 studies with fewer than 50 participants. This may account for why a well-designed and relatively more effective JITAI stood out and appeared to be the \"outlier.\"\n\nOur results on moderating effects of age and health outcomes also provide interesting insights in informing the design of JITAIs. We see a consistent pattern that among all three sets of JITAI effects, age, treatment length, and primary outcomes of interests were not significant moderators. Indeed, this may further speak to the potential generalizable effects of JITAI: Such technology-enriched interventions can have the potential to reach participants despite their age and the nature of the JITAI behaviors of interests. This is consistent with theories that guide JITAIs. The design of JITAI content (feedbacks, messages, and other materials) is usually contingent upon specific theories regarding particular behaviors of interests  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2016) . Indeed, the ease and attractive features offered in a media platform should have the potential to persuade despite age or behaviors of interests."

      "text": "Hedges's g That is, with the prevalence of mobile phones and relatively low costs of delivering tailored contents, JITAI may have the potential to target otherwise hard-to-reach populations.\n\nRegarding the choice of feedback decision algorithm, results indicated that the automatic algorithm (rather than a human) produced a stronger JITAI effect (see Figure  2 ), and the combination of an automatic and a human algorithm produced the additively strongest JITAI effects. From Figure  2 , we see a relatively low mean effect size regarding human-decided feedback as compared to feedback from automatic algorithms. We also see that using both human and automatic algorithms to provide feedback is related to the largest effect sizes regarding Hedges' g. Regarding the tailoring criteria (e.g., sending tailoring feedback according to one-time trait assessment (yes or no) and sending tailored feedback according to different risky states (yes or no) were both significantly related to the outcomes of JITAIs (such that the combination of these variables produced the largest additive effect). This result has multiple implications. First, it speaks to the importance of both artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms and human agents in making diagnostic and treatment decisions. Second, the combination of the two may have the best JITAI outcomes, which is a result that is consistent with longstanding findings regarding the decision-making abilities of AIs and similar algorithms. That is, although AI has the ability to make diagnostic assessments based on individual cases and current conditions, it was also found to neglect the look-ahead reasoning (e.g.,  Pomerol, 1997) . However, as shown in the scatterplots, we only have a limited number of studies to compare the tailoring variables, and the confidence intervals are very large, suggesting that we should interpret and make further use of those moderating results with caution."

      "title": "Conclusion and future directions",
      "text": "While this study is the first to illustrate the effectiveness of JITAI on various health outcomes, a number of questions remain unanswered. First, because of the limitation of the number of studies that provide longitudinal results (e.g.,  Gustafson et al., 2011; Lustria et al., 2013) , we didn't extract long-term effect sizes of JITAIs. This is important because previous studies called for attention to JITAI dynamic tailoring, and we still lack meta-analytical evidence to indicate the advantages of JITAIs in producing long-lasting behavior changes  (Heron & Smyth, 2010; Krebs et al., 2010; Lustria et al., 2013) . Therefore, this study calls for more JITAI-based clinical trials and experiments in the following years. Then, in subsequent analyses, we will be able compare the postintervention changes via multiple time points rather than just looking at the effects produced immediately postintervention (as was the case here). For the same reason, with more JITAI studies to come, future work could further explore the role of other moderators. In subsequent analyses, with sufficient studies, we should be able to evaluate the role of dynamic tailoring and active assessment. Indeed, tailoringand understanding what tailoring aspects optimize outcomesshould always be the number one assessment goal for JITAIs  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015) ."
