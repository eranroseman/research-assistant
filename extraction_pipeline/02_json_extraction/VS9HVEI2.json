  "title": "How theories, models, and frameworks have been used to implement digital health interventions in services for people with severe mental health problems: a scoping review",
  "abstract": "Background Digital health interventions have the potential to improve the efficacy and accessibility of mental health services for people with severe mental health problems, but their integration into routine practice is a challenge. The real-world implementation of digital health interventions should be considered alongside digital intervention development. However, little is known about the quality of implementation research in this area, including the extent to which implementation science theories, models and frameworks are used. The aim of this review was to synthesise evidence regarding the application of theories, models and frameworks in research investigating the implementation of digital health interventions in services for people with severe mental health problems. Secondary aims were to consider the contexts within which studies had been undertaken and the degree of service user involvement in this research. Methods A scoping review method was employed. Electronic databases were systematically searched for published papers in English and reference lists of included studies were hand searched. Included studies used an implementation science theory, model, or framework to understand, guide or evaluate the implementation of digital health interventions in services for people with severe mental health problems. \n Results Twelve eligible studies were identified. Studies were primarily undertaken in community mental health services with staff participants and there was variation in the types of digital interventions that were investigated. Eight different implementation science theories, models, and frameworks were used and were mainly employed to guide qualitative analysis. Most studies were undertaken in the early exploratory stages of implementation projects and there was little evidence regarding factors affecting the longer-term sustainment of digital health interventions in practice. Only one study reported the inclusion of service users in the design of the implementation study.",

      "text": "Severe mental health problems (SMI) such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder present significant health, social and economic challenges, both for individuals and for wider society  [1, 2] . The current treatment offer for people with SMI is insufficient. Mental health services are chronically underfunded and staff vacancies, long waiting lists, time-limited interventions and prioritisation of crisis care hamper services' ability to provide individualised evidence-based interventions for people with SMI  [3] [4] [5] . Indeed, one third of those with SMI in the United States do not receive any treatment, and globally 71% of people with SMI do not receive mental health care  [6] .\n\nDigital health interventions (DHIs) offer the potential to improve access to healthcare for people with SMI. DHIs can be defined as a discrete functionality of digital technology that is applied to achieve health objectives  [7] : they can be delivered directly to the user and/or integrated into service provision. DHIs have been found to be acceptable and usable for people with SMI  [8] [9] [10] [11]  and, although efficacy research is in its infancy, there is preliminary evidence that DHIs can improve mood, cognitive and social outcomes for this client group  [8, [12] [13] [14] . Furthermore, people with SMI report that DHIs can help to facilitate communication about their experiences with clinicians and enable greater choice and control over their healthcare, which may lead to improved access to appropriate interventions and support  [10, 15] . Integrating DHIs into mental healthcare delivery can also reduce clinician workload, increase service user engagement, and enable the widespread dissemination of evidencebased care, particularly in rural areas and developing countries  [16] .\n\nDespite their potential to improve the accessibility and effectiveness of mental health services, there are widespread challenges to the sustained adoption of DHIs in routine clinical practice, with most efforts to implement DHIs failing  [17] . The real-world implementation of evidence-based interventions is notoriously complex, with novel clinical innovations taking an average of 17 years to be implemented  [18] . There are also unique challenges to implementing DHIs: issues related to data security, costs, interoperability with exiting healthcare technology, and clinician resistance to novel technologies have been found to impede their implementation in clinical care  [19] [20] [21] .\n\nFurthermore, people with SMI, and the services that support them, present with personal and contextual factors that affect the implementation of DHIs. People with SMI experience disproportionately high levels of social and economic disadvantage  [22]  and commonly experience motivational and cognitive difficulties which can make engaging with interventions and services challenging  [23, 24] . Indeed, the severity of mental health symptomatology, and the interplay between service users' mental health symptoms and DHIs, have been found to impact on DHI engagement  [25, 26] . Additionally, clinicians' concerns about risks, low staff morale and underfunding of mental health services, have been suggested as unique factors that likely affect the adoption of DHIs in services for people with SMI  [27] . Mental health clinicians are deemed to be more 'hands-on' than most other non-mental health practitioners, often placing great importance on the relational and observational aspects (i.e., observing people's behaviours and emotions) of their work  [28] . This is particularly pertinent in services that support people with SMI, where service users are often assigned name key workers and service user-clinician relationships, collaborative decision making, and active involvement in interventions by service users are intended to be at the cornerstone of care. The unique multi-level complexity of this implementation context highlights the need for comprehensive, systematic research on the implementation of DHIs in this area.\n\nGiven the challenges to implementing DHIs in healthcare for people with SMI, researchers have argued that the implementation and sustainment of DHIs in routine care should be considered from the earliest stages of DHI development, and that co-production with end-users (e.g. administrators, service users, clinicians) throughout DHI development, testing and implementation is important in facilitating greater implementation success  [29] . in a variety of real-world contexts using theoretically or empirically supported implementation strategies  [30] .\n\nGiven that implementation is a multi-faceted, complex process, there is increasing emphasis on the use of theories, models, and frameworks (TMFs) to theoretically underpin implementation research and facilitate understanding of implementation processes and outcomes  [31] . TMFs offer an efficient way of generalising findings across diverse settings by providing explicit explanations of implementation-related phenomena: they provide a common language and facilitate shared understanding across disciplines  [32, 33] . TMFs also help to inform all phases of research by helping to frame study questions, anchor existing literature, clarify constructs to be assessed, describe relationships to be tested, and contextualise findings  [34] . Nilsen  [35]  identified five main types of TMFs applicable to implementation research: process models, which guide the step-by-step planning of implementing an intervention from pre-implementation to sustainability; determinant frameworks, classic theories, implementation theories, which can all be used to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation; and evaluation frameworks, which evaluate implementation effectiveness. Implementation researchers can employ one or multiple TMFs to address their research questions, and it is commonplace for researchers to select particular TMF domains or constructs deemed most applicable to their implementation context.\n\nPrevious reviews have highlighted the use of implementation science TMFs to investigate factors that influence the implementation of DHIs in general health care  [36, 37] , but there is a lack of synthesised evidence for their application in digital mental health research, particularly in SMI populations. This scoping review aims to gain a better understanding of which implementation science TMFs have been used by researchers to investigate the implementation of DHIs in services for people with SMI, how TMFs have been applied, and for what purpose. Synthesising this evidence will improve understanding of the role for implementation science theory when attempting to integrate DHIs in services for people with SMI, facilitate digital mental health researchers' implementation efforts, and highlight future directions for research and application of TMFs in this area."

The review was conducted in accordance with scoping review methods outlined by Arksey & O'Malley  [38]  and Peters and colleagues  [39] . The reporting of the review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines  [40] .

      "text": "Eligible studies were those published in English in peerreviewed journals that utilised at least one implementation TMF to investigate the hypothetical or actual adoption of a digital tool in services for people with severe mental health problems. Studies that did not use a referenced TMF to inform, guide, analyse or evaluate implementation were excluded. Studies where the TMF used was developed to investigate acceptability and/or usability only were excluded because such tools typically focus on stakeholder experience of an intervention at the individual-level, as opposed to systematically investigating implementation processes. Studies were included if the hypothetical or actual implementation setting was a mental health service that provided care to people with SMI aged \u2265 14-years-old: this age was chosen due to it commonly being the youngest age of eligibility for early intervention in psychosis services. SMI was defined as people with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other non-organic psychoses in accordance with the NHS England Quality Outcomes Framework  [41] .\n\nStudies were excluded if the DHI being investigated was solely telehealth, an administrative system, or an electronic medical record without service user input because such technologies are considered to represent standard incremental improvement in service delivery, rather than digital intervention innovation. Non-empirical studies (e.g. opinion pieces, commentary papers, dissertations, conference abstracts) and reviews were also excluded due the requirement for studies to sufficiently describe study procedures and for them to collate, analyse and interpret primary data.\n\nAuthor HB screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Full-text articles were then obtained and reviewed according to the inclusion criteria. Any uncertainties about study eligibility were discussed with the wider review team until a consensus was reached. A second researcher (EE) screened 10% of retrieved articles; comparison of ratings (include/exclude) with original screening outcomes indicated complete agreement between raters (Kappa = 1.0)."

Three studies investigated smartphone apps for people with SMI, including: an app designed for routine self-monitoring of symptoms and the provision of practical advice, which also involved clinician triage in response to significant changes in mental health detected by the app  [45] ; an app provided on discharge from hospital, aimed at fostering increased treatment adherence, which included cognitive-behavioural strategies for self-coping, and sharing of information from the app with the outpatient team  [43] ; and an app which included psychoeducation, tracking of behavioural health, an auditory hallucination detector tool and a peer newsfeed, with a connected clinician portal  [46] . Blajeski and colleagues  [48]  explored the implementation of virtual reality job interview training (VR-JIT), a computerised job interview simulator aimed at improving job interview skills for people with SMI. One study investigated peer support specialists' expectations regarding the hypothetical implementation of digital peer support for people with SMI  [49] : the authors did not explicitly define digital peer support, but study findings suggested apps and chatbots aimed at facilitating peer support were enquired about.\n\nTwo studies utilised web-based platforms. One study explored implementation of a DHI specifically designed for carers: an online supported self-management toolkit which provided psychoeducation and peer support for relatives of people with psychosis or bipolar  [27] . O'Sullivan and colleagues  [47]  described the implementation of moderated online social therapy, an integrated web-based clinic that blends online support (psychosocial interventions, a social network, clinical moderation, and peer support) with in-person specialised mental health services for young people with SMI.\n\nFive studies described the implementation of computer-based software or tools specifically designed for clinicians to use with people with SMI to support care planning.

      "title": "Use and application of implementation TMFs",
      "text": "Determinant frameworks were the most commonly applied type of TMF in included papers and were used by five studies, followed by implementation theories which were used by four studies. Three studies used TMFs deemed to be evaluation frameworks  [35] , though one of these  [43]  used the framework in a hypothetical implementation study rather than to evaluate actual implementation efforts. Only one study  [44]  used a process model.\n\nThe most frequently applied TMF was the determinant framework, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR;  [54] ; three studies  [47, 49, 52]  used the original version, and one study  [48]  cited the updated CFIR  [55] . Three studies  [27, 45, 51]  utilised the implementation theory Normalisation Process Theory (NPT;  [56] , with Allan and colleagues  [45]  also using the Medical Research Council (MRC) process evaluation framework  [57]  to frame their analysis.\n\nAll other TMFs included in the review were used once. The Nonadoption Abandonment and challenges to Scaleup, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework  [58]  and its associated complexity assessment tool (NASSS-CAT;  [59]  were applied by Gremyr and colleagues  [50]  to complete a complexity assessment of the development and deployment of a point-of-care digital dashboard. In another study  [53] , the same research group used the Clinical Adoption Meta Model (CAMM;  [60] to explore adoption of the dashboard post pilot implementation.\n\nThe Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework  [61] , an implementation process model, was used by Nicaise and colleagues  [44]  to guide the implementation of a digital social-support mapping programme. A modified version of the Simplified Sociotechnical Model was applied by Sequeira et al.  [46]  to explore implementation of an app and related online portal for clinicians. Finally, Moitra and colleagues  [43]  utilised Proctor and colleagues' implementation outcomes framework  [42] , to evaluate clinicians' expectations regarding the implementation of a smartphone app given to service users post hospital discharge.\n\nAll studies, except for one  [45] , used only one TMF. Studies varied in how TMFs were applied across implementation phases. Three studies reported using TMFs to explore participants' expectations regarding the implementation of the DHI  [43, 45, 49] . All three of these studies used implementation TMFs to inform the development of interview schedules for the collation of qualitative data, as well as to guide and structure their qualitative analysis. In contrast to the studies by Fortuna et al.  [49]  and Moitra et al.  [43] , Allan and colleagues  [45]  used different TMFs at data collection and analysis stages: NPT  [56]  and the MRC process evaluation framework  [60]  respectively.\n\nThe remaining studies used TMFs in the early adoption phase (e.g. post piloting the DHI) of their research. Gremyr and colleagues  [50]  used the NASSS-CAT  [59]  following early piloting that highlighted challenges to the larger-scale development and deployment of their digital dashboard: the NASSS-CAT was used to structure stakeholder workshops, to frame data collection (in the form of observations, field notes, notes from participants and audio recordings of workshop discussions) and to structure findings. The authors were also piloting the NASSS-CAT and tested its utility as part of this study. Five studies, all of which undertook interviews with staff who worked in services where the DHI had been adopted, used TMFs to synthesise qualitative findings regarding the barriers and facilitators to implementation according to TMF constructs  [27, 47, 48, 51, 52] . Three of these studies also reported using the TMF to guide qualitative data collection by informing the development of the interview schedules  [27, 47, 51] . Finally, three studies used the TMF to frame mixed methods analysis and integrated both quantitative and qualitative findings to explore acceptability, use, and usefulness of the DHI in practice  [44, 53]  or to evaluate implementation of the DHI  [46] .\n\nIn summary, TMFs were most frequently used to guide qualitative data analysis. Most, but not all, studies that used a TMF in qualitative analysis also used a TMF to inform qualitative data collection (e.g. by using the TMF in the development of the interview schedule). TMFs were used less frequently for quantitative data analysis: only three of the six studies that collated quantitative data used the TMF to interpret this data. It is of note that most studies included in this review were in the pre-implementation or early adoption phases, meaning that TMFs were primarily used to identify barriers and enablers to more widespread implementation, with only"

Allan and colleagues  [45]  utilised all four main constructs of NPT  [56]  to guide data collection but selected specific parts (context, fidelity, adaptations, reach) of the MRC process evaluation framework  [57]  to frame their analysis. Blajeski et al. 's  [48]  findings mapped to three of the five updated CFIR  [55]  domains (intervention characteristics, outer setting, individuals): they did not report findings for the inner setting or implementation process domains, or the characteristics of individuals subdomain. Fortuna and colleagues  [49]  also employed the CFIR and selected three domains (intervention characteristics, inner setting, characteristics of individuals) that they felt would be most relevant to explore in their qualitative study. Their findings mapped to these three domains, plus the outer setting domain. In their study utilising the CFIR, O'Sullivan et al.  [46]  coded qualitative data to all main CFIR domains, apart from the implementation process domain. The implementation process domain refers to the activities and strategies used to implement an intervention  [54, 55] . The relative dearth of evidence pertaining to this domain across papers could be reflective of the fact that most included studies were undertaken in the pre-implementation or early adoption phases.\n\nIndeed, Nicaise and colleagues applied only the 'exploration' stage of EPIS framework  [61]  to investigate the appropriateness and acceptability of the digital socialsupport mapping programme in recognition that the DHI was in the exploratory stage of implementation. A similar strategy was undertaken by Moitra et al.  [49]  in their application of Proctor et al. 's  [42]  implementation model: they selected three out of the eight implementation outcomes (appropriateness, acceptability, and implementation cost) to inform their topic guide: the authors stated this choice was guided by the nascence of the project."

In their study, Lobban and colleagues  [27]  reported that the use of NPT  [56]  enabled them to compare findings with extensive previous research that has utilised the same theory. One of the aims of Gremyr et al. 's  [50]  study was to pilot the NASSS-CAT  [59] , providing a rationale for choosing it as a framework. Finally, although Allan and colleagues  [45]  did not provide a rationale for selecting NPT to inform data collection in their study, they did explain a rationale for moving away from NPT at analysis stage and instead using the MRC process evaluation framework  [57]  to frame their analysis. The authors argued that the MRC framework was more relevant to the needs of their feasibility study because it was too early in DHI development to state whether normalisation of the DHI in routine practice was the ultimate goal. The authors also reported that the MRC framework was chosen because it goes beyond barriers and facilitators to implementation classifications and provides a taxonomy of implementation constructs."

Pithara et al.  [52]  provided a more comprehensive critique of the usefulness of the CFIR  [54]  in understanding the implementation of a digital CPT. They reported that the CFIR was useful in helping to capture and categorise factors impacting on implementation but reported challenges in assigning data items to the individual dimensions of the CFIR due to analytical ambiguity between them and the complexity of the DHI itself. A key aim of the study by Gremyr and colleagues  [50]  was to evaluate the usefulness of the NASSS framework  [58]  in a real-life setting. Via workshops with stakeholders, the authors collected and thematically analysed qualitative data regarding stakeholders' views on the application of the NASSS-CAT tool  [59] . Findings showed that stakeholders thought the tool was useful in helping to gain new insights and in covering areas that may otherwise have not been considered; however, they stated it would have been helpful to have more of an understanding of the tool's concepts before using it. The authors concluded that using the NASSS-CAT can help provide a greater understanding of the complexities in digital projects."

The most frequently reported outcomes were acceptability and feasibility, followed by adoption and appropriateness. There were no studies which reported data pertaining to costs or penetration, and only one  [51]  that mentioned sustainment. The lack of reporting on these longer-term implementation outcomes is likely to be reflective of the fact that included studies were mostly undertaken in the exploratory pre-implementation or early piloting phases of implementation (see Additional File 2 for further details on reported outcomes)."

Most studies coded and synthesised the data from service user participants according to implementation TMF constructs and thus data from service user participants, clinician participants, and DHI usage (where applicable) were typically integrated. However, O'Sullivan and colleagues  [47]  analysed the service user data using thematic analysis and presented these findings separately to findings from staff interviews, which were mapped to the CFIR  [54] .\n\nOnly two of the included studies reported that people with SMI had been involved in the design or conduct of the study. Peer support specialists with lived experience of SMI helped to develop the interview schedule in a study investigating peer support specialists' and people with SMI's views on digital peer support  [49] . Peer support workers also led and facilitated implementation of the A4i platform at one site in Sequeira and colleagues' study  [46] ]. Lobban and colleagues  [27]  reported that stakeholder groups, which included relatives of people with SMI, advised on how the DHI would be introduced into services but no further information on this was provided. The authors also stated that relatives were involved in the design of the DHI. Furthermore, although they did not report any service user involvement in the implementation studies in this review, four studies  [47, [50] [51] [52]  reported that service users were involved in the design and development of the DHI being piloted."

This review aimed to summarise the application of implementation science TMFs in studies investigating the implementation of DHIs for people with SMI. Overall, the number of studies applying TMFs was limited (n = 12). Most studies had taken place in community mental health settings or with community mental health clinicians. All studies explored staff views regarding implementation of DHIs, with only half also investigating service users' perspectives. The DHIs being implemented by studies varied from those designed to be used predominantly by service users (e.g. self-monitoring smartphone apps) to those designed to be used by clinicians in collaboration with people with SMI (e.g. digital care planning programmes). The relatively small number of studies utilising implementation TMFs in this review reflects the infancy of this research area. Indeed, to date, studies in digital mental health have typically focused on DHI development, acceptability, and efficacy, with research into real-world implementation only recently coming into focus."

      "title": "Use and application of TMFs",
      "text": "Studies in this review varied in their application of TMFs, with most using TMFs to inform data collection, analysis, and presentation of findings. TMFs were not typically used to guide the selection and evaluation of implementation strategies, or to guide implementation processes. This is reflective of wider implementation science literature that has traditionally focused on the early stages of implementation and less so on how to sustain innovations in practice  [66] . The most commonly applied TMF in this review was the CFIR  [54, 55] . The CFIR is a metatheoretical determinant framework that measures multiple ecological levels, making it useful for understanding the implementation of complex interventions in complex settings. The framework can offer clarity for researchers by organising, labelling, and describing a complex array of constructs that contribute to implementation, enabling researchers to select constructs most suited to their research  [55] . The CFIR is one of the most highly cited frameworks in implementation science  [67] , perhaps due to its applicability across multiple contexts, its flexibility, the use of clearly operationalised constructs and guidance for its use. Its popularity and usability mean the CFIR is likely to be one of the most familiar frameworks to digital mental health researchers investigating implementation. All four studies that utilised the CFIR used the framework to inform qualitative data collection and/or to guide qualitative analysis. In all cases, the CFIR was used to categorise barriers and facilitators to successful implementation, with limited theorising about relationships between determinants or causal mechanisms through which determinants influence implementation outcomes. This is a common critique of the application of determinant frameworks in implementation science, where complex relationships are in danger of being reduced to prescriptive checklists  [31] ."

      "text": "Three studies in this review used NPT  [56] . NPT is an implementation science theory which explains core mechanisms that shape implementation processes and describes nonlinear relationships between its four overarching constructs (coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring). The theory was developed from attempts to understand the adoption of telemedicine systems in the UK National Health Service  [37]  and is one of the most applied theories in DHI implementation studies  [68] . All studies in this review utilised all four constructs of NPT to inform qualitative data collection and/or analysis, though again, theorising about relationships between constructs and the mechanisms behind implementation processes was limited.\n\nThere was variation in how specific domains or constructs of TMFs were used by studies. Implementation researchers often select TMF domains deemed to be most relevant to their research question or implementation context and it is recommended that rationales for using specific domains or constructs of TMFs are provided  [54] . Three studies in this review  [43, 44, 49]  selected specific TMF domains to use prior to commencing data collection and provided rationales based on pre-existing expectations regarding implementation barriers and facilitators  [49]  or the implementation stage the study was in  [43, 44] . The remaining studies that used a TMF to guide analysis did not select domains or constructs a priori, and most reported findings for all domains of their selected TMF. A notable exception to this was the four studies utilising the CFIR, where only one  [52]  included the implementation process domain. This domain refers to the strategies and activities that are undertaken to implement an innovation  [54, 55] . The omission of this domain in study findings could be reflective of studies being in the early exploratory stages of implementation, where sustained and incremental optimisation of implementation is not yet a main research objective.\n\nDespite the variation in TMFs used, only four studies provided any rationale for choosing a particular TMF and none described a process of TMF selection. This is not unusual in implementation research: researchers commonly fail to provide adequate justification for their selection of a particular implementation TMF  [69] . Indeed, the growth of implementation science research over the past two decades has led to the development of over 150 different TMFs  [69]  and researchers have highlighted difficulties in selecting the most appropriate TMF for a given research project  [70, 71] , meaning TMF choice is often based on convenience or prior familiarity rather than systematic consideration  [32] . This is problematic if the selected TMF is not well suited to the user's objectives and may limit the ability to generalise findings, support progress and promote shared understanding  [32] . To this end, it is recommended that digital health implementation researchers carefully consider, and transparently report, justifications for TMF selection. This transparency will facilitate synthesis of relevant evidence and thus may improve the efficiency with which DHIs are successfully implemented in services for people with SMI.\n\nFurthermore, few studies in this review evaluated their chosen implementation TMF, and where evaluation did occur, this was limited to the utility of the TMF for addressing their research questions or aiding understanding of the implementation context. This 'one-way' engagement with TMFs, where theory shapes data collection and/or analysis but empirical findings are not explained in terms of what they mean for the theory, is common in implementation science  [31] . It is argued that, to advance conceptual knowledge in the field, implementation researchers should engage with their selected TMF(s) in an in-depth manner throughout research design, delivery, and reporting  [72] : this should include scrutiny of the theoretical assumptions of the work in response to empirical findings  [31]  and potential modifications to TMFs where this is grounded in evidence. Most studies in this review did not report any modifications to TMFs, which was understandable given the infancy of the evidence in this area. As the evidence builds, researchers should look to cumulatively refine and build theoretical knowledge by using empirical data actively to evaluate, validate, modify, and develop TMFs."

    {
      "title": "Implementation outcomes",
      "text": "There was variation in the types of implementation outcomes that studies in this review reported on. The lack of evidence pertaining to the implementation outcomes of penetration, sustainment and cost could be reflective of the studies being mostly undertaken in the early exploration and early pilot implementation phases. Indeed, Proctor and colleagues  [42]  note that different implementation outcomes are likely most relevant for decision-making at different points in the implementation life cycle. The most commonly reported implementation outcomes of studies in this review were feasibility, acceptability, adoption, and appropriateness. Thus, the majority of implementation outcome research in this area to date has provided information about the degree to which stakeholders like, or find usable, the DHI and related practices: this can help to refine interventions, support initial uptake, and improve patient centredness  [73] . However, these outcomes do little to inform the reach and sustainment of interventions in practice. These findings are in line with findings from a recent scoping review  [73]  which examined the reporting of Proctor et al. 's  [42]  outcomes in implementation research and found that the least reported outcomes were cost, penetration, and sustainment. The dearth of evidence pertaining to such outcomes is problematic because they are often the most highly prioritised in real-world decision making and thus argued to be some of the main factors that may actually have a public health impact  [72, 73] . Digital mental health implementation researchers should therefore look to advance the evidence for more observable implementation outcomes such as these to support programme leaders and policy makers to make decisions about the equitable deployment, reach and sustainment of DHIs in services for people with SMI."

      "title": "Service user involvement",
      "text": "Despite all studies in this review investigating the implementation of DHIs that require active service user input and use, only half included service user participants. Furthermore, although some studies in the review did report that service users were involved in the development of the DHI, only two  [46]  involved people with SMI in the design or conduct of the study. This is typical of the wider implementation science literature which has traditionally focused on the 'implementers' of innovations, that is, the people integrating an intervention or practice into services (e.g. clinicians, managers)  [55] . Indeed, effective stakeholder involvement, including the involvement of service users, is a recognised challenge in the field  [74] . Given the unique context of mental health services for people with SMI and the active role service users have in DHIs, any efforts to theorise about the implementation of DHIs should undoubtedly involve service users' experiences, knowledge, and perspectives  [29] . Inclusion of service users in the research process is likely to facilitate greater understanding of implementation determinants and help to test, refine, and develop implementation theories. There is a lack of knowledge regarding which methods are most effective for engaging service users in the conduct of implementation research  [75] : further research in this area is necessary to ensure meaningful involvement and prevent tokenism."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "A potential limitation of the review is that it included published research only. Given the relative infancy of implementation science research in the context of DHIs for people with SMI, additional evidence from grey literature could have added to findings. In addition, although efforts were made to use sufficiently broad search terms related to implementation, the lack of consistent shared terminology and somewhat vague descriptions of concepts in the field  [32, 35]  could have meant relevant papers were missed. However, the search approach was deemed acceptable for the purposes of a scoping review.\n\nAll studies in this review were undertaken in Europe, North America, or Australia, limiting applicability of findings to other contexts and healthcare systems. This lack of evidence from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is reflective of the wider DHI literature, where studies that have evaluated DHIs for people with SMI living in LMICs are scarce  [76] . Given that most people with SMI living in LMICs do not have access to mental healthcare  [77] , it is imperative that future research in this area includes systematic consideration of how best to implement DHIs into LMIC healthcare systems and improve access to care."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "Findings from this review highlight that the use of implementation science TMFs in research investigating the integration of DHIs in services for people with SMI is limited. Most studies utilised TMFs to guide qualitative analysis and structure the presentation of their findings, with few integrating them throughout the research process. Authors often did not provide a rationale for choosing to use a particular TMF and typically applied TMFs in an 'off the shelf ' manner, with limited evaluation or theoretical critique. It is recommended that digital mental health researchers looking to utilise implementation TMFs to understand and facilitate DHI implementation should carefully consider the TMF(s) most applicable to their implementation context and should transparently report this decision making. Furthermore, researchers should evaluate their empirical findings considering the theoretical underpinnings of the TMF, reporting any contributions to theory to advance implementation science research in this area.\n\nFindings showed that most implementation research on the adoption of DHIs in services for people with SMI has been undertaken in the early exploratory stages of implementation, with focus being on the acceptability of DHIs and perceived feasibility of DHI implementation. There is currently little evidence on implementation processes or the sustained implementation of DHIs in practice and few studies report on implementation outcomes related to the longer-term maintenance of interventions. Future research should investigate factors that influence the sustainment of DHIs in services for people with SMI and collate data regarding longer-term implementation outcomes. Finally, for studies in this review there was consistent a lack of service user involvement in study design, procedures, and evaluation. It is essential that future research investigating the integration of DHIs in services for people with SMI effectively involves people with SMI in research design and delivery to facilitate greater understanding of implementation determinants, processes, and outcomes."
