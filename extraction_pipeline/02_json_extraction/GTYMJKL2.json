  "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of a remote physical activity monitoring program, quantify baseline activity levels, and examine predictors of activity among rurally residing adults with Parkinson disease (PD) or stroke. Design: Thirty-day observational study. Participants completed standardized assessments, connected a wearable device, and synced daily step counts via a remote monitoring platform. Setting: Community-based remote monitoring. Participants: Rurally residing adults with PD or stroke enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration. Intervention: N/A. Main Outcome Measures: Feasibility was evaluated using recruitment data (response rates), study completion (completed assessments and connected the wearable device), and device adherence (days recording \u2265100 steps). Daily step counts were examined descriptively. Predictors of daily steps were explored across the full sample, then by diagnosis, using linear mixedeffects regression analyses. Results: Forty participants (n=20 PD; n=20 stroke) were included in the analysis with a mean (SD) age of 72.9 (7.6) years. Participants resided 252.6 (105.6) miles from the coordinating site. Recruitment response rates were 11% (PD) and 6% (stroke). Study completion rates were 71% (PD) and 80% (stroke). Device adherence rates were 97.0% (PD) and 95.2% (stroke). Participants with PD achieved a median [interquartile range] of 2618 [3896] steps per day and participants with stroke achieved 4832 [7383] steps. Age was the only significant predictor of daily steps for the full sample (-265 steps, 95% confidence interval [-407, -123]) and by diagnosis (PD, -175 steps, [-335, -15]; stroke, -357 steps [-603, -112]). Conclusions: A remote physical activity monitoring program for rurally residing individuals with PD or stroke was feasible. This study establishes a model for a scalable physical activity program for rural, older populations with neurologic conditions from a central coordinating site.",

[1] [2] ] [3]  Individuals with neurologic disease, such as Parkinson disease (PD) or stroke, are particularly vulnerable to poor outcomes. This is due, in part, to limited access to specialized care and novel programs to promote disease selfmanagement.  1, 3 This restricted access has resulted in a dearth of information related to healthy behaviors (eg, physical activity) and factors that may affect daily activity and ongoing disease self-management.\n\nRegular physical activity can improve health, reduce morbidity and mortality, and mitigate motor and non-motor symptoms of neurologic disease.  4, 5 Physical activity is essential to disease self-management but effective, scalable interventions to increase activity are lacking. Telerehabilitation programs have expanded to rural populations but are time-limited and require clinical resources.  6, 7 Clinical trials designed to increase physical activity for individuals with PD or stroke are feasible, but resource intensive and often require in-clinic visits, limiting recruitment to those living near urban medical centers.  8, 9 Scalable technology, such as wearable devices and remote monitoring platforms, affords new opportunities to reach these populations but are under-studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of a remote physical activity monitoring program for rurally residing adults with PD or stroke, quantify baseline physical activity levels, and explore predictors of physical activity."

      "text": "Recruitment for this study occurred from February 2021 to September 2021. Consistent with prior physical activity feasibility studies for adults with PD or stroke, we established an a priori goal of 40 Veterans (20 PD, 20 stroke) to be included in our analyses.  [11] [12] 2] [13]  Individuals were mailed a recruitment letter then contacted the study coordinator, completed a cognitive screen, and provided oral informed consent via telephone. Enrolled participants were directed to Way to Health, an online remote monitoring platform used in previous studies,  [14] [15] [16]  to complete all study surveys. Upon completion of the study surveys, participants were mailed a wearable device (Fitbit Inspire HR, San Francisco, CA) a and instructions for connecting their device to the Way to Health platform. Way to Health is a secure, web-based platform that automates many research functions such as the administration of standardized assessments or questionnaires, collecting health data from connected devices, and patient messaging.\n\nParticipants completed a technology questionnaire that quantified pre-enrollment access and use of different technologies (eg, internet, smartphone)  17, 18  and standardized assessments on the Way to Health platform. The standardized assessments quantified potential predictors of physical activity: exercise self-efficacy (Exercise Self-Efficacy scale  19  ), fatigue (Facit Fatigue Scale 20 ), falls efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale  21  ), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item  22  ), apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale  23  ), and social support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey  24  ). Participants with PD also completed the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (8-item), a measure of the quality of life.  25 articipants wore the Fitbit device during waking hours for 30 days. The 30-day observational period was selected, in part, to provide sufficient time to capture current physical activity levels and reduce the potential upward bias of daily steps that may occur in the first few days of wearing an activity tracker. The reliability and validity of Fitbit for quantifying daily steps for older adults with PD and stroke has been established.  [26] [27] 7] [28]  Participants with PD wore the Fitbit on their hip, eliminating the potential for erroneous step counts due to hand tremor. Participants in the stroke cohort who used an assistive device while walking wore the Fitbit on their less affected hip and those who did not use an assistive device wore the Fitbit on their less affected wrist. Daily step counts automatically synced to the Way to Health platform via the Fitbit smartphone application. This eliminated the need for participants to manually record their daily step count, which reduced participant burden. Data were considered missing if the daily step count was <100 steps, a validated daily adherence threshold in adults with stroke.  29"

This exploratory evaluation was completed to examine potential bias in our recruitment method to help inform future recruitment strategies. Next, we explored baseline predictors of daily physical activity using linear mixedeffects regression analysis across the full sample adjusting for participant random effect and diagnosis. Because of the small sample size, predictors were first evaluated for significance individually. All significant predictors were then added to a final multivariate model. Lastly, the sample was stratified by diagnosis (PD and stroke) and predictors were first evaluated individually. All significant predictors were then tested in a final model for each cohort. Step data were examined at the day level and all models adjusted for a participant random effect due to repeated observations. Analyses were completed in R (version 4.0.5)  30 using the tidyverse  31  and lme4  32  packages."

      "text": "We achieved our a priori goal of including 40 rurally residing Veterans with PD (n=20) or stroke (n=20) in our final analysis. Our recruitment flowchart and reasons for exclusion are presented in Figure  1 . We mailed 695 recruitment letters (74 contacts) to those with PD and 528 letters (32 contacts) to individuals with stroke, resulting in an 11% and 6% response rate, respectively. Among all consented participants, the PD cohort had a slightly lower study completion rate (20/28, 71.4%) compared with the stroke cohort (20/ 25, 80.0%). Across both cohorts, the most common reason for not completing the study was failing to create a Way to Health account and completing study surveys (Figure  1 ) after   40, 41  y Reported as number of participants reporting they had daily access to each technology prior to this study. z Any device that records and transmits health data (eg, wearable activity tracker, electronic pill bottles, Bluetooth enabled blood pressure cuff).\n\nx Scores range from 9 to 28, higher scores = greater exercise self-efficacy.\n\n\u01c1 Scores range from 0 to 52, higher scores = greater quality of life.\n\n{ Scores range from 0 to 100, scores>70 indicate a fear of falling. ** Scores range from 0 to 100, higher scores = greater social support. yy Scores range from 0 to 27, score>4 indicates mild depression with higher scores indicating more severe depression.\n\nzz Scores range from 0 to 120, higher scores = greater mobility across different environments. \u00a7 \u00a7 Scores range from 18 to 72, higher scores =greater apathy.\n\n\u01c1\u01c1 Scores range from 0 to 100, lower scores = better quality of life/health.\n\nproviding informed consent. Four participants with stroke wore the Fitbit on their belt, while the remaining participants (n=16) wore the device on their wrist. There were no adverse events reported. Daily device adherence over the 30-day study period was high (97.0% PD, 95.23% stroke). The cohorts were demographically similar (Table  1 ). Overall, the mean (SD) distance from participants' residence to the study location was 252.6 (105.6) miles. Nearly all participants had daily access to the internet (95%) and a smartphone (92.5%), although only a small number had access to a connected health device (25%). A connected health device is any device that records or transmits health data such as wearable activity trackers or a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff. The PD cohort achieved significantly fewer steps per day (median [interquartile range], 2618 [3896] steps) compared with the stroke cohort (median [interquartile range], 4832 [7383] steps, P<.001).\n\nIndividuals who contacted the study team were demographically similar to those who did not respond to the recruitment letter (Table  2 ). For both cohorts, enrolled participants had a more recent visit to a VA medical center or clinic for diagnosis-related treatment than those who did not contact the study team. This was significantly different in the PD cohort (41.9 vs 21.8 weeks, P<.001).\n\nResults from the regression analysis for the full sample indicated that, after adjusting for diagnosis, age (in years) was the only significant predictor of daily steps (-265 steps, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-407, -123], P<.001). Results from the bivariate regression analysis by cohort demonstrate that age (in years) was the only significant predictor of daily steps (Figure  2 ). For every 1-year increase in age, daily steps significantly decreased for both the PD cohort (-175 steps, 95% CI [-335, -15], P=.03) and stroke cohort (-357 steps, 95% CI [-603, -112], P=.006)."

      "text": "A remote physical activity monitoring program was feasible among rurally residing adults with PD or stroke, who were enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration. Participants demonstrated high device adherence and successfully interacted with the remote monitoring platform throughout the study duration. The significant decrease in daily steps among older participants suggests that older adults with PD or stroke are key populations who may benefit from future interventions to increase physical activity. These findings provide foundational knowledge and support toward the development of remote interventions to increase physical activity among rural populations with PD or stroke. The geographic reach of this study also speaks to the scalability of such interventions from a central coordinating center to distant sites.\n\nThere has been a significant investment in telehealth and telerehabilitation resources in the last decade, especially within the Veterans Health Administration,  [33] [34] [35] [36]  which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  37 Many tele-based programs are time-limited and require broadband internet access, which is lacking in many rural areas.  38 This can perpetuate existing disparities.  38 While 95% of our sample reported regular internet access, the physical activity program in this study did not require broadband internet access, making it especially salient for rural populations with reduced access to high-speed internet. Participants can access Way to Health if their smartphone or tablet has a cellular data plan that can provide internet access. This is an important feature for longer-term remote programs that target improving physical activity and other healthy behaviors among rurally residing populations with neurodegenerative disease or complex disability. Participants with PD or stroke demonstrated high device adherence over the 30-day study period. Over half of our sample had not previously interacted with a connected health device. The high adherence rates suggest that participants consistently wore and engaged with the Fitbit device which is an important finding for future interventions to increase physical activity among older, medically complex populations. We observed varying levels of daily physical activity across the sample. Overall, participants with PD completed fewer steps per day compared with those with stroke, but we observed low levels of physical activity among participants in both cohorts.\n\nThese results suggest that rurally residing individuals with PD or stroke would benefit from a novel, remote intervention to increase daily physical activity that could potentially improve long-term disease self-management and health outcomes."

      "title": "Study limitations",
      "text": "The limitations of this study include the small cohort size and the racial and sex homogeneity that affects the generalizability of these findings. Future studies should explicitly seek to recruit patients from diverse racial backgrounds given the known racial disparities in access to virtual care.  39 dditionally, this study required access to a smartphone or tablet that was compatible with the Fitbit application. This may have excluded individuals of lower socioeconomic status. Moving forward, it is important to identify strategies to improve access to the required technologies to ensure all individuals can participate in these programs. The remote design prevented the collection of in-clinic assessments of disease state or impairment (eg, Hoehn and Yahr Scale). This limited our ability to examine impairment measures (eg, balance performance) as predictors of daily physical activity."

      "text": "In conclusion, this study was a first critical step in reaching a population who are underserved, understudied, and particularly vulnerable to the pernicious effects of low physical activity. This \"touchless\" protocol required no in-person visits or regular clinician involvement, which expanded our recruitment radius and is scalable to a larger study to increase physical activity. Daily physical activity was low, especially among older participants, indicating a need for novel interventions to increase daily activity. The evolution of scalable technology platforms has extended the reach of novel programs to more vulnerable populations."
