  "abstract": "Background This reconstructed individual patient data (IPD)-based meta-analysis is aimed to summarize the current findings and comprehensively investigate the predictive value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in operable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods PubMed, Cochrane and Embase were searched to include potentially eligible studies. The primary outcomes included progression-free survival (DFS) by ctDNA status at baseline, postoperative, and longitudinal timepoints. The IPD-based survival data was retracted and used in reconstructed IPD-based meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was implemented based on the baseline characteristics. Results Totally, 28 studies were involved, including 15 full-length articles (1686 patients) for IPD-based synthesis and 20 studies for conventional meta-analysis. The IPD-based meta-analysis discovered that patients with positive ctDNA status at the baseline (hazard ratio, HR = 3.73, 95% confidential interval, CI: 2.95-4.72), postoperative (3.96, 2.19-7.16), or longitudinal timepoints (12.33, 8.72-17.43) showed significantly higher risk of recurrence. Patients with persistent ctDNA-negative status had the lowest recurrence rate, and the negative conversion of ctDNA from baseline to postoperative timepoints was correlated with elevated DFS. Subgroup analyses suggested that stage II-III patients with ctDNA-positive status may achieve preferable therapeutic outcomes. Conclusions Plasm ctDNA monitoring shows excellent clinical significance at the tested timepoints. Perioperative conversion of ctDNA status may indicate the therapeutic effect of radical surgery. Postoperative adjuvant therapy may be determined according to the ctDNA status. Trail registration CRD42022304445.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Lung cancers still are the severest health hazard to people worldwide compared to other types of carcinomas  [1, 2] . Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) contribute to most of the subtypes of lung cancers. With the advancement of physical examination, diagnosis, and treatment methods, more and more NSCLC patients can be treated at early stages. The survival outcomes can be significantly improved, and some patients may even be cured  [3] . Unfortunately, a part of patients facing disease progression and poor prognosis are still recognized at early stages by the current tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system. Hence, the potential imperfections of the current staging system need to be made up by involving effective molecular biomarkers.\n\nCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which is defined as a specific portion of cell-free DNA comprising strands of < 145 bp in length, is recognized as a preferable biomarker of disease progression for various cancers, including NSCLC  [4] [5] [6] . The predictive role of ctDNA was initially investigated at advanced stages of NSCLC, which shows ctDNA has excellent value in predicting disease progression. A multi-center cohort study by prospectively including 1127 advanced NSCLC patients suggests that ctDNA detection in plasma is an independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio (HR), 2.05; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.74-2.42) [7] .\n\nResearchers doubt whether or not ctDNA can make a difference in patients at early stages of NSCLC  [8] . Recently, this question has been investigated. Some publications with comparatively small sample sizes fail to identify the prognostic role of ctDNA  [9] [10] [11] . Nevertheless, most of the studies present positive results. After analyzing the clinical data of 116 participants, Qiu B et al. discovered that patients with postoperative and longitudinal negative ctDNA had significantly better recurrencefree survival  [12] . Zhang JT et al. confirmed the clinical significance of ctDNA by including a comparatively large sample size  [13] . They further imply that patients with negative ctDNA status may not benefit from postoperative adjuvant treatment.\n\nWe have discovered several disadvantages after reviewing these references, which need to be reinforced. A majority of these studies include relatively small sample sizes, and many studies recruit less than 50 patients. The baseline characteristics are unbalanced between groups, which has not been dealt with using statistical methods. In addition, there is a lack of subgroup analysis. Therefore, our reconstructed individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis trys to summarize the existing findings, comprehensively investigate the predictive value of ctDNA in early stage (I-III) NSCLC and make a guidance for future studies."

Studies with specific survival data were included in reconstructed IPD-based metaanalysis and conventional meta-analysis, and otherwise, they were included in systematic review. Stage I-III NSCLC patients with radical surgery were eligible for the IPD-based meta-analysis. Patients without survival data were excluded.

First, the researchers excluded duplications. Then, they screened the rest of studies using titles and abstracts to determine which studies will be included for further filtration. Finally, the full texts of articles were screened, and eligible studies were included for meta-analysis. The two independent researchers assessed the quality of the studies included in quantitative synthesis using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

The baseline characteristics included study type, neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), ctDNA panel, testing timepoints, definition of ctDNA-positive, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT), location, sample size, pathological stage, median follow-up period, and precedence of relapse. In our subsequent analysis, patients receiving other types of postoperative treatment were also included in the ACT subgroup, such as adjuvant radiotherapy, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, target therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In terms of survival outcomes, we firstly collected the reported HRs and 95%CI from the included articles and abstracts. The IPD-based survival data was retracted from the published supplemental files of all included full-length articles. Otherwise, the reported Kaplan-Meier curves and swimmer plots were used to collect corresponding survival and ctDNA status data using the methods reported by Guyot et al.  [14] . The demographic variables of individual patients were also collected, such as age, gender, smoking history, tumor size (cm), pathological type, pathological stage (T&N), ACT, NAT, and ctDNA status at different timepoints. Longitudinal ctDNA positive status was defined as ctDNA positive at any one testing timepoint during follow-up period."

The primary outcome was IPD-based diseasefree survival (DFS) by ctDNA status at baseline, postoperative, and longitudinal timepoints. The secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS) and the predictive value of ctDNA on recurrence. The survival data of ctDNA status at various testing timepoints was collected and analyzed. In IPD analysis, survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the HRs (95% CI) of DFS/OS were calculated based on the Cox proportional hazards model. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to address the between-study heterogeneity using stratified Cox regression and shared frailty models. Multivariate Cox regression was implemented to balance inter-group differences of baseline characteristics, including age, gender, smoke, tumor size, pathological type, T stage, N stage, and pathological stage. Propensity score matching (PSM) was also used to flush discrepancy of baseline characteristics between ctDNA-positive and ctDNA-negative groups, which allowed to calculate HRs (95% CI) based on similar between-group demographic variables. Five covariates (age, gender, smoking history, pathological type, and stage) were included in PSM. The nearest neighbor method was used to match (ratio = 1:1) patients between groups with no replacement. The caliper width was set at 0.02. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was conducted for age, gender, smoking history, tumor size, pathological types, T stage, N stage, pathological stage, and ACT.\n\nIn conventional meta-analysis, we synthesized the reported HRs (95% CI) from the included studies based on a fixed/random-effect model, which was chosen depending on the level of inter-study heterogeneity. We defined the significance of heterogeneity as I 2 > 50% or P < 0.05, and a random-effect model was implemented. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to discover potential sources of inter-study heterogeneity. Funnel plots were used to assess potential publication bias.\n\nThe statistical significance was defined as two-side P < 0.05. The analyses were conducted on RStudio 4.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)."

Persistent ctDNA negative status predicted the lowest recurrence rate, and continuous ctDNA positive status was correlated with the poorest result of DFS (Table  2 ). Subgroup analyses by pathological types and stages were summarized in Table  S11  (Figure  S6 ). Furthermore, the relationship between ctDNA status change after ACT and recurrence risk was also explored by involving 108 patients from 3 studies  [12, 13, 30]  (Table  2 ). Patients with persistent ctDNA negative status showed the best DFS outcome, and patients with persistent ctDNA positive status showed the highest risk of recurrence (Fig.  4B ). We also explored the prognostic role of ACT in patients with different postoperative ctDNA statuses. Eleven studies  [10, 12, 13, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, [30] [31] [32]  involving 704 participants were included.

In the postoperative ctDNA positive group, ACT can reduce the recurrence rate, though not significantly (P = 0.067, Table  2 ). After excluding patients at stage I, we discovered that ACT significantly improved the DFS outcome of patients with postoperative ctDNA positive status (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.23-3.95, P = 0.008, Fig.  4D ). However, ACT did not improve the survival of patients with postoperative ctDNA negative status (P = 0.401, Table  2 ). Furthermore, ACT was associated with poor survival outcomes among ctDNA-negative patients in subgroups of stage I and AD (Table  S12 ). ACT failed to differentiate patients with ctDNA positive status in stages I and SCC (Figure  S7 ). Therefore, these results imply that ACT may obtain preferable therapeutic outcomes in stage II-III and the AD subgroup for ctDNA-positive patients."

The prognostic value of monitoring ctDNA status is increasing with time from baseline to longitudinal timepoints, which is further confirmed by the analysis of clinical predictive values (PPV&NPV). We also conducted subgroup analyses at baseline, postoperative, and longitudinal timepoints, which show the estimates are consistent in almost all subgroups. In addition, the role of ctDNA status in determining whether ACT shall be conducted or not was confirmed by our analysis. We discovered that only patients with postoperative ctDNA positive status may benefit from ACT. Subgroup analyses further identified that the beneficial effects mainly helped stage II-III and AD subgroups.\n\nThe quality of each included study was assessed as high level according to the NOS. Most of the studies were designed as prospective cohort studies. The definitions of critical variables were clearly described in the method part of the published articles, such as ctDNA panel formation, definition of ctDNA positive status, and testing timepoints. Some studies  [13, 24]  described the postoperative and longitudinal ctDNA positive statuses as molecular residual disease (MRD), which was not used in other included studies. A part of patients with postoperative ctDNA positive status still survived without recurrence. Thus, we did not describe the postoperative or longitudinal ctDNA positive status as MRD. The major defect of the existing study designs is between-group comparability. Only several studies with comparatively large sample sizes reported sensitivity analysis by accounting for the heterogeneity of between-group baseline characteristics  [12, 13] . We speculate that small sample size is the major cause for the imperfection. Therefore, to cover the shortage, we used reconstructed IPD-based synthesis with several types of sensitivity analyses (e.g., multivariate Cox regression and PSM) to handle demographic disparities between groups. In addition, inter-study heterogeneity was further dealt with using sensitivity analysis based on stratified Cox regression and shared frailty models.\n\nThe existing studies focus on the clinical value of plasm ctDNA monitoring at three timepoints, including baseline, postoperative, and longitudinal timepoints. In our study, the baseline timepoint was defined as the time after diagnosis and before any treatment, including NAT and radical surgery. Reportedly, postoperative ctDNA positive status within 3 days rapidly degraded after radical surgery and showed no prognostic value of recurrence  [32] . Thus, the postoperative timepoint was defined as the time duration from 3 days to 1 months after surgery. The longitudinal timepoint was defined as any timepoint during the follow-up period (once per 3-6 months). Some studies suggest that ctDNA at baseline timepoint is not an independent predictor of recurrence. A study with 20 participants implies that the presence of ctDNA at diagnosis is not associated with recurrence-free survival in the follow-up with a median duration of 30 months  [19] . However, after analyzing preoperative plasma samples of 55 early-stage NSCLC patients, Cho JH et al.  [21]  reported an opposite outcome in terms of the prognostic role of baseline ctDNA status. Our synthetic findings demonstrate that baseline positive ctDNA status can be an independent predictor of prognosis (both recurrence and OS) for operable NSCLC (stage I-III).\n\nIn terms of postoperative ctDNA status, Vasseur D et al.  [9]  failed to identify its relationship with diseasefree survival or OS. Simon N et al.  [18]  investigated 70 samples and insisted that postoperative plasma ctDNA may be a potential vicious biomarker of recurrence. A small pilot cohort showed that postoperative ctDNA positive status was significantly associated with recurrence, although the absence of plasma ctDNA was not associated with the lack of recurrence  [20] . In all, the majority of the included studies demonstrate that postoperative ctDNA positive status is significantly correlated with higher risk of recurrence  [15, 16] . Our study confirms that the postoperative presence of ctDNA can be an independent prognostic biomarker for operable NSCLC (stages I-III), which shows better predictive value than the baseline ctDNA status. In terms of longitudinal ctDNA monitoring, all studies discover that persistent absence of plasma ctDNA during the follow-up period predicts a significantly higher probability of curing, which is also verified by our analysis. Moreover, the clinical predictive value of plasma ctDNA monitoring peaks at the longitudinal timepoint compared with the baseline and postoperative timepoints.\n\nThe existing studies did not investigate the impact of baseline factors on the prognostic value of ctDNA status. Our analyses show that the prognostic value of ctDNA status exists in almost all subgroups based on baseline characteristics. The prognostic value of ctDNA is apparently higher at stage I than at stage II/III and is lower in the ACT group than in the non-ACT group. Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation between ctDNA status change after radical surgery and DFS. Results demonstrate that patients with persistent ctDNA negative status have better survival outcomes than patients with ctDNA negative conversion and show an elevated DFS versus those with ctDNA positive conversion or continuous ctDNA positive status. Similar results were identified in the group of ctDNA status change after ACT. Additionally, we investigated the HRs (95% CI) of DFS by combining postoperative ctDNA status and ACT and found only stage II-III patients with postoperative ctDNA positive status benefited from ACT. Subgroup analysis by pathological types further showed the improved DFS due to ACT mainly came from the AD group rather than the non-AD group.\n\nSeveral limitations exist in our study. Firstly, we failed to collect the survival data of some included studies and reconstructed these data using reported statistical methods. Even though the reported K-M curves can be reproduced using our reconstructed survival data, this may impair the final results of our study. Secondly, we failed to retract the baseline characteristics of patients in some studies and thereby had to exclude these patients from multivariate Cox regression analysis and PSM. The quality of included abstract studies failed to be comprehensively reviewed. It might bring about some bias in our meta-analysis. Thirdly, we assigned several types of postoperative adjuvant therapy into the ACT group, including ACT, radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy. Unfortunately, targeted therapy and ICIs only occupied a very tinny proportion. Therefore, our results about the clinical value of ctDNA for ACT are inapplicable to targeted therapy and ICI treatment. Furthermore, because of the variation of ctDNA panels among included studies, the definition of ctDNA positive status varied among these included studies. We failed to unify the definitions of ctDNA positive status, and the difference of ctDNA panels between the included studies may lead to bias in our results. Additionally, most of the included studies came from mainland China, which may limit the application of our conclusions into other ethnic populations. Thus, the prognostic role of ctDNA in operable NSCLC shall be further investigated in patients of other races."
