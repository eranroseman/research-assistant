  "title": "Text Messaging Interventions for Adolescent and Young Adult Substance Use: a Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Tobacco and alcohol use continues to be associated with negative health outcomes among adolescents and young adults. New technologies such as text messaging can increase access to substance use interventions and have now been established as an evidence-based, recommended approach towards substance use prevention. This review presents results from a meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of text message interventions for tobacco and alcohol cessation within adolescent and young adult populations. Results from 14 studies with effect sizes are ranging from -0.25 to 0.54. Combining the effect sizes across studies yielded a summary effect size of 0.25, indicating that in general, text interventions have a positive effect on reducing substance use behaviors. Results are discussed in the context of prevention opportunities and recommendations for future text messaging intervention research.",

      "text": "Substance use continues to be a public health issue among adolescents and young adults where the transitions between these developmental life phases have been identified by researchers as a critical period for use and misuse of substances  (Stone et al. 2012) . Recent national survey data estimate that 10 % of youth ages 12 to 17 in the USA are current tobacco users, as are almost 40 % of young adults, ages 18 to 25 [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) 2012]. Alcohol use among these age groups is also concerning. Among youth ages 12 to 17, 13 % endorsed current alcohol use, with rates rising to 16 % among those who are 18 to 20 years old  (SAMHSA 2012) . Efforts to prevent alcohol and tobacco use and related negative sequelae are often aimed at adolescents and young adults (e.g.,  Botvin and Griffin 2004; Hester et al. 2012) , as initiation usually occurs before the legal age of use of these products  (SAMHSA 2012) ."

      "title": "Limitations of Human-Delivered Prevention Approaches",
      "text": "While substantial scientific progress has been made regarding substance use prevention, the limits of human-delivered approaches for public health issues such as substance use are evident. There simply are not enough evidence-based interventions being delivered with high fidelity to meet the need to prevent adolescent and young adult substance use  (National Prevention Council 2011) . Leaders in the prevention science field are now calling for the testing of optimal combinations of known prevention programs to address large-scale, complex, multiple problem behaviors (Gorman-Smith 2014). To address both the need for scaling up interventions and combining effective programs to reach underserved populations, mobile interventions, such as text messaging, have emerged with the promise of bridging some of the critical gaps in the field. For example, new technologies such as text messaging can increase cost-effective access to evidence-based treatments among larger populations, reach underserved populations, and reduce stigma associated with traditional interventions  (Cunningham et al. 2011) .\n\nWithin the context of mobile health, these interventions address critical gaps in human-delivered intervention approaches to prevention science by reducing the need to come to providers, are individualized based on need, are private and can be delivered anytime at any location, and are delivered with 100 % fidelity. In contrast, engaging teens and young adults in traditional face-to-face programs is a difficult task, given that this group reports having high levels of stigma associated with substance use services are less likely to be screened for substance use and are less likely to receive substance use services  (Mason et al. 2013) . Systems of care struggle to efficiently provide high-quality programming that can be flexible to individual needs while simultaneously meeting larger group needs  (Fagan et al. 2011 ). The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends that effective interventions to address substance abuse need to be readily available, individualized, adaptive, and regularly assessed (NIDA 2012). These qualities are inherent to many effective mobile health interventions, providing an opportunity for researchers to begin to test new delivery mechanisms for combining known evidence-based prevention programs to reach underserved populations."

      "title": "Mobile Health Interventions",
      "text": "The recent rise of mobile technology has begun to offer researchers new tools with which to develop such interventions. In particular, mobile phone use worldwide has significantly increased in the past decade. Text messaging has become a common feature of many of these mobile phone service plans. Recent figures suggest that over six trillion text messages are sent annually (International Telecommunication Union 2010)-an astounding 200,000 text messages per second. In a recent comprehensive survey on American use of short message service (sms), aka text messaging, the Pew Research Center found that 83 % of adults own mobile phones and nearly three quarters (73 %) of these send and receive text messages. Racial minorities (African-Americans in particular) utilize texting more than whites, and individuals with lower levels of education and income text more often compared to those with more education and income. On average, women across all age groups text slightly more than men (male=40.9; female=42.0) (Smith 2011) . Young adults, in particular, are the most active sms users across all age groups. This upsurge in the use of text messaging has created an attractive new avenue for health-focused prevention and intervention efforts. Mobile phones are being used in a variety of health-care activities, including health service appointment reminders, medication adherence, and self-management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, tobacco cessation, and problem drinking reduction (e.g.,  Bacigalupo et al. 2012; Free et al. 2011; Suffoletto et al. 2012; Quinn et al. 2011) . Mobile phone-based interventions have now been established as an evidence-based, recommended approach towards substance use prevention, such as tobacco [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2011;  Cunningham et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2011] .\n\nA growing literature is documenting the use of mobile phone-based interventions for substance abuse prevention and treatment with most of these efforts being aimed at tobacco use among adult populations (e.g.,  Borland et al. 2012; Free et al. 2009) . In a recent meta-analysis of five studies, mobile phone interventions aimed at tobacco cessation increased the long-term quit rates of adult smokers significantly when compared to control programs  (Whittaker et al. 2012 ). These mobile phone interventions have included interactive text message programs alone (e.g. Free et al. 2009 ) and/or in combination with web-based assistance programs  (Borland et al. 2012 ) and video messages delivered via text message  (Whittaker et al. 2011 ). More recently, researchers have begun to test these text messaging intervention programs on samples that include adolescents and young adults."

      "text": "Mobile phone interventions may offer a cost-effective, readily available avenue to provide personalized substance abuse preventive and treatment support to adolescents and young adults. This intervention medium is especially suited for these groups for several reasons. First, mobile phone ownership and use have increased dramatically among this age group in recent years. Both mobile phone ownership and text messaging are nearly universal among those who are 18 to 24 years old, with 95 % owning a mobile phone and 97 % of these owners using text messaging. US mobile phone owners between the ages of 18 and 24 exchange an average of 110 messages on a normal day  (Smith 2011 ). In addition, mobile phone interventions offer an alternative to traditional types of interventions and the barriers associated with these, such as cost, transportation, and stigma. Mobile phone-based interventions can be utilized for little cost, do not require travel to a specialist's office, and can be utilized without the stigma of having to inform friends and family members or be seen visiting mental health service facilities.\n\nGiven the favorable outcomes of mobile phone interventions with adult substances users and the widespread acceptance of mobile phone use among younger age groups, mobile phone-based substance use interventions for teens and young adults appear to be promising. However, little is known about the effect of these interventions on this age group. The present meta-analytic study sought to expand on this literature by examining the effectiveness of text message interventions for tobacco and alcohol cessation within adolescent and young adult populations. We were interested in the comparative effectiveness of text message intervention programs as compared with control interventions or treatment as usual. This study addressed the following research question: What is the comparative effectiveness of text message interventions relative to control conditions among adolescents and young adults using tobacco or alcohol?"

      "title": "Eligibility Criteria and Search Strategy",
      "text": "Studies included in the current review were required to meet specific eligibility criteria. First, studies had to include a text message intervention program in which substance use prevention, reduction, or cessation was the primary goal of the trial. Text messaging interventions were broadly defined, comprising any intervention that included a component where sms was sent to participants' mobile phones. Typically, this is an automated process via a web-based, computer program; however, not all studies provided this level of programmatic detail. Studies were included whether the text message intervention was offered as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with another program as long as sufficient detail was reported to calculate unique effect sizes. Eligible studies were included only if they utilized a sample that was inclusive of adolescents and/or young adults ages 12 to 29, using National Institutes of Health age group definitions  (Bleyer and Albritton 2003) . All included studies were required to be randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that provided enough baseline information from which to calculate effect sizes. Further, eligible studies had to include use of at least one substance (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, etc.) as a primary outcome measure, either by selfreport or biochemically verified tests. Finally, eligible studies were required to be published in 2000 or later and to be written in English.\n\nStudies were identified using a variety of sources including electronic databases such as PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Databases, and Google Scholar. In addition, reference lists from all screened and eligible studies also were screened for potentially relevant reports and published articles. After receiving specific search training from a university research librarian, the search was performed by one author and repeated by another author to determine accuracy. Any discrepancies or search concerns were discussed among all four authors as well as with the expert advice of a research librarian who provided consultation during the search process. Titles, abstracts, and keywords were searched using the terms \"adolescent\" or \"young adult\" and \"text message\" or \"sms\" or \"mobile app\" and \"substance use\" or \"tobacco\" or \"alcohol\" or \"marijuana\" and \"intervention\" or \"prevention\" or \"cessation\" or \"quit\" or \"counsel\" or \"abstain\" or \"discourage.\" This search yielded 14 eligible studies that measured the effects of text message-based intervention programs on alcohol and tobacco use outcomes, reported between 2000 and 2013. No studies targeting marijuana use were found. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were coded on several variables, including target substance, age, gender, and primary finding."

      "text": "Each study was reviewed and determined to be appropriate if the necessary descriptive statistics were available, such as means, standard deviations, odds ratios, and confidence intervals. We used a random effects model to compute a summary effect size. We chose the random effects model because the selected studies were not likely to be functionally equivalent due to their variability in terms of the number of text messages, the duration of the intervention, and the constitution of the samples. Additionally, a random effects model allows for greater generalizability compared with a fixed effects model. We conducted homogeneity tests by calculating the Q statistic; results were significant (Q=28.56, df=13), indicating that effect sizes underlying each selected study were not homogenous.\n\nAccording to statistical procedures described by  Borenstein et al. (2009) , we first calculated the effect size for each study. We obtained Cohen's d  (Cohen 1988 ) by computing the standard mean difference for four studies. For the other 10 studies, we computed Cohen's d by converting odds ratios provided in each articles' results to standard mean differences. Then, we converted Cohen's d to Hedges' g  (Hedges 1981 ) to remove the estimation bias of effect sizes ascribed to small sample sizes. Next, we computed the variance for each study. The inverse variance was assigned as a weight for each study, with larger weights indicating better precision. We then combined the effect size across studies to create a summary effect size."

For some studies, only part of the entire sample was included in this meta-analysis if the trial included more than one intervention and control group. Also, if a study included multiple age groups such as young adult and adults, we only included the young adult groups. For these studies, the sample size reported is accurate to what was included in the analysis of the intervention, while gender is reported on the whole sample, as subsample descriptive statistics were not available. Studies reported the number of texts sent in varying forms, as counts, ranges, and means. We contacted four authors to clarify the number of texts sent to include in Table  1 .\n\nEleven studies targeted tobacco use (n=10,573) and three focused on alcohol (n=79) for a total of 10, 652 research participants.

Sample sizes ranged from 18 to 5,792, and follow-ups ranged from 1 to 12 months. Eight of the 14 papers stated that the intervention was predicated upon a particular theory, four did not report any theory, and two papers were classified as \"generic motivation\" (see Table  1 ).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This review examined the specific and combined effects of text messaging interventions on tobacco and alcohol use. Results of this review suggest that there is sufficient evidence to warrant further research into the promising effects of this low-cost intervention delivery model. Effect sizes varied, but approximately one third of participants in the treatment conditions reduced their tobacco or alcohol use as compared to control participants. Many of the tobacco studies had large samples, thus providing confidence in these findings and increasing precision in the analyses. Effect sizes varied but appeared to cluster in the small to medium range, with few outliers. Effect sizes need to be interpreted differently with text-based interventions compared to typical face-to-face interventions normally used in behavioral clinical trials. The cost of developing, programming, and monitoring the text-based intervention is relatively small compared to the cost of treatment development, therapist training, fidelity, adherence, and monitoring typical interventions. A large cost savings is not having to pay for a clinician to deliver the intervention or paying for trainers to ensure fidelity, treatment adherence, and monitoring across a trial. Further, the interventions are delivered exactly as designed, resulting in a 100 % reliable (barring a technical problem) intervention, providing confidence in results that is rare among person-based delivery models. Given these advantages, the effect sizes would not have to be large to be interpreted as meaningful. For example, if a text-based intervention can reach 1,000 participants every year at a relatively limited expense and have an effect size of 0.25 on a significant public health problem such as tobacco use, this would be considered a very important and useful intervention. These issues are essential for prevention scientists to consider as the creative use of mobile health interventions exponentially expands in the literature. The use of texting as a stand-alone intervention method, as a supplement to augment traditional evidence-based interventions and to improve treatment adherence, is in its infancy. This review demonstrates the effectiveness and the usefulness of this emerging tool for prevention science.\n\nAs evidence of the early developmental stage of this research, there were only three interventions targeting alcohol use. These three studies were feasibility trials and had the smallest sample sizes; two of these  (Mason et al. 2014; Moore et al. 2013 ) had the fewest texts per intervention among the studies. Only the paper by  Suffoletto et al. (2012)  had a significant effect size. While our review only calculated effect sizes for alcohol use behaviors, there were other significant outcomes within these papers. For example,  Mason et al. (2014)  found large and significant intervention effects on intentionality to reduce alcohol consumption, an immediate antecedent of drinking behavior (ES = 1.38, p < 0.05). Importantly,  Moore et al. (2013)  found that collecting data on alcohol consumption via text messages provides a valid index of hazardous alcohol use in comparison to a standardized alcohol use measures, providing methodological  As illustrated in Fig.  2 , a moderate dose-response effect appears to be evident with regards to the number of text messages included within each intervention and the correlation with effect size (r=0.663, p<0.01). While there are outliers in this distribution, a positive linear trend is evident. Given the developmental stage of mobile health intervention research, there is reason to continue to test the effects of text message frequency and outcomes with well-powered samples across varying substances and behaviors. It is important to note that there was also heterogeneity across the studies in the actual content of the text messages; interventionists need to investigate how the content of text messages influences outcomes. Finding the \"sweet spot\" that delivers a well-worded intervention with an appropriate frequency but does not dissuade a participant from engaging in the intervention is an important goal for this area of research. It is reasonable that in the very near future, texting programs and mobile applications will become more highly interactive and adaptive, creating texting interventions that can respond to participants in real time, delivering tailored, personalized modules that are based on the target problem; the participant's characteristics, such as age, gender, and race; and the context of the study (e.g., health-care setting versus college setting).\n\nApproximately one third of the studies reviewed did not report a theory associated with the interventions. This lack of foundational intervention guidance would likely be problematic in most behavioral research. In some ways, if text-based interventions are simply reminders to exercise, not smoke or use harmful substances, a lack of sophisticated theory is acceptable. However, there is a concern that mobile health interventions need to be critically reviewed regarding their use of traditional health behavior theories. In a recent review,  Riley et al. (2011)  found that not only are mobile interventions not explained theoretically, but they are much less analyzed in enough detail to determine mechanisms of change. There is a concern that traditional, more static, between-person theories do not fit with the interactive, dynamic, within-person approaches foundational to mobile health applications. Riley et al. (2011)  are asking an important question: Has technology surpassed our behavioral theories, making these less useful for the modern, technologically engaged person? As mobile health interventions can dynamically interact with an individual's context and immediate health status, appropriate theoretical models would have to have an adaptive, regulatory understanding of behavior change. Most health behavior theories are built upon static and linear assumptions regarding the dynamic between interventions and human behavior, making these ill-fit for mobile health research  (Riley et al. 2011 ). Thus, the challenge for mobile health research is to begin testing more dynamic and interactive approaches in order to better conceptualize the rapid and proximal behavior change associated with mobile health interventions. This will demand the explicit adaptation of existing theories or the development of new, more appropriate theories.\n\nSeveral limitations must be considered, both within these studies individually and within the current review. In general, most of these studies lacked detail into the intervention content. That is to say, the reader receives general descriptions of the intervention, rarely reading the actual text messages that were delivered, even in summary format. Without this level of detail, replication is severely limited. Next, the frequency and length of texting interventions on many studies were very difficult to decipher. As noted, we had to contact four authors for clarification. Several of these studies are individualized, and the number of text messages sent varies by participant need; still, an average number and length could be reported to help the reader understand the number of text messages to effect size relationship. A limitation of the primary findings is that text-based interventions are not compared to other types of interventions. It is assumed that because such dramatic differences are evident in the delivery of the interventions (face-to-face versus texts), that direct comparison was not appropriate. However, this could be an interesting area to address in future studies. Another limitation is the lack of explicit use or nonuse of theory as a guide. This may be the product of a new and developing area where this type of detail may be less critical. However, to begin to understand the mechanisms of change, this line of research will need to report in more detail the intervention itself, the number of text messages sent as part of the intervention, and the technical information in order to move forward scientifically. Another limitation was the lack of technical information reported in most of these studies. Some of this may have been due to space limitations. Nonetheless, without sharing the specific technological framework, such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP), and automated texting program and textenabled web-based applications, such as TROPO (2013), the readers are left to guess as to how the actual messages were created, delivered, monitored, stored, and transformed into user-friendly data. Enough information should be shared so that a nontechnical reader can at least have references to do further reading. In addition, the current review was limited in its ability to isolate adolescent and young adults from samples that included these groups but did not report enough data to calculate unique effect sizes by group. This may be a product of the small number of studies that met our review criteria and the early developmental stage of this line of research. Finally, only three studies focused on alcohol; no studies concentrated on marijuana or other substances of abuse. This clearly highlights the need to expand this research to address more substances with more distinct age, race/ethnicity, and gender groups.\n\nBased on this review, we make the following recommendations for this line of research going forward:\n\n1. Provide sufficient detail of the intervention; if adapted from a face-to-face therapy, describe the adaptation process; describe theoretical foundation 2. Sufficiently describe the text messages in terms of frequency and duration 3. Describe with enough detail the technical programs and procedures to allow replication 4. Begin to analyze moderation and mediation processes to better understand the mechanism of change.\n\nIn all, this review and the studies included have yielded useful insights into the current state of text messaging for substance use interventions. This line of research is no doubt poised to rapidly expand as low-cost, large studies can continue to be refined and improve their design. The potential for highly flexible, adaptive interactive interventions that respond in real time has promise to support current evidence-based prevention interventions and to expand into novel areas of health promotion and risk reduction."
