  "title": "Effectiveness of mHealth Interventions in Medication Adherence among Patients with Cardiovascular Diseases: A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "mHealth interventions have been reported to improve adherence to long-term therapies in chronic conditions. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in medication adherence among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), a leading cause of mortality globally. Relying on our inclusion criteria and the PRISMA recommendations, a literature search was carried out in the PubMed, Medline, and ProQuest databases for primary studies that investigated the impact of mHealth on medication adherence for cardiovascular disease (CVD) between 2000-2021. A total of 23 randomized controlled trials with 34,915 participants matched the selection criteria. The mHealth interventions used included text messages, mobile phone applications, and voice calls, which were used either as a single intervention or combined. Additionally, studies on enhancing drug adherence had contradictory findings: most of the studies elaborated positive results; however, six studies were unable to reveal any significant effect. Finally, a risk bias analysis revealed varying outcomes across all studies. This review, as a whole, supported the notion that mHealth interventions can be effective in improving adherence to CVD medication even though they could not improve adherence to all CVD medications when compared with controls. Further trials with more refined designs integrated with comprehensive interventions are needed to produce better health outcomes.",

      "text": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for 17.9 million deaths annually (31% of all deaths globally)  [1] . It is a key contributor to premature deaths and escalating healthcare expenses  [2, 3] . Cardiovascular diseases are projected by Global Health to remain the leading cause of mortality in 2030  [4] . To reduce the burden of CVDs, adequate control of CVD risk factors is required; such factors include high blood pressure, excess body weight, high blood lipids, cigarette smoking, and diabetes. Elevated blood pressure has been reported to be the most significant contributing factor to CVDs  [5] . It was indicated in the Global Burden of Disease study that each of the above-mentioned risk factors was among the top 10 causes of a loss in disability-adjusted life years  [6] .\n\nAdherence is the degree to which an individual's behavior in taking medications, maintaining a diet, and implementing other lifestyle changes matches with accepted advice from a healthcare professional. Medication non-adherence is acknowledged as a leading healthcare problem that can be prevented and as a serious obstacle to improving clinical outcomes. Non-adherence to medication represents the leading cause of mortality for more than 60% of cardiovascular patients. Medication use is a complex activity that is influenced by a variety of elements that include experience, beliefs, and culture. Medication-taking Diseases 2023, 11, 41 2 of 18 habits might vary between different drugs. Faster medical care that boosts medication adherence is currently one of the most serious issues. Despite efforts, randomized controlled trials have only shown a limited impact on medication-taking behavior  [7] [8] [9] [10] .\n\nDespite substantial resources being allocated to developing new regimens, nonadherence to current medications is persistent and remains an issue of public health importance. This is because non-adherence depletes evidence-based therapy, thereby escalating mortality rates annually and globally and thus contributing to unwarranted healthcare disbursements. The complexity of non-adherence makes it challenging to define and accurately identify its presence in patients, leading to increased risk for worse cardiac events and a higher mortality rate. Therefore, innovative tools for assessing and screening patients for non-adherence will enhance interventions targeted at improving adherence  [11] .\n\nThe most widely used interventions to improve cardiovascular medication adherence include unsophisticated pillboxes and calendars, while the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and blister packs have been used in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Other modern-day interventions commonly used include mobile applications, reminder services, automated dispensers, real-time provider feedback, networkable MEMS, and biomarkers, which can measure adherence objectively  [11] . While the availability of these sophisticated tools could be a step in proffering a solution to the issue of non-adherence, their extensive implementation remains restricted. Given that most of the interventions are complicated and not cost-effective, non-adherence behavior necessitates designing and implementing cost-effective interventions.\n\nWith the extensive possession of mobile telephones and 5.3 billion mobile broadband global subscribers in 2018 (ICT 2018), the possibility of automation gives rise to the likelihood of designing and implementing cost-effective interventions of behavior changes to a large sample population. In recent times, mobile health is a resource that has gained popularity. The use of mobile phones (mHealth) was reported as a necessity for prompt and enhanced mHealth research and yielded promising results  [12] . Targeting behavior modification could be accomplished with the use of mHealth technologies  [13] .\n\nIn addition, mobile phone interventions are associated with only a few adverse events (such as the probability of road traffic accidents)  [14] . Even if mHealth is becoming increasingly popular, there is still no proof of its effectiveness  [15] . Today, mHealth, electronic health (e-Health), and telehealth can be used as replacements for each other. The Global Observatory for e-Health defined mHealth as the support of medical and public health using mobile devices, which include mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), patient monitoring devices, and wireless devices.\n\nEven though mHealth interventions to improve medication adherence in chronic disease patients have supposedly been positive, their impact on cardiovascular disease medication adherence is still not clear, so there is an urge to find literature support to establish a causal relationship. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to determine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on cardiovascular medication adherence."

      "text": "In recent times, technology-based interventional approaches such as mHealth, eHealth, and telehealth have become essential tools. mHealth technology is at the same time assessable, faster, and acceptable to the community.\n\nFindings from previous studies showed improvement in medication adherence in patients after mobile health interventions. mHealth, which has gained popularity in recent times, has attained amassed interest as a tool for enhancing health promotion interventions as well as the provision of CVD prevention in an accessible manner with a relatively lower cost. Moreover, mHealth has a specific potential to promote lifestyle modification and is an effective tool for improving adherence  [39] .\n\nIn the present review, studies on enhancing drug adherence had contradictory findings: 17 trials (73.9%) reported a significant improvement in medication adherence, whereas 6 studies (26%) failed to show a substantial impact of the intervention on medication adherence. The effectiveness of mHealth interventions on cardiovascular medication adherence has also been reported in other systematic reviews, which showed that the majority of studies reported an improvement in medication adherence and other health outcomes  [39, 40] . Similar findings from an existing body of literature strengthen the current review's evidence  [41] [42] [43] .\n\nIn the current review, most of the studies used SMS only as an intervention, while some trials used SMS in combination with Micro Letters or voice calls. In a meta-analysis review, patients who received SMS-based interventions were found more likely to be adequately adherent than the control group  [44] .\n\nmHealth apps (mobile and web-based) were also another popular mHealth intervention identified in the current review. A review was conducted to assess the impact of mHealth apps on adherence to CVD that revealed mixed results with reasonable acceptability  [45] . As such, the two commonly used modes of mHealth delivery are text messaging (short messaging service or SMS) and smartphone applications  [39] . In the present review, seven studies employed the use of SMS to improve medication adherence, while five studies employed mHealth-based apps. Both SMS and phone applications have the ability to serve the role of a drug intake reminder, blood pressure monitor, or routine clinic appointment reminder  [40] .\n\nThe current review identified other mHealth technologies used that included phone calls, interactive patient support apps, interactive text messages, interactive voice calls, wireless self-monitoring gadgets, electronic pill bottle reminder devices, emails, automated messages, and phone calls. Similarly, numerous effective delivery strategies were identified in other systematic reviews; these included SMS  [46, 47] , automated phone messages, and reminders  [48] .\n\nHowever, in certain cases, the reported beneficial outcome was not always a result of the patient's choice of a particular tool. A study compared different interventions to determine their effects on adherence to medication. The study used various tools that included pillboxes and smartphones. Smartphones reported a higher adherence score than pill counts  [20] . Moreover, a multifaceted intervention medication reconciliation and tailoring, patient education, collaborative care between a pharmacist and a patient's primary care clinician, and voice messaging were used  [21] .\n\nA meta-analysis of mHealth intervention to improve adherence in chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, and HIV infection showed improvement in medication adherence; this included 16 randomized controlled trials  [49] . mHealth intervention had a positive impact on improving antiretroviral therapies in HIV patients and in antituberculosis treatment  [49] ; however, cardiovascular diseases require further refined designs.\n\nmHealth is a more personalized method that helps individuals in managing their condition using an apt and standard design form. It has also been found to be an efficient tool in various studies of real-time data analysis. A study showed interest in smartwatches because they are a potential tool and have multifunctional dimensions like a smartphone.\n\nThe study presented a smartwatch-based medication reminder system and also introduced an early prototype to improve medication adherence  [50] . Furthermore, it could help the clinicians to improve adherence to treatment, which could be beneficial to the the patient  [51] . This has been found in different studies in which medication adherence was measured using different designs, sample sizes, intervention approaches of mHealth, adherence measuring tools, outcome measures, and the multitude of methods.\n\nMobile health strategies are instrumental in addressing the issue of medication nonadherence, which has been a challenge in the management of chronic diseases. Despite the positive feedback reported regarding the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in adherence to cardiovascular medications, more studies on the cost-effectiveness of this intervention type are required, especially in resource-limited settings. Some studies have stated that mHealth interventions are cost-effective; for instance, an mHealth intervention study in Kenya reported a marginal cost of USD 0.02 per SMS and a weekly SMS, which represented a cost of almost USD 1 per patient annually. This suggested that mHealth intervention requires a minimum cost to implement but has the potential to yield effective results. However, it was suggested that the cost of other equipment used (as well as the training of research assistants) be included in the total cost. Apart from being less capital intensive, implementing this type of intervention is also convenient for both the health provider and the patient who is the recipient because messages reach the patient at any time and place. This intervention is also less time-consuming and curbs the problem of accessibility to the health facility because patients can communicate directly with their health providers through voice calls and phone apps. It is convenient in resource-limited facilities where venues for routine health education sessions are limited or unavailable, but health information can be delivered through this medium. The participants in all of the chosen trials were diverse. The fact that they varied from one another in terms of their medical and social profiles may have influenced the results, but the authors used the data from the studies to assess how well the interventions worked. Additionally, there was no established time frame for assessing therapies because adherence is a behavior that lasts a lifetime. Studies on enhancing drug adherence have contradictory findings, where seventeen studies (73.91%) reported significant improvement in medication adherence whereas, six studies (26.09%) failed to show a substantial impact of the intervention on medication adherence. Overall, RCTs using various interventions in the current review showed improvement in adherence to CVDs (Figure  3 ).\n\nDiseases 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 18\n\nThe study presented a smartwatch-based medication reminder system and also introduced an early prototype to improve medication adherence  [50] .

Overall, RCTs using various interventions in the current review showed improvement in adherence to CVDs (Figure  3 ). However, in planning a mHealth intervention, it is recommended that studies of this nature design an acceptable, standardized, systematic, and validated mobile phone application to facilitate the implementation. In the present review, only the studies in  [34, 52]  had customized applications designed for their interventions. Furthermore, the timing of sending messages and making calls as well as the language used must be acceptable to and understandable by the patients. Close attention should be paid to the content and frequency of the messages and calls to fully achieve the goal of the intervention and gain the benefits thereof. An alternative method should be considered for patients who have problems with their sight, speech, or hearing, as well as for patients who cannot read. All these factors should be considered in designing mHealth interventions. Lastly, one of the goals of behavioral interventions is to produce lasting or durable behavioral changes that will yield positive health outcomes. On this note, it is suggested that future research on mHealth focus on the long-term impact of this intervention on adherence behavior among cardiovascular disease patients because this will provide more authentic findings and justifications."

      "text": "This review, as a whole, supported the notion that mHealth interventions can be effective in improving adherence to CVD medication even though the use of various mHealth interventions could not improve adherence to all CVD medications when compared with controls. Further trials with more refined designs integrated with comprehensive and effective interventions are needed. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness studies of such interventions should be conducted to further derive the benefits of mHealth interventions. This will enable policymakers to reserve capital-intensive interventions for patients who are most in need of such interventions; for instance, patients dealing with factors that mHealth cannot overcome (such as adverse drug reactions or a high pill burden)."
