  "title": "Efficacy of app-based mobile health interventions for stress management: A systematic review and meta-analysis of self-reported, physiological, and neuroendocrine stress-related outcomes",
  "abstract": "Stress is a significant mental health concern for the general population, highlighting the need for effective and scalable solutions, such as mobile health (mHealth) app interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of mHealth apps designed primarily to reduce stress and distress in non-clinical and subclinical populations. A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to August 2024, including studies that measured both self-reported and physiological stress outcomes. 80 studies were analyzed. A small but significant effect size (g = 0.33) was found for self-reported stress outcomes, with studies that used specific active controls, operated in naturalistic contexts, and had a low risk of bias showing significantly lower effect sizes. A similarly small effect size was observed for physiological outcomes (g = 0.24). Notably, studies that employed muscle and breathing relaxation, meditation strategies, personalized guidance, experimental usage settings, and measured acute stress responses demonstrated significantly higher effect sizes. Further analysis of specific physiological systems revealed small effect sizes for autonomic (g = 0.32) and cardiac outcomes (g = 0.36). The significant effects observed across both psychological and physiological outcomes support the efficacy and potential of mHealth apps for the self-management of stress responses in the broader population.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Mobile-based interventions in mental health (mHealth) have been appreciated as representing viable solutions for the accessibility problems faced by the current health system (e.g., geographical constraints, discouraging access due to lack of anonymity, insufficient number of professionals  (Linardon et al., 2019) , holding promise for improving the access to the already available evidence-based psychological treatments. Their importance and relevance have been realized now more than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the need for digital health services and stress management support was acutely felt by the population (;  Torous, Myrick, Rauseo-Ricupero, & Firth, 2020) . And as attention has been drawn, this potential is even more suitable in the case of lowincome and middle-income countries, where the untreated mental health needs are even higher, while the access to a mobile device is in the same trend with the rest of the world  (Naslund et al., 2017) . This potential has led to growing interest, evidenced by the exponential rise in investments and the expansion of the smartphone application market for mental health care. By 2017, over 10,000 mental health apps were already available for download  (Torous & Roberts, 2017) . This surge has also prompted an increase in academic research investigating this field and critically examining the often confident but frequently unsupported claims made by these market apps  (Torous et al., 2019) . Systematic reviews to date have confirmed the promising efficacy of mHealth app interventions for common mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, although effect sizes are generally modest and tend to diminish as comparison conditions become more rigorous  (Goldberg, Lam, Simonsson, Torous, & Sun, 2022; Linardon et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2022) .\n\nFor other mental health conditions, particularly those characterized by high symptom severity or specific issues such as suicidality and PTSD, the evidence remains inconclusive, with no significant effects observed or a lack of sufficient studies available  (Weisel et al., 2019) . This underscores a lack of robust, generalizable evidence to support psychological mHealth interventions as standalone treatments for severe or clinically significant mental health conditions. However, mHealth is not widely regarded as a substitute for conventional mental health treatment. Instead, its primary value lies in being an economically feasible, easily accessible, low-intensity intervention suitable for individuals who do not yet require intensive medical support. This format is particularly promising for preventive use or as part of a stepped-care approach in treatment, with its greatest utility found among the general population  (Bakker, Kazantzis, Rickwood, & Rickard, 2018) . Despite the modest effect sizes, the positive outcomes for common psychological issues highlight the potential of these lowcost, highly scalable interventions to impact public health. One such broadly relevant mental health issue is stress.\n\nStress has been defined in various ways, with its conceptualization evolving according to different approaches-environmental, psychological, and biological. Despite these varied perspectives, a common core idea persists: stress is a process through which environmental demands exceed an organism's adaptive capacity, prompting physiological and psychological changes. The primary function of stress is to help the body return to homeostasis-a state of internal balance and stability. Stress activates mechanisms to cope with and adapt to these demands, ultimately aiming to restore homeostasis and prevent potential harm. As described by  Cohen, Kessler, and Gordon (1997) , stress involves this dynamic process of adaptation, which can place individuals at risk for disease if the body's capacity to maintain balance is overwhelmed.\n\nCompared to states or specific disorders, such as anxiety and depression, stress is a broad construct of general distress, which includes both more specific somatic symptoms (rapid heartbeat, pain and tense muscles) but also a broader and diffuse emotional discomfort (e.g., negative affectivity,  (Henry & Crawford, 2005) , in response to various demanding life situations. Thus, this over-inclusiveness makes stress more representative in the everyday life of each individual. Indeed, stress is an inherent part of life. Maladaptive patterns and harmful effects are what bring relevance and make salutary the objective of corrective interventions  (Selye, 1973) .\n\nCoupled with the fact that the cumulative imbalance in the body's physiological systems associated with prolonged activation of the stress response contributes to the onset of many psychiatric and physiological complications  (Chida & Steptoe, 2010; Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007; Hammen, 2005; McEwen & Stellar, 1993) , stress represents so a major concern for the public health. All these make stress one of the fittest candidates to be an outcome target in need for effective and scalable solutions like those in the format of mHealth apps.\n\nPrevious meta-analyses  (Firth et al., 2017a (Firth et al., , 2017b;; Linardon et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2022; Weisel et al., 2019)  have primarily focused on specific mental health disorders when evaluating the efficacy of mHealth smartphone apps. While some of these analyses included stress as an outcome, it was not the primary focus of their studies, and they often included only those studies where stress was not the main target of intervention. As such, including studies not primarily targeting stress prevent a clear investigation of the effect of apps designed for stress reduction. On the other hand, focusing on a broad area of mental conditions has the disadvantage of not being able to focus on the relevant characteristics of a particular outcome. Likewise, the latest and most comprehensive meta-review study so far, which synthesized results from 14 meta-analyses on mHealth intervention for mental health  (Goldberg et al., 2022)  highlighted among others the role of the relevant moderators in trying to explain the variance in the results of a particular outcome and increase thus the confidence in the obtained results.\n\nOne of those important characteristics of stress is represented by the very multilevel nature of this construct with direct implications for its assessment  (Epel et al., 2018) . Stress response comprises multiple levels of reactivity, from subjectively felt strain, to specific biological systems reactions, which equip the organism with the prepared metabolic state needed for adaptation. These processes lead to a cascade of physiological changes, including elevations in heart rate (HR) and respiration rates, increased blood pressure, and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), all of which serve as reliable indicators of stress. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation results in elevated cortisol levels, a hallmark of the body's adaptive response, while the autonomic nervous system's reactivity is reflected in altered HRV and increased salivary alpha-amylase, an enzyme linked to sympathoadrenal medullary system (SAM) activation. Hemodynamic changes, such as fluctuations in blood pressure, further underscore the cardiovascular impact of stress. Additionally, stress influences markers of immunity and inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), highlighting the interconnectedness of the stress response with immune function. These physiological parameters collectively represent key measurable outcomes that capture the breadth and impact of the body's response to stress  (McEwen, 2015) .\n\nIt is by the disruptive activations of these physiological markers, in exposure to prolonged, or large magnitude stressors, that is hypothesized to mediate the influence of stress on disease vulnerability  (McEwen & Seeman, 1999) . Thus, given its complexity and multiple physiological and psychological mechanisms by which affects our health, a multimodal approach provides a more comprehensive and accurate way to measure stress  (Epel et al., 2018) .\n\nWhile other meta-analyses and systematic reviews investigated the physiological outcomes of stress (e.g.,  de Witte, Spruit, van Hooren, Moonen, & Stams, 2020; Pascoe, Thompson, Jenkins, & Ski, 2017) , none were examining the effects in the context of mHealth app interventions. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis with the primary focus on the effects of mHealth apps specifically designed for stress management, and which statistically analyzed the results of both psychological and physiological outcomes. Thus, our objectives were to investigate the efficiency of mental health apps in stress reduction for the general population, and to explore the difference in efficiency depending on various types of stress outcomes, characteristics of the studies, samples, and interventions."

A protocol for this study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews of the National Institute for Health Research ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ ) with the CRD42021292821 ID.

      "title": "2.2.. Eligibility criteria",
      "text": "We included randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of a psychological intervention delivered via a standalone smartphone application primarily aimed at the reductions of stress/distress. We therefore excluded computer-based interventions or those that were delivered only by web, virtual reality based, text messaging-only, synchronous telehealth or adjunct interventions (where an app is part of another standard therapy intervention). Also, the blended programs (where the access to the intervention could be done either trough a mobile app or other format) were also excluded, if the intervention was not accessible by a dedicated app. This last criteria represented one of the slighty changes from the original protocol, where we proposed to accept all blended programs. The change was motivated by the rationale that as long that there was not offered a dedicated smartphone format (i. e., an app) for the intervention, most of usage cases will be done by computers or other mobile devices, precluding the investigation of the objectives of this review, focusing on mHealth smartphone apps.\n\nFor the control condition, we also required for studies to have a relevant condition in the case of active control comparisons, in that comparing with other app interventions that were not prior validated for its efficacy could confound the type of effect investigated.\n\nThe population considered eligible was represented by nonclinical or sub-clinical samples (stressed populations or other risk factors without a psychiatric or medical condition), with an age between 18 and 65 years. Articles were excluded from review if used a non-general population (e. g., caregivers, post-natal), as these samples might limit the generalisability of the results to the larger population.\n\nAs for the outcomes, to be included studies should have measured the psychological stress/distress dimension by either a self-report validated instrument or a physiological measure. Additionally, we also included measures of sleep problems when reported, and not anxiety and depression symptoms as specified in the protocol, as the evidence suggests a close link between stress and sleep that needs further investigation into intervention aspects  ( \u00c2kerstedt, 2006) , while the other outcomes are already very well represented in the review literature  (Firth et al., 2017a (Firth et al., , 2017b;; Khademian, Aslani, & Bastani, 2021) ."

      "title": "2.5.. Data extraction",
      "text": "Data were extracted from eligible studies as follows. First of all, data on the identification of the studies and their geographical area (citation and country where the study took place) and data on the characteristics of the sample, such as number, age, percentage of female gender, type of population (students, general population, workers), used to see how the stress context, expected to be different in the case of several population categories, can influence the results. The data related to the study design such as: inclusion criteria (healthy status, risk factors, unselected), naturalistic setting vs. lab-based environment and the type of control (inactive, nonspecific active, and specific active), were also coded and included in the moderation analyses. In the case of the control group, we chose this coding scheme, meeting the call that several authors make for the importance of considering the comparison conditions separately, since these design differences are expected to lead to different conclusions  (Goldberg et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2014) . Thus, those comparison conditions that did not involve any treatment, such as a waitlist or when the intervention group also received the same type of standard treatment, in addition to the mobile application, were coded as inactive control groups, as in the treatment-as-usual conditions. This type of control is considered to ensure only a minimal degree of control, remaining susceptible to placebo effects through non-specific factors, such as time, attention and expectations of improvement. Active nonspecific control groups do exactly this, keeping these non-specific factors under control, by maintaining the impression of being able to benefit also from the assigned condition, but without delivering the active ingredient, considered to be responsible for much of the expected effect. The conditions that were coded under this category include comparisons of attentional control and psychoeducation type. And under the umbrella of the last category, that of the specific active control groups, were included the studies that compared the mobile intervention with another one, whose effect for the studied outcome is already known (e.g., relaxation through music, self-monitoring, standard therapy face to face, etc.). This separation allows thus the investigation of not only efficacy, but of comparative effectiveness for the interventions in question  (Goyal et al., 2014) .\n\nData on the intervention characteristics, including the strategies employed and the theoretical orientation of the interventions, were extracted as follows: CBT-based (where applications were introduced that mainly used either classical techniques such as restructuring, behavioral activation, problem solving, etc., or third wave ones such as diffusion and values exercises); meditation/mindfulness (different meditation strategies including yoga, transcendental, love and kindness, or the most popular, mindfulness meditation); muscle and respiratory relaxation (deep and slow breathing, diaphragmatic breathing; progressive muscle relaxation); multimodal (the inclusion of several strategies from several theoretical traditions, without being able to distinguish one predominant one); and other (e.g., alternative strategies, relaxation through music). The categories thus chosen were selected starting from the systematic review of  Coulon, Monroe, and West (2016) , who identified seven main evidence-based stress management strategies for stress reduction used in the field of health psychology. At the same time, we were looking for their inclusion as informative and parsimonious as possible.\n\nIn the same effort to standardize the categories used, data related to the functions of the applications were coded by referring to pre-specified groups from the literature  (Weisel et al., 2019) : Monitoring, Participant engagement, Tailoring, Gamification, Reminders, Social component, Personalization, Guidance, Simulation of situations, option for Wearable devices.\n\nOther data related to the intervention were also coded: the duration of the intervention (in weeks), the duration of the session (in minutes), the prescribed use (daily, weekly, at discretion, experimental occasion), the level of guidance (reminder, unguided, feedback), adherence to the use of the intervention, reported satisfaction and adverse effects.\n\nFor the outcomes, we extracted the self-report measurements of psychological stress, where this construct was specifically measured, or those of psychological distress, where only this measurement was offered. In the case of physiological measurements, we coded the different biomarkers of stress in several overarching groups, paying attention to the importance of separately identifying multiple biological systems, which will allow us to synthesize the effects of mHealth applications for each of these discrete biological pathways  (de Witte et al., 2020; DuPont et al., 2020; Heckenberg, Eddy, Kent, & Wright, 2018) . The categories used were: cardiac (heart rate and breathing rate), hemodynamic (systolic blood pressure  [SBP]  and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]), HPA axis (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), DHEAS/cortisol ratio), autonomic (heart rate variability [HRV], salivary alpha amylase  [sAA] , and skin conductance), and others (immunity and inflammation markers). Physiological outcomes were also grouped into acute and chronic depending on the time-measured effect of the reaction to stress (during the intervention or after an acute stress manipulation task, and after the intervention, respectively).\n\nThe data needed for the statistical analyses were the preferable data for a meta-analysis of RCTs with continuous outcomes, in the format of post data like post means and standard deviations (SD) for each group. If data was not retrievable from publication, study authors were contacted for clarification. Other data formats like difference in means, common SD, t-value and associated p-value were extracted if the preferable ones were missing and the authors do not respond. Where other data were reported instead of means and standard deviations (SDs), we used the formula from  Higgins and Cochrane Collaboration (2020)  to convert standard errors (SEs) and confidence intervals (CIs) into SDs. Additionally, we employed the Deep Meta Tool software, based on the method outlined by  Hozo, Djulbegovic, and Hozo (2005) , to calculate means (Ms) and SDs from medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs)."

Thus, in RoB 2 bias is assessed in five distinct domains: randomisation process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result. For each field there is a defined set of signaling questions, whose answers lead based on a standard algorithm to judgments of \"low risk of bias,\" \"some concerns,\" or \"high risk of bias\". The judgments received on each field will then be able to provide an overall judgment for the outcome of the study being assessed. In this way, the RoB 2 facilitates the integration of the results obtained from the risk of bias assessment into the statistical analysis of the review, for example by stratifying the meta-analysis according to the risk of bias judgments  (Sterne et al., 2019) ."

To answer the main question of the review to find out the efficacy of mHealth applications in reducing stress, the polled effect was calculated both for the selfreported outcomes and physiological ones. There was used a randomeffects model because of the expected heterogeneity between studies, reporting the Hedge'g coefficient with the associated p-value and confidence interval, and interpreting the effect size according to the Cohen's standardized mean difference (0.2 = small, 0.5 = moderate, 0.8 = large). For trails with multiple arms and measurement per outcome, to avoid inflating power we used the mean of the comparisons  (Borenstein, 2009) .\n\nHeterogeneity was also quantified using Cochrane's Q and I 2 statistics, representing from 0 to 100 how much overall variance is between studies. A 25 % can be interpreted as low, 50 % as moderate, and 75 % as substantial heterogeneity.\n\nTo explore as many sources of the variance between studies effect, we employed subgroups analyses and meta-regressions using a mixed effects model. In the case of studies whose characteristics were coded in multiple groups per moderator category, independence was assumed this time as aggregating the effect size for these will confound the precise source of heterogeneity we were trying to assessed.\n\nFor the meta-regression models, continuous predictors were added to the model in a backward method, including all the predictors in the model and eliminating those predictors based on significance and model fit values.\n\nThe publication bias was visually inspected by funnel plot and the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill analysis, and Egger's test of the intercept were performed."

Participants in Flett, Conner, Riordan, Patterson, & Hayne, 2020 study reported experiencing a mean of 7.14 (SD = 4.91) from 59 potential meditation-related challenges, with no difference between those who used the app and those who did not use it. Hirshberg et al. (2022)  also examined worsening in symptoms by categorizing anxiety and depression severity on normative t scores. Their findings indicate that participants in the intervention group had significantly fewer chances to score high anxiety and depression symptoms at post and that no differences at the 3-month follow-up were observed. Keinert, Schindler-Gmelch, Eskofier, & Berking, 2024 recorded no severe mood from the study participants, while using a validated self-reported measure to check the changes in the negative emotions from pre-to posttreatment. They reported a mean difference (MD) of -0.17 (SD = 1.27) for the intervention group, and MD = 0.08 (SD = 1.31) in the control group, with a non-significant between group comparison (g = 0.19  [-0.58;1.26;] ).

This was largely due to the fact that participants were not blinded, and outcomes were selfreported, which introduced potential social desirability biases. Whereas the judgment of high risk of bias derived mainly from the lack of evidence that the results were not biased by missing outcome data (10.5/12.4 %), an issue covered in the missing outcome data domain."

      "title": "4.2.. Self-reported stress findings",
      "text": "In the case of self-reported stress outcomes, the small-to-medium effect size obtained (g = 0.33) corresponds with the results founded in the other meta-analyses to date that reported stress between the outcomes included  (Goldberg et al., 2022; Linardon et al., 2019) . What is new, in addition to these previous meta-analyses, is that the increasing number of studies in recent years testing smartphone app interventions, and the primarily focus of this current study on stress outcomes, has made it possible the investigation of more and relevant variables. As Fig.  3 . Forest plot of physiological stress-related outcomes such, the effect could be investigated at both 1 month and 3 month follow up periods, retaining its significant and effect size. While the scarcity of follow-up reports necessary to investigate the long-term effects was a concern in the previous mHealth meta-analytical studies, this represents an important finding, as attesting for the potential of a sustained effect of such low-intensity self-directed interventions. Among the continuous moderators analyzed, dropout rates in both the intervention and control groups were significant predictors of effect size. Specifically, a higher dropout rate in the intervention group was associated with a higher effect size, whereas a higher dropout rate in the control group was associated with a smaller effect size. Although these results may seem mixed, they reflect a well-documented pattern of differential attrition rates common in mHealth research and highlight the risk of bias associated with this issue  (Goldberg, Bolt, & Davidson, 2021 ). High dropout rates can lead to missing data, which may affect the results if the missing data is related to unobserved variables. Generally, higher dropout rates in the intervention group suggest that those who left the study might not have benefited from the app, potentially leading to lower perceived efficacy. Conversely, higher dropout rates in the control group imply that those who remained were more motivated and had better well-being, which could skew results towards lower effect sizes for the interventions compared.\n\nAnother significant moderator was the total time spent using the app, where increased usage was associated with somewhat higher effect sizes. This finding aligns with theoretical expectations and is supported by individual study results.\n\nThe type of control, laboratory context, and the risk of bias assessment were the sole moderators significantly associated with differences in effect sizes. The apps investigated in comparison with inactive controls, like waiting list and treatment as usual, obtained significantly larger effect size (g = 0.41), compared with nonspecific and specific controls (g = 0.23 and g = 0.16, respectively). A similar trend of diminishing effect size as control conditions became more rigorous was somewhat observed for the physiological outcomes as well, although here was not of a significant association as the number of studies and the difference were not sufficient. This confirms the importance of considering the types of comparison separately in allowing for different assessments of the efficiency of an intervention, as recognized and advocated in the literature  (Goyal et al., 2014) .\n\nMoreover, compared with other meta-analyses that looked at the effect separately by comparison type  (Goldberg et al., 2022; Linardon et al., 2019) , we obtained significant results as well for nonspecific and specific control groups. Thus, the smartphone interventions were efficient in reducing stress in the absence of any other treatment (inactive control), the effect is not only due to the factors of time, attention and expectation (nonspecific control), and has a comparative advantage against other interventions that were knew to be efficient as well (specific control).\n\nThe effect size was significantly smaller in the case of low risk of bias studies (g = 0.14), compared with those with high and some concerns for bias (g = 0.24 and g = 0.41, respectively), being in accordance with the findings in the general psychotherapeutic literature in which low risk studies give a more conservative effect  (Cuijpers, van Straten, Bohlmeijer, Hollon, & Andersson, 2010) .\n\nThe apps were equally effective for all types of populations included (employees, university students and general populations), with unselected, a healthy status or present at-risk factors as inclusion criteria, and in various prescribed usage (daily, weekly, at discretion), and guidance regimes (feedback, reminders, unguided). Hence, these findings add confidence to the evidence of efficiency and potential of standalone smartphone apps usage in the stress management for a broad population.\n\nThere was also observed small to moderate effect for the selfperceived sleep problems, investigated additionally in 9 trials. Other suggestions from the literature that sleep can be effectively managed by such mHealth standalone apps have been pointed out (e.g.,  Weisel et al., 2019, although  with only two studies at the time of the review, nonetheless found moderate to large effect sizes). And, while not primarily focused on sleep improvement, given the closed relationship between sleep and stress  ( \u00c2kerstedt, 2006) , these findings cast interesting considerations for the potential of brief stress management interventions to alleviate sleep disturbance symptoms."

      "title": "4.3.. Physiological stress findings",
      "text": "For physiological outcomes, a small effect size on psychological stress-related outcomes (g = 0.26) was obtained. Although the first meta-analysis, to the best of our knowledge, to investigate the effects of mHealth apps on physiological stress related outcome, the results can be compared with other meta-analyses on different types of interventions. In one of those meta-analyses, de Witte et al. (  2020 ) found a medium effect on music interventions for physiological outcomes. The difference in magnitude between this and our study could be due to the fact that other treatment strategies could be more efficient. Music relaxation, although was represented by only one app intervention strategy  (Hides et al., 2019) , and included as well as an active control condition in one of the comparisons in the current study  (Kirk & Axelsen, 2020) , where significant effects were obtained above it, might represent a more efficient intervention strategy when targeted primary at stress reduction than those found it for the apps included. Other explanation might lie in the characteristic of studies, like the type of stress response that investigators studied or allowed by the type of intervention. The results of aforementioned meta-analysis were based mainly on one-occasion interventions for the moment stress reduction, a feature which rather elicits an acute type of stress response. Indeed, as we coded for this feature, we observed that the effect size in the case of acute physiological stress response was also of medium size in our study (g = 0.48). Coding for the most relevant features of this category of intervention and outcome allows thus for further investigation of the sources of variability.\n\nSignificant moderation for the physiological outcomes was obtained by intervention strategy, prescribed usage, guidance, type of stress response, and laboratory context categories. In the case of intervention strategy, the muscle and breathing relaxation and meditation had the largest and the sole significant effects.\n\nStudies whose prescribed usage was only on the experiment occasion and offered feedback as the guidance strategy also moderated the effect, giving significant and the largest results. Coupled with the observation that, although nonsignificant as a moderator, the guidance regime of feedback drove the largest effect estimate found in the self-reported outcomes as well, these may indicate that experimental instruction can function as a professional support, which has been found to be associated with larger effects in other mHealth and as well as in web-and computer-based intervention meta-analyses  (Heber et al., 2017; Linardon et al., 2019) . Another possible contribution to the effect of experimental occasions might be due to the well-controlled laboratory conditions, which allow a more rigorous and sensible assessment  (Wilhelm, Grossman, & M\u00fcller, 2012) . To this hypothesis converge also the results by which the sole significant and larger effect size was obtained in the case of the studies carried out in a laboratory context, as opposed to a naturalistic setting. Type of stress response moderator too seemed to map to the laboratory vs. naturalistic setting in which the studies were conducted and might contribute as well both to the explanation of the larger effects in the case of laboratory conditions, and of the physiological response in general. The acute stress is characterized by a more susceptible type of stress response to the immediate shifts in the acute physiology effects of various stressors or managing strategies  (Epel et al., 2018) . For this reason, it is best measured in standardized laboratory conditions, as the small number of studies identified here for this type of response carried out in a naturalistic condition supports this (k = 6 vs. 68). At the same time, the impact of chronic stress, with a more diffuse course trajectory and ongoing adaptation required, is a more trait-like response type whose effects require more time and ingrained skills to be altered, and hence the smaller effects of a brief and lowintensity intervention in managing it.\n\nFurther, when we investigated the effects separately per different physiological systems, significant results were found only for the autonomic and cardiac outcomes, both with a small effect size of g = 0.32, and g = 0.36, respectively. Within the autonomic category, two indices for time domain HRV with medium effect sizes (RMSSD, g = 0.46 and pNN50, g = 0.69) were further found to be significant. The interpretation of such results seems to converge with the resonance frequency theory according to which slow and diaphragmatic breathing partly causes dominance of the PNS and increases in HRV, through the improved homeostasis of the baroreflex activation and the stimulation of vagal afferent pathways, with such beneficial effects as stress and mood recovery  (Lehrer & Gevirtz, 2014) ."

      "title": "4.4.. Limitations and implications for research and practice",
      "text": "The following limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, despite attempts to explain it through subgroup analyzes and moderation, there remained substantial heterogeneity unexplained for most of the results. Furthermore, many of the subgroup categories in the moderation and separate analyses for the physiological outcomes contained too few studies, which reduces statistical power and thus the results should be considered preliminary. The small number and high variance between studies which include different physiological outcomes made thereof harder to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy on the different biological categories investigated. For example, the HPA axis-related neuroendocrine responses (i.e., cortisol), are recognize to play a central role in the stress response, and the few studies who included it precludes important research questions to be answered. To this end, the potential for publication bias, which could lead to uncertainty in the study results, was found to be influenced by the lack of active control studies, which were underrepresented in both self-reported and physiological outcomes. Therefore, more studies should incorporate active control groups to more accurately assess the reliability of the results.\n\nMoreover, the inclusion of follow-up assessments continues to remain a necessity for the synthesis of the long-term effects, especially in the case of physiological outcomes.\n\nDespite these limitations, this study can have important directions for future research and clinical practice. Although with a modest effect for the psychological symptoms, and preliminary findings of efficiency for the physiological reactions, the findings resulted in this study supports the suggestion that smartphone app interventions represent a viable platform for stress management in the larger population. In particular, muscle relaxation and breathing and meditation seem to be requisite strategies for inclusion in any such intervention that aims to effectively reduce stress. CBT based strategies were found to have comparable efficiency for psychological stress. More studies should include CBT-based intervention for stress management in an app format, especially assessing physiological effects. Following shortly in the results obtained by the strategies above, mediation approaches had long been appreciated for their stress reduction efficiency  (Pascoe et al., 2017) , with recent applications in the format of mHealth showing moderate effect size on stress reduction  (G\u00e1l, \u0218tefan, & Cristea, 2021) . The finding that muscle and breathing relaxation had a comparative if not larger effect on both type of stress outcomes, suggests that the muscle and breathing relaxation might represent a central component in the stress reduction efficiency of mediation approaches. Indeed,  Smith (2021)  has proposed a more comprehensive framework, the Relaxation, Meditation, and Mindfulness (RMM) theory to account for an empirically derived common lexicon of numerous varieties of self-relaxation techniques, which seem to prevent any kind of favoritism that a desired effect state is the hallmark of a single technique. Future studies should investigate possible sequences of intervention components in which relaxation and mediation techniques might serve as a prerequisite of attaining the disengagement and physically relaxed response before focusing on more high cognitive processes of regulation and reframing to install enduring changes in the person's general response pattern at stress. Factorial designs, like multiphase optimization (MOST) and sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) represent emerging methodologies which have been argued to provide the adequate framework for how to select and optimize which components and features works best for whom and in what order  (Collins, Nahum-Shani, & Almirall, 2014; Sakata et al., 2022) . Meanwhile, the high heterogeneity and variance in response, coupled with the many features and contents that have been present in the mHealth interventions so far could be capitulated through the new advances in the methods of synthesis, like component network meta-analysis (cNMA; e.g.,  Furukawa et al., 2021) .\n\nOn this note, our analysis revealed that certain app feedback features significantly moderated the polled effect, enhancing efficacy across both self-reported and physiological outcomes. Such key characteristics included asynchronous therapeutic feedback and automated feedback delivered by conversational agents (CAs) (i.e.,  Luangapichart, Saisavoey, & Viravan, 2022; Ulrich, Lienhard, K\u00fcnzli, & Kowatsch, 2024) . These findings align with recent meta-analyses highlighting the efficacy of mental health apps, particularly those incorporating cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) principles with CAs and monitoring technologies  (Linardon et al., 2024) . While traditional rule-based CAs are wellestablished and safe for use in health interventions, large language model (LLM)-based CAs which have recently gained attention await further development to enhance the feedback capabilities of mHealth apps. Future app development should capitalize on these innovations and leverage other unique platform characteristics such as in-build sensors, continuous availability, behavioral prompts, and integration with wearable sensors for physiological assessment (e.g.,  Pleumeekers et al., 2024; Tomoiag\u0203, Gheorghiu, & David, 2024) . Additionally, implementing persuasive design elements and fully exploiting technological advancements are critical for maximizing app efficacy. For example, elements incorporating machine learning algorithms, which can be used to process vast amounts of data from smartphones inputs to detect patterns and predict user health status, can enable more personalized, data-driven healthcare solutions. As suggested by our findings and corroborated by other studies, these directions hold potential for improving intervention outcomes.\n\nIn summary, we found evidence for the efficacy of mHealth apps in stress reduction for non-clinical populations. Both the significant effects recorded among the psychological outcomes and the physiological ones, with important points of convergence and mutual support, give credence in the efficacy of this scalable intervention format for the selfmanagement of stress responses in a broad general population to recommend its utility."
