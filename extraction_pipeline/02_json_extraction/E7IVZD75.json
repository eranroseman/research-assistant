  "abstract": "Utilizing a more representative sample than previous research, this study examines differences in breast cancer survivors' social, psychological, and physical quality of life by participation in breast cancer support groups. This research also explores whether all breast cancer survivors who participate in breast cancer support groups are benefiting equally. The sample includes 958 women of Eastern North Carolina (26% African American, 73% Caucasian) diagnosed with breast cancer who completed interviews concerning their experience with the disease, as well as their social, psychological, and physical well-being. Support group participation was found to have a significant positive affect on social and overall QOL; yet these affects on social QOL were found to be insignificant, and merely marginally significant concerning overall QOL when controlling for sociodemographics, other social support networks, and disease characteristics. Significant differences were found in the characteristics of participants and non-participants of breast cancer support groups and a number of these differences were found to have significant affects on QOL. These findings suggest that future research needs to investigate the relationships between participation in a breast cancer support group and measures of QOL while controlling for potential confounding factors.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Support programs are becoming an increasingly popular strategy to promote various aspects of healing. Although consistently highlighting the social and psychological benefits of support group participation, the extensive literature concerning breast cancer support groups provides conflicting evidence as to the physical benefits. Furthermore, a majority of the previous research has focused entirely on the benefits of participation in professionally-led formal support groups, relied on random assignment of breast cancer patients to support groups, and/or included unrepresentative samples of breast cancer survivors. This causes a particular problem within the field as there are breast cancer support groups outside of the medical setting, led by a variety of different types of facilitators, which may be frequented by different groups of breast cancer survivors than professionally-led groups. Furthermore, the impact of random assignment to support groups may not be the same as for those who voluntarily participate. Thus past studies fail to represent the full range of support groups available to breast cancer survivors, do not reflect the benefits of nonprofessionally-led, community-based or faithbased support groups, and fail to represent the experiences of the full spectrum of survivors who participate in these groups. As a result we do not have an accurate picture of who does participate in support groups nor what benefits they experience, if any, as a result of their participation.\n\nIf breast cancer survivors who participate in support groups are indeed more likely to experience the multidimensional benefits as illustrated in previous research, data on a more representative sample of breast cancer survivors that encompasses the full range of support groups available should present similar results. However, it is possible that not all breast cancer survivors experience these benefits equally due to differences in sociodemographics, other social support networks, and disease characteristics. These differences among breast cancer survivors have not been fully accounted for in previous literature. By using more representative data and examining differences in breast cancer survivors' social, psychological, and physical quality of life by participation in support groups, we can explore if, in fact, all breast cancer survivors are benefiting equally from their participation in breast cancer support groups."

      "title": "Types of Breast Cancer Support Groups",
      "text": "In his review of the literature on breast cancer support groups,  McLean (1995)  distinguishes between what he terms \"professionallyled\" support groups and \"community-based\" support groups. The former groups are often led by health care professionals  (Helgeson et al. 2000)  and generally attempt to combine educational materials about the disease with the participants' sharing of their experiences with breast cancer  (Magen and Glajchen 1999) . Community-based groups are more often facilitated by survivors themselves and are sometimes referred to as self-help groups to distinguish them from more formalized groups run by members of the medical establishment.\n\nUnfortunately, research on community-based, faith-based, or less professionally organized forms of support groups is quite limited. It is not known how many breast cancer survivors participate in these forms of support groups, whether the participants in these support groups differ in any way from the participants in professionally-led support groups offered by members of the medical and therapeutic communities, or whether the benefits women accrue from participation in these groups differ from those of the hospital-based groups to which women have been assigned in research studies. In this particular study survivors interviewed may have participated in breast cancer support groups of any kind. Thus, as opposed to previous studies, this research is able to assess the impact of participation in all types of breast cancer support groups on quality of life."

      "title": "The Beneficial Aspects of Cancer Support Groups",
      "text": "By analyzing the beneficial qualities of support groups reported by a majority of previous research we attain a better understanding of what is offered by these groups that attracts breast cancer patients and may in turn affect their quality of life. I draw from three quality of life domains identified by Ferrell and colleagues: specifically, social, psychological, and physical quality of life  (Ferrell et al. 1997; 1998) . Past studies suggest numerous social, psychological, and physical benefits of cancer support programs, resulting largely from the sharing of experiences and feelings  (Jacobs et al. 1983; Cain et al. 1986; Toro et al. 1987; Samarel et al. 1998; Johnson 2000; Kyngas et al. 2001; Classen et al. 2001) , teaching of positive coping skills  (Spiegal et al. 1989; Bauman et al. 1992; Fawzy et al. 1995; Spiegal et al. 2001; Goodwin et al. 2001; Koopman et al. 2001; Jacobsen et al. 2002) , relationships and bonds formed  (McLean 1995; Magen and Glajchen 1999; ) , and education offered through these groups  (Sullivan et al. 1993; Krizek et al. 1999; Helgeson et al. 1999; Rhoads et al. 2001; Anonymous 2001) .\n\nThere is much evidence to suggest that breast cancer support groups, and what they offer participants, may positively influence the social, psychological and, physical quality of life of breast cancer patients. However it is important to question whether all breast cancer patients who participate in these support programs are benefiting equally, as well as if participants are benefiting more so than non-participants on these quality of life measures."

      "title": "METHODS",
      "text": "The data used in this study represent the experiences of Englishspeaking breast cancer survivors diagnosed in Eastern North Carolina from the late 1980s through the 1990s. All cases of cancer diagnosed in the region are required by law to be reported to the Eastern North Carolina Tumor Registry, maintained by the Leo Jenkins Cancer Center, Greenville, NC. Eastern North Carolina has several characteristics that make it an ideal setting for this type of research. The population is racially diverse and varies by place of residence, income, and education  (Wilson 1997) . The data in this study come from two sources. First, telephone interviews were conducted with breast cancer survivors identified in the Eastern North Carolina Tumor Registry. Second, these individual-level survey data were linked with tumor registry data, including age and stage at diagnosis.\n\nThe goal of the data collection effort was to interview all of the breast cancer survivors who had been diagnosed in the region since the Tumor Registry began maintaining its database. Of the 1528 in the original sample in April 1999, 165 respondents were ineligible because they had died (95), were unable to complete the survey due to illness (33), they could not speak English (2), or reported that they had not had breast cancer (35). This reduced the pool of eligible respondents to 1363. Of the 1363 eligible women in the sample, 24.4% could not be located. However, 70.4% of the eligible women who were located completed the 20-minute interview. Of the women with whom interviewers actually spoke, 93.2% completed the survey. There were a total of 958 completed interviews (26% African American, 73% Caucasian) and 2 partial-completes, which were thrown out. The characteristics of the total sample are summarized in Table  1 ."

      "text": "Quality of Life (QOL) is conceptually ambiguous and operationally complex. Most QOL tools focus primarily on acute treatment side effects and not on long-term survivorship issues. Furthermore most rely on assessments by health care providers, and not the patients themselves. For the purpose of this study I rely on Ferrell et al.'s conceptualization of QOL with breast cancer  (Ferrell et al. 1997; 1998) . Although the authors break QOL down into four domains this study focuses on the first three domains-the social, psychological, and physical QOL. I utilize four measures as indicators of these broad concepts.\n\nPerceived Social Support. Respondents were asked to what extent they agreed with the following statements: \"I have someone I can turn to for support and understanding when things get rough,\" \"I have someone I can really talk to,\" \"I have someone who would help me with things, like give me a ride, watch the kids/house, or fix something,\" \" I have someone who would take care of me if I were sick.\" Responses ranged from (1) Strongly disagree to (4) Strongly agree. An average of the four scores was taken to assess the patient's overall social quality of life. Reliability tests were performed yielding an alpha score of .911.\n\nLife Satisfaction. Respondents were asked \"On a scale of 0 to 5 with 0 being not at all and 5 completely how satisfied would you say you are with your life in general? 1  Self-Assessed Physical Health. Respondents were asked: \"On a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is poor and 5 is excellent, how would you rate your overall physical health?\" 2\n\nPerceived Overall Quality of Life. Respondents were asked \"Thinking about how things are today, how would you rate the overall quality of your life?\" Response categories ranged from 0 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent). Reliability tests were performed regarding all four measures of QOL yielding an alpha score of .638."

      "title": "Independent Variables",
      "text": "Support Group Participation. Respondents were asked if they had ever been involved as a member of a breast cancer support group since their diagnosis. Those respondents who answered \"Currently\" or \"Previously involved but not currently involved\" were coded as having participated in a breast cancer support group (1) and those who had never participated in a support group were coded 0. Missing values were coded as never participated. 3  It is important to note that this question allows for all types and forms of breast cancer support groups that the respondents have participated in to be included in the study. However, this question (and therefore, this particular study) does not draw any distinctions in terms of participants, benefits, or any other aspect between these types of support groups.\n\nPrevious studies regarding breast cancer support groups have highlighted particular variables that have been identified as determinants of participation. These variables include race, age, income, education, employment, number of children, marital status, stage of tumor at diagnosis, and if having the disease had interfered with personal relationships.\n\nSociodemographics. Sociodemographic variables include race, age, income, and education. The variable Black measures race, which is coded 1 for Black women and 0 for Caucasian women. Women of other races (1% of the sample) were deleted from the sample, as were the 7 women who did not report their race. Age is measured in number of years. Missing values were coded to the mean as the distribution of ages was not skewed. Concerning income, respondents were asked what specific monetary bracket best described their total household income was during 1999, including income from all members of the household and from all sources before taxes. These original brackets included, (1) Less than $10,000, (2) Between $10,000 and $20,000, (3) Between $20,000 and $30,000, (4) Between $30,000 and $40,000, (5) Between $40,000 and $50,000, (6) Between $50,000 and $60,000, and (7) Over $60,000. To adjust for unequal brackets values were recoded to reflect the midpoint of each range. Therefore, the categories became $5000, $15,000, $25,000, $35,000, $45,000, $55,000 and, $80,000. In order to replace missing values on this variable, income was regressed on age, black, education, working, and married and then the regression equation was used to estimate the incomes of those individuals with missing values on this variable. Finally, education is measured intervally as the highest grade of school the respondent has completed. Missing values were coded to the median as the distribution was skewed.\n\nOther Social Support Networks. In order to investigate whether a respondent's other social support networks influence support group participation and/or their quality of life, measures for employment, number of children, and marital status were included in the analyses. Employment status contrasts those employed full-or part-time (1) with those not employed (0), and missing values were recoded to the mode-not employed. Whether the respondent was a parent or not was converted into a dummy variable; had children (1) or not (0). The missing values for this measure were recoded to the mode-having children. Marital status contrasts those married or having a significant other (1) with those who are divorced, widowed, or never married (0). Missing values were coded to the mode-married.\n\nDisease Characteristics such as stage of tumor at diagnosis were reported by the physician to the Tumor Registry and regarded as a proxy for the severity of the patient's disease. The Tumor Registry identified eight categories of patients' tumor stage which were coded 0, 1, 2 or 2A, 2B, 3 or 3A, or 4. I focused specifically on the Path Stage One report of each patient that identified the stage of the patient's first recognized breast tumor at initial diagnosis. Missing values were recoded to the median. Respondents were asked to what extent their continuing health care had interfered with their personal relationships. The answer for this question was given in a scale from 0 to 5, 0 being \"not at all\" and 5 being \"completely.\" Missing values on this variable were recoded to the median."

      "text": "Concerning the total sample of breast cancer survivors, a majority of the women were White (73%), whereas 26% were Black and 1% were members of other races. The average respondent was 63 years old, and the average reported income was roughly $30,400. Thirty-five percent of the survivors reported that they were employed either full-or parttime, whereas the average level of education attained was 13 years. Where 90% of respondents reported having children, only 70% reported being married or having a significant other. The average woman was diagnosed with a Stage 1 or Stage 2 tumor, and the average response to how severely the disease had interfered with the patients' personal relationship was 3.7.\n\nAmong the total sample, the majority of breast cancer survivors in this study were not currently or had not ever participated in any type of breast cancer support group (82%). However, those women that did participate or were currently participating reported significantly higher levels of social and overall quality of life  (3.349 vs. 3.194, p < .01, and 4.310 vs. 4.120, p < .05, respectively)  than those who did not participate in a support group. Table 2 further highlights the significantly positive relationship between support group participation and social quality of life (r = 0.095, p < .01), as well as participation and overall quality of life (r = .071, p < .05).\n\nMany other factors were correlated with quality of life. Black breast cancer survivors reported lower levels of social (r = \u03ea0.163, p < .001), psychological (r = \u03ea0.107, p < .01), and overall quality of life (r = \u03ea0.076, p < .05). Although younger women reported higher levels of social (r = \u03ea0.174, p < .001) and physical quality of life (r = \u03ea0.139, p < .001), older women reported higher psychological quality of life (r = 0.076, p < .05). Breast cancer survivors of higher income reported higher levels of quality of life on all four measures, as well as those women who were employed either full-or part-time, women who were married or had a significant other, and women who reported that their disease had interfered less with their personal lives. The higher the level of education attained by the respondents the more likely they were to report higher levels of social (r = 0.190, p < .001), physical (r = 0.146, p < .001), and overall quality of life (r = 0.117, p < .001). Breast cancer survivors with children were more likely to report higher degrees of overall quality of life (r = 0.078, p < .05), and women with earlier stage tumors at diagnosis were more likely to report higher psychological quality of life (r = \u03ea0.068, p < 05). Surprisingly however, stage of tumor at diagnosis did not have a significant negative correlation with physical quality of life.\n\nNoticeably, a number of the variables that presented differences among participants and non-participants in Table  1  appear to be significant determinants of support group participation and significantly related to the quality of life measures (Table  2 ). Women participating in a breast cancer support group were significantly younger than non participants (58 vs. 64, p < .001), reported higher levels of income ($35,800 vs. $28,700, p < .01), attained higher levels of education (14 yrs vs. 12 yrs, p < .001), were more often employed full or part time (46% vs. 32%, p < .01), and were more often married (77% vs. 69%, p < .05). These variables may be creating spurious relationships between breast cancer support group participation and the measures of quality of life.\n\nTo further explore the variables' associations with the measures of quality of life, Tables 3a through 3d show the OLS regression of each measure of quality of life on four different clusters of variables (each brought in separately): support group participation, sociodemographics, other social support networks, and disease characteristics. Support group participants reported a higher social quality of life score (b = 0.155, p < .01) on average than non-participants. However, when controlling for sociodemographic variables the affect is no longer signifi- TABLE 3a.

All two-tailed tests. Standard errors in parentheses.\n\ncant. On the other hand, controlling for other social support networks does not explain the significant affect of support group participation on social quality of life (b = 0.107, p < .05) and the affect is increased slightly when specifically controlling for disease characteristics (b = 0.165, p < .01). When stepping in the full model however, yet again the significance is lost. Similar to the findings in Table  2 , support group participation did not have a significant affect on psychological or physical quality of life even after controlling for potential confounding affects.\n\nSupport group participation was found to have a positive affect on overall quality of life (b = 0.071, p < .05) in model 1 (Table  3d ); however, net of sociodemographics, as well as other social support networks, the significance is lost. Yet, as with social quality of life, controlling for disease characteristics increases the significant affect of support group participation on overall quality of life (b = 0.084, p < .01). This affect is even found to be marginally significant when overall quality of life is regressed on the full model (b = 0.148, p < .10).\n\nIn order to investigate whether support group participation benefits all women equally interaction effects were tested. Support group participation was paired with each independent variable individually (to create new variables) and run within the full regression model predicting each measure of quality of life. Each new variable was entered with the full regression model separately to avoid problems with multicollinearity. Those participants of breast cancer support groups who reported that their disease had led to increased interference with their personal relationships experienced significantly lower benefits to their physical quality of life than those who did not experience interference with their personal relationships (b = \u03ea0.229, p < .01). Although only slightly significant, it was shown that participants who are also parents experienced fewer benefits to their physical quality of life than non-parents (b = \u03ea0.541, p < .10), and that participants who were working either full-or part-time experienced fewer benefits to their physical quality of life than those who were not working at all (b = \u03ea0.355, p < .10). However, it was also shown that participants of higher income experienced greater benefits to their overall quality of life than those with less income (b = 0.000, p < .10).\n\nOther findings deserve mention. Being African American was found to have a significantly negative affect on social quality of life (b = \u03ea0.118, p < .01). Income was found to have a significantly positive affect on social (b = 0.000, p < .001), and overall quality of life (b = 0.000, p < .001); however, concerning psychological and physical quality of life, the affect of income is explained when controlling for other social support networks, and disease characteristics. Respondents who were employed either full-or part-time reported higher levels of quality of life on all measures, even when controlling for all other variables in the regression model. The same can be said for those respondents who were married or had a significant other. Although it did not have an affect on physical quality of life, the stage of tumor at diagnosis was found to have a significant negative relationship on psychological quality of life (b = \u03ea0.057, p < .05), as well as a marginally significant affect on overall quality of life (b = \u03ea0.052, p < .10). However, both of these affects are explained when controlling for sociodemographics and other social support networks. The extent to which the disease had interfered with personal relationships was found to have a significantly negative affect on all quality of life measures even when controlling for all other variables in the regression model."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Given the heavily documented social benefits of breast cancer support groups, it is not surprising to find that those women who had participated in a breast cancer support group reported significantly higher levels of social and overall quality of life. However, looking at other significant differences between participants and non-participants, one might question whether this reported QOL is due to the support group participation or perhaps other characteristics of the support group participants. Participants were found to be significantly younger, wealthier, reported higher levels of education, were more often employed, and were more often married than non-participants which is consistent with previous literature  (Glassen et al. 2001; Helgeson et al. 2000; Samarel 1998 ). Notably, these variables explained the affect of support group participation on social QOL and much of the affect of support group participation on overall QOL in the multivariate analyses. This leads one to believe that these characteristics of the participants may be creating a spurious relationship between participation and QOL in previous research.\n\nOddly, stage of tumor at diagnosis was not found to have a significant negative affect on physical QOL. Although presenting an initially significant negative affect on psychological QOL, and a slightly significant negative affect on overall QOL, both affects are explained when other measures are controlled. Perhaps due to increasingly efficient and available technology and treatments regarding breast cancer the stage of the tumor at the initial diagnosis does not have such a dramatic effect physically on the patient, but rather mentally and emotionally. Therefore, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals need to acknowledge the sudden and damaging psychological effects of the initial diagnosis of breast cancer  (Caudell 1996; Cain et al. 1986; Taylor et al. 1986; Jacobs et al. 1983) .\n\nExpectedly, participants of breast cancer support groups who reported that their disease had led to increased inference with personal relationships were found to have significantly lower levels of physical QOL than participants who did not experience interference with their personal relationships. Previous literature has consistently noted that individuals reporting lower levels of social support tend to be less healthy not only psychologically, but physically as well  (Hawkley & Cacioppo 2003; House, Landis, & Umberson 1988) . However, this result can also be interpreted another way; participants of breast cancer support groups who reported lower levels of physical QOL may find that disease leads to increased interference with their personal relationships. This could be due to certain treatment options such as a mastectomy; even side effects from particular treatments can lead to changes in a patient's appearance and physical image. Such changes could lead friends, family, even co-workers to separate themselves from the patient, thereby leading the patient to report higher levels of interference. Rokach (2000)  summarizes the work of a number of authors who suggest that particular reactions to cancer treatments, as well as others' concern of attaining the disease from the patient, can lead to the distancing of family members and friends from the patient  (Cohen 1985; Wortman & Dunkel-Schetter 1979) . Also, the specific treatments themselves can physically isolate the patient from social support networks for a certain amount of time leading a patient to potentially report interference with personal relationships. As the data here are cross-sectional in nature, the causal order question can not be resolved. Researchers need to examine the potential benefits of offering cancer patients in-depth educational resources, family counseling, as well as counseling regarding particular treatment options so that the patient fully understands the possible advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments and how such treatments can not only affect the patient individually, but those around them as well.\n\nThis study also reinforces the necessity for research concerning the benefits of varying types of breast cancer support groups, as it is essential for breast cancer survivors to understand the potential benefits and/or downfalls of existing psychosocial treatment options. As noted earlier in this study, there is a vast array of support groups available for breast cancer survivors. However, research on how these types of groups are similar or different is quite limited. Although the survey used in this study does not ask what specific type of breast cancer support group the patient is or was involved in, the generality of the question concerning support group participation does allow for the vast array of support groups to be included.\n\nThere are potential concerns that should be addressed regarding this study. Foremost, it should be made clear that although a number of findings within this study were statistically significant, they do not suggest clinical significance  (Kendall & Sheldrick 2000) , and therefore do not provide clinical evidence of outcomes of treatments. Also, it is important to take into account how integrated in a support group a participant is regarding their attendance regularity and the importance of the group to them. Such matters could very well influence the affect of participation on QOL measures.\n\nIt is important for future research to take into consideration the differences among breast cancer support group participants when investigating participation and QOL measures, paying special attention to using a more representative sample of breast cancer survivors, as well as examining a more representative sample of breast cancer support groups. Methodological flaws in previous research make it exceptionally difficult to fully comprehend the actual benefits of support group participation on quality of life as it relates to all types of breast cancer survivors, as well as the general affect of the disease itself on diverse samples of breast cancer survivors. Michalec et al. (2004) , using a more representative sample of breast cancer survivors than a majority previous research on breast cancer support groups, noted that patterns of participation are quite different when representative samples of survivors are studied, rather than samples of support groups."

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": "This study highlights differences between participants and non-participants of breast cancer support groups, explores predictors of support group participation, and attempts to shed light on how differences among participants may affect levels of QOL. Although support group participation was found to have a significant positive affect on social and overall QOL these affects were found to be insignificant when controlling for sociodemographics, other support networks, and disease characteristics. Differences among participants were found to have varying affects on levels of QOL. In order to fully understand the beneficial aspects of support groups, differences between professionally led and non-professionally-led support groups must be explored more thoroughly. It is necessary for healthcare professionals to recognize the importance of psychosocial treatment and counseling immediately following diagnosis, throughout physical treatment, and even during remission for all breast cancer survivors not merely those that are frequently represented in previous research. Finally, further research is needed to investigate why more patients are not participating in breast cancer support groups.\n\nNOTES 1. Although one may doubt the legitimacy of using a question concerning life satisfaction as an accurate measure of patients' psychological QOL, other potential measures (measures of depression, and measures of locus of control) were attempted in previous drafts of this study and shown not to provide the desired outcome to the extent of life satisfaction. Other potential psychological QOL measures were not correlated with support group participation, nor were they correlated with other measures of QOL.\n\n2. It has been shown in previous research that perceived health is a valid and reliable measure of physical health  (Maddox and Douglas 1973; Davies and Ware 1981; Mossey and Shapiro 1982; Idler and Kasl 1991) .\n\n3. Sensitivity analyses were conducted which indicated that recoding the missing values on participation in this way did not affect the results"
