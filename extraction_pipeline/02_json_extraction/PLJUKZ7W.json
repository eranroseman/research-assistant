      "text": "Around one in six citizens in the world will be over 65 years old within the next 30 years, rising from a proportion of 9% in 2019 to a projected 16% of all people in 2050 [1]. In Denmark, population forecasts has estimated the percentage of persons over 65 years to increase from 20% in 2019 to 22.6% in 2030, which is higher than the expected average for Northern Europe [1]. In the latest population projection, Statistics Denmark also estimate that the proportion of citizens aged 80 or over will double from 5% in 2021 to 10% in 2060  [2] .\n\nOlder adults have relatively frequent contact with emergency departments, which often converts into hospitalizations  [3, 4] . 12% of Danish citizens over 65 years has at least one hospitalization per year  [5] . Moreover, there is a correlation between hospital contact and home care use for the elderly. A US analysis showed that 30% of home healthcare patients are hospitalized or visit an emergency department  [6] . In Denmark, 50% of those over 65 years who were hospitalized also received home care or lived in a nursing home (for patients hospitalized aged 80 or above the proportion was 80%)  [5]  resulting in expenses that are four times higher for this group than for the elderly in general  [5] .\n\nIf possible, hospitalizations should be avoided for dependent and frail elderly, since they can exacerbate challenges with mobility and daily activities  [7]  and lead to adverse events during hospitalizations, e. g. acquired infections  [8] , or in transitioning from the hospital to homes  [9] . An overview of systematic reviews has highlighted common characteristics of effective interventions to prevent hospitalizations for frail older individuals  [10] . Results show that the most effective interventions are those that integrate community care (e.g. at-home preventive geriatric screening) with hospital care  [10] .\n\nTo facilitate an integrated approach, and to help municipalities responsible for community care in Denmark, the Danish Health Authority have previously published guidelines to assist community health personnel in assessing the everyday health of the elderly receiving home care and to act upon any abnormalities detected in order to avoid preventable hospitalizations  [11] . Based on these recommendations, Aalborg Municipality implemented a digital version of a triaged changing table suggested in the guidelines  [11] . The tool consisted of a checklist used to detect changes in the citizen's habitual state by answering questions within five subgroups of health status: Mental and social state, behavior in the home, activities of daily living, consumption of food and beverages as well as physical complaints. The current state was given a color code (green, yellow or red) depending on the number of changes registered from the citizen's normal habitus within the five subgroups.\n\nA high risk of hospitalizations and a complex pattern of risk factors of the elderly adults was also found in the overview of systematic reviews  [10] . This makes machine learning (ML) a suitable way to help primary care and community health care personnel with decisions surrounding potential hospitalizations, because ML was developed specifically for prediction purposes with an intention to identify hidden patterns and interactions among various predictor variables  [12] [13] [14] . However, not much is known about which variables to include in prediction models aimed at forecasting hospitalizations for the elderly in a community care context and expected predictive performance. A systematic review from 2014 concluded that, in general, models based on administrative and/or routine clinical data from community-dwelling adults performs well  [15]  and that the best performing models included historical activity and concrete codes for diagnoses and medicine  [15] . However, a recent study has found good performance for prediction models based only on triage of functional assessments, care needs and geriatric syndromes from the elderly  [16] .\n\nThe objective of this study was therefore to investigate whether it was possible to predict acute hospitalizations in elderly recipients of home care services based on a newly developed triage tool in Aalborg Municipality in combination with administrative and clinical data routinely collected in the Danish healthcare and social care sector."

      "text": "A development study based on a retrospective cohort was designed  [17] . Eligible participants were initially extracted from the electronic home care record (EHCR) in Aalborg Municipality and included subjects aged 65 or older, who had received home care services at least once a week from 1/1-2016 to 31/12-2017. Terminal subjects and subjects with severe mental disorders were excluded from the study.\n\nThe data material included 1,282 subjects. By applying a civil registration number that all Danish citizens receive at birth (a so-called CPR number)  [18] , precise linkage between registers across sectors can be made and in this case using data from three sources:\n\n(1) The electronic home care record (EHCR) from Aalborg Municipality, which holds both citizen-level socio-demographic data as well as activity-based information primarily used for costing or compensation purposes. Municipality personnel routinely record the type, timing and duration for almost all social care activities such as personal care, practical help, home nursing care and rehabilitation activities for each contact. (2) The triaged changing table database (TCT) from Aalborg Municipality  [11] , where all registrations and triage state changes are were stored. In Aalborg Municipality, the community personnel routinely utilize the triage tool for assessing the individual citizen's current health state.\n\n(3) The Danish National Patient Register (DNPR), which contains patient-level data of all inpatient, outpatient and emergency contacts to all hospitals in Denmark, and the register forms the basis for hospital statistics in Denmark  [19] .\n\nThe principles of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) checklist for assessment of medical AI were adhered to  [20] ."

The outcome of interest was whether acute hospitalizations has taken place, which in the DNPR is defined by two variables (a hospitalization date and an indicator of acute or planned hospitalization). Therefore, the problem was a binary classification problem  [12] [13] [14] . A sliding window approach was implemented  [21] , which is illustrated in Fig.  1 .\n\nPeriods in which there is a hospitalization (an event, marked by a red line) was called event periods and periods with no hospitalizations was called control periods. There was a fixed lead time of 3 days for each period to make it possible for community health care personnel to act and potentially avoid the predicted hospitalizations from the algorithm. Features from a fixed period of two weeks prior to the lead time period was used to predict acute hospitalizations. 90,375 periods were extracted with 345 of those resulting in an acute hospitalization.\n\nBefore pre-processing and model development, the data material was randomly divided at patient-level such that 70% was used for training and validating the models and 30% was reserved for testing the model. Hence, the 30% reserved for testing was not used in the development of the models. This procedure ensured that the results were not prone to overfit allowing for better transferability to a similar cohort  [22] . This approach is illustrated in Fig.  2 ."

This study utilized a complete-case-approach such that only periods with available data were included for analysis."

Extracted features were calculated from the history of hospitalizations, socio-demographics, municipal information, usage of past and current home care services, and absolute and relative changes from the triaged changing table. The features were extracted from the observation in the periods for each variable by calculating mean, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, number of observations, slope of linear regression, and most frequent values. Furthermore, the difference between the first 7 days and last 7 days of the period were calculated to account for relative changes, which could indicate change in health status. Current home care service features also included the relative between visitation time and service time delivered. This large number of features were extracted because we did not know which information from the data sources would have relevant information about potential exacerbations which leads to hospitalization.\n\nThe initial 857 extracted features were before model training reduced to a subset of 40 features. This procedure was conducted using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC AUC) from each feature to rank their ability to discriminate between control and event periods. The reduction procedure was utilized to reduce computation time. Moreover, many of the potential features were assumed to hold redundant information. We included a feature set from the subset using forward selection and 5-fold cross-validation to reduce overfitting of the model."

      "title": "Choice of machine learning algorithm",
      "text": "We chose to compare a simple linear model (logistic regression) and a more complex nonlinear model (RUSBoost). Logistic regression was used due to the simplicity of the model with linear combination of features, which gives an easy interpretable model.\n\nBecause of the imbalance in the training data between periods without hospitalization and periods with hospitalization RUSBoost ensemble method was also used to model data  [23] . RUSBoost have been reported to be a fast and robust classifier for dataset with imbalanced data  [24] . RUSBoost has been reported to be computationally less extensive with slightly better performance than more complex methods for dealing with class imbalance  [25] . This combination of simplicity, speed and performance makes RUSBoost an interesting technique for learning from imbalanced data  [25] . We also compared training the models with and without oversampling the training dataset 1:1 between the two classes. The training dataset was balanced using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE, k = 5) with five nearest neighbors  [26] .\n\nHyper-parameters for the RUSBoost model (i.e. learning cycles [range, 10:10:1000], learn rate [range, 0:0.1:10]) were determined using 5-fold cross-validation to minimize overfitting. The final model was then tested on the test dataset. Our study did not recalibrate the model post the training procedure, which is considered best practices to get an unbiased estimate of performance. To investigate the effect of the search space of hyper-parameters on generalization, a 'restricted' model was trained with a smaller search space (i.e. learning cycles [range, 10:1:100] and learn rate [range, 0:0.01:1])."

E.g. if a sensitivity of 74% is required (i.e. accurately finding roughly \u00be of all actual hospitalizations) that would correspond to a positive predictive value of 47% (i.e. the algorithm is then able to correctly predict hospitalizations in roughly half of all predictions that flag a risk of a coming hospitalization). If lower sensitivity thresholds for sensitivity are acceptable (e.g. 59%) then a higher positive prediction value can be achieved (87%).\n\nTable  3  show prediction metrics for several threshold values.

      "text": "The result in this study demonstrates that the triage tool, in combination with administrative and clinical data routinely collected in the Danish healthcare and social care sector, have a potential for being utilized to predict elderly people at high risk of impending hospitalization. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the potential of using these types of data for prediction of acute hospitalizations.\n\nThe performance of the logistic regression was low, especially the PR-AUC of 0.01 makes it unusable in practice. Furthermore, the implementation of SMOTE oversampling in the training of the model did not improve performance on the test dataset. An explanation of the low performance for the logistic regression model could be due to the linear capability of the model, which does not capture non-linear association in the data.\n\nHowever, the performance of the RUSBoost model was acceptable with a PR-AUC of 0.71 (ROC-AUC was 0.99). The most important predictor of acute hospitalizations was the number of personal care registrations the last 14 days, followed by the number of medication handling registrations and number of nutrition services registered.\n\nFour of the five most important features used to accurately predict an acute hospitalization came from routine municipality registrations in the feature period (i.e., the total number of services provided by municipalities as well as personal care, medication handling and nutritional registrations). The final important predictor stemmed from the developed triage tool (i.e., the number of physical complaints).\n\nUsing a 'restricted' search space for the training of the RUSBoost model did not improve the performance of the model. However, the gap (in PR-AUC) between the training and test dataset was narrowed."

The included patient socio-demographics (age, gender, marital status), the patients' historical activity in hospitals, outpatient clinics, comorbidities and clinical diagnoses from previous hospitalizations does not seem to be important in predicting future acute hospitalizations. What matters most are routine administrative and clinical registrations in municipalities that are well suited to predict future hospitalizations for the elderly with one item from the triage tool implemented in Aalborg Municipality was also highly relevant. We can only speculate as to why this is the case. Routine registrations might be more rigorously registered if they are used for compensation or costing purposes. The triage tool is also a first version seeking to translate potential predictors into everyday measurements and it might therefore need further revision if it should be used as a prediction tool for acute hospitalizations."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "This study is to our knowledge the first to apply administrative and clinical registrations routinely documented by Danish regions and municipalities and to combine them with a community-based triage tool to predict acute hospitalizations. The data was derived from a heterogenic sample of citizens above age 65, who received home care services. However, several limitations are present. Firstly, the prediction relied heavily on assumptions about the causal relation between municipality registrations, triage and the hospitalization, and this relationship might not be fully understood (e.g. hospitalizations might also influence home care and future triage registrations). Secondly, despite including a sufficiently sized sample for prediction purposes, the number of outcome events (345 hospitalizations) were rather limited and the results could be subject to bias  [28] . This is also seen from the test sample results, where the PR-AUC is significant lower that the PR-AUC from the training data. While we cannot exclude overfitting, even though crossvalidation was applied, the difference in results might also be because of a large heterogeneity among participants. This mean that the expected performance on new data is not yet solid, even though the results clearly point toward that the data holds valuable information in relation  TPR TNR PPV NPV TP TN FP FN 0.74 0.99 0.47 0.99 76 26,924 85 27 0.66 0.99 0.73 0.99 68 26,985 24 35 0.59 0.99 0.87 0.99 61 27,000 9 42 to disease exacerbation. Thirdly, the impact of the prediction model is not validated. From a technological readiness perspective, this would require a proof of principle setup  [29]  with e.g. a large randomized controlled trial, which could investigate if the proposed predictions could lead to earlier treatment, reduced hospitalizations or length of stay. Fourthly, multiple sources of undesirable biases can arise in the development of ML algorithms, that can lead to unintended discrimination of gender and minority groups. Investigation of model fairness was not performed. However, models were trained and tested on a dataset that is fairly representative of the gender distribution of the elderly receiving home health care. Also, gender was not included in the final model due to lack of explanatory power. Assessing ethnicity bias based on register data was impossible, since this information, should it exist, is highly restricted in Denmark. So, representation bias is expected to be low across gender and unknown for ethnic minorities. Finally, access to home health care is universal and free of charge in Denmark leading to a low risk of algorithmic bias."

Topaz and colleagues  [6]  achieved a similar performance in predicting a combined outcome of emergency department visits or hospitalizations in the US with a random forest algorithm (PR-AUC 0.76). The study relied on text mining of clinical notes and a much younger population (mean age of the elderly were 70.8 compared to 82.9 in this study). In our study did not rely on text mining of patient journals (or claims data), but rather on structured registrations used nationally by Danish regions and common language standards applied for elderly in municipalities  [30, 31] , which should allow for greater generalizability at least in a Danish context. Veyron and colleagues  [32]  found a lower performance seeking to predict emergency department visits (ROC-AUC 0.7 with a random forest) using a home care screening application with four domains. The population was slightly older than in our study (mean age 88 vs 82.9). Finally, using a gradient boosting algorithm, Jones and colleagues  [33]  sought to predict emergency department utilization using a standardized clinical assessment instrument (the Resident Assessment Instrument: Home Care (RAI-HC)) applied routinely in Ontario for recipients of home and community care in Ontario, Canada. With a similar population age (mean age around 82 years), the algorithm achieved a lower performance (ROC-AUC 0.689)."

      "text": "There exist plenty of alternative machine learning algorithms for binary classification, including but not limited to na\u00efve bayes algorithms, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, and other ensemble methods than the RUSBoost applied in this study. Although the RUSBoost was chosen based on experiences with performance and computational requirements for imbalanced problems, we acknowledge that other methods could potentially lead to better performance, especially if a larger dataset with more events was available for investigation. Recently, there have been developments in algorithms specifically targeted the clustered nature of repeated measures in longitudinal data  [34] . Future research could compare the performance of more methods and tuning strategies simultaneously. Machine learning algorithms could also be used to predict other relevant outcomes, such as repeated hospitalizations, length of stay or adverse events associated with hospitalization. Moreover, future research should have focus on maturing the algorithm and validating the results in other cohorts for geriatric assessment in a home health care setting. It is not yet clear if these results could be transferred to another country due to structural differences between registration methods. It could be interesting to explore deeper if especially routine administrative registration is a valuable unexplored data resource for predicting outcome for patients."
