  "title": "The Impact of Digital Adherence Technologies on Health Outcomes in Tuberculosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Suboptimal tuberculosis (TB) treatment adherence may lead to unsuccessful treatment and relapse. Digital adherence technologies (DATs) may allow more person-centric approaches for supporting treatment. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD42022313166) to evaluate the impact of DATs on health outcomes in TB. \n Methods : We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science and preprints from medRxiv, Europe PMC, and clinicaltrials.gov for relevant literature from January 2000 to April 2023. We considered experimental or cohort studies reporting quantitative comparisons of clinical outcomes between a DAT and the standard of care in each setting. Results: Seventy studies (total 58,950 participants) met inclusion criteria. They reported SMSbased interventions (k=18 studies), feature phone-based interventions (k=7), medication sleeves with phone calls (branded as \"99DOTS,\" k=5), video-observed therapy (VOT; k=17), smartphone-based interventions (k=5), digital pillboxes (k=18), ingestible sensors (k=1), and interventions combining 2 DATs (k=1). Overall, the use of DATs was associated with more frequent treatment success in TB disease (OR = 1.18 [1.06, 1.33]; I 2 = 66%, k = 46), a decrease in loss to follow up (OR = 0.71 [0.53, 0.94]; I 2 = 80%, k = 36) and an increase in adverse event reporting (OR = 1.53 [1.26, 1.86]; I 2 = 0%, k = 9). VOT was associated with an increased likelihood of treatment success in TB disease (OR 1.54 [1.09; 2.19]; I 2 = 0%, k = 8) and treatment completion in TB infection (OR 4.69 [2.08; 10.55]; I 2 = 0%, k = 2) as well as an increased frequency of adverse event reporting (OR = 1.79 [1.27; 2.52]; I 2 = 34%, k = 4). Other interventions involving smartphone technologies were associated with increased treatment success in TB disease (OR 1.98 [1.07; 3.65]; I 2 =56%, k = 5) and a decreased frequency of loss to follow up (OR = 0.31 [0.13; 0.77]; I 2 = 36%, k = 5). Digital pillboxes were also associated with an improvement in treatment success (OR = 1.32 [1.00; 1.73]; I 2 = 71%, k = 11). However, improved treatment success was only seen in high-and upper middle-income countries. SMSbased interventions, feature-phone interventions and 99DOTS were not associated with improvements in short-term clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Certain DATs--notably VOT and smartphone-based interventions, in higher income settings and sometimes combined with other supportive measures-may be associated with improvements in treatment success and losses to follow-up, compared to standard care. However, evidence remains highly variable, and generalizability limited. Higher quality data are needed.",

      "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is currently the second leading infectious cause of death, eclipsed only by the COVID-19 pandemic. About one-quarter of the world's population is estimated to have been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. [1]  In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people developed TB disease worldwide, of whom 1.3 million died. [2]  Suboptimal adherence to treatment for TB disease may lead to treatment failure, increased risk of death or relapse. To improve adherence, the World Health Organization in 1994 endorsed directly observed therapy (DOT) where health workers, community volunteers or family members observe and record patients taking each dose.[3] Digital adherence technologies (DATs) may facilitate more patient-centric, community rather than facility-based, and less intrusive approaches for monitoring TB medication adherence than existing DOT models. [4]  Depending on the setting and care model, some studies have suggested that DAT-based treatment may be more effective than standard care in achieving favorable treatment outcomes. [5]  However, findings regarding health outcomes have been inconsistent and may vary by country income level and technology type. [6] [7] [8]  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of DATs on health outcomes in persons treated for TB disease and TB infection."

The search was conducted by a health sciences librarian (GG) to ensure that the most suitable search terms were used. Key elements included terms that denoted tuberculosis (disease or infection); digital technologies and tools (including mobile phone, smartphone, video observation, medication monitors, text messaging, etc.) and health outcomes (microbiologic conversion, treatment success, microbiologic cure, treatment failure, death, loss to follow-up, relapse/ recurrence, subsequent TB disease after treatment for latent TB infection, medication adherence, and patient-reported outcomes). More detailed information about the search strategy and results is provided in S1 Table . We also hand-searched conference abstracts from the Union World Conference on Lung Health from 2004 to 2022 and cross-checked reference lists and citations of included studies as a supplementary approach to identify further data sources.\n\nWe followed a PICOS format (participants, interventions, comparator, outcomes, and study design) to formulate the clinical question used for including studies in the systematic review.\n\n. Study design. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and cohort studies.\n\nPopulation.

This included reminding patients to take their medications, facilitating digital observation of pill-taking, compiling patient dosing histories and identifying adherence patterns, which facilitate patient-centric approaches for monitoring TB medication adherence.\n\nWe included all such interventions whether they engaged persons treated for TB, providers, or both. We excluded studies where the technology was an electronic health record used only to log visit attendance or if the intervention consisted only of non-automated \"routine telephone calls\" to patients. A detailed definition for eligible DAT interventions was developed before study selection and is provided in S2 Table . Comparator. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to report a comparator arm involving standard care in the same settings. This included various forms of directly observed therapy Outcomes. We considered short-and long-term clinical outcomes, medication adherence, and patient-reported outcomes. Short-term clinical outcomes were treated as binary (yes/no) and included: treatment success, treatment completion, cure, loss to follow up, treatment failure, death during treatment, adverse events, emergence of anti-tuberculous drug resistance, microbiological conversion of sputum smear, completion of intensive phase treatment and composite outcomes of favorable or unfavorable outcomes. Short-term clinical outcomes are defined in S3 Table . Long-term clinical outcomes were also treated as binary, and included recurrence or relapse (TB disease), defined as a repeat diagnosis of TB disease within 2 years of successful treatment; post-treatment death, defined as death within 2 years of successful treatment for TB disease; and subsequent risk of TB disease, defined as development of TB disease within 5 years of treatment for TB infection.\n\n. Adherence was considered as a binary, ordinal, or continuous outcome depending on the measures used in specific studies: These included indirect measures of medication adherence such as pharmacy refill visits; or more direct measures of medication ingestion as indicated by persons with TB themselves, DAT and DOT records, or biologic testing (e.g. drug metabolites in urine). Patient-reported outcomes were based on suitably validated instruments, administered to persons using or not using DATs, at comparable time points during/after treatment. They included: health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional status, perceived stigma and satisfaction.\n\nTo be included, studies had to report quantitative comparisons of clinical outcomes between a DAT and standard care with at least 20 participants using the DAT. Clinical outcomes could include treatment outcomes, other health outcomes and/or patient reported outcomes. We included data from full-text publications, preprints, or abstracts without any language restriction. We excluded review articles and studies that reported purely qualitative information.\n\nAfter deduplication of items initially retrieved from our search, all remaining items were imported into Rayyan software (Rayyan, Cambridge USA). Selection of studies involved two levels of screening conducted in parallel by two independent reviewers (among MM, MZ, CK, CC, SB, NF). In the first-level screen, all titles and abstracts were screened: all studies addressing TB and DATs were included. A third reviewer (KS, KF, or RS) resolved conflicts.\n\nIn the second-level screen, two independent reviewers (MM, MZ, CK, SB and NF) screened the full text of studies retained from the title and abstract review. Articles were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria. In the event of discordant judgment regarding suitability, a third reviewer (KS) resolved conflicts. Excluded full-texts were stored and the reasons for their exclusion were documented."

Results for short-term clinical outcomes were pooled and summarized quantitatively.\n\nWhen treatment success (which includes both successful completion and microbiologic cure) and treatment completion were reported in the same study, we focused on treatment success for purposes of meta-analysis. When only treatment completion was reported in a study, we used those data when pooling the results for treatment success.\n\nResults were pooled using an inverse-variance weighted random effects model to estimate overall odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. For short-term clinical outcomes, the odds ratio in individual studies was calculated from the number of events in the intervention and control groups. When the direct estimate required for the analysis -an odds ratio with its 95% confidence intervals-was provided by the authors, it was used when pooling the data. Risk ratios in individual studies were used when odds ratios were not reported. The reciprocal of odds ratio for unfavorable outcomes was used to calculate the odds ratio for treatment success in studies that addressed unfavorable outcomes only, and did not report treatment success. For cluster-randomized trials and stepped-wedge trials we used the direct estimate from analyses that properly accounted for the cluster design. When an effect measure was not reported, available crude data were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.\n\nBetween-study variance was estimated by the DerSimonian-Laird method  [10] . The metaanalysis was conduced using R version 4.2.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, using the metafor  [11]  and meta  [12]  packages. When substantial heterogeneity was present (I 2 > 50%) we conducted subgroup analyses to explore potential sources.\n\nPre-specified subgroup analyses considered the specific DAT interventions as well as income levels in the countries where studies were conducted. Country income level was classified as high, upper-middle, lower-middle or low according to the classification of the World Bank. [13]  When the number of pooled studies exceeded 10, publication bias was assessed qualitatively by visual inspection of funnel plot symmetry and quantitatively using Egger's linear regression. [14]  A sensitivity analysis was completed with and without data extracted from conference abstracts to confirm the robustness of the results.\n\nTreatment adherence was summarized in tabular form and described narratively. Odds ratios for adherence results with sufficiently homogeneous assessment measures were presented in forest plots without pooling. When adherence was reported in binary terms, odds ratios or risk ratios provided by the authors were used, or the odds ratio was estimated from the number of events in the intervention and comparison groups. For continuous adherence measurements, the standardized mean difference was calculated and transformed to the log odds using the Hasselblad and Hedges method. [15]  As reports were much sparser, results for long-term clinical outcomes, and patient reported outcomes were summarized in tabular form and/ or described narratively following PRISMA guidelines for best practices."

The use of digital technologies was associated with an increase in the number of persons reporting adverse events (OR = 1.53 [1.26; 1.86]; I 2 = 0%, k = 8, [moderate certainty . evidence]). Subgroup analysis showed that VOT (OR = 1.79 [1.27; 2.52]; I 2 = 0%, k = 4, [moderate certainty evidence]) was associated with an increased frequency of adverse event reporting. The combination of SMS and MERM (OR = 1.91 [1.27; 2.88]; I 2 = N/A, k = 1) also significantly increased the number of adverse events reported. (S16 Table, S8 Fig). While in most studies the number of adverse events corresponded to the number of persons who reported any adverse event  [19] [20] [21] [22] , in one study it referred specifically to persons for whom adverse events led to longer TB treatment duration  [23] , and in another study it referred to persons for whom adverse events led to treatment interruption.

Two studies reported on emergence of anti-TB antibiotic resistance during treatment. Neither showed a significant association with DAT use.

Egger's test indicated asymmetry for treatment success (Egger's \u03b20 = 0.66 [0.16 to 1.16]; t(44) = 2.58; p = 0.01) suggesting potential publication bias reflected by the relative paucity of larger studies with negative findings.

[26]  Long-term clinical outcomes Two cohort studies  [22, 30] and one RCT  [31] examined the frequency of recurrence after treatment for TB disease. Of these, only one cohort study suggested a lower rate of recurrence in the DAT group. The others found no difference.

      "text": "Our systematic review aimed to assess the impact of digital technologies on clinical outcomes, adherence, and patient-reported outcomes among persons treated for TB disease and infection.\n\nWe included randomized and quasi-experimental studies, as well as cohort studies, from diverse country settings.\n\nSome digital technologies, notably those involving video observation or other smartphone technologies, were associated with improved treatment success and reduced losses to followup. They may also enhance adverse event reporting. These findings are concordant with previous reviews  [5, 8, 42, 43] . Similarly, VOT was associated with improved adherence to . expected dosing. However, VOT and smartphone intervention studies were overwhelmingly conducted in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. Hence the generalizability of these findings to low-income and lower-middle-income country settings, which experience most of the world's TB incidence, may be limited. Low-income and lower-middle-income countries may face greater challenges in mobile coverage and accessibility, and in health system capacity to implement DATs.\n\nIndeed, SMS-based interventions and medication sleeves with phone calls (99DOTS), which were largely implemented in LMIC settings, were not consistently associated with improved adherence or clinical outcomes. In fact, 99DOTs may have been associated with an increased frequency of death, raising the possibility of gaps in patient supervision and support. [44]  However, this result should be interpreted with caution as the effect of confounders was not adjusted for. Clustering was also not considered in one of the 99DOTS studies. It is also possible that deaths appeared more frequent if there were fewer losses to follow-up, as the latter are a key competing risk.\n\nDigital pillbox-based interventions, which were also mostly implemented in LMIC settings, also had variable associations with clinical outcomes. While digital pillboxes were associated with increased medication adherence, these findings were often reported from studies that compared adherence data from a \"silent\" pillbox (i.e., without reminders) in the control arm to a pillbox that provided audiovisual reminders in the intervention arm. This approach may increase risk of detection bias, as people receiving audiovisual reminders may be more inclined to keep medication blister packs within the device, thereby increasing engagement with the DAT. Earlier studies and a forthcoming systematic review have highlighted limits to the accuracy of dose reports with 99DOTS and reveal considerable variability in the accuracy of dose reports from digital pillboxes. [45] [46] [47]  The increased reporting of adverse events with the VOT and smartphone platforms is likely a positive consequence of more consistent opportunities for contact with providers. Reporting of more adverse events by persons treated using VOT may indicate that more medication is taken. Reporting of adverse events is important to manage potential complications, and to address concerns that may affect adherence to treatment. [20]  Unfortunately, no study evaluated deaths post-treatment, and most did not report on recurrent TB disease or emergence of drug resistance at any time.\n\nImportantly, many of the VOT and digital pillbox studies also included co-interventions to enhance patient support, beyond dose monitoring.\n\nExamples include medication reminders,  [19, 22, 25, 28, 40, [48] [49] [50] [51]  encouraging adverse event reporting  [19, 20, 22, 24, 40, 48]  and/or escalation via SMS, phone calls, or home visits if expected video observation was missed. Some VOT interventions were coupled with motivational SMS, reimbursement of mobile data costs, payment for visit attendance, or nutritional allowances. [19, 20, 29, 48, 52]  Similarly, for interventions that involved smartphone technologies, most studies described various combinations of associated measures e.g., medication reminders, adverse event reporting, instant messaging, chat groups with providers and/or other patients. [37, 53, 54]  The diversity of comparison strategies reported as the \"standard of care\" further complicates This substantially limits generalizability of findings regarding these two technologies to lowerincome country settings where TB burden is highest, yet where these technologies and the necessary technical and human resource infrastructure may be least accessible. Notably, however, our review does report robust findings from studies in LMICs: the DAT types implemented in these settings (e.g., SMS, 99DOTS, digital pillboxes) had variable or nonsignificant impacts on treatment outcomes, which has important policy implications.\n\nThere was also substantial heterogeneity in study findings, which is not surprising given the diversity of study settings, methodologies, technologies and comparators considered. This limited our ability to formally pool and meta-analyze data, and made some quantitative findings less robust.\n\nWe could not assess treatment success and treatment completion as separate outcomes: some studies used the two terms interchangeably. While the treatment success category includes both persons with microbiologic cure and those who completed treatment without known microbiologic failure, most studies did not report microbiologic cure.\n\nIn this meta-analysis, we estimated odds ratios for some short-term clinical outcomes from crude event numbers reported in cluster randomized trials, as no adjusted estimates were provided. This may have resulted in artificially narrow confidence intervals when clustering was ignored.\n\nWe focused on evidence from RCTs, quasi-experimental studies and cohort studies. For this reason, cross-sectional studies which assessed patient-reported outcomes-often without a comparison group-were excluded. More generally, there was very limited evidence around the use of DATs in persons with drug-resistant TB, in children, or in persons living with HIV."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "While the evidence base remains incomplete, and generalizability of studies often limited, this systematic review nonetheless synthesizes relevant information and identifies further evidence patients, and providers will increasingly look to digital technologies for support. The combination and fine-tuning of different support interventions, with a more personalized delivery approach, is promising. However, there remain substantial knowledge gaps with respect to key populations and to longer-term health outcomes. Beyond issues of generalizability to settings and populations which bear the highest TB burdens, there also remain important questions related to implementation and logistics. Further research is urgently needed to rethink approaches to DATs-and to inform non-DAT-based approaches to improving TB treatment outcomes in LMICs.\n\n."
