      "text": "The second manuscript reviewed commonly used self-report nicotine dependence measures used with young adult populations. Three instruments, including the Fagerstr\u04e7m Test for Nicotine Dependence, the Cigarette Dependence Scale, and the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, were identified as the most commonly used instruments and were subjected to further psychometric analysis. Results indicated that researchers must consider conceptual and operational definitions of smoking behavior as it relates to the population and the topic of interest, and review reliability and validity of appropriate instruments prior to selecting self-report measures of nicotine dependence for use in studies of college students.\n\nThe third manuscript summarized a quasi-experimental study designed to test the effects of a novel text message-based motivational interviewing intervention (iMI) on cigarette smoking behavior in college students and to provide a better understanding of smoking behavior regulation. The aims of the study were to : (1) test the effects of the iMI on cognitive parameters of behavior regulation (psychological needs satisfaction, autonomous motivation, smoking self-efficacy, and readiness to quit) among college students who smoke,  (2)  evaluate the effect of the intervention on smoking behavior (number of cigarettes smoked per day and severity of nicotine addiction) between baseline and 2-week post-intervention follow-up, and (3) identify independent predictors of change in smoking behavior among college students, from baseline to 2-week postintervention follow-up. Undergraduate students (N = 33) were recruited to participate in the study that lasted five weeks (3-week intervention program with 2-week postintervention follow-up assessment). Data were analyzed to determine differences in behavior regulation and smoking behavior parameters from baseline to 2-week postintervention follow-up and identify independent predictors of change in smoking behavior among study participants. The findings indicated that intervention was successful in affecting positive changes in smoking behavior regulation (autonomy and relatedness needs satisfaction, autonomous motivation, and smoking cessation selfefficacy) and reducing smoking behavior (cigarettes smoked per day). Smoking cessation self-efficacy was the strongest behavior regulation predictor of smoking behavior in college students.\n\nLimitations of the study included limited interpretability and generalizability due to a small, single-group convenience sample and the exclusive use of self-report measures."

      "title": "CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "The primary purpose of this dissertation was to examine the effects of a novel text message-based motivational interviewing intervention on cigarette smoking in college students. In addition to the introductory chapter, this dissertation consists of three manuscripts and a concluding chapter that summarizes and links the findings of these manuscripts. First, a critical review of the literature on smoking cessation interventions using motivational interviewing and text-messaging among young adults was conducted to identify relevant research and practice considerations. Next, the state of the measurement of smoking addiction in young adults was examined and the psychometric properties of three nicotine dependence instruments commonly used in college-age samples were evaluated. Finally, a novel text message-based motivational interviewing intervention was designed and tested in a sample of college students to identify its effects on smoking behavior.\n\nThe ill-health effects of cigarette smoking are widely known. The impact of young adult smoking is dramatic on both individual and public health levels. Over a hundred years of research has drawn attention to the adverse effects of smoking on young people. Early literature depicted young smokers developing a \"tobacco heart\"  (Otis, 1884) . More recently, others described the association of tobacco smoking with lower academic achievement  (Latvala et al., 2014) , reduced fertility  (Augood, Duckitt, & Templeton, 1998) , congenital defects  (Hackshaw, Rodeck, & Boniface, 2011) , and increasing one's odds at becoming an illicit drug user  (Strong, Juon, & Ensminger, 2016) .\n\nThose who smoke have worse overall health, more frequent hospital admissions, and more workplace absenteeism than non-smokers which costs American economy approximately $300 billion every year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n[CDC], 2016). In Kentucky, the annual health care cost of smoking is at a staggering $1.92 billion, creating almost $1200 per household in state and federal tax burden (Campaign for Tobacco  -Free Kids, 2016a) .\n\nNearly all cigarette smoking behavior begins during youth and progresses through young adulthood. Almost all life-time smokers start smoking by age 26, and every person who dies due to smoking effects is replaced by two new young smokers (Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, 2016) . Although scientific evidence that smoking cigarettes is deadly is incontrovertible, over 40 million American adults and about 3 million adolescents continue to smoke (U.S. Department of  Health & Human Services, 2014) . If nothing is changed and the smoking continues at its current rate, one out of every 13 of today's youth will die prematurely from a smoking-related illness  (CDC, 2016) . For the state of Kentucky, that will be approximately 119,000 lives lost prematurely (Campaign for Tobacco  -Free Kids, 2016a) . Although today's smokers smoke fewer cigarettes than those 50 years ago, they are faced with a higher risk of developing smoking-related disease due to changes in the design and composition of cigarettes (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services [USDHHS], 2014). Therefore, it is crucial to address smoking behavior in its earliest stages.\n\nDespite the progress in public health that led to smoking rates falling significantly (by more than 50% since 1964), cigarette smoking remains the single largest cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States  (USDHHS, 2014) . About half of all smokers who do not quit will die prematurely from a tobacco-related disease, and more than half of people who continue to smoke will be affected by a disease caused by their smoking (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). It is clear that achieving the ultimate goal of eliminating smoking-related death and disease will require a thorough investigation of this social phenomenon and a theoretically-driven design of a carefully tailored program, at each sub-population level.\n\nYoung adults as a population present with unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nRates of health risk behaviors peak in adolescence and young adulthood  (Park, Paul Mulye, Adams, Brindis, & Irwin, 2006) . These poor health behaviors may result in lifelong health problems, if left unaddressed. The college setting represents a transitional period for smoking and other risk behaviors, and it presents a unique window of opportunity to conduct smoking interventions. Literature suggests that several factors are associated with cigarette smoking in young adults, most common of them are: intensity, frequency, duration of cigarette use, and the associated nicotine addiction  (Cengelli, O'Loughlin, Lauzon, & Cornuz, 2012) . A systematic review of evidence revealed that age at first cigarette, friends' smoking status, intentions to smoke in the future, beliefs about smoking, and the ability to resist peer pressure were the strongest predictors of smoking cessation in adolescent and young adult smokers  (Cengelli et al., 2012) . These factors are important in research, as well as planning and evaluation of the strategies aimed at smoking behavior in college students.\n\nThere are several evidence-based approaches for smoking cessation reported in the literature. The most popular ones in the college setting include environmental strategies, cognitive-behavioral therapy, nicotine replacement, self-help, and counseling interventions  (Butler, Fallin, & Ridner, 2012) . One counseling intervention that has not been well examined in this group is the use of motivational interviewing (MI)a personcentered method of counseling to elicit and strengthen person's motivation for a behavioral change  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) .\n\nIn the last decade, the use of mobile phones and text messaging has become popular among young adults around the world  (Krishna, Boren, & Balas, 2009) . Cell phones offer an alternative route of intervention delivery to the hard-to-reach populations, at a relatively low cost  (Krishna et al., 2009) . Young adults' comfort with and access to Reliable and valid measures are crucial in conducting research that yields meaningful and translatable findings. Identifying such measures, however, can be very challenging. Literature suggests that addiction is a one of the major factors in smoking behavior  (Patkar, Vergare, Batra, Weinstein, & Leone, 2003) . Chapter Three includes a published manuscript on the state of the measurement of smoking addiction measures  (Jorayeva, Hall, Ridner, 2015) . The Fagerstr\u04e7m Test for Nicotine Dependence  (Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991) , the Cigarette Dependence Scale  (Etter, Le Houezec, & Perneger, 2003) , and the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist  (DiFranza et al., 2002)  were chosen for evaluation from the most popular instruments used in smoking behavior research based on their good overall psychometric properties, theoretical plausibility, and applicability to the college population. Recommendations for new directions in reliable measurement of smoking addiction are given in this chapter.\n\nChapter Four presents a pilot study of an innovative cigarette smoking intervention in college students. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, text message-based brief motivational interviewing  (MI)  intervention in facilitating smoking behavior change in college students. The study was grounded in the propositions of Self-Determination Theory (SDT).\n\nSelf Determination Theory is a broad-based motivational theory that focuses on the sources of human motivation to engage in a healthy behavior  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) .\n\nThe main premise of the SDT is that all behaviors may be understood as laying along a continuum of relative autonomy, which reflects the extent to which the person fully endorses and is committed to a particular behavior  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . The foundational principle of SDT is that behavior can be both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . Intrinsic motivation characterizes behavior, engagement in which could be explained by the pleasures and satisfaction it provides. Extrinsic motivation pertains to behavior that is performed to obtain some separable outcome. It is on this assumption that the SDT proposes its continuum of autonomy. At the extremes of this continuum are amotivation (or the lack of motivation) and intrinsic motivation (the point of most autonomy), between them are four classifications of motivated behavior, from the least to most autonomous: external regulation (behavior is performed to satisfy demand or reward), introjected regulation (behavior is driven by the contingent selfesteem), identified regulation (behavior is accepted and owned), and integrated (behavior is assimilated to the self) regulation  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . According to the theory, as individuals internalize and integrate new behavior to their concept of self, they experience greater autonomy in the action; and more autonomously regulated behaviors are more stable and produce greater positive effects on individual's well-being, both short-and long-term  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . This process of autonomy, as proposed by SDT is a stage-based, continuous development, yet the movement along the continuum may not always be linear, as the authors credit prior experiences and current situational factors as major determinants of the stage of behavior internalization  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) .\n\nMore specifically, SDT proposes that expression of one's full capacity and optimal functioning is supported primarily by satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Figure1)  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) .\n\nAccording to SDT, engagement and maintenance of health behaviors, such as quitting smoking, rely heavily on the behavior regulation processan active course of internalization of an externally prompted behavior within an experience of autonomy, relatedness and sense of competence (Figure  2 )  (Williams et al., 2011) .\n\nThe need for autonomy or the sense of personal choice and authorship is an important aspect of human thriving  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) . It is different from the need for competence, as a person may very well be competent in a certain behavior and yet resent engaging in it. It is further argued that the need for autonomy provides additional adaptive advantages to the ability to become more internally coordinated and integrated to be able to disengage from certain social groups when necessary, which is often crucial in self-regulation and maintenance of behaviors conducive to health and well-being  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) .\n\nHowever, most health behaviors, such as quitting smoking, are not inherently enjoyable and thus happen to be not intrinsically but externally motivated; therefore, it's important to have the client see the value in and endorse the needed change  (Ryan, Patrick, Deci, & Williams, 2008) . According to SDT-based interventional research, controlled motivation with its external (where a person adapts the change to avoid punishment or get a reward, or comply with social pressures) or introjected (where a person adapts change to receive approval or avoid feelings of guilt) regulation pathways is largely unrelated to the long-term adherence to change  (Ryan et al., 2008) .\n\nAutonomous motivation, on the other hand, is strongly associated with the enhanced maintenance and transfer of behavior change through its mechanisms of identified (where a person endorses or identifies with the value of health behavior) and integrated (where a person aligns the healthy behavior with his or her central values) regulation  (Ryan et al., 2008) .\n\nAccording to SDT, a person's satisfaction of the need for competence relies on the opportunities to master the environment and the support of their sense of competence.\n\nThe need for competence proposes an innate human drive to seek challenges to contribute to their growth and development and adapt to the changes around them  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) . Theoretically, the concept of competence is well aligned with the concepts of similar dimension, such as self-efficacy, confidence, control, and optimism, making its postulation relatively uncontroversial  (Vansteenkiste & Sheldon, 2006) .\n\nSDT posits that gaining a sense of competence is often facilitated by the sense of autonomy. In essence, when the person has a high degree of willingness to act and a strong sense of personal choice in their decision, there are more inclined to learn and apply new strategies, techniques, and competencies  (Markland, Ryan, Tobin, & Rollnick, 2005) . In addition, SDT model makes a distinct claim that competence alone is not sufficient to ensure adherence and that it must be accompanied by autonomy for a meaningful outcome  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) .\n\nThe need for relatedness postulates that people innately seek close and intimate relationships in order to achieve a sense of belongingness that allows their feelings, thoughts and beliefs be heard and respected. It is because of this need, that mutually supportive relationships are created; and through these bonds, the ability to affect the desired change is tremendously enhanced  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) .\n\nIn the health care setting, clients often seek a sense of respect, understanding, and a genuine concern from their encounters with health care professionals, who are there to guide them through the journey to a better health. Satisfaction of these conditions is vital to forming the relationship of connection and trust which will in turn not only lead to greater openness to health information and compliance with clinical recommendations, but also allow for the internalization of the desired behavior change by the client and a more sustained positive outcome  (Ryan et al., 2008) .\n\nSDT model proposes that an individual's motivation to change is primarily facilitated by the satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness  (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan et al., 2008) . The authors argue that this list is not exhaustive but rather additive, and that these three experiential qualities are among the most crucial for clients' optimal functioning and well-being  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) . SDT postulates that by enhancing client's experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, the regulation of health behaviors is more likely to be internalized and behavior change is more likely to be sustained over time  (Williams, Deci, & Ryan, 1998) . These three needs are central to the theoretical framework proposed for this study.\n\nDrawing from SDT, the process of smoking behavior regulation was hypothesized as a prime antecedent of smoking behavior. Situational factors were operationalized as individual demographic characteristics (internal factors) and participation in the iMI intervention (external factor). Smoking behavior regulation was operationalized by four cognitive parameters: basic psychological needs satisfaction, autonomous motivation, smoking cessation self-efficacy, and readiness to quit smoking. College student smoking was operationalized by the behavior parameters of smoking: number of cigarettes smoked per day and severity of nicotine addiction (Figure  3 ).\n\nSeminal work of social cognitive theorists placed behavior regulation at the heart of causal processes in human behavior  (Bandura, 1991) . Not only does behavior regulation mediate the effects of external influences but it also provides the basis for action in most human endeavors  (Bandura, 1991) . Self-regulatory mechanisms play a paramount role in motivation and are a multifaceted phenomenon operating through a number of cognitive processes, including evaluative judgment, self-appraisal, and affective regulation  (Bandura, 1991) .\n\nAt the core of behavior self-determination process is the satisfaction of basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) .\n\nSDT posits that autonomous motivation originates in fulfillment of the basic psychological needs, with individuals whose needs are generously satisfied being more likely to engage in self-determined and healthy activities, and those whose needs are generally thwarted seeking to compensate through taking on externally motivated and detrimental behavior  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . Support and satisfaction of the basic psychological needs has been empirically associated with motivation, initiation, and maintenance of health behaviors  (Ng et al., 2012) . Previous research has related basic psychological needs satisfaction with regulation of healthy behaviors such as exercise  (Edmunds, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2006; Fortier, Sweet, O'Sullivan, & Williams, 2007; Ng et al., 2012; Vlachopoulos & Michailidou, 2006) , dental care  (M\u00fcnster Halvari, Halvari, Bj\u00f8rnebekk, & Deci, 2010) , and tobacco abstinence  (Ng et al., 2012; Ryan, Patrick, Deci, & Williams, 2008) . In college students, individuals reporting high need fulfillment were more likely to engage in healthy behaviors such as physical activity and smoking abstinence  (Visser & Hirsch, 2014) .\n\nThe concept of autonomous motivation as a function of psychological needs has been explored for several decades, and various studies have supported its association with more optimal development, performance, and well-being  (Deci & Ryan, 2000) . Rockafellow and Saules (2006)  conducted an investigation of motivational factors in substance use among collegiate athletes. They found that autonomously motivated students had lower rates of substance use with respect to their quantity and frequency of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use  (Rockafellow & Saules, 2006) . Autonomous motivation also has been credited with a significant association with greater tobacco abstinence  (Williams, McGregor, Sharp, Kouldes, et al., 2006; Williams, McGregor, Sharp, Levesque, et al., 2006)  and cessation  (Williams, Gagn\u00e9, Ryan, & Deci, 2002)  in two longitudinal studies of adult smokers.\n\nThe concept of self-efficacy, which is often interchanged with the word competence is most commonly defined as one's ability to \"organize and execute courses of action required to attain designated types of performance\"  (Bandura, 1986, p. 391) , and it has been extensively examined in the behavioral change literature. Smoking behavior literature supports a positive relationship between self-efficacy and the number of quit attempts, smoking cessation, and maintenance of long-term abstinence  (Mudde, Kok, & Strecher, 1995; Schnoll et al., 2011; Scholte & Breteler, 1997)  and an inverse relationship between smoking cessation self-efficacy and nicotine addiction  (John, Meyer, Rumpf, & Hapke, 2004 ) across different populations. In adolescents and young adults, research suggests that self-efficacy is similarly significant precursor to smoking cessation, and therefore an important concept for smoking behavior research  (Camenga & Klein, 2004; Chen, Horner, Percy, & Sheu, 2008; Martinez et al., 2010; Patten et al., 2008) .\n\nReadiness to change is one of the most prominent antecedents of smoking cessation (Van Zundert, Engels,  Kleinjan, & van den Eijnden, 2008) . Research proposes that greater readiness to quit smoking is positively related not only to smoking cessation but also long-term abstinence  (Ham, 2007) . Multiple factors influence readiness to stop smoking. Number of cigarettes and frequency of smoking were strongly associated with higher nicotine addiction, lower self-efficacy, and lower readiness to quit  (Berg et al., 2012; Branstetter, Horn, Dino, & Zhang, 2009) . Readiness to quit smoking was also positively associated with quit attempts, while nicotine addiction is inversely associated with successful cessation  (Kleinjan et al., 2009) . A recent systematic review of longitudinal population-based studies confirmed the centrality of self-efficacy and readiness to change constructs in adolescent and young adult smoking cessation  (Cengelli et al., 2012) .\n\nCigarette smoking behavior is a well-studied, extremely complex phenomenon of intentional inhalation of tobacco smoke  (Kissen, 1964) . Many different parameters are used in the literature to operationalize the nature of smoking activity. One of the most common descriptive as well as predictive factors in smoking behavior literature is nicotine addiction. Nicotine addiction was positively associated with quit attempts and inversely associated with social smoking in college students  (Moran, Wechsler, & Rigotti, 2004 ). In the college population, studies have shown that the prevalence of smoking and nicotine addiction increase over the college years, making this population a particularly informative age group  (Bachman, Wadsworth, O'Malley, Johnston, & Schulenberg, 1997) .\n\nSDT has increasingly been cited in the health behavior change literature, and there is a growing number of randomized clinical trials that test the efficacy of the SDTbased interventions in the initiation and maintenance of behavioral changes. Evidence suggests that these interventions enhance autonomous self-regulation and competence, and consequently promote positive behavioral outcomes  (Ryan et al., 2008) . In fact the three basic needs as proposed by SDT (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) are highly congruent with the MI processes of engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning  (Miller & Rollnick, 2013) . From SDT perspective, it is essential for the clinicians to help clients feel that (1) they have autonomously chosen their behavior change,  (2)  they can succeed at it, (3) they connect with and trust the professional they are working with while undergoing the change. All of these three goals were targeted through the application of motivational interviewing (MI) to behavioral counseling in this novel college student smoking behavior intervention.\n\nThe final chapter of this dissertation is Chapter Five. That chapter synthesizes the findings of the three manuscripts and makes recommendations for future research and practice. and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being,\" by R.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Advances in medicine and public health have increased exponentially during the last century, leading to increased life expectancy in the United States. However, today's young adults may be the first generation to experience worse health indicators than their predecessors, and majority of these health conditions are preventable or remediable through health behavior changes  (Rollnick, Miller, & Butler, 2008) . Health care in the 21 st century has moved beyond traditional medical cure and is increasingly more focused on chronic disease management, behavioral changes, and healthy lifestyles  (Rollnick et al., 2008) .\n\nNicotine is well-known as an addictive substance.\n\nIn the United States, cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product, representing over 90% of nicotine use (APA, 2013). Despite numerous warnings regarding the dangers of cigarette smoking, 40 million Americans continue to smoke, and the number of some-day smokers has increased from 8.7 million in 2005 to 9.3 million in 2014 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015a). Smoking harms almost every organ of the human body and accounts for nearly 20% of all deaths, each year in the United States (CDC, 2015b); it is the single most preventable cause of premature mortality and morbidity across different populations (CDC, 2015b). Cigarette smoking is a prominent problem that crosses most age groups, including young adults (CDC, 2015a). Long-lasting health risk behaviors are formed during young adulthood and their effects have a broad reach. About 16.7% of all American adults aged 18-24 years smoke cigarettes (CDC, 2015a). There are over 15 million young adults attending undergraduate colleges and universities in the United States, almost 9 million of those are younger than 25 years old (United States Census Bureau, 2015). According to the American College Health Association -National College Health Assessment, 9.8% of the college students report some use of cigarettes within the last 30 days (American College Health Association, 2016). Cigarette smoking in college-aged individuals\n\npresents a significant risk for life-long nicotine dependence and its devastating effects on health, well-being, and economic welfare of the population  (Rigotti, Lee, & Wechsler, 2000) .\n\nYoung adults as a group present with unique challenges and opportunities. It is known that the rates of health risk behaviors peak in adolescence and young adulthood  (Park, Paul Mulye, Adams, Brindis, & Irwin, 2006) . These poor health behaviors may result in lifelong health problems, if left unchanged. The college setting represents a transitional period for smoking and other health risk behaviors and presents a unique window of opportunity to implement effective secondary prevention interventions.\n\nCurrently, various evidence-based approaches are used in smoking cessation. The most popular ones in the college setting include environmental strategies, cognitive-behavioral therapy, nicotine replacement therapy, self-help, and group or individual counseling interventions  (Butler, Fallin, & Ridner, 2012) . One approach that has not been well established in this group is the use of motivational interviewing.\n\nMotivational interviewing is a purposefully directive approach to counseling where a client is carefully led towards changing his or her own behavior  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) . It is a promising intervention option for college students because of its non-confrontational nature, brevity, and evidence-supported efficacy in affecting health risk behaviors such as smoking in similar age groups  (Colby et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2010; Herman & Fahnlander, 2003) . Integration of commonly used technology may offer a unique delivery method for such interventions in the young adult population.\n\nTechnology today is pervasive in many aspects of daily living and shows great promise as an effective delivery method for the traditionally in-person therapies.\n\nTechnical innovations are essential to quality health care and optimal patient outcomes.\n\nIn the last decade, the use of mobile phones and text messaging has become very popular among young adults around the world  (Krishna, Boren, & Balas, 2009) . Cell phones offer an alternative route of health intervention delivery for hard-to-reach populations at a relatively low cost and with a promise of improving health outcomes  (Krishna et al., 2009; Orr & King, 2015) . Young adults' comfort with and access to technology provides a great opportunity to use these tools in smoking behavior interventions.\n\nThe primary objective of this review is to examine the available evidence for the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI) and text messaging in smoking cessation among college-age individuals. The secondary objective is to develop recommendations for next steps in smoking intervention research in young adults. This review will also add to the new body of knowledge on innovative, effective, technology-integrated strategies to impact health behavior changes."

      "title": "Significance Text messaging interventions",
      "text": "Advances in cell phone technology are increasingly viewed as solutions to expanding the range of health care delivery  (Luxton, McCann, Bush, Mishkind, & Reger, 2011) . Mobile phones provide people with the opportunity to connect with others, regardless of time and location. The use of this technology can help clinicians and researchers in behavioral health care stay in closer contact with their clients and gather data more efficiently  (Luxton et al., 2011) . In addition, mobile phones offer familiar, naturalistic environment for the intervention delivery, as the person is already familiar with operating their phone and does not have to be subjected to the artificial surroundings of a health care facility  (Verster, Tiplady, & McKinney, 2012) . To better fit diverse needs and changing lifestyles of young adults, an increasingly mobile and tech-savvy population, health care needs to move beyond the traditional office-based setting to be more accessible, interactive, and efficient, and congruent with time.\n\nMobile phone technology has undergone a major development during the last decade, evolving from the bulky first generation phones with small screens and limited data capacity into the slim, larger touch-screen, high-speed internet access devices, with more advanced computing capability and data storage  (Verster et al., 2012) . In the U.S. there are over 326 million active wireless subscribers which is more than 100% total penetration rate (CTIA -The Wireless Association\u00ae, 2013). Usage statistics suggest a growing trend in the use of mobile technology. With 2.3 trillion minutes aired, 2.19 trillion Short Message Service (SMS) text messages exchanged, and 1.47 trillion megabyte of data transferred, smartphones are becoming more than just a traditional device to place a call (CTIA -The Wireless Association\u00ae, 2013). A 2011 report of mobile technology use in America identified young adults as the most avid users of cell phone's text messaging capability; 95% of 18 to 24 year-olds own a cell phone and 97%\n\nsend an average of 110 text messages a day  (Smith, 2011) . Systematic reviews and a recent meta analysis  (B\u00e4ck & M\u00e4kel\u00e4, 2012; Cole-Lewis & Kershaw, 2010; Krishna et al., 2009; Mason, Ola, Zaharakis, & Zhang, 2015; Wei, Hollin, & Kachnowski, 2011)  found text messaging to hold great potential for clinical and health behavior interventions allowing for more efficient use of health care resources and producing a positive effect on reduction of substance use in adolescent and young adult populations (summary effect size 0.25, 95% CI 0.13 -0.38)  (Mason, Ola, et al., 2015) .\n\nMany studies have demonstrated efficacy and acceptability of text messaging in the field of smoking cessation across different populations (e.g.,  Bock, Heron, Jennings, Magee, & Morrow, 2013; Devries, Kenward, & Free, 2013; Free et al., 2011; Gritz et al., 2013; Hartmann-Boyce, Stead, Cahill, & Lancaster, 2013; Haug, Meyer, Schorr, Bauer, & John, 2009; Militello, Kelly, & Melnyk, 2012; Obermayer, Riley, Asif, & Jean-Mary, 2004; Whittaker et al., 2012; Ybarra, Holtrop, Prescott, Rahbar, & Strong, 2013) . In a Cochrane intervention efficacy review, Hartmann-Boyce and colleagues (2013) reported that mobile phone smoking cessation interventions increased long-term quit rates (RR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.47-1.99) (Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2013) . This systematic review evidence for the first time reported the efficacy of behavioral support over and above pharmacotherapy. Although the contents of text message smoking behavior interventions varied across studies, this delivery method has been supported as a powerful behavior change instrument in adolescents and young adults  (Bock et al., 2013; Haug et al., 2009; Militello et al., 2012; Obermayer et al., 2004; Ybarra et al., 2013) . Overall, the integration of mobile technology into the behavioral change interventions seems to be a promising new trajectory applicable to a variety of interventions."

      "text": "Motivational interviewing (MI) is a person-centered method of counseling to elicit and strengthen an individual's motivation for a behavioral change  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) . It is a communication approach in which difficulties of behavioral change and possibilities of engagement in healthier behavior are discussed in a respectful manner and in accord with client's own goals and values  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) . MI is not based on any specific theory or a school of psychotherapy  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) .\n\nIt is a style of empathy, honesty, and collaboration that can be used in different settings to elicit internal motivation and resources when ambivalence is impeding behavioral change  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) .\n\nThe technical definition of MI is: \"collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change <\u2026> designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion\"  (Miller & Rollnick, 2013, p. 29) . MI is focused on the construct of motivation which acts as both the antecedent of the initiation of behavioral change and an impetus in the progression of change  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) .\n\nSince its original development as a treatment modality for problem drinking, motivational interviewing has been extended to other substance use disorders, health behaviors, and mental health disturbances  (Arkowitz, Westra, Miller, & Rollnick, 2008; Hettema, Steele, & Miller, 2005; Miller, 1983; Rollnick et al., 2008) . Research on the use of MI in tobacco control is quite extensive, with first article published in 1998  (Colby et al., 1998) . For the 2013 Smoking Cessation Update, Miranda and colleagues conducted a review of the current clinical cessation evidence and concluded that the MI strategies were effective in increasing the quit attempts  (Miranda, Ruiz, & Rebollo, 2013) . A review of the literature on smoking behaviors examining the dimensions of social support, motivation, and tailoring of the intervention suggested that the intrinsic motivation is the best predictor of change  (Mantler, Irwin, & Morrow, 2012) . The most comprehensive systematic analysis of MI in smoking cessation to date included 31 empirical studies with 9,485 participants  (Heckman, Egleston, & Hofmann, 2010) . There was a statistically significant effect of MI on abstinence (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.14-1.83) and a sustained superiority of MI over control condition over time. The odds ratio for MI effect for adolescents was 2.29 (95% CI = 1.34-3.89) and 1.44 (95% CI = 1.04-2.01) for adults  (Heckman et al., 2010) . These findings suggest that motivational interviewing can be an effective brief smoking cessation intervention for adolescent and young adult populations. Thus, the ability of MI to serve as a bridge to cessation and its value as a cigarette smoking reduction approach are well supported in the literature.\n\nMotivational interviewing and text messaging studies have shown promise for smoking cessation. It is important to provide a detailed review of research with adolescents, college students, and young adults. There is a need to learn more about the role and context of text messages and motivational interviewing interventions in smoking behavior change and whether the two approaches make good candidates for merging."

      "text": "The use of text messaging and motivational interviewing in smoking cessation among young adults is in its early stages, as only 12 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, and only one study merged the two interventions  (Mason, Mennis, Way, & Floyd Campbell, 2015) . One of the reviewed studies had a sample size less than 100 participants  (Witkiewitz et al., 2014)    (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983)  for the main outcome measures. Peterson and colleagues (2016)  used the Social Cognitive Theory  (Bandura, 1986)  as the basis for their counseling intervention. In the text message intervention paper, Skov-Ettrup and colleagues (2014) reported that their study website's content was inspired by the Social Cognitive Theory  (Bandura, 1998)  and the Theory of Planned Behavior  (Monta\u0148o & Kasprzyk, 2002) .\n\nAlthough a majority of the studies did not report theoretical underpinning, they were randomized controlled trials with a large sample size representative of the collegeage population demographics. One study included both interventions of interest -motivational interviewing and text messagingand the intervention was successful in producing a positive change in smoking behavior  (Mason et al., 2015) .\n\nIn the motivational interviewing studies, the interventions were mostly comprehensive and moderate in intensity (about three sessions, around 30 minutes each),\n\nand almost consistently reduced smoking rates  (Audrain-McGovern et al., 2011; Colby et al., 2012; Mason, Mennis, et al., 2015; Pardavila-Belio et al., 2015; Peterson et al., 2016; Sussman, Sun, Rohrbach, & Spruijt-Metz, 2012) . However, only one study reported a significant effect of the intervention on sustained smoking cessation  (Pardavila-Belio et al., 2015)  and one longitudinal study found a significant effect only for male participants  (Peterson et al., 2016) . Table  1  summarizes the extracted data for each study.\n\nAll four of the reviewed texts messaging studies demonstrated a positive effect on smoking behavior either through reduction of smoking or complete smoking cessation  (Mussener et al., 2016; Skov-Ettrup et al., 2014; Witkiewitz et al., 2014; Ybarra et al., 2013) . All of the text messaging interventions were at least two-weeks in length, and most delivered a minimum of one text message per day. Table  2  summarizes data on each study.\n\nSmoking behavior indicators data were collected pre-and post-intervention in all of the selected studies. Significant differences in smoking outcomes between groups were reported in six out of eight motivational interviewing intervention studies  (Audrain-McGovern et al., 2011; Colby et al., 2012; Mason, Mennis, et al., 2015; Pardavila-Belio et al., 2015; Peterson et al., 2016; Sussman et al., 2012)  and all four of the text messaging intervention studies  (Mussener et al., 2016; Skov-Ettrup et al., 2014; Witkiewitz et al., 2014; Ybarra et al., 2013) .\n\nOverall, there is a beginning body of evidence that supports the use of a combination of motivational interviewing and text messaging in producing short-term smoking behavior changes. More studies are needed to investigate the long-term benefits of using these interventions to arrive at more conclusive evidence for the college student population."

      "text": "Cigarette smoking is a substantial problem among college students across the country. Quitting smoking is the single most important health behavior change most individuals can make. Adolescents and young adults are unlikely to seek cessation therapies; however, integrating mobile technology may be a way to increase students' readiness to stop smoking and ultimately reduce smoking prevalence and enhance healthy behavior  (Bock et al., 2013; Orr & King, 2015) . The vast majority of the smoking research in college students has been epidemiological in nature. To date, there have been  Records identified through database searching (N = 371) Records after publication date and language filters (n = 356) Records excluded based on ineligibility (n = 344) Studies included in the review (n = 12) Smoking does not satisfy any basic human need and is often perceived as a way to relieve stress or find pleasure  (Schaefer, 2004) . According to the Surgeon General, young people (18 to 25 years of age) have the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking in the United States (over 30%) (USDHHS, 2012).Smoking initiation might shed some light on the process of addiction. Many young people are likely to smoke their first cigarette at college, and almost 100% of smokers start before the age of 26  (Everett et al., 1999; USDHHS, 2012) . Lasting health habits are formed during young adulthood and the health effects of these habits are far-reaching.\n\nCigarette smoking among young adult college-aged individuals presents a significant danger for life-long nicotine dependence  (Rigotti, Lee, Wechsler, 2000) .\n\nInterestingly, some longitudinal research points to the fact that the majority of the smokers exhibit the desire to quit, and that the strongest predictor of cessation is the nicotine dependence  (Hyland et al., 2004) . Identifying proper attributes of smoking addiction will further enhance the understanding of this phenomenon and help create effective interventions for smoking cessation.\n\nDespite numerous empirical efforts to address smoking in young adults, the literature lacks a consistent measurement procedure of nicotine dependence in college students. Careful selection of measurement instruments is critical for advancement of science and clinical practice needed to prevent the devastating personal and social consequences of cigarette smoking. This chapter will examine three of the most commonly used nicotine dependence instruments to identify and compare their psychometric properties and applicability to a college population. A recommendation will be made for the most rigorous approach to nicotine dependence measurement in college students."

      "title": "Conceptual definitions",
      "text": "The concept of addiction is intertwined with the concept of smoking. As a first step in establishing the common definitions of the concepts of interest, popular media was consulted. According to the Miller-Keane Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health, smoking is defined as an inhalation of smoke of burning tobacco  (Farlex Inc., 2013) . Although there is no universally accepted definition, addiction is often defined as psychological and physiologic dependence  (Farlex Inc., 2013) . The Mayo Clinic defines nicotine dependence as an addiction to tobacco, where one cannot stop using the substance, although they are aware of its harm (Mayo Foundation for Medical  Education and Research, 2013) .\n\nFrom the empirical evidence, smoking was viewed as a chronic behavioral disorder that creates the physiologic basis for addiction to nicotine through the inhalation of cigarette smoke  (Patkar et al., 2003) . It is the nicotine that is the primary cause of tobacco use and dependence  (Benowitz, 2001) . To get a better understanding of this relationship, a review of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system effects is needed.\n\nEarly addiction research suggested that neurochemical effects of nicotine delivered through cigarette smoking are comparable to the effects of antidepressive medications in the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in the brain, leading to a better psychological state in the individual  (Benowitz, 1997) . In addition, nicotine has been shown to improve cognitive symptoms and may indeed induce enhancement of learning, memory and other higher-order cognitive processes  (Evans & Drobes, 2009; Newhouse et al., 2004; Rusted et al., 2000) . Apart from nicotine, other components of tobacco smoke may also have psychoactive properties. For instance, cigarette smoke is associated with an inhibition of monoamine oxidase B activity, which carries antidepressant properties, aside from the nicotine effects on the brain, adding to the reinforcement of the positive effects of smoking behavior experienced by the smoker  (Fowler et al., 1996) .\n\nThe construct of smoking addiction is difficult to define precisely. Historically, the meaning of this construct was heavily influenced by the social and political climates of the given time period  (Peele, 2010) . Although addiction is generally viewed as an irreducible biological syndrome, Peele (2010) points to the ongoing evolution of this concept, citing the 1964 World Health Organization's report that officially changed the word \"addiction\" to \"dependence\" and the new version of APA's DSM-V, which returns the word \"addiction,\" re-replacing the word \"dependence\". Interesting to note that tobacco was officially acknowledged as a dependence-producing substance only in 1980 in the DSM-III, which may validate the idea of addiction being more of a political and social construct, rather than solely a medical one  (APA, 1980; Peele, 2010) . Taking into account the current focus of U.S. healthcare on prevention of chronic health conditions, cigarette smoking is, without a doubt, a major societal issue that requires proper operationalization.\n\nConventionally, smoking addiction is the process through which an individual experiments with cigarettes and then gradually escalates the frequency of smoking over 2 to 3 years to daily smoking, developing into a chronic addicted smoker over time  (Rose & Dierker, 2010) . Research supports the link between repeated and chronic use of tobacco and the diagnosis of nicotine dependence, and has identified it as a core feature in the phenomenology of substance dependence  (Dierker et al., 2007) . In the college population, studies have shown that prevalence of smoking and nicotine dependence increase over the college years, making this population a particularly informative age group  (Bachman et al., 1997; Dierker, et al., 2006; Jackson et al., 2000) .\n\nFor the purpose of this investigation, nicotine addiction will become a major informational point for the understanding of smoking addiction, which in its turn will provide a cultural context to create its comprehensive meaning. Nicotine dependence was chosen to be an operational definition (over the exposure to smoking) based on the evidence that suggests considerable variability in dependence across individuals with comparable exposure to smoking  (Colby et al., 2000; Kandel & Chen, 2000) . Also, all single item measures could present unreliable data and could reflect measurement error or some extraneous influences."

      "title": "State of the measurement",
      "text": "Valid and reliable measures of smoking addiction are needed for clinical and research purposes. Currently, there are multiple measures of nicotine dependence symptoms. These measures are sometimes divided into four major categories based on their central constructs: standard substance dependence measures, Fagerstr\u04e7m tests and its derivatives, consumption measures, and the self-rated dependence instruments  (Hughes et al., 2004) . ). The major strengths of the generic measures are that their criteria are derived from widely-accepted definitions of clinical dependence, the major weaknesses are the cost (interviews must be administered by trained personnel) and the fact that they identify the presence not intensity of dependence  (Hughes et al., 2004) .\n\nThe Fagerstr\u04e7m Tolerance Questionnaire is the oldest and one of the best known measures of nicotine dependence that targets consumption and impaired control  (Fagerstr\u04e7m, 1978) . Its revised and shortened version is the Fagerstr\u04e7m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)  (Heatherton et al., 1991) . Both instruments were created to provide a short self-report of nicotine dependence for use in clinical practice. Two items of the FTND (time to first cigarette and cigarettes per day) were later included in the Heaviness of Smoking Index  (Heatherton et al., 1989) . The major strengths of these measures are that they are easy to obtain and that their predictive validity has been supported by many studies; the major weaknesses are their poor overall psychometric features and an overreliance on consumption of tobacco, focusing primarily on the intensity of established nicotine dependence  (Hughes et al., 2004) .\n\nThe most commonly used nicotine consumption measures are self-reported cigarettes per day and cotinine levela metabolite of nicotine  (Hughes et al., 2004) . The major strength of the cigarettes per day is ease in measurement and the major strength of cotinine is that it is an objective measure; the major weaknesses are bias in measurement (for single items) and cost (for the collection and processing of cotinine specimens)  (Hughes et al., 2004) .\n\nThere are several self-rated measures of nicotine dependence; some of them are single items such as level of addiction  (Eiser et al., 1985)  and others are more sophisticated scales such as Reasons for Smoking Questionnaires  (Etter et al., 1999; Tate et al., 1991) . The major strength of these self-rated measures is their unique approach to dependence phenomenon, different from the generic criteria; the major weakness is their poor psychometric performance  (Hughes et al., 2004) .\n\nTo summarize, there are multiple measures of nicotine dependence, and all of them are tapping different aspects of the addiction experience; therefore, a researcher must be careful in the selection (and evaluation) of measures as they predict different outcomes. The value of smoking addiction research and practice depends on the careful measurement of the phenomenon. Therefore, critical evaluation of the psychometric properties of available measures is essential."

      "title": "Existing measures",
      "text": "In the field of smoking addiction, self-report questionnaires are used extensively both in research and clinical practice. Research has shown that nicotine dependence measures are indeed related to real-time reports of smoking and cotinine levels  (Chen et al., 2002; Prokhorov et al., 2000) . The major weaknesses of self-report measures are potential misunderstanding of the questions, social desirability, and the level of physical and mental capacity required to complete the self-report instrument. Given their utility across administrations, statistical appropriateness, and low cost, as well as their theoretical relationship to the concept of addiction, self-reported nicotine dependence measures were chosen for this review.\n\nAside from the generic DSM measure (for which evidence of good psychometric properties is limited, partially due its dichotomous scoring system and the requirement of clinical training), seven popular nicotine dependence instruments were identified in the peer-reviewed literature: the Fagerstr\u04e7m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)  (Heatherton et al., 1991) ; the Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI)  (Heatherton et al., 1989) ; the Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS)  (Etter et al., 2003) ; the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS)  (Shiffman et al., 2004) ; the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC)  (DiFranza et al., 2002) ; the Autonomy Over Smoking Scale AUTOS  (DiFranza et al., 2009) ; and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68)  (Piper et al., 2004) . Out of these self-report instruments, three were selected for further assessment based on their good overall psychometric properties, theoretical plausibility, and applicability to the college population: the Fagerstr\u04e7m Test for Nicotine Dependence, the Cigarette Dependence Scale, and the Hooked on Nicotine\n\nChecklist. Only the CDS has not had its psychometric properties reported in a college sample."

      "title": "Fagerstr\u04e7m Test for Nicotine Dependence",
      "text": "The FTND is an evolution of the Fagerstr\u04e7m Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) and its purpose is clinically oriented  (Heatherton et al., 1991) . The FTND is designed to be used with heavy cigarette smokers. The FTQ's eight items were derived from theoretical notions of reliance on nicotine  (Fagerstr\u04e7m, 1978) . The FTND consists of six of the original FTQ items [time to first cigarette (scores range from 0 to 3), difficulty refraining (scores range from 0 to 1), morning cigarette's importance (scores range from 0 to 1), cigarettes smoked per day (scores range from 0 to 3), heaviness of smoking in the morning (scores range from 0 to 1), smoking when ill (scores range from 0 to 1)] and eliminates the nicotine rating and inhalation questions. The FTND also carries a revised scoring (broader range) for two of the itemstime to first cigarette and cigarettes per day, according to the HSI scoring method  (Heatherton et al., 1989) . The sum of the scores is interpreted to be indicative of either very low (0-2), low (3-4), moderate (5) or high (over 7) nicotine dependence level. The FTND corrected some of the psychometric and conceptual problems of the original FTQ, considerably improving the coefficient alpha from .48 (FTQ) to .61 (FTND) in a sample of 254 adults  (Heatherton et al., 1991) , yet still falling below the recommended threshold of .70  (Nunnaly & Bernstein, 1994) .\n\nSince then, the internal consistency reliability of the FTND has not been much improved, ranging from .48 to .68 in a sample of seven research studies published within the last six years  (Brown et al., 2008; Sledjeski et al., 2007; Courvosier & Etter, 2010; Etter, 2008; Stavem et al., 2008; Etter et al., 2009; Okuyemi et al., 2007) . Moreover, several issues with the instrument validity have been reported by the researchers. Etter (2008)  reported that in his large sample of 13,697 participants at baseline, 1,113 participants at eight days later, and 435 participants at a six week follow-up, FTND performed poorly on the tests of predictive (smoking cessation and self-efficacy) and construct (association with DSMdefined dependence) validity. Sledjeski and colleagues (2007)  also reported that FTND failed the test of predictive validity in their study of smoking behavior of 95 college students at baseline and 55 at follow up, suggesting the inappropriateness of the FTND for a universal nicotine dependence measure. A unidimensional factor structure for the FTND  (Heatherton et al., 1989)  was supported in the literature  (Courvosier & Etter, 2008; Etter, 2008; Wellman et al., 2005) , suggesting that the FTND measures the single dimension of nicotine dependence. Table  4  provides details on these findings."

      "title": "Cigarette Dependence Scale",
      "text": "The CDS is 12-item self-administered measure of addiction to cigarettes developed for use by both clinicians and researchers  (Etter et al., 2003) . The CDS items (prisoner of cigarette, smoke too much, smoke all the time, before going out, minutes to first cigarette, urge to smoke, stress with not having cigarettes, difficulty quitting, dropping everything) cover the main components of DSM-IV and ICD-10 definitions of dependence, except for tolerance. Items are both continuous and multiple choice (scores range from 1 to 5) and are scored using an algorithm. The CDS scores range from 12 (low dependence) to 60 (high dependence). Upon initial administration, the internal consistency of the CDS was supported by an \u03b1 level of .90 (Etter et al., 2003) ; the later use of the CDS has also demonstrated support for the internal consistency of the measure  (Etter et al., 2009) . Etter and colleagues (2009)  in their sample of four distinct groups -226 psychiatric patients, 370 tobacco cessation clinic clients, 13,697 Internet cessation site visitors, and 292 members of general population -reported Cronbach's alpha coefficients of .87 and greater for the CDS across different sample groups.

The unidimensional structure of the CDS was confirmed by the several studies  (Courvosier & Etter, 2010; Etter et al., 2009; Etter, 2008) . Table  4  provides a more detailed overview of these reports. However, there was no psychometric reporting of CDS found in smoking research in college population  (Dean, Sugar, Hellemann, London, 2011; Floyd, Westmaas, Targhetta, Moyer, 2009; Xu, Floyd, Westmaas, Aron, 2010) ."

      "text": "The HONC is a 10-item checklist that is self-administered to determine the strength of nicotine dependence  (DiFranza et al., 2002) . Items include: tried to quit but couldn't; really hard to quit; addicted to tobacco; strong cravings; need for a cigarette; difficulty refraining; hard to concentrate without; feel more irritable without; strong need or urge when not smoking; feel nervous, restless, or anxious without  (DiFranza et al., 2002) . The number of positive responses to any of HONC items signals a loss of autonomy and the onset of dependence. A total score is calculate by summing the number of responses (yes = 1, no = 0), with the number of the symptoms endorsed with a positive response serving as a measure of the extent to which autonomy over nicotine has been lost. The initial psychometric performance and concept validity of the HONC were evaluated in a 30-month study of 679 seventh-graders  (DiFranza et al., 2002) . Internal consistency reliability was .94, and construct validity was supported by its utility in prediction of failed cessation and tobacco use. Since then, the HONC was used in multiple studies and has performed well in terms of predictive  (Sledjeski et al., 2007; Wellman et al., 2008) , concurrent  (Wellman et al., 2008; Wellman et al., 2005) , and content  (Huang et al., 2009)  validity and reliability (Cronbach's alpha range: .83 to .89 among the four reviewed studies). Table  4  presents greater details on these findings.\n\nFactor analyses across studies yielded support for a single factor model  (DiFranza et al., 2002) , suggesting that the HONC is measuring one dimension of nicotine dependence  (Wellman et al., 2005; Wellman et al., 2008) . However, a study of the Chinese version of the HONC suggested a three-factor model  (Huang et al., 2009) . More investigative work is needed to examine this inconsistency."

      "text": "To begin evaluation, each measure was compared to the DSM-V criteria for tobacco use disorder, in order to arrive at a prospective measure of content validity  (Muehlig, 2011) . The FTND appeared to omit most of the key components of tobacco addiction, in particular, recurrent use resulting in failure to meet role obligations, continued use despite social or interpersonal problems, substance is often taken in larger amounts or over longer period than intended, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control substance use, excessive time allocation, and neglect of other activities, matching only the recurrent use in hazardous situations, withdrawal, use despite known harm, and the craving or a strong desire or urge to use criteria. The questions of the HONC also matched only four criteria of the DSM-V definition of tobacco use disorder: withdrawal, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control substance use, use despite known harm, and the craving or a strong desire or urge to use. The CDS, in its turn, reflected seven out of 11 DSM-V criteria and presented the most evidence for content validity among the three compared measures. Table  3  presents abbreviated items of the scales and their match (direct and indirect) to the DSM criteria.\n\nTable  4  presents reliability findings reported in selected peer-reviewed research studies. Information provided clearly demonstrates evidence in support of the CDS's (Cronbach's alpha range: .81 -.91) and the HONC's (Cronbach's alpha range: .83 -.89) internal consistency reliability, and points to the weakness of the FTND in this psychometric area (Cronbach's alpha range: .48 -.68). Also, evidence supporting validity of each measure is presented in Table  4 . Validity support is only consistent for the CDS and the HONC; and the FTND again demonstrates less than desirable validity findings."

However, closer evaluation revealed that the three measures selected are not equal in their psychometric properties and that each has its strengths and weaknesses. Two of the three measures have adequate support for internal consistency reliability, with the FTND falling considerably behind. Two of the measures have adequate evidence for validity, with the FTND yet again performing worse than the CDS and the HONC. The less than desirable psychometric performance of the FTND may be partially explained by the publication date of the original Fagerstr\u04e7m Tolerance Questionnaire (being prior to the DSM-IV publication, thus the major disagreement between the FTND and DSM-based measures)  (Etter, 2008) . The strongest overall measure appeared to be the CDS; however, it has a major limitation in this analysisits psychometric properties have not yet been supported with a college sample. Table  5  illustrates some of the major strengths and weaknesses of the three chosen measures of nicotine dependence."

      "text": "In summary, smoking addiction is a complex construct. Nicotine dependence is the most common way of operationalizing smoking addiction. There are multiple instruments to measure nicotine dependence that evaluate various attributes of nicotine dependence. For this reason, it is crucial for clinicians and researchers to properly identify their interest and review available empirical evidence regarding specific measures of their particular dimension of inquiry.\n\nTwo major issues with the selected nicotine dependence measures are the lack of consensus among researchers and practitioners regarding the definition of the construct (inherent across all nicotine dependence measures) and the lack of direct comparison studies among these three distinct measures. Although the evidence suggests that the CDS has the best indicators of reliability and validity, a universal recommendation for its use cannot be made until its psychometric properties are evaluated in a college sample and direct comparisons are made among the three selected instruments. Meanwhile, use of the HONC in a college population may be appropriate, as findings of two reviewed studies supported internal consistency reliability and concurrent and predictive validity in college students  (Sledjeski et al., 2007; Wellman, McMillen, & DiFranza, 2008) ."

      "text": "One of the major limitations is the minimal amount of the research (due to the limitations of the search databases used, restrictions on time of publication, etc.)\n\nincluded in the analysis of the three measures of nicotine dependence. A more thorough investigation may potentially yield different results. Therefore, no conclusive statements of one measure's superiority can be made at this time. Another limitation is the nature of inquiry. All of the self-reported measures chosen for the analysis ask people to report their global behavior, where as in real life, one's behavior may be heavily situational and not representative of the more general perception reflected in the questionnaires  (Mischel & Shoda, 1995) ."

      "title": "Recommendations for new directions in measurement",
      "text": "Numerous research studies focus on smoking addiction; however, no perfect instrument to measure this construct exists. Further research is needed to identify major attributes of smoking addiction and the ways to best assess it, reexamining centrality and dimensionality of the nicotine dependence construct. The new DSM-V offers promise by creating a continuum of tobacco use disorder (eliminating the two previously exclusive categories of nicotine abuse and nicotine dependence), considering that tobacco is known to kill up to half of those who use it as intended, harming everyone exposed to it  (WHO, 2008) . However, psychometric properties of available nicotine measurements are yet to be fully examined. Most importantly, yet, would be the issue of clinicians' understanding, endorsement, and integration of the smoking addiction measures in their practice to improve health outcomes of those affected by tobacco. For that to happen, not only a significant relationship is needed between the measure and the clinical outcome, but also a general congruence with a theoretical construct that the instrument is supposed to measure. More input from practitioners and researchers on the practical phenomena is warranted. A good example is issue of the nicotine dependence of a social smoker, who may never smoke daily or in the morning, yet consume a good amount of nicotine in social situations. To conclude, the future of the rigorous nicotine dependence measurement relies on inclusion of thorough psychometric reporting in each research publication -assessment of validity and reliability, and analysis of the ability of individual items and total score to predict smoking behavior."

Although the decrease in the number of people who smoke over the last decade is encouraging, 40 million Americans continue to smoke (CDC, 2015a).\n\nIn the US, cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product, accounting for over 90% of the total nicotine consumption (APA, 2013). Smoking harms almost every organ of the human body and causes more than 20% of all annual deaths in the US  (CDC, 2015b) . The economic burden of smoking on the US health care system is approximately $170 billion dollars or 1% of the gross domestic product (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, 2016b)."

      "text": "Cigarette smoking is a huge concern in the young adult population (CDC, 2015a).\n\nHealth risk behaviors of young adulthood have far-reaching effects. About 17% of young adults (18-24 years old) smoke cigarettes (CDC, 2015a\n\n). Of the 15 million young adults who attend colleges and universities in the US (United States Census Bureau, 2015), approximately 10% report smoking cigarettes (American College Health Association,  2016) . Cigarette smoking among college students presents a significant danger for health and well-being and poses consequences such as the loss of a decade of life  (Jha et al., 2013; Rigotti, Lee, & Wechsler, 2000) .\n\nQuitting smoking is a single most important health behavior change most individuals can make. The vast majority of the smoking research with college students has been epidemiological in nature. To date, there have been few behavioral interventions targeting smoking cessation among college students. Substance use disorders are at their peak among people aged 16 to 25 years  (Griffin & Botvin, 2010) . College campuses are prime locations for smoking cessation interventions for young adults, as college years are often the time when many adults either establish lifelong cigarette smoking or abandon it  (College Tobacco Prevention Resource, 2016) . Since adolescents and young adults are unlikely to seek cessation therapies  (Suls et al., 2012) , innovative smoking cessation interventions are essential to reach and engage this population. Integrating mobile technology may be a way to increase college students' participation in smoking cessation  (Orr & King, 2015) . There are no studies that examine adaptation of interactive motivational interviewing to text messages as a cessation intervention. Therefore, the purposes of this research were to test the effects of a novel, theory and evidence-based motivational interviewing intervention (iMI) in college students who smoke and to identify predictors of change in cigarette smoking behavior.\n\nA sound theoretical base is the foundation for any good health care intervention and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) was the foundation for this study. SDT is a broadbased motivational theory that focuses specifically on regulation of human motivation to engage in a healthy behavior  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . It proposes that all behaviors lie along a continuum of relative autonomy which reflects the extent to which a person fully endorses and is committed to a particular behavior  (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . SDT suggests that individuals' motivation to change is facilitated by the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness  (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan et al., 2008) .\n\nSDT has increasingly been cited in the health behavior change literature, and there is a growing number of randomized trials testing the efficacy of SDT-based interventions in the initiation and maintenance of behavioral changes  (Halvari & Halvari, 2006; Patrick & Williams, 2012; Williams & Deci, 2001; Williams, Niemiec, Patrick, Ryan, & Deci, 2009) . Evidence suggests that these interventions enhance the cognitive parameters of psychological needs satisfaction, autonomous motivation, smoking cessation self-efficacy, readiness to quit, and consequently promote positive behavioral outcomes  (Patrick & Williams, 2012; Ryan et al., 2008) .\n\nMotivational interviewing is a person-centered method of counseling to elicit and strengthen individual's motivation for a behavioral change  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) . It is often described as a communication approach in which difficulties of behavioral change and possibilities of engagement in healthier behavior are discussed in a respectful manner and in accord with client's own goals and values  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) . The technical definition of MI is: \"collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change \u2026 designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion\"  (Miller & Rollnick, 2013, p. 29) .\n\nThe MI approach to therapeutic change and the theoretical focus of Self-Determination Theory are both centered on the manner in which interventions are delivered, making the integration of the two not only possible but complementary  (Vansteenkiste & Sheldon, 2006) . From the SDT perspective, it is essential for the clinicians to help clients feel that they: (1) have autonomously chosen their behavior change, (  2 ) can succeed at it, and (3) connect with and trust clinician they are working with (and other significant people) while undergoing the change. All three goals are brought together through the application of motivational interviewing processes of engaging the client into a therapeutic alliance, focusing on the \"what\" and \"why\" of cigarette smoking, evoking arguments for change, and planning actions for smoking cessation  (Miller & Rollnick, 2013) .\n\nThe specific aims of this study were to:\n\n1. Test the effects of the iMI intervention on cognitive parameters of behavior regulation (psychological needs satisfaction, autonomous motivation, smoking self-efficacy, and readiness to quit) among college students who smoke."

The BNSG-S is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of 21 items related to satisfaction of the basic needs in life, in general. Respondents choose on a scale from 1 (not true at all) to 7 (definitely true) the extent to which they feel their psychological needs of autonomy (7 items), competence (6 items), and relatedness (8 items) are satisfied in their life, in general. The average of the item scores on each subscale represents the degree to which a person experiences satisfaction of that respective need, with higher scores representing greater psychological need satisfaction.\n\nIn general population, including college student samples, reliability was supported for the need for autonomy subscale (\u03b1 = .60, .65, .69) and for the need for relatedness subscale (Cronbach's alpha = .78, .82, .86) (Gagn\u00e9, 2003; Johnston & Finney, 2010; Molix & Nichols, 2013) .

The CDS-12 was developed based on signs indicative of addiction to cigarettes as reported by the smokers, systematic psychometric considerations, and addiction content coverage. The CDS-12 is a continuous self-reported measure composed of 12 items designed to assess the primary symptoms of nicotine dependence reflected by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria, except for tolerance  (Etter et al., 2003) . The items are both continuous and multiple choice (scores range from 1 to 5) and are scored using an algorithm, with total scores ranging from 12 (low dependence) to 60 (high dependence)  (Etter et al., 2003) . Studies in samples of the general population have reported good internal consistency reliability (\u03b1 = .84 -.91) and strong test-retest reliability (r = .83) of the measure  (Courvoisier & Etter, 2010; Etter, Le Houezec, Huguelet, & Etter, 2009; Rohsenow, Martin, Tidey, Monti, & Colby, 2013) . Predictive validity of the CDS-12 was evidenced by associations with later measures of abstinence, expired CO, readiness to quit, and number of cigarettes smoked. In addition, the CDS-12 has been successfully used in the young adult and college populations and is a promising tool for addiction assessment in the smoking behavior research  (Dean, Sugar, Hellemann, & London, 2011; Floyd, Westmaas, Targhetta, & Moyer, 2009; Kelemen & Fulton, 2008; Kelemen & Kaighobadi, 2007) ."

Eligible students were asked to review the preamble letter and complete the baseline survey. Referrals and information on free alternative services (such as Kentucky's Tobacco Quit Line, Cooper Clayton classes, SmokefreeTXT program, etc.) were offered to the students with active smoking status who met the exclusion criteria or chose not to participate and to the participants at the end of the study (Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, 2013). No eligible participant was excluded based on race or ethnicity, or sexual orientation. A total of 64 students with identified smoking status were screened, four students did not meet the study enrollment criteria, and 27 declined the invitation to take part in the research.\n\nParticipation was voluntary and the students who chose to participate received a $30 incentive through Chase Person-to-Person Quick Pay \u2122 for their time over the course of the study by providing their phone number or email address (JPMorgan  Chase & Co, 2013) .

The two predictors were retained by the final model, which explained 74% of the variance, suggesting that this group of variables can be used to reliably predict the cigarettes smoked per day by college students (F(2, 30) = 47, p < .05). Respective parameter estimates indicated that for every unit increase in the smoking cessation self-efficacy scores, students smoked a third of a cigarette less per day, holding the effect of baseline cigarettes smoked per day constant (Table  13 ).\n\nTo summarize the results, participation in the intervention yielded a significant reduction in students' rate of daily smoking (cigarettes per day) over time, although, it had no effect on students' severity of nicotine addiction. Participation in the intervention was also successful in modifying four of the cognitive parameters of smoking behavior regulation by significantly increasing students' level of autonomy need satisfaction, relatedness need satisfaction, autonomous motivation, and smoking cessation selfefficacy. However, it had no positive effect on competence need satisfaction or readiness to quit smoking. Smoking cessation self-efficacy was identified as the strongest behavior regulation predictor of the smoking behavior in college students."

      "text": "This exploratory trial of a novel smoking cessation intervention demonstrated that a theory-driven, text message-based motivational intervention was an effective approach to smoking reduction in college smokers. This innovative method offers a new way of treatment delivery for hard-to-reach populations. The major outcome (reduction in cigarettes smoked per day) is consistent with available evidence on the effects of other technology-assisted smoking cessation interventions in young adults  (Brown, 2013) .\n\nThe findings support the role of the cognitive parameters of behavior regulation component of the Self-Determination Theory and suggest that self-efficacy played a prominent role specific to smoking behavior. The results showed that smoking cessation self-efficacy was uniquely and negatively related to smoking behavior. This finding is consistent with recent research in college population on factors influencing smoking behavior  (Kim & Hong, 2016; Mee, 2014) . College students' cigarette smoking reduces the more they feel capable of refraining from smoking in situations that trigger the urge to smoke. Interventions capable of targeting this interaction hold great promise for smoking cessation in young adults.\n\nSelf-efficacy is a robust predictor of various health behaviors including smoking and is often used as a proxy marker for it. General self-efficacy has been identified as a determinant of college students' initial cigarette smoking experience and the subsequent future risk of being a regular smoker  (Menati et al., 2016) . Smoking cessation selfefficacy had negative relationship with college students' nicotine dependence  (Kim & Hong, 2016) , smoking behavior  (Mee, 2014) , and mediated the relationship between depression and smoking  (Mee, 2014) . Among young adults, smoking cessation selfefficacy was a strong predictor of future smoking status and it mediated protective effects of exercise on smoking behavior  (Loprinzi, Wolfe, & Walker, 2015) . Increased selfefficacy may influence smoking cessation preparedness thereby increasing the readiness to quit and the rate of cessation, even in those who do not initially respond to treatment  (Burns et al., 2016) . In general adult population, smoking cessation self-efficacy mediated the effect of smoking urges on cigarette use  (Blevins, Farris, Brown, Strong, & Abrantes, 2016)  and the effects of craving on smoking abstinence  (Berndt et al., 2013) . It can be used to predict intention to quit  (de Hoog et al., 2016) , number of cigarettes smoked per day  (Berli et al., 2015)  and continued abstinence  (Schnoll et al., 2011) . In adolescents, self-efficacy not only mediated the impact of change in the social environment on smoking behavior, but it was the strongest risk factor for smoking  (Gao, Li, Chan, Lau, & Griffiths, 2013) . In the study of acupressure on smoking cessation in college students, smoking cessation self-efficacy increased students' abstinence  (Lee & Park, 2016) . These findings support self-efficacy as the key underpinning of smoking behavior and make it a useful target for smoking cessation interventions.\n\nAssessing college students' smoking cessation self-efficacy is key to identify those at risk for more difficult cessation progress. Identifying low smoking cessation selfefficacy allows clinician to target ways to indirectly address unhealthy behavior by increasing individual's self-efficacy necessary to abstain from it. College students who identify the need to improve their smoking cessation self-efficacy may be more responsive to recruitment into cessation programs. However, in order to develop maximally effective interventions, more research on determinants and development of smoking cessation self-efficacy is needed, including a more thorough examination of the relationship between smoking behavior regulation and self-efficacy.\n\nWhile it is clear that smoking behavior regulation predicts cigarette use by the college students, a larger sample is needed to determine the smoking cessation self-efficacy mechanism involved in behavior regulation, to clarify its effect on smoking behavior. To develop appropriate intervention strategies, it is important to better understand how and to what degree each cognitive parameter of smoking behavior regulation makes a contribution to college student smoking.\n\nOverall, the findings of this research may offer a novel clinical approach for reaching and treating college smokers. Further research investigating the effects of mobile smoking cessation self-efficacy-focused interventions in college student may eventually yield broader clinical applications which will help reduce the public health burden associated with cigarette smoking."

      "text": "The major limitations of this study are the sample selection and the self-report nature of the data. A convenience sampling may have led to bias due to underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain subgroups of the study population, thus affecting generalizability of the research findings to a larger young adult population  (Polit & Beck, 2012) . In addition, those who chose to participate may systematically have been different from those who did not.\n\nThe lack of control group and short follow-up assessment (potential overestimation of the effect of the intervention) warrant caution in interpretation of the results. Although participants were largely representative of the selected college population in racial diversity, they were primarily Caucasian, limiting the ability to generalize the findings to minority populations as well as those not enrolled in the large, metropolitan university. The self-report instruments that were used could also introduce the risk of a social desirability bias  (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002) .\n\nMajor strengths of this study include its prospective design, theoretical grounding, and the sample representative of the study population. The baseline characteristics and cigarette consumption of the study sample are consistent with other research of college students who smoke  (Brown, 2013) . The theoretical foundation used in the design and implementation of the intervention added to the scientific rigor of the research. None of the participants were lost to follow-up, which may be due to acceptability of this novel intervention. In addition, the study used a relatively inexpensive and widely available technology.\n\nFuture studies should include a 6-month follow-up to capture the true long-term effect of the intervention."

      "text": "There is an urgent need for an affordable, age-appropriate, personalized, effective,    likely to get addicted to nicotine, become lifetime smokers, suffer from lower quality of life and die prematurely due to one of the many chronic diseases (Figure  5 ) developed due to their cigarette smoking  (Mehta, Desai, & Patel, 2016) .\n\nIn addition to the physical consequences of smoking, there are also psychological and social outcomes related to it. Smoking has been long-linked to emotional psychopathology  (Leventhal & Zvolensky, 2015) , with any level of nicotine being associated with greater risk for depression  (Park, Romer, & Lim, 2013) , alcohol and drug abuse  (Berg, Wen, Cummings, Ahluwalia, & Druss, 2013) , panic attacks  (Bakhshaie, Zvolensky, & Goodwin, 2016) , lower health-related quality of life  (Schane, Ling, & Glantz, 2010) , and an increased risk for completed suicide  (Li et al., 2012) . People who smoke tend to be more stressed, less educated, have lower socioeconomic status, and lower levels of social support  (Pampel, Krueger, & Denney, 2010) . Recent systematic review and meta-analysis further confirmed the association of smoking and poor mental health outcomes  (Taylor et al., 2014) .\n\nAmong college students, there is also evidence of association between smoking and poor academic achievement  (Latvala et al., 2014) . Institutional policies and mainstream anti-smoking campaigns are providing only short term fixes to the rate of college student smoking. The challenge for colleges is to identify ways to encourage students to make steps in the direction of cessation immediately instead of \"in a few years\"  (Waters et al., 2016, p. 4 ). To ensure a meaningful movement towards complete cessation, the long-term solution lies in identifying and incorporating the factors that significantly influence college students' cigarette smoking behavior into the smoking cessation interventions that are specifically designed for this young adult population.\n\nOver time, bringing together research and clinical practice could significantly impact college student smoking behavior.\n\nOne counseling technique that has being increasingly used by the clinicians and researchers to promote smoking cessation is motivational interviewing (MI). MI is a person-centered counseling method used to elicit and strengthen person's motivation for a behavioral change  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) . MI builds on a discussion of the difficulties of behavioral change and possibilities of engagement in healthier behavior in accord with client's own goals and values  (Miller & Rollnick, 2002) . In the 2013 smoking cessation update, a review of the current clinical cessation evidence concluded that MI strategies were effective in increasing quit attempts among smokers  (Miranda, Ruiz, & Rebollo, 2013) . The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence cite MI as having the highest level of support for clients not ready to make a quit attempt  (Fiore et al., 2008)  and substance use research suggests its compatibility with developmental needs of emerging adulthood stage of college students  (Scholl & Schmitt, 2009) . Although the use of MI is recommended by the USPHS Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence  (Fiore et al., 2008) , research suggests only a partial adherence to this recommendation within college student health centers (only 22% of clinicians reported always or usually using MI in their smoking student encounters)  (McNamara et al., 2015) . MI was also integrated in only two smoking cessation studies conducted in the past five years in a college setting  (McCambridge, Hunt, Jenkins, & Strang, 2011; Pardavila-Belio et al., 2015) , and the findings were conflicting. Health care providers cite the lack of student interest in participation in smoking cessation counseling as the primary barrier to tobacco use interventions  (McNamara et al., 2015) . This evidence calls for further investigation of new ways for MI delivery in college students.\n\nAdvances in cell phone technology present novel solutions to expanding the range of health care delivery  (Luxton, McCann, Bush, Mishkind, & Reger, 2011) . Mobile phones offer a comfortable environment for an intervention, as the person is already familiar with operating their phone and does not have to be subjected to artificial surroundings of a health care facility  (Verster, Tiplady, & McKinney, 2012) . To better fit the diverse needs and changing lifestyles of young adults (an increasingly mobile and tech-savvy population), health care has been slowly moving beyond the traditional officebased setting to be more accessible, interactive, and efficient. Researchers have successfully used text messaging in smoking cessation interventions in adolescents  (Militello, Kelly, & Melnyk, 2012) , young adults  (Bock, Heron, Jennings, Magee, & Morrow, 2013; Devries, Kenward, & Free, 2013; Free et al., 2011; Haug, Meyer, Schorr, Bauer, & John, 2009; Ybarra, Holtrop, Prescott, Rahbar, & Strong, 2013) , and college students  (Obermayer, Riley, Asif, & Jean-Mary, 2004) . There were no studies, however, that examined application of smoking cessation-focused MI through text messaging in college students.\n\nCombining text messaging and motivational interviewing in a smoking cessation intervention for college students adds greatly to the science and has the potential to decrease smoking and health care costs. Even a small improvement in smoking behavior could have major impact on public health (WHO, 2013a). Addressing smoking behavior early in its trajectory is crucial for avoiding smoking-related diseases and clinically significant pathophysiology. Providing effective cessation services requires a thorough understanding and assessment of the factors that affect smoking behavior. Chapter Three stressed the importance of a thorough psychometric reporting of smoking behavior instruments, as it would allow researchers to evaluate their utility for specific samples of the population and to derive accurate and meaningful results. Specifically, the lack of consensus for the measurement of nicotine dependence, which is often included in the smoking behavior research, demonstrates the challenge of measuring this latent construct.\n\nThe task of identifying appropriate measures to be used in a research with a small sample size is even more difficult.\n\nFurther development of the conceptual understanding of smoking behavior as well as testing of current and future instruments designed to capture the critical latent constructs in large and representative samples of college students is necessary. Currently, the Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS-12) is the most recommended measure of nicotine dependence (reliability and validity support reported across different populations), yet the reports of its psychometric evaluation in college samples are lacking so that caution should be exercised when using this instrument.\n\nAs mostly occasional smokers, college students may not see the mainstream smoking cessation programs as appealing to them, even though many of them may be developing nicotine addiction. Chapter Four addressed the need for an innovative approach to smoking behavior intervention for college students. The results of this novel study provided some important preliminary information about college student smoking and opportunities for smoking behavior interventions on college campuses. The integration of motivational interviewing into a text message platform showed promise for smoking behavior change in college students.\n\nThe mean number of cigarettes students smoked per day at baseline (9\u00b17) was reduced by the end of the study (5\u00b15), and this change was statistically significant (p< .05). This finding of the effect of the motivational interviewing on smoking behavior is consistent with previously published research that used motivational interviewing as a part of a multi-component intervention for smoking cessation in college students, where the mean of daily cigarettes was reduced from baseline (10) to the end (8) of the study (p< .05) (Pardavila-Belio et al., 2015) .\n\nStudy findings also revealed that students with higher smoking cessation selfefficacy were smoking less per day at 2-week follow-up post-intervention, after controlling for the baseline number of cigarettes smoked per day (p< .05). The relationship between smoking and smoking cessation self-efficacy is corroborated with previous research in college students  (Lee, Catley, & Harris, 2014; Mee, 2014)  and young adults  (Loprinzi et al., 2015) .\n\nInterestingly, study participants' competence need satisfaction did not change over the course of the intervention, yet their smoking cessation self-efficacy did. This finding points to the need for a deeper theoretical evaluation. In its conceptual essence, competence refers to the capacity of a person to accomplish a specific goal  (Valloze, 2009) , whereas self-efficacy is one's belief in that capacity  (Zulkosky, 2009) . It may be that the belief in personal capacity to refrain from smoking is not always reflective of the capacity not to smoke. In fact, one may believe that he or she can quit smoking before attempting cessation, but failure to succeed is more of a measure of ability to abstain from cigarettes rather than the belief in it. One needs to attempt cessation at least once to get a sense of competent quitting ability, and for many students, who are still early in their smoking career, that simply might not yet have been the case. Additionally, survey research is unable to truly capture the objective reality and the fact that two other basic psychological needs are characterized by the subjective experience further supports the need to use the concept of self-efficacy rather than the concept of competence, which is proposed by Self-Determination Theory, for theoretical clarity and internal consistency of behavioral research."

Considering the popularity of text-messaging among young adults (97% of 18 -24-year-olds exchange on average 110 text messages per day) (Pew Research Center, 2011) and minorities (African Americans and Hispanics) use the textmessage twice as much as Caucasians  (Lenhart, 2010) , this type of technology should be further investigated for ways to deliver evidence-based smoking cessation interventions.\n\nThis study used an individual-level intervention delivery; future research can explore alternative approaches such as group setting, automated algorithms, video messaging, etc.\n\nto deliver the intervention. In addition, this intervention could be developed for other risk taking behaviors such as alcohol and illicit drug use.\n\nIn order to increase the number of providers delivering MI interventions, MI training must be incorporated into the curricula for health care providers. For those previously trained, there is a great need for refresher courses. The Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT) could serve as a resource for many of these training  (Rollnick et al., 2008) . It also is imperative that there is institutional support for the health care providers to deliver smoking cessation beyond the traditional office advice to stop smoking. Delivering messages using the MI RULE -(Resisting the righting reflex, Understanding clients' motivation, Listening and Empowering) enables clients to take charge of their lives and their health  (Rollnick et al., 2008) .\n\nSmoking among young adults is a complex behavior motivated by a myriad of factors. Self-efficacy is arguably the most predictive  (Williams & Rhodes, 2016)    Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015."
