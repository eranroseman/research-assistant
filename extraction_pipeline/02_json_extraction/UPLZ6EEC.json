      "text": "Physical activity is a very significant issue for persons with SCI and the proposal initiative represents a well-designed pilot bringing forward an innovative use of adaptive trial design which will enable a somewhat personalized approach for this issue. Adaptive trial designs seem to be a particularly useful approach to overcome some of the significant challenges for mounting physical activity trials in persons with SCI. Most notably, the potential for personalizing / tailoring interventions with this approach and still include the capability for a controlled experimental approach is a significant advance for the field. The proposed approach is an early attempt at incorporating these methods and should provide significant learnings for the further development of this approach."

Several behavioural components are embedded in the both the interventional approach as well as the evaluative components which aligns well with the PSR portfolio. : This is a strong team bringing together a junior investigator showing promise along with an established mentor working within a setting that is state of the art and a leader in the field. There is a good track record between the 2 investigators featured on the application and also a solid support staff (i.e., biostatistician, technical support, exercise leaders, qualitative researcher, albeit the latter is junior and the description of qualitative methods was somewhat lacking in the proposal)."

And/or is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? :\n\nThe key innovation lies in bringing together various behavioural approaches within an adaptive trial methodology where both the intervention and the evaluation is enabled through remote technologies.\n\nIn particular, the adaptive trial methodology, as a means to support generation of research evidence for physical activity is an innovation that is important for the field in terms of developing more personalized approaches to enhancing physical activity participation. APPROACH 1. Is the project well-suited to the Pilot stage? Are the future applicability or next steps after the Pilot work discussed (i.e., does this research help lay the groundwork for future studies or describe plans for the dissemination and translation of knowledge that will impact current practices and approaches)? 2. Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific Aims of the project, within the proposed project period and by the project team described? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? 3. If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed adequately? The initiative is well-suited to the pilot stage. It is based on prior work (including recent work supported by Neilsen Foundation) into a comprehensive intervention that will be further developed and tested as a pilot. The methodology appears sound and well-suited to the pilot and there are several plans and mitigation strategies suggested to address feasibility for a successful trial. The SMART -adaptive trial design for tailoring the exercise program is innovative and well suited to overcoming traditional challenges associated with most physical activity trials. In addition, the trial incorporates virtual assessments and intervention which both accommodates the realities of the pandemic, but also addresses challenges with in-person trials with respect to retention and overcoming barriers to participation and eventual reach of the intervention. In general, this is a well-described, logical research design. There is clarity in describing how the underlying theoretical basis (social cognitive theory) is operationalized in the Move 2 Music exercise intervention i.e., these constructs are embedded through the coaching and social networking approach. Additionally, there is attention paid to incorporating several behavioural features within the intervention (i.e., motivational interviewing).\n\nThe data analysis plan for secondary measures lacking (e.g., what is going to be done with Actigraph data?).

      "text": "The investigators have all the resources and support needed to conduct this initiative successfully. There is ample evidence within this environment of successfully implementing large research trials -and in particular all resources are in place along with a strong track record of supporting both physical activity trials including those that incorporate remote technologies. If anything, the description on facilities and resources, albeit impressive, seems a little excessive, especially given little emphasis is placed on what the secondary data analyses are actually going to consist of beyond looking at the primary outcomes associated with feasibility, acceptance, etc. (i.e., for both qualitative and quantitative secondary measures). Significant strengths of the application include a clinically significant issue (physical inactivity), innovation (tailored design), a well-designed, theory-based approach, and strong senior scientific leadership. Weaknesses of the application include a relatively junior PI, though this project will help establish a junior PI's research program. The project has the potential for \"high gain\" to balance risk. The project's scope is suited to the funding level and has the potential to be an important contribution to the field of SCI psychosocial research. This project addresses an important problem or a critical barrier in the field, limited uptake of physical activity by people with SCI. In part, this stems from people with SCI being understudied with regard to effective interventions that are tailored to their needs and replicable in home environments. Data from this pilot study will inform an R01 application for funding to assess the implementation and efficacy of a full-scale SMART of this adaptive exercise intervention among people with SCI. If the Aims of the project are achieved, this work is likely to change or enhance current methods, technologies, treatments, services, and interventions"

      "text": "This project is relevant to the mission of the Neilsen Foundation by exploring ways to increase the physical activity of people with SCI, and in turn, improve health and quality of life of adults with SCI. This project relevant to the goal of the PSR portfolio with its behavioral focus. This study demonstrates innovation by pilot testing a SMART design for a telehealth exercise program for people with SCI. It applies concepts, approaches, instrumentation, or interventions from another field of research to SCI. The study seeks to increase enrollment in, adherence to, and sustainability of an exercise trial in people with SCI using an innovative study design that has not been used to evaluate exercise adherence in persons with SCI. Compared with one-size-fits-all approach to interventions developed to improve health behaviors, adaptive designs can improve adherence, and SMART designs help identify the programmatic variations that can optimize the adaptive intervention. The study uses a rigorous home-based assessments for data collection, avoiding transportation barriers. APPROACH 1. Is the project well-suited to the Pilot stage?

Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? 3. If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed adequately? The project is well-suited to the Pilot stage. The applicant provides preliminary data which helps set the stage for the proposed pilot study. The design is based on social cognitive theory, and operationalizes key constructs in the study design and instrumentation. The project proceeds in a logical manner by conducting a 12-week pilot study of an intervention with 30 individuals with SCI that includes an adapted exercise program, instructor-led, individualized training, behavioral coaching, and social networking support. Participants will be randomized to either 4 weeks or 8 weeks of a novel adapted exercise program (Movement to Music [M2M]) with social networking support in order to assess the length of the first intervention stage. After the assigned period, participants with high intervention adherence will continue on the same program for the balance of the 12-weeks. Those with low adherence will be randomized to either an augmented arm that includes individualized behavioral coaching or to M2M Live, a modified version of M2M that involves one-on-one teleexercise training, allowing for immediate feedback and accountability. The applicant will collect self-report and physiological measures to assess completion rates and conduct semi-structured interviews to assess perceived satisfaction and enjoyment. The applicant discusses the applicability of findings after the Pilot work is completed, thus laying the groundwork for future studies. The overall strategy, methodology, and analyses are well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific Aims of the project, within the proposed project period and by the project team. The applicant discusses potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success. The proposal includes a project timeline that includes time for study start-up and sufficient subject recruitment. The start-up plan adequately addresses regulatory approval. It appears that the study will use some of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Common Data Elements, though they are not identified specifically. ENVIRONMENT 1.
