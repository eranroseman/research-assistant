  "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that affects between 1% to 2% of individuals and causes considerable impairment and disability. Although . 50% of individuals experience symptom onset in childhood, symptoms can continue to develop throughout adulthood. Accurate and timely assessment of clinical presentation is critical to limit impairment and improve prognosis. Presently, there are 2 empirically supported treatments available for OCD in children and adults, namely cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This article provides an introduction to the phenomenology, etiology, and clinical course of OCD. Assessment practices used to evaluate symptom severity are described, and evidence-based treatment options are reviewed, with appropriate distinctions drawn between children and adults. Finally, recommendations for assessment and treatment practices for OCD are explicated.",

This article serves as a primer on the phenomenology, etiology, clinical course, and comorbid conditions associated with OCD. Additionally, assessment modalities and evidence-based treatment options are reviewed. Because there are differences in clinical presentation between children and adults, distinctions are addressed when appropriate. This article concludes with practical recommendations on the assessment and treatment of OCD and highlights aspects that are integral to improving patient outcomes."

      "title": "Phenomenology",
      "text": "Traditionally conceptualized as an anxiety disorder, OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions that are time-consuming and cause distress and/or interference. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced as inappropriate, intrusive, and distressing. Intrusive thoughts are frequently reported by nonclinical samples of children (77%-85%)  8, 9  and adults (80%-88%).  10, 11 However, obsessions experienced by patients with OCD differ from those encountered by nonclinical populations in terms of the extent of distress, time lost, or impairment. Common obsessions in patients with OCD include contamination fears (eg, dirt, germs, chemicals), fear of harm to self or others, preoccupations with symmetry, exactness, or order, excessive concerns regarding religious or moral conduct (eg, fear of committing a sin, breaking rules, or displeasing God), fixations with lucky or unlucky numbers, or forbidden sexual, aggressive, or violent thoughts or images.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  Although these individuals are highly unlikely to act out on obsessive thoughts, they produce considerable distress and frustration.\n\nIn response to obsession-related distress, individuals with OCD engage in repetitive behaviors or mental acts called compulsions to provide temporary relief by neutralizing the fear. Compulsions are generally excessive and repetitive (eg, washing hands 25 times after touching a \"contaminant\"), cause considerable impairment, and/or are irrational means of preventing feared outcomes evoked by obsessions (eg, avoid stepping on cracks to save mother's back). Commonly endorsed compulsions include decontamination rituals (eg, excessive washing, bathing, or cleaning), checking (eg, doors, locks, homework), counting, repeating, and straightening.  [12] [13] ] [14]  Other rituals may include confessing/praying, reassurance seeking, touching, tapping, and rubbing, measures to prevent harm to self or others, and hoarding.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  Individuals with OCD tend to have several obsessions and compulsions, with certain obsessions linked to the performance of specific compulsions (eg, fears of contamination with washing rituals). As opposed to performing compulsions to alleviate or prevent distressing obsessions, individuals may actively avoid antecedents that precipitate obsessions or compulsions. Avoidance is relatively frequent in patients with OCD  [14] [15] [16]  and is directly associated with symptom severity and overall clinical severity.  17 lthough obsessive-compulsive symptoms are heterogeneous across patients, symptoms appear to cluster together to form identifiable dimensional categories. Patients may endorse symptoms on several symptom dimensions, with a preponderance of symptoms falling into 1 or more dimensional groupings that are relatively stable across the lifespan.  18, 19 Four primary obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions have been noted: 1) symmetry, which includes symmetry obsessions and ordering, repeating, and counting compulsions; 2) forbidden thoughts, which include aggression, sexual and/or religious obsessions, and checking; 3) cleaning, which includes contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions; and 4) hoarding, which includes hoarding-specific obsessions and compulsions. Symptom dimensions have been associated with distinct patterns of psychiatric comorbidity, 20 heritability,  21, 22  and patterns of neural activity, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.  23 Moreover, specific symptom dimensions have been associated with differential response to pharmacologic (Table  1 )  24, 25  and nonpharmacologic (Table  2 ) treatments,  26, 27  as well as decreased likelihood of symptom remission in adulthood.  28"

      "title": "Etiology",
      "text": "A definitive account of the etiology of OCD is not yet available, although most agree that it is multifactorial. Several prevailing theories regarding the onset and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive symptoms are described below, including neurobiological, genetic, and cognitive-behavioral perspectives. Although there is a growing literature on the neurobiology of OCD, replications of study findings are relatively limited. A wide range of biological models have proposed that the development and maintenance of obsessivecompulsive symptoms are linked to abnormal functioning of brain regions, specifically dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), frontal cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus.  [29] [30] ] [31] [32]  However, a meta-analysis of 13 functional neuroimaging studies found that differences between patients with OCD and controls were not replicated.  31 n light of the potential brain regions implicated in OCD (eg, OFC, thalamus, and ACC), there has been interest in exploring the role of the basal ganglia, particularly the dysfunction of cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuits.  33, 34 he CSTC model suggests that obsessive-compulsive symptoms develop from dysfunctional pathways that connect the caudate nucleus, OFC, and ACC (see Del Casale et al  35  for a comprehensive review). This model suggests that \"direct\" and \"indirect\" pathways through the basal ganglia account for excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively. Imaging studies in patients with OCD indicate that the OFC, ACC, and caudate nucleus are hyperactive at rest, become more active under symptom provocation, and show less activity following treatment.  29, 30, 33 As there are multiple circuits connecting these regions, a deficit may be present at any point in the pathway, triggering dysfunction in other connected areas.  29, 30 This may account for the heterogeneous symptomatic presentation observed in patients with OCD. Neuropsychological functioning affected by these CSTC circuits is involved in decision making, learning, and adaptive functioning, all of which have been suggested as being impaired in patients with OCD (eg, deficits in set shifting abilities, decision making, and learning).  36, 37 Lending further support to this model are the findings that successful treatment of OCD is associated with attenuation of abnormal regional brain activity within the OFC, ACC, and caudate nucleus.  [38] [39] ] [40] [41]  Obsessive-compulsive disorder appears to have a genetic component, which has been shown by an increased risk in both twin studies and in first-degree relatives of patients with OCD.  42, 43 Prevalence rates in first-degree relatives vary across studies (10%-35%), with lifetime prevalence of OCD being significantly higher in case (22.5%) rather than control (2.6%) first-degree relatives.  [43] [44] 4] [45]  Familial risk appears to be much greater for childhood-onset OCD compared with adult-onset OCD.  46 More than 80 candidate gene studies have been conducted, with a predominant emphasis on genes in the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. However, none of the identified candidates have achieved genome-wide significance or produced consistent replicated findings.  47 The glutamate transporter gene (SLC1 A1) on 9p24 has shown early promise of exhibiting a replicable finding in genetic association studies of patients with OCD.  48, 49 n addition to neurobiological and genetic perspectives, OCD etiology can be explicated using behavioral and cognitive models. Two types of conditioning processes occur in the development of OCD. The behavioral model suggests\n\nTable 1.

The reduction in anxiety/distress (known as negative reinforcement) maintains the compulsive behaviors via operant conditioning. In a complementary fashion, cognitive models of OCD suggest that obsessive symptoms develop from dysfunctional cognitive beliefs (eg, inflated sense of responsibility, overestimation of threats) that lead to misappraisal and misinterpretation of intrusive thoughts or stimuli.  [51] [52] 2] [53]  These misappraisals and misinterpretations cause patients to experience increased distress and anxiety, which result in attempts to control, suppress, or neutralize these thoughts or to prevent harmful consequences by initiating ritualized behaviors or avoidance.  51, 54 Notably, this cognitive paradigm may not be universally applicable to patients with OCD, as many of them experience feelings of disgust  55  and \"not-just-right\" feelings as motivations for compulsive rituals.  56, 57 Although it is likely that both conceptualizations are involved in the development and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, the behavioral model has served as the basis for empirically supported psychotherapy treatments.  58 he development of OCD is likely due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental processes. Many environmental influences have been reported to influence the onset of OCD, including neurological illnesses, trauma, medical illness, and infections.  59 One example, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS), has received considerable debate and recent attention.  60 Briefly, PANDAS refers to childhoodonset OCD (or tic disorders) with abrupt onset or an episodic symptom course, in which symptom onset or exacerbation is temporally associated with infection with Group A Streptococcus (GAS).  61 However, establishing a clear and definitive causal role of GAS infections has proven difficult, in part because GAS infections are so common in childhood, and other infectious triggers may play a role.  60, 62 In the end, as these pathogenic models are not mutually exclusionary, there may be several contributing factors that lead to the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms."

First, these comorbid conditions may be associated with additional functional impairment beyond the obsessive-compulsive symptoms alone.  3, 71, 86 Second, certain comorbid conditions may attenuate response to psychotherapy  87, 88  and/or pharmacotherapy.  89 Third, the presence of certain comorbidities may require sequential or concurrent treatment in addition to addressing obsessive-compulsive symptoms. For example, severe depressive symptoms or externalizing problems may require initial treatment so that patients can adequately engage in strategies to treat OCD. Finally, the presence of certain comorbidities may provide information about clinical course for a patient. For instance, the presence of childhood tic disorders has been associated with a greater likelihood of obsessive-compulsive symptom remission in later adulthood.  28"

When symptoms are suspected, an initial evaluation should include an assessment of current and past OCD symptoms, current symptom severity, associated functional impairment, and psychiatric comorbidity.  90 If the patient does not recognize that the obsessivecompulsive symptoms are excessive or unreasonable, poor insight into symptoms should be specified in the diagnosis, which has implications for clinical severity and treatment outcome.  91, 92 eyond the unstructured clinical interview, several assessment options exist. Structured diagnostic interviews may aid in the diagnosis of OCD and its comorbid conditions. Examples include the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV),  93  the Kiddie-SADS-Present and Lifetime Version,  94  and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedules for adults,  95  as well as parents and children.  96 lthough comprehensive, structured diagnostic interviews are time-intensive and costly, resulting in their infrequent use in regular clinical practice."

The Y-BOCS/Y-BOCS-II has excellent reliability and validity,  14, [97] [98] [99] [100]  with symptom severity reductions between 30% to 45% corresponding with ratings of clinically meaningful improvement.  101, 102 Beyond clinician-rated measures, self-report questionnaires can be used as brief alternatives to assess symptom presence and severity. Self-report questionnaires, such as the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised,  103  Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Self-Report,  104  and the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory,  13  offer informative and reliable ratings of symptom presence and severity (see Benito and Storch 105 for a review of rating scales).\n\nAs children are often secretive about their symptoms and may have limited insight, evaluations for youth should include perspectives from multiple informants. 106,107 Moreover, multiple informants help to distinguish obsessivecompulsive symptoms from normative, ritualistic behaviors in early childhood. The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) is a clinician-administered rating scale that assesses the presence and severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. 108,109 Ratings of symptom severity reductions around 25% correspond with clinically meaningful improvement.  110 In line with multi-informant practices, parent-and child-report measures are often both used. The Children's Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Parent and Child reports 111 assess parent-and self-rated symptom presence and severity. Other child-report measures used to assess current symptom severity include the Children's Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory 112 and the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Child Version 113 (see Merlo et al 114 for a review of child rating scales)."

      "title": "Treatment",
      "text": "There are 2 evidence-based treatment options for OCD: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a first-line treatment with robust efficacy in treating obsessive-compulsive symptoms in both children and adults.  [115] [116] 6] [117] [118]  It is recommended as the initial choice of treatment for children and adults with symptoms of mild to moderate severity.  106, 119 If symptom severity persists after CBT, evidence-based pharmacotherapy presents another first-line treatment option that is often more accessible than CBT and yields significant reductions in symptom severity. Children and adults who present with symptoms of moderate to severe severity should initially receive both CBT and evidence-based pharmacotherapy.  106, 119 For adults with severe symptom severity, evidence-based pharmacotherapy is recommended as the initial treatment followed by a trial of CBT.  119, 120 T Cognitive-behavioral therapy for OCD can consist of varied components, such as psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and parental involvement.  121 Although there is some support for cognitive therapy alone for the treatment of OCD, 122 the predominant therapeutic component relied on in CBT is behavioral, namely exposure and response prevention. The exposure component requires the patient to repeatedly encounter situational and/or internal triggers to their anxiety, which usually precipitate their compulsive behaviors. While completing these exposures, patients must resist engaging in compulsions until habituation to the anxious state is achieved. As patients habituate to feared stimuli, distress and associated desire to ritualize diminishes. For example, a patient who experiences contamination fears and compulsive washing rituals would be required to touch perceived \"contaminated\" objects (eg, doorknobs that have been touched by multiple individuals) while refraining from cleansing behaviors that function to neutralize his or her fear. Although it may take several therapy sessions before observable improvement is achieved, considerable symptom severity reductions are regularly endorsed across randomized studies 118,123 (Table  2 ). Although CBT typically occurs on a once-or twice-weekly basis, intensive (daily) CBT produces similar symptom reductions, achieves meaningful response in less overall time,  117, 124, 125  and may be particularly helpful for those who do not respond to pharmacotherapy and/or less intensive psychotherapy.  126"

      "text": "Although CBT has demonstrated lasting improvements for up to 7 years, 127,128 CBT response and delivery can be impeded by patient noncompliance, attrition, and limited access to trained providers. While these challenges impact the use of psychotherapy across many psychiatric disorders, innovative solutions are being explored to address these issues. For example, positive treatment expectations and homework compliance are key aspects of CBT that predict treatment response.  129 However, exposure therapy and accompanying homework can sometimes prove challenging to patients, which, in turn, can precipitate noncompliance with therapeutic exposures and discontinuation of treatment. For these challenged patients, the addition of motivational interview-ing to CBT may increase the compliance with exposures by clarifying intrinsic motivation to change behaviors and reduce treatment ambivalence.  130, 131 imited access to cognitive-behavioral treatments is a relatively common problem for patients with anxiety disorders. Emerging technologies (eg, video conferencing, the internet) have demonstrated promise at increasing access for patients by delivering CBT across considerable distances.  132  recent study found significant symptom severity reductions when using a web camera to deliver CBT to pediatric OCD patients.  133 These findings hold considerable promise for treatment dissemination. Before encouraging the widespread practice of web-based CBT, further clarification of ethical issues related to telemedicine across state and country borders is needed, along with a larger trial replicating these results.  133"

Currently, 5 SRIs-clomipramine, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine-have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults, with 4 of these-clomipramine, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and sertraline-receiving approval for treatment of children and adolescents with OCD.\n\nClomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, was the first pharmacological agent to demonstrate efficacy in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  137, 138 Despite its therapeutic benefit (Table  1 ), clomipramine is accompanied by potential cardiovascular complications, anticholinergic effects (eg, dry mouth, headaches, increased heart rate), sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction, which limit its tolerability.  137 Despite its tolerability concerns and associated risks, meta-analyses suggest that clomipramine may be more efficacious than SSRIs in reducing symptom severity.  89, 116, 139 However, direct-comparison clinical trials with fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have failed to detect a difference in efficacy.  140, 141 lective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram) increase synaptic serotonin concentrations by inhibiting its reuptake into the presynaptic neuron. The efficacy of SSRIs is well established in the treatment of OCD, with variable reductions in symptom severity for each specific pharmacological agent (Table  1 ). These symptom severity reductions should be considered against reductions observed with placebo in children (2.3-5.3 on the CY-BOCS)  138, 142  and adults (0.20-5.0 on the Y-BOCS).  143, 144 Although there appears to be no systematic efficacy differences between specific SSRI medications,  116, 145  individual patients may respond to or tolerate 1 SSRI instead of another.  119 In the absence of an adverse reaction, a minimum 12-week SSRI trial is recommended to evaluate the medication's therapeutic benefit before transitioning to another medication.  146 ompared with other conditions for which antidepressants are effective at lower doses (eg, non-OCD anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder), many experts advocate the use of higher and quickly escalating doses of an SSRI in the treatment of OCD. 119,120 A meta-analysis of fixed-dosed trials in adults with OCD found evidence to suggest that higher SSRI doses are more effective in the treatment of adults with OCD.  147 Despite good efficacy, SSRIs are frequently accompanied by side effects, including nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation, headache, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue, sedation, somnolence, asthenia, forgetfulness, and sexual dysfunction.  145 Attention to side effects is important, as they can influence patient compliance with medication regimens and treatment attrition rates.  116 In children, clinicians should be particularly vigilant for behavioral activation, 148 a phenomenon involving agitation, hostility, restlessness, impulsivity, emotional lability, and insomnia. Notably, these symptoms are most often seen 1 to 9 days after a dose change. 106,149 A small but significant increased risk of suicidality in youth taking SSRIs led the FDA to issue a black box warning to inform parents and clinicians of these associated risks. However, subsequent meta-analyses concluded that SSRIinduced benefit outweighs the risk of a suicide event among OCD-affected youth.  150 Nonetheless, caution is encouraged when considering medication for children and adolescents."

      "text": "Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are an acceptable monotherapy option; however, between 40% to 60% of patients with OCD do not respond to adequate trials of these medications.  151 oreover, residual symptoms frequently exist, with remission being less common with SRI medication (8%-37%) than with CBT (24%-55%).  152 Consequently, SSRI augmentation with other pharmacological agents, such as antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, 153 aripiprazole, 154,155 quetiapine, 156-159 risperidone 160 ), clomipramine, 161 and benzodiazepines, 162 have been investigated. While findings in this area are preliminary, the most beneficial SRI augmentation with antipsychotics appears to come from risperidone 163 and aripiprazole.  154, 164 However, antipsychotic augmentation practices are frequently accompanied by significant side effects that may limit their tolerability and prolonged use (eg, weight gain, metabolic dysregulation, sedation),  165  and their long-term efficacy remains uncertain.  166 Beyond antipsychotics, another group of medications acting on glutamate (eg, memantine, N-acetylcysteine) have shown promise as augmenting agents.  167, 168"

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Considerable advances have led to an improved understanding of the nature, assessment, and treatment of OCD. Initially, patients experienced an average of 17 years between the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and the start of appropriate treatment.  169 Now, patients spend approximately 9 years before receiving evidence-based care.  1  Although progress has been made, there are still reports of up to 50% of children being referred to an OCD specialty clinic who have not previously received an evidence-based treatment (ie, medication or CBT).  170 The findings among adults reflect a similar pattern of limited dissemination for effective treatments (eg, CBT).  171 Clearly, further clinical and research efforts are necessary to improve the timely assessment and treatment of OCD.\n\nIn terms of advancing the assessment of OCD, early and accurate identification of symptoms is an integral component. The development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms frequently occurs amid the presence of other anxiety or mood disorders that complicate accurate recognition.  1  Consequently, clinicians are encouraged to be attentive to the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms when evaluating patients for common comorbid conditions. The use of reliable rating scales (as discussed above) assists in clarifying symptom presentation, evaluating symptom severity, and tracking the clinical course of treatment.\n\nEvidence-based treatments are recommended for patients with OCD across the lifespan. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should be the first-line intervention except in severe cases or when access is unavailable. Moreover, the \"active ingredient\" in CBT is exposure and response prevention (ie, facing the feared stimulus, habituating to anxiety, and refraining from rituals). Although finding well-trained therapists specializing in OCD can be difficult, there are several online professional directories that can provide information concerning available therapists in patients' local areas (eg, International OCD Foundation, Association of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies' \"Find-a-Therapist\"). As access and availability can pose problems for CBT use, researchers are developing innovative methods of CBT dissemination (eg, computer-based CBT programs, web camera CBT) to further increase access to this evidence-based treatment. If a patient's symptom presentation is severe or worsens significantly, intensive (eg, daily) outpatient CBT as well as specialized residential programs are available. Because these programs might not be accessible for some families (eg, due to location or cost), 172 medication should also be considered.\n\nWhen CBT is inaccessible or insufficient, SRI medications present another evidence-based treatment option. These pharmacological agents are often more accessible than CBT (eg, primary care physician) and yield modest but significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptom severity. It is important that patients receive an adequate trial of an SRI (minimum of 12 weeks  119, 146  ) before transitioning to a different SRI medication. These medications are generally well tolerated but may be accompanied by side effects, and should be prescribed with care for pediatric patients. For patients with severe symptoms, who have no access to CBT (or demonstrate poor response to it) and exhibit only a moderate response to adequate trials of SRIs, evidence-based treatment options are less definitive. In clinical practice, antipsychotic medications (eg, risperidone, aripiprazole) have shown efficacy in SRI augmentation in adults. However, in such situations, it is prudent to refer to a psychiatrist before pursuing this course of treatment."
