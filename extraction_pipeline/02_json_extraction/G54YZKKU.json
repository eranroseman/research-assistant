      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "As digital devices such as smartphones make it easier for users to self-track diverse data in their daily lives, their interest in gaining insights from their own data is increasing. Personal informatics (PI) systems  [46]  are designed to meet this demand by helping users refect on their self-tracking data and plan actions to improve their future selves  [2, 67] . PI users want to understand the impact of their behaviors on health goals  [11] . Thus, they generate hypotheses about infuencing factors, evaluate them using self-tracking data, and revise their strategies to improve health.\n\nPI systems target diverse domains of health and well-being, including physical activity, chronic condition management, sleep, diet, and weight  [22] . This work focuses on stress management in mental health. Stress is associated with contextual factors such as activity, place, social setting, or time. For instance, some people become stressed around others, regardless of the activity or location. As context could afect one's stress, a holistic view of contextual factors is needed to understand the causes of stress. Moreover, users should identify causally related contextual factors for efective long-term stress management, given their routine and repetitive occurrence.\n\nYet, prior PI systems are limited in efectively supporting users in investigating contexts causally linked to stress. Existing studies have focused on presenting a correlation between factors  [3, 8, 49] , but analyses overlooking the complex relationships within the data may lead to diferent conclusions. For example, when identifying the efects of studying on stress, it is necessary to compare stress levels during studying and non-studying. However, comparing studying in a cafe to not studying in a dormitory may not be reasonable, as the diference in place could also infuence the causal relationship. Instead, all other factors besides the factor of interest should be identical (e.g., comparing stress levels while studying in the cafe to those while not studying in the cafe) to ensure that the diference in outcome comes only from the factor of interest. This shift from an 'apples-to-oranges comparison' to an 'apples-to-apples comparison' minimizes fundamental diferences in comparison targets.\n\nPI users unaware of this can be susceptible to errors if causality is identifed solely based on correlation, without considering external factors introducing bias in comparison groups. Alternatively, some studies have employed self-experimentation to investigate causal relationships  [18, 19, 35] . This approach is rigorous and scientifcally valid, but its utility is limited because the random assignment of conditions is challenging in daily life. Asking users to always adhere to required experimental settings when investigating causal relationships between context and stress is difcult.\n\nTo address such practical issues, we suggest a quasi-experimental approach with observational data in PI system design. Unlike the experimental approach, this method uses observational data obtained without random allocation of samples to the treatment and control groups. Before analyzing the causality of a specifc context, it balances the distribution of confounding factors (i.e., contexts other than that under analysis) between the two groups to minimize their efect on stress. If a signifcant diference in stress levels exists after balancing, we may conclude that the context has a causal relationship with stress. We opted to employ 'matching' among the various balancing methods, as it is intuitive and widely used  [28, 33, 45, 79, 80] . The quasi-experimental approach is less rigorous than experimentation in controlling for confounders, but benefcial since it allows users to mimic the experimental setting in data analysis even when experimentation is not applicable or practical. Human-computer interaction (HCI) studies have used this approach to understand the relationships between smartphone usage and contexts or emotional states  [54, 82] . Notably, there is a lack of research that leverages this method in PI systems to help individuals analyze causality.\n\nIn this study, we designed DeepStress, a PI system aiding users in exploring stressful contexts (i.e., activities, places, social settings, and times) using a quasi-experimental approach. As a PI system, it visualizes self-tracked data such as stress changes over time, and provides summarized stress information for each context. In addition, it ofers a list of stressful contexts (i.e., contexts demonstrating causality) with relevant contextual information.\n\nThe primary goal of this study is to explore user experiences in exploring causal relationships through DeepStress. We specifcally examined  (1)  how DeepStress supports users in investigating stressful contexts, (2) how users understand and interpret causality results, (3) which challenges occur while using DeepStress, and (4) how users utilize insights from DeepStress in their daily lives. DeepStress facilitated data-driven self-refection, enabling users to pinpoint stressful contexts and understand relationships between various contexts. We revealed a sensemaking process about how users refect on their stress and interpret the causal relationships. A follow-up diary study indicated that causal insights helped participants manage their daily routines and stressful contexts.\n\nOverall, our contribution can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We demonstrated a use case for a quasi-experimental approach in PI systems for exploring unbiased causal relationships between contexts and stress. \u2022 We investigated how users explored and interpreted causal relationships by leveraging sensemaking frameworks. \u2022 We discussed challenges and design considerations for supporting causal analysis in PI systems."

      "text": "As daily life tracking with smart devices has become routine, people leverage these devices to track physical, behavioral, and contextual information  [81] . Personal informatics (PI) systems help users refect on and understand themselves based on the gathered data  [46] . Previous studies examined PI system usage behavior and intentions, proposing models to identify barriers and better assist users  [23, 46, 47] . PI systems are typically utilized for health management, enhancing quality of life, and seeking new experiences  [11] , encouraging users to shape a better future self  [2, 67] .\n\nPI systems are useful in the afective computing domain, interacting with users to sense, analyze, and respond to their emotions  [61] . They infer emotional states from data, including physiological signals, facial expressions, and body gestures  [26, 27, 83] . Smartphones and wearables also detect user states via passive sensors (e.g., accelerometer, GPS, etc.) and interactions (e.g., app usage) or questionnaires  [55, 63] . The systems then provide users with information about mental states, facilitating their self-refection. For example, they encourage users to (1) review past events in connection with their emotions or mood  [32, 43] , (2) explore triggers infuencing them  [78] , or (3) examine afective states or stress levels along with contextual information  [42, 53] . Such systems employ visual elements to help users' understanding  [6, 84]  and provide interventions to address negative emotions at opportune moments  [29, 73] .\n\nPI systems are expected to provide diverse data-driven insights  [9, 10] . Particularly, PI users are interested in linking diferent types of factors in their data  [69]  such as exploring correlation and causality  [66] . Fleck and Fitzpatrick  [25]  called this 'dialogic refection,' where individuals try to determine relationships between their experiences, hypothesize why they happened, and generate explanations. HCI studies have proposed PI systems to help users understand relationships between diverse factors. Bentley et al.  [3]  designed a system that pinpoints correlations between contexts and well-being indicators. PI systems also assessed sleep quality based on the contributing factors or visually displayed correlated contexts  [8, 49] . Furthermore, they predicted users' stress using contextual factors and delivered useful results  [38] .\n\nStill, most existing PI studies rely on correlation rather than causality when analyzing contextual factors' impact, limiting the rigor of the results. For causal analysis, studies have allowed users to conduct self-experimentation, such as identifying problematic food triggers  [35] , activities for improving sleep  [18, 19] , or causal relationships between various activities and conditions  [17] . Selfexperimentation is practical when manipulating the condition is readily available following the system's random assignment. However, controlling contextual factors may not be easy; for example, users are not always able to change their place immediately to examine the causality between places and stress levels. Thus, we chose an alternative way, a quasi-experimental approach, to address this limitation and enable causal analysis through PI systems."

      "title": "Investigating Causal Relationships with Quasi-experimental Approaches",
      "text": "When examining causal relationships between factors, the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is considered the gold standard  [60, 76] . This method randomly assigns each subject to either the control or treated group and evaluates whether there is a statistically signifcant diference in outcome between the two groups. Random allocation ensures that groups are identical except for the treatment condition, implying any outcome diferences are solely due to the treatment. This process minimizes bias arising from external factors like confounding variables, distinguishing between correlation and causality (as the well-known phrase \"correlation does not imply causation\"). Moreover, the concept of RCT can be extended to an individual level called 'single-case designs' (or n-of-1 trials)  [15, 50] , using a certain participant as a control for themselves to examine the efect of the treatment on their outcome. However, RCTs are not always applicable for practical reasons, such as ethical concerns, costs related to sample size, and the spillover efect where treatment in one group afects another  [70, 74] . In such situations, a quasi-experimental design  [13]  can be used to verify causality, similar to RCTs addressing counterfactual (i.e., what-if) questions. However, this approach is considered less rigorous due to the absence of random allocation of subjects. Thus, controlling for bias before comparing groups is necessary to ensure that the diference in outcomes originates from the treatment.\n\nOne method is to compare subjects having similar combinations of confounding variables, known as 'matching'  [28] . In matching, it is essential to pair the most similar subjects to mimic the random assignment. Several methods have been proposed to defne the distance (similarity) for matching samples. For instance, researchers can directly compare the similarity of two subjects using the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance  [20]  of confounding variables, or calculate a scalar value such as propensity score (i.e., the probability of being allocated to control or treated group given confounding variables)  [71]  as a distance metric. Another approach is coarsened exact matching (CEM)  [31] , which coarsens each confounding variable into discrete categories (or 'bins') and matches subjects if they are in the same bin. When matching subjects, additional options can be considered, including the matching ratio and the algorithm for minimizing the total distance  [79] .\n\nPrevious studies have analyzed causality in human behavior by implementing the quasi-experimental approach in a single-case design setting. Tsapeli and Musolesi  [82]  investigated the causality between contextual factors and stress levels, while Mehrotra et al.  [54]  explored the relationship between emotions and mobile phone interactions. In both studies, analysis was conducted for each individual user, acknowledging variations in lifestyles, smartphone usage, and emotions. Moreover, the quasi-experimental approach was preferable, as participants could not manipulate their emotions to evaluate their efect on smartphone usage. Referring to these studies, we also applied the quasi-experimental approach in investigating causality between contextual factors and stress levels."

      "title": "Making Sense of Self-tracking Data and Visualized Information",
      "text": "Sensemaking is the process of retrieving, organizing, and utilizing information. Russell et al.  [72]  illustrated this concept as a process of generating and modifying a representation to process a task, iteratively reducing the associated costs. Pirolli and Card  [62]  extended the sensemaking process by introducing two main loops:\n\n(1) a foraging loop where the process between retrieving relevant information and creating schema happens, and (2) a sensemaking loop where the generation of hypothetical mental models and their assessment occur to fnd the optimal one. The sensemaking concept was further detailed in Klein et al.'s work  [41] , where they introduced a data-frame theory of sensemaking. They distinguished the concept of data and frame as instance and structure and described the sensemaking process as creating and updating the frame using data. In their framework, individuals may reinforce the frame or seek another frame that better explains the data, depending on whether a gap exists between the data and the current frame.\n\nSensemaking was further elaborated in self-tracking. Mamykina et al.  [52]  proposed a sensemaking framework to explain the process involved in managing chronic diseases. Their framework comprised two modes depending on the gaps in understanding new information: (1) a sensemaking mode where individuals actively investigate data and generate explanations to determine actions, and (2) a habitual mode where they passively engage with their data and use pre-existing knowledge to continue routine actions. During the construction of a new model in the sensemaking mode, individuals form hypotheses (or explanations) from the data and test whether the hypotheses adequately describe the collected data  [51] .\n\nSensemaking actively occurs when exploring and understanding data in a visualized form. For example, when visualizing stress changes over time with contextual factors such as activities and places, users inspect the relationships among them and design personalized, just-in-time interventions  [75] . In addition, PI system users could follow the sensemaking process with their health data, for instance, by creating the initial frame of explaining what afects their symptoms, supporting or revising the frame based on the newly found information from the data, and selecting the most reasonable frame for them  [64] . However, such information visualization should be carefully designed while considering the sensemaking process, as users may not be familiar with integrating diferent types of factors, rely heavily on their pre-existing knowledge, and result in a biased interpretation if they inspect the data only using their eyes  [9, 24, 57, 66] . Our study explored how the sensemaking process occurs when users explore the causal relationships in their data through self-tracking data visualization."

      "text": "As illustrated in Figure  1 , this study was conducted following several steps. We recruited participants from a university and collected self-reported data about their contexts and stress levels over six weeks. One week after the data collection began, we conducted a preliminary interview to investigate user needs for our system. Then, we developed DeepStress based on insights gathered from the interview and the literature review. After the remaining fve-week data collection, we conducted a user study in a lab setting to allow participants to explore their stressful contexts using DeepStress. Following this, we asked them to use DeepStress freely in their daily lives for one week and record a diary about their experiences. Note that each participant followed all these steps.\n\nIn Section 3, we provide information about the participants (Section 3.1), the collected data (Section 3.2), and the procedures of the preliminary interview and user study (Section 3.3). Next, we describe the design process of DeepStress based on the preliminary interview (Section 4) and present the user study results (Section 5)."

      "title": "Participants Recruitment",

Initial applicants were screened using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) survey  [12] , and recruitment occurred only if the score exceeded  13  (i.e., moderate to high perceived Participant Recruitment 6 Week ESM Data Collection Preliminary Interview (After 1 Week of Data Collection) Lab-based User Study 1 Week Follow-up Field Diary Study DeepStress Design Investigating user needs for the DeepStress design Collecting contexts and stress levels through ESM surveys for causal analysis Exploring the user experience of DeepStress in the lab setting Designing DeepStress based on findings from preliminary interview and literature review Evaluation (Section 5) User Study Design (Section 3) Literature Review Reviewing prior studies for the DeepStress design System Design (Section 4) Exploring the user experience of DeepStress in the real world stress). This criterion was set for two main reasons. Firstly, participants with low perceived stress might be less motivated to engage in a stress management study, making them less suitable as our target users. Secondly, individuals consistently experiencing low stress levels may yield biased data with small variance, resulting in fewer meaningful causal insights into stressful contexts. As a result, 24 participants were recruited (9 women, 15 men; age: M = 21.3, SD = 2.1), and their average PSS scores were 23.3 (SD: 5.0).\n\nThe participants in the study had diverse academic majors, including natural sciences, engineering, industrial design, and business management. Nevertheless, participants had the opportunity to grasp the concept of correlation through data analysis in their mandatory experimental courses, such as physics experiments, during their freshman year. Thus, they might have developed a certain level of understanding of experimental design (e.g., setting up control and treatment groups), implying that the notion of confounding variables may not have been entirely unfamiliar to them."

      "title": "Data Collection",
      "text": "The participants were instructed to collect data on their stress and contexts for six weeks, as described in Figure  1 . Since we designed and evaluated a PI system, it was more reasonable to evaluate the system using participants' own data rather than those from others.\n\nWe developed a mobile application that uses the Experience Sampling Method (ESM)  [44]  to collect data. The participants reported their stress levels and contexts when responding. Each ESM session consisted of four questions: one regarding the participant's stress level and three others related to context information. The participants rated their stress levels on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not stressed at all) to 5 (very stressed). Also, they provided three types of contextual information containing where they had been (place), what they had been doing (activity), and who they had been with (social setting) until they responded to the survey.\n\nTo reduce the data collection burden on participants, we provided a list of contexts (Table  1 ) referring to similar ESM studies conducted with college students  [37, 77] . The participants chose eight contexts for each context type from a given list before collecting data. They made their choices based on the frequency of occurrence, and additional contexts could also be reported through an open-ended question. Consequently, each ESM response consisted of stress level, place, activity, and social setting. Note that time was not reported, as it was logged automatically when responding to the ESM survey. In addition, if participants encountered multiple contexts within the same type when reporting, we requested them to report the one most relevant or impactful to them.\n\nWe also confgured the ESM survey frequency in the data collection application. A minimum of 30-minute gap between samples was set to avoid excessive repetition of ESM surveys. Consequently, after reporting one ESM survey, the app remained disabled for 30 minutes. Moreover, to prevent insufcient data, a reminder was sent if no response was received within one hour after the system was enabled again. The notifcation was sent every hour until a response was received, and the system was disabled for 30 minutes again as soon as it received any response.\n\nParticipants could customize the start/end time of receiving notifcations to avoid receiving them late at night, and they set the duration for receiving ESM notifcations to an average of 15.7 hours (SD: 2.9). By setting the notifcation permission period to a total of N hours, participants could potentially receive up to N-1 ESM notifcations daily (in the case where they do not respond to any ESM at all). However, the actual ESM notifcations received per day averaged   [37] . These contexts are known to be common in the daily lives of university students.\n\n4.9 times (SD: 1.6), suggesting that participants reported their states frequently, even without notifcations. Existing studies suggested that the notifcation frequency we set was reasonable  [34] .\n\nAs a result, the participants reported 566.9 ESM surveys on average (SD: 156.8, max:867, min: 258). Following the data collection, we asked participants to provide three to four bins of contexts for each context type, organized based on their similar characteristics. For example, the 'activity' type could be divided into three bins:\n\n(1) academic and work (class, study, research, meeting), (  2 ) hobbies (social activities, leisure activities), and (3) health (rests, meals). These bins were employed to match similar samples using CEM, aiming to balance confounding factors for causal analysis. Further details are provided in Section 4.3."

      "title": "Study Procedure and Data Analysis",
      "text": "Before designing a PI system that analyzes stressful contexts using a quasi-experimental approach, we established key design considerations through a literature review and preliminary interviews. We focused on previous studies that examine how PI systems support users in refecting on and analyzing self-tracking data. Given that we aim to ofer causal results, we investigated how previous systems helped users identify meaningful relationships between factors. Moreover, we examined challenges in understanding and interpreting relationships in data through existing PI systems.\n\nA brief preliminary interview was conducted to investigate the participants' needs for the PI system supporting causal analysis. This interview, held one week after data collection began, uncovered analysis needs arising from participants' actual experiences of self-tracking. We asked two main questions: (1) What information should our PI system provide? and (2) How would you analyze the data to identify the 'cause' contexts of stress? These questions delved into the information to establish connections between contexts and to assess participants' understanding of deriving causality from data. DeepStress was then designed based on the key considerations obtained from interviews and the literature review.\n\nIn the lab-based user study, we examined the user experience of exploring stressful contexts using DeepStress in a lab setting. We frst introduced our study and provided a brief overview of the main functions of DeepStress. Then, DeepStress was installed on each participant's smartphone, and they were given up to 30 minutes to freely use the system to explore their stressful contexts. Participants could view their stress and context information, along with DeepStress' identifed stressful contexts and relevant information.\n\nAfter using DeepStress, we measured its usability with the System Usability Scale (SUS)  [5] . This allowed quantitative evaluation of our design's appropriateness for supporting PI users' understanding of causality from their data. We also conducted semi-structured interviews to investigate how people make sense of DeepStress. All interview sessions were recorded and transcribed to capture participants' responses in detail. We analyzed the interviews by repeatedly reading the transcripts, generated initial codes, and organized the codes and data into relevant themes  [4] . The themes and codes were reviewed and revised iteratively by conducting afnity diagraming until all the researchers agreed on the fnal themes.\n\nIn the follow-up diary study, we examined participants' experiences of using DeepStress in the real world, focusing on how they applied the fndings from DeepStress in their daily lives. Participants revisited the collected data and analysis results without additional data collection. We requested them to run DeepStress at least once a day for a week and write a diary describing their experience of using it. To guide them in providing detailed experiences, we gave sample questions, such as what they explored, whether they utilized the information, and whether any information infuenced their thoughts or actions. The participants submitted their diaries after the one-week study period, and we analyzed the diary contents following a process similar to the lab-based user study.\n\nThe participants were paid 10 USD as compensation for each preliminary interview, user study, and follow-up diary study. For the ESM survey, they were given 120 USD (20 USD per week) as a baseline, considering the repetitive tasks over a long period. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of a university and obtained written consent from all participants."

      "text": "The System Allows Users to Navigate Past Stress History with Contextual Information. One basic requirement of PI systems is allowing users to explore the data to recall the past. As illustrated in previous studies  [9, 10] , PI users typically navigate through collected data to interpret specifc situations or answer their own questions. Cho et al.  [7]  noted that commercial PI systems commonly present data by visualizing it or adding further explanations for users to review. In presenting data, we may refer to Sharmin et al. 's approaches  [75] , ofering stress levels over time or for each context to establish connections between stress and contexts.\n\nOur interview also revealed similar needs to explore stressful contexts through PI systems. Most participants wanted to monitor stress changes over time. In addition, they were interested in how stress levels varied across diferent contexts, requesting summaries of stress levels for each context. \"If I recorded 'library' as a place, I hope to see the number of records and the overall stress level in that place\" (P16). They suggested that the average stress level for each context may be useful in comparing the contexts. Moreover, the participants wanted to see their records while considering the relationship between various factors. \"I think my stress levels may vary if I do the same activity in diferent places. I'd like to see those relationships\" (P08). P17 also mentioned, \"Showing what I've done frequently in that place could be useful. Maybe, I can think about how they relate to my stress.\" Thus, we chose to provide summaries and details of data and to help users diversely revisit their data."

Similarly, PI users may experience difculties when examining causal relationships between factors. The efect of confounding factors should be minimized, but this was not well supported in existing PI systems. For instance, PI systems leveraging correlations were limited in addressing confounding factors  [49] , leading to misunderstandings of correlation as causality without\n\n(a) (b) (c) considering dependencies between contextual factors. In this regard, previous studies highlighted the importance of designing PI systems to prevent users from obtaining biased results  [9] .\n\nIn the interview, participants had difculties in identifying causal relationships from self-tracking data. In the simplest way, many participants suggested using the average stress level of each context, as P12 stated, \"I would calculate the average stress level of all places and then compare it with that in a particular place.\" They also thought that comparing stress levels between contexts would inform them of relative stress and help them evaluate causal relationships. However, some participants noticed that it may not be clear which of the contexts resulted in the high or low stress. \"Since I can perform various activities in a specifc place, it may be difcult to pinpoint whether my stress is due to the place or activity\" (P01). We found it challenging for participants to independently identify causal relationships, prompting the PI system to analyze the causalities and deliver the results to them."

      "text": "We described the stressful context using two separate views that emphasize diferent aspects. The context view (Figure  3 ) primarily describes what happened in a given context, including the overall stress level within the context and its relationship with other contexts. Conversely, the analysis view (Figure  4 ) addresses the causal relationship between context and stress, taking the efects of other contexts into account.\n\nTo help users quickly review and explore the contexts, we organized a list of contexts at the top of both the context and analysis view (the upper section of Figure  3  and Figure  4 ). For each context, the relationship with stress is represented using a circle with a color inside and a set of fre or ice icons above the circle. The circle's color denotes the average stress level for a given context, using the same color spectrum as in the calendar view. The icons represent the causal relationship: fre and ice icons indicate the direction of the causality (i.e., increasing or decreasing the stress) and their quantity denotes statistical signifcance. These icons are not displayed if there is no causality between the given context and stress. The circle's color and the fre/ice icon have diferent meanings since the latter considers other relevant contexts (i.e., confounding factors) in calculation whereas the former does not. We intended this design to inform users that high-stress contexts are not necessarily causal.\n\nThe context view (Figure  3  (a)) frst shows the average stress level of the context and its ranking against other contexts of the same type. For instance, if we choose a 'class' context, the average stress level in this context and its ranking compared to other 'activity' contexts are displayed. The system shows the context's frequency ranking among the same type, denoting its relative frequency. The users can check the distribution of stress levels for the given context. We also displayed three of the most co-occurring contexts from each context type to illustrate their relationship. For example, the activity 'class' may occur frequently in certain places (e.g., classroom, library, dormitory), social settings (e.g., friends, colleagues, alone), and during the day (e.g., afternoon, evening, morning). Furthermore, the system shows the frequency of co-occurring (in ratio), informing how closely they are related to the context being explored. Figure  3  (b) shows that users can move to other contexts while reviewing information of the whole context by type."

For more details about the quasi-experimental approach, we added separate pages explaining the analysis procedure (Figure  4  (b)) and the interpretation of the result (Figure  4  (c)).\n\nMoreover, for a given context, we listed the contexts of the remaining types that may increase or decrease the stress level. We extracted samples containing the chosen context and conducted the quasi-experimental approach to identify the causal relationship between the context of other types and stress. For example, if the chosen context was 'class' (activity type), the system will only use samples with 'class' to conduct causal analysis for places, social settings, and time. As a consequence, users were allowed to explore which of the contexts of the remaining types would afect their stress within a given context."

      "title": "Quasi-experimental Approach",
      "text": "The essence of the quasi-experimental design lies in mimicking a controlled experiment by minimizing the diferences in confounding factors between the control and treated groups. To achieve this goal, we utilized CEM, a matching method widely employed to identify similar pairs of samples using predefned bins. Ideally, achieving control over confounding variables involves matching identical samples except for the treated state; however, this is challenging to achieve in practice. CEM considers samples sufciently similar (i.e., comparable) if each of their confounding variables falls in the same coarsened bin  [31] . Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of this method in controlling confounders  [40] . Unlike other methods employing scalar values as distance metrics The process of conducting CEM as a quasi-experimental approach in four steps. The table at the top right illustrates the coarsened bins assumed in this example case, including three bins for each context (i.e., place, social setting, and time) that should be balanced during matching. The blue squares and red triangles denote samples from the treated and control groups, respectively, and their changed size represents the weights assigned to them after matching.\n\n(e.g., propensity score matching), the balance of one factor does not impact the balance of another.\n\nWhile binning is typically applied to categorize continuous variables, we extended this concept to match samples based on the similarity of their contexts. As shown in Section 3.2, samples with 'rests' or 'meals' can be considered similar in activity type context as they belong to the same 'health' bin. Matching these samples is feasible when other context types (place, social setting, and time) are also similar, meaning they were included in the same bin for each context type. In the following explanation, we name the combination of bins for each context type a \"subset\" to avoid confusion.\n\nOur quasi-experimental approach using CEM is shown in Figure  5 , illustrating a sample case investigating whether \"studying\" causes an increase in stress. (1) When a user chooses a context for investigation, like \"studying,\" samples from the original dataset are allocated to either the treated group (with studying activity) or the control group (with an activity other than studying). (2) Next, samples from both groups are assigned to the same subset if the combinations of coarsened bins for their confounding factors are identical (e.g., Subset #1 = P1, S1, T1). By comparing coarsened bins instead of the raw context, this approach allows matching sufciently similar samples, even when not exactly the same (e.g., considering home and dormitory similar, both included in bin P1).\n\n(3) After assigning samples to subsets, the samples in each subset are weighted based on the ratio of treated and control samples. Samples within subsets exclusively consisting of treated or control are discarded as they are considered unmatched (Subset #2 and #27 in Figure  5 ). Throughout this process, the treated and control groups achieve balance, minimizing bias introduced by confounding factors. (4) Finally, the average treatment efect on treated units (ATT)  [80]  is calculated using linear regression to estimate the efect of the treatment context on stress levels. In our example, we may conclude that \"studying causes more stress\" if there is a statistically signifcant diference in the stress levels of the two balanced groups.\n\nNote that the balanced dataset after matching can difer from the original dataset because unmatched samples are discarded and matched ones are weighted by their relative ratio. This may lead to diferent conclusions between simple correlation and causality. For instance, there could be a signifcant correlation between a specifc context and stress levels, but no causal relationship. In addition, this approach is conducted on one user's data, employing the same individual's data for both treated and control conditions. As the comparison is within one user's data, interpersonal diferences like varying lifestyles, sensitivity to stress, or self-evaluation of stress do not afect the inferred results. Moreover, causal relationships can vary among users, and even for the same context, stress can be increased, decreased, or not changed.\n\nFurther details regarding the quasi-experimental approach and each participant's causal analysis results are provided in the Supplementary Material."

The participants were particularly interested in days with higher stress levels. \"I took a closer look at the days with distinct red colors. With the timeline, I could remember why my stress was high\" (P19).

This pattern may be related to my part-time job\" (P23).\n\nIn the context view, the participants could check how they evaluated a particular context in terms of stress level, which was a novel experience for them. \"It was impressive because I had no chance to analyze my stress by place and time\" (P17). In particular, they focused on the distribution of stress levels, as P03 stated. \"After checking my stress level was mostly 4 or 5, I noticed that I was truly stressed out when taking a class.\" Some participants realized the importance of the recorded data when their recalls were incorrect. \"I thought I was stressed out when I was with my girlfriend, but it was not.

P23 noted, \"The average does not consider other contexts' efects on stress, so I think it cannot indicate causality\" Through the explanations about procedure and analysis result, they learned how to control confounding factors when identifying the stressful one. \"After all, we have to match the other three contexts before the analysis to minimize their efect on stress\" (P19).

We should change only one condition to see the impact of it.\" After understanding the matching process, some participants reported that the results became more reliable.\n\nParticipants also found it helpful for DeepStress to provide causal results directly to them. \"DeepStress automatically analyzed and delivered in which context I was stressed, so I could check the stressful contexts easily and accurately\" (P09).

The pub was somewhat noisy and crowded, and accidents may happen more frequently.\" Some participants supposed that the results might be infuenced by other co-occurring contexts. P19 mentioned, \"DeepStress told me that my colleagues got me stressed more, but I suppose this would be because of class-taking activities that happened often with them.\" Similarly, P17 said, \"The dormitory was evaluated as a stressful place, but it seems this result was afected by the fact that I often study in the dormitory.\"\n\nThey also hypothesized that those inconsistent results might be due to the recorded contexts not being specifc enough. \"The stress really depends on the class. The classes I took in the afternoon or evening were easy, and this might lead to the unexpected causal result that taking a class lowers my stress\" (P04). The number of samples and temporal precedence of the context were suggested as potential reasons for the unexpected results. P06 said, \"I don't think I had a meeting that much, so the low frequency of the activity may make the result biased.\" Additionally, P07 mentioned, \"I usually take a walk outside when I get stressed.

P19 stated, \"Upon revisiting the context view, one of the frequent co-occurring activities with colleagues was taking a class.

P15, whose 'lab' was a stressful context said, \"I went over which contexts increased my stress when I was in the lab. 'Studying' and 'Afternoon' were there, so I realized that doing homework in the lab got me stressed.\" The participants also checked how many times such contexts were recorded from the context view and evaluated whether their hypotheses were correct. \"There aren't many records in this view that include meeting activities, so the result may be biased.

      "title": "DISCUSSION 6.1 Leveraging the Quasi-experimental Approach in PI Systems",
      "text": "DeepStress employed a quasi-experimental methodology to help users investigate which contexts were causally related to stress using their self-tracking data. While previous PI systems have also explored relationships between various factors (e.g., correlation analysis and self-experimentation), there are methodological diferences from this study's approach. Additionally, this method would be benefcial for exploring causal relationships that (1) are unknown or less intuitive, (2) can be infuenced by multiple, complex external factors, or (3) are challenging to test individually. Compared to studies conducting correlation analyses, the quasiexperimental approach enables users to assess the efects of specifc contexts on stress levels with unbiased data, by balancing the distribution of confounding factors. While our approach shares a fundamental similarity with correlation analysis in eventually comparing stress levels between cases with and without the target context, the key diference lies in whether the data were balanced before the comparison, which potentially leads to diferent conclusions. In this study, we observed cases where the results of correlation (i.e., without balancing) and causality (i.e., with balancing) were inconsistent. Some showed signifcant causality but no correlation or presented opposite directions of correlation and causality (details in Supplementary Material). Therefore, we may consider delivering results from the quasi-experimental approach together in PI systems so that users do not miss important relationships from a rigorous analysis. Given that users may utilize PI systems for critical purposes such as health management, these inconsistencies should be carefully considered to avoid potential type 2 errors, particularly when numerous confounding factors complicate the estimation of the unbiased efect of a target context.\n\nThe quasi-experimental approach is less rigorous than experimentation but has the advantage of investigating causalities from collected data without conducting controlled experiments for each context. Testing all contexts with n-of-1 trials can be challenging in terms of time and cost, particularly as the number of contexts and confounding factors increases. When experimentation is limited, our approach could serve as an alternative for inferring causal relationships, enabling unbiased evaluations. Furthermore, self-experimentation and quasi-experimental approaches can be employed together to complement each other's limitations. For example, PI system users can frst explore causal relationships using quasi-experimental approaches and proceed with follow-up self-experimentation if needed. This combined approach helps narrow down the scope of experimentation, allowing users to analyze causality rigorously and address practical concerns such as costs.\n\nThe quasi-experimental approach aims to minimize bias in collected data, similar to randomized trials, before comparing groups. Compared to correlation analysis without balancing data, this approach may require more data to fnd proper counterfactual samples (i.e., pairs of treated and control samples). The necessary sample size for causal inference varies depending on factors such as data dimension. As the dimension increases, fnding sufciently similar samples for all confounding factors may become challenging, potentially requiring further data collection. The required sample size also depends on the specifc quasi-experimental method or the users' determination of statistical power and signifcance level  [21] . Collecting as much data as possible is advantageous for analysis; however, the burden on users associated with data collection must be considered carefully (further discussed in Section 6.3).\n\nIn matching similar samples, we employed the intuitive CEM method. Unlike other methods like propensity score matching, CEM did not require additional abstraction for balancing confounding factors. It allowed users to create bins for each confounding factor based on similarity, making it easily understandable that this method enables an apples-to-apples comparison. CEM ofers fexibility in adjusting bin size (or the number of bins), letting users set the maximum imbalance bound for each confounding factor based on their knowledge of the data  [30] . However, this approach involves a trade-of: smaller bins (i.e., more fne-grained) increase sample similarity but decrease the likelihood of having both treated and control samples within the same bin, reducing matched sample size. For user-defned coarsened bins, there are no specifc guidelines such as deciding the appropriate number of bins or their sizes. King et al.  [39]  proposed the \"matching frontier\" that reaches the jointly optimal case for the trade-of, but they primarily focused on pruning samples for given coarsened bins. Moreover, as explained in Iacus et al.  [31] , diferent numbers of bins can be generated based on the target domain and the importance of each variable.\n\nOne suggestion is to test numerous binning cases and choose the one that best balances the confounding factors between groups  [28] . This can be supported by an automated procedure  [31] , where the algorithm progressively reduces the number of bins until reaching the minimum allowable number. As shown in their example using the Lalonde dataset, this procedure improves the matched cases and reveals which confounding factors have the largest impact on the imbalance level. However, it is crucial to avoid bins that drop treated samples, if possible, because the analysis aims to measure the efect of the treated cases on the outcome. In our study, determining the similarity between contexts posed a challenge, even when participants provided reasons for clustering them in the same bins. This challenge may arise partly because contexts are categorical variables, and measuring their closeness can be ambiguous. To improve PI systems, we propose allowing users to input for binning criteria (e.g., \"This activity requires concentration a lot. \") and score each context accordingly (e.g., \"Strongly agree\"). By leveraging these responses, the system can generate bins by considering the closeness of contexts (e.g., k-nearest neighbors), with bin sizes iteratively revised to fnd the optimal coarsened bins.\n\nDetermining appropriate rigor in PI systems is an open question. One suggestion is that systems should support diferent rigor levels by users' questions and analysis scope  [35] . We may improve DeepStress to deliver analyzed results with varying rigor levels incrementally, starting with correlations  [3]  and progressing to unbiased causal analysis using the quasi-experimental approach. If users require more rigorous evidence (e.g., testing serious health issues), systems may guide them on self-experimentations or provide randomized study designs. However, PI systems should inform users if the inconsistency in analyzed results between biased and unbiased data occurs, enabling more careful examinations. Throughout this process, users may learn rigorous data analysis and experiment design from PI systems and answer their questions."

      "title": "Delivering Causal Analysis Results to PI Users",
      "text": "In this study, DeepStress directly delivered the results of causal relationships to users. Previous studies  [9]  reported that allowing users to identify causality from visualized data may lead to wrong conclusions. Therefore, we chose to provide users with the analyzed stressful contexts along with explanations and relevant information, rather than letting them investigate causality on their own.\n\nIn the user study, participants understood the concept of causality and explored various relationships between contexts while identifying stressful situations. When encountering a context with high stress that was not identifed as a cause, participants closely examined its relationship with other contexts and recognized the potential infuences on stress levels. Prior studies  [24, 57, 66]  highlighted users' reliance on prior knowledge due to the complexity of investigating confounding factors. However, DeepStress played a crucial role in raising awareness of these potential confounders, encouraging a more balanced perspective when evaluating causality.\n\nThe overall process of exploring and understanding stressful contexts using DeepStress can be interpreted through the Mamykina et al.'s sensemaking framework  [52] . When there was no gap between the inferred causal relationship and users' existing selfknowledge, they entered the 'habitual mode, ' accepting the causal results without further analysis. In contrast, in the presence of inconsistency, the 'sensemaking mode' was initiated, where users actively explored the data and generated interpretations for the given results. Users' analytic thinking was activated with unexpected causal relationships (perception of the gap), leading them to explain how such results emerged by refecting on past records (construction of new inferences). Also, they could maintain or update their mental models of causal relationships and apply the newly acquired knowledge in the real world (explicit actions).\n\nIn particular, activities occurring in the inference stage aligned with the personal discovery framework  [51] . For instance, users might hypothesize that unexpected causal relationships were infuenced by other co-occurring contexts. They evaluated the hypothesis by examining the co-occurring ratio and checked the details in the calendar view to assess their hypothesis.\n\nWe found some behaviors fell between the two modes. Users occasionally integrated analyzed results with their existing knowledge or past experiences, instead of revisiting the data or collecting additional information. This heuristic integration process could be interpreted as fuid contextual reasoning  [36] , where individuals quickly connect existing models without elaborate sensemaking. As this mode does not require efortful thinking for sensemaking, users apply their existing knowledge along with the analysis from DeepStress when managing stress entangled with diverse contexts.\n\nThe use of DeepStress can also be interpreted through another sensemaking perspective, namely the data-frame theory of sensemaking  [41] . In this framework, samples collected from self-tracking typically served as 'data, ' employed to construct new 'frames' illustrating relationships between various factors. However, as Deep-Stress directly informed the stressful context analyzed by the system, there were some variations in the sensemaking process compared to existing studies on PI systems.\n\nOur work showed that the data-frame relationship could extend to two diferent levels. Initially, users' self-knowledge of how each context afects stress can be seen as a frame, while the causal result for a certain context inferred from DeepStress can be regarded as data. Depending on the gap between the existing frame and the data in determining stressful contexts, users may either elaborate on the frame or question and adjust it using the data. When the gap is observed, another round of sensemaking begins with a new dataframe relationship, wherein the DeepStress's causal result acts as a frame and the raw self-tracking samples serve as data. During this process, users may re-analyze the data, potentially generating an alternative frame or understanding and accepting the given frame. If the alternative makes sense to them, the frame is integrated into the prior self-knowledge, thereby extending the users' own frame. Therefore, the system-driven analysis results in the PI system may serve as both data and frame, efectively connecting self-tracking data and self-knowledge in the sensemaking process. Moreover, acting as an anchor in the analysis, they could assist users in quickly understanding the overall causalities while exploring unfamiliar cases where new knowledge could be discovered."

      "title": "Actions after Refection on Causality",
      "text": "As with prior healthcare studies highlighting the signifcance of contextual factors  [48, 64, 65] , this study empowered participants to understand how context infuences stress and implement datadriven strategies. Participants utilized information on the presence of causality and its intensity in each context for efective stress management. This information could be integrated into existing just-in-time interventions, guiding users on stress management in stressful contexts. By leveraging the causal relationships, existing PI systems can be extended to predict stress levels in specifc contexts and proactively inform users to help plan their day.\n\nThe information from DeepStress could be used to (1) check whether a certain context was stressful and (2) identify other contexts that infuenced stress within a given situation. This novel feature, employing a quasi-experimental approach in two stages, offered users fexibility in developing coping strategies for managing their stress. Previous PI systems typically focused on the relationship between two factors (e.g., stress levels and a specifc context), leaving users with the only option of 'avoiding the stressful context.' However, DeepStress additionally analyzed the causalities within a given context and identifed which other contexts have causal relationships with stress. This can be practical for developing an alternative plan for stress management in situations where controlling the problematic context directly is challenging, such as attending a class in the dormitory instead of simply skipping it. Mamykina et al. [51]  also demonstrated that providing fexible options for addressing (health) issues would make users more actively engaged in self-management. Therefore, the two-stage causal analysis in DeepStress would empower PI system users with more alternatives, potentially motivating users to explore causal relationships from various angles.\n\nIn our follow-up diary study, DeepStress motivated participants to revisit the refection and data collection steps in the stage-based model. They iterated refecting on whether each context's causal relationship was accurate while experiencing that context in their daily lives, which can be considered as 'refection-in-action'  [58] . This difered from the main study's 'refection-on-action,' where they relied on analysis results or memory. From the data-sensemaking perspective, users utilized this active refection to fnd cases supporting hypotheses generated during the 'refection-on-action' process. This process may help users construct a rationale for analysis results and expand their self-knowledge. In addition, the participants recognized the need for further data collection, questioning whether the results could be reproduced with the new data. Therefore, supporting continuous data collection is necessary to enable users to examine stressful contexts over any period of interest and to investigate how the relationships change over time.\n\nGiven the recurring process after refecting on causal relationships, our system could be more benefcial when the value of the quasi-experimental approach exceeds the users' burden. Previous studies  [66, 68]  also emphasized balancing the benefts and burdens of self-tracking to encourage users to continue data collection while gaining new insights.\n\nFirst, DeepStress could be used with passively collected data, reducing the data collection burden. For instance, the system could assist users with diabetes in identifying behavioral causes of blood glucose spikes by utilizing sensor data, including accelerometers (physical activity), GPS (place), ambient light (sleep), and heart rate (stress), along with photos of food intake  [14, 56] . By combining them with continuously monitored glucose levels, PI systems could estimate causal relationships and alert users to potential risk factors without requesting users' manual data collection. Moreover, it would be valuable for laborious cases that purely rely on selfexperimentations, such as identifying triggers of gastrointestinal discomfort. Our approach reduces the complicated process of setting experiments and testing each case individually, as users can derive causality from data they naturally collect in their daily lives.\n\nAlternatively, we may reduce user burden by narrowing down the scope of data collection. Given that users formulate hypotheses and assess them using self-tracking data  [59] , PI systems could ofer specifc guidelines for data collection based on the hypotheses rather than simply requesting extensive data collection. The causal analysis process can be improved by referring to suggestions in  [16] , letting users explore testable variables, conduct a preliminary analysis, and perform a main evaluation focusing on specifc hypotheses. Furthermore, PI systems may empower users to start with a narrow, specifc question, such as determining whether context X increases their stress, as opposed to a more general inquiry about which contexts elevate stress levels. This approach would enable users to collect sufcient samples for causal inference within a shorter period because the treatment condition is predefned. This facilitates the acquisition of more treated samples, which are often sparser than controlled ones. Considering the iterative nature of the refection-and-action cycle in PI systems  [23] , users can identify relevant factors (to the initial context) during their exploration and subsequently conduct the same analysis on those factors. These approaches would encourage continued self-tracking for users to explore and test various aspects of daily life."

      "title": "Limitations and Future Work",
      "text": "One crucial challenge is determining the level of detail for userrecorded context. While we ofered preset contexts to ease data collection, it had limitations in capturing detailed context information. In addition, there was a trade-of between facilitating the analysis (i.e., requiring more samples) and providing results for very specifc contexts (i.e., having fewer samples). To address these issues, PI systems could allow users to record more specifc situations like a diary. These records could serve as additional contextual information for causal inference. Furthermore, the system could provide information on the feasibility of causal inference based on the amount of collected data. This would encourage users to collect more samples for the context or create another coarsened bin including that context to enable the causal analysis.\n\nTo explore the feasibility of a PI system supporting causal inference, we provided analysis results only after completing a certain data collection period. In future work, systems could gradually deliver analyzable insights based on the collected data, motivating users for data collection and supporting refection-in-action.\n\nFor the generalizability of the study, considering alternative quasi-experimental approaches like propensity score matching is crucial for analytical robustness. Further investigation should involve individuals beyond university students, especially those with limited data analysis knowledge, to assess how they utilize the system. Also, experiments comparing DeepStress with other PI systems help reveal the relative benefts of investigating causality."

Our goal was to identify user experiences in exploring causal relationships through DeepStress. We showed that Deep-Stress helped users conduct data-driven self-refection where they could pinpoint both stressful contexts and relationships between contexts. We also found that the sensemaking process occurred while interpreting the causal analysis results, which may be continued to the application of fndings in daily life to manage stress.\n\nOur study showed the feasibility of a PI system in exploring causal relationships using observational, self-tracking data. We expect our system to be extended to address diverse health challenges by leveraging causalities and to be utilized complementary with other methods such as self-experimentations in delivering meaningful causal insights."
