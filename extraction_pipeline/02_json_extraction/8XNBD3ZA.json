      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "The cooperative and human aspects of software engineering (SE) have been studied for several decades. More recently, research on human aspects within SE such as emotions, gender, and personality, has received increasing attention  [1, 2, 3] . The term \"human aspects\" in SE has been broadly defined as different aspects of human involvement and influence in the SE process, spanning individual to organisational, tactical to psychological, and involving both customers and developers  [1] . Human aspects in software development is seen as the ingredient that \"ultimately gives a project team its soul\"  [4] . There are various human aspects that impact SE  [1, 5] . Many studies have been conducted to identify the impact of human aspects such as culture  [6] , gender  [7] , emotions  [8] , human values  [9] , personality  [10, 11] , motivation  [12] , communication  [13, 14] , empathy  [15]  and others in diverse SE contexts  [16, 17] . These human aspects have a great influence on SE due to the inherently interactive and collaborative nature of the SE discipline  [1, 2, 3] .\n\nInvolving users in the software development process is considered useful due to their ability to influence system success  [18, 19] . Engaging with users in software development can enhance both the system quality and its value to users. However, some studies have highlighted drawbacks of involving users in the software development  [20, 21, 22, 23, 24] . These drawbacks include an increased likelihood of conflicts, negative impact on data quality, unfavourable user attitude towards system, and negative developer attitude towards users.\n\nMotivated by the above contradictory findings and the absence of systematically accumulated knowledge in the area of the impact of developer-user interactions, we compiled primary studies that explored the influence of human aspects on these interactions within SE. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive analysis of existing studies that examined the effects of human aspects on interactions between developers and users. Through this systematic literature review (SLR), we intended to identify the different human aspects influencing these interactions, understand the implications of these human aspects, and report strategies for maximising positive effects while mitigating negative impacts. While our research focuses on understanding the impact of human aspects on developer-user interactions, we acknowledge the prevalence of such interactions in agile methodologies. Our study does not specifically target a single software development methodology. However, we recognise the significance of agile practices in facilitating developer-user interactions due to their iterative and customer-centric nature. Although agile practices hold significance in facilitating developer-user interactions, our study adopts a holistic approach by examining these interactions within a broader context that encompasses various software development methodologies including agile, waterfall, and other iterative approaches. By exploring interactions across different methodologies, we aim to provide insights that are applicable to a wide range of software development contexts.\n\nWe developed an SLR protocol following the guidelines provided by Kitchenham et al.  [25, 26] . After searching and filtering, we found 46 primary studies and extracted data from them. Our analysis covered various factors, including study goals, methodologies, participants, and outcomes. Through this analysis, we identified a spectrum of human aspects that influence developeruser interactions and the field of SE. Our investigation covered positive and negative effects of these human aspects, and strategies for mitigating the negative effects alongside exploring their interrelationships. Additionally, our analysis of the limitations and future work in these studies enabled us to identify key research gaps, which led to the formulation of specific recommendations. The key contributions of this work are:\n\n\u2022 Identification of relevant human aspects and the impact of these human aspects on the interactions between software developers and users in SE context.\n\n\u2022 Collation of mitigation strategies to overcome the negative effects of these human aspects.\n\n\u2022 Identification of limitations and future work of studies to inform research gaps in the area of human aspects' impact on developer-user interactions.\n\n\u2022 A set of recommendations from the identified research gaps to direct future research and implications for practice.\n\nWe recognise software development as a collaborative effort that involves various roles and responsibilities, each contributing to the creation and delivery of software products. We mainly used the term 'developers' to refer to programmers who are the individuals directly involved in coding activities. However, upon further examination of primary studies, we recognised that the term encompasses a broader spectrum of roles within the software development process. This includes individuals such as technical leads, head of IT department, customer support personnel, and SE students. These roles were explicitly defined as types of developers in the analysed primary studies. Additionally, we encountered other roles classified as developers, such as vendor chief architects and vendor project managers. Despite not being directly involved in coding activities, these roles were identified as developers within the primary studies. To address this complexity, we categorised these additional roles as 'developer representatives'. Therefore, when we use the term 'developers' in this paper, it may encompass the diverse range of professionals involved in the development life cycle.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of key related studies. Section 3 describes our research methodology. Section 4 describes the data synthesis and key findings of this work, and Section 5 discusses the identified research gaps and recommendations for future work. In Section 6, we present threats to validity of this SLR, followed by our conclusions in Section 7."

      "title": "2.. Related Work",
      "text": "Many empirical studies and reviews have been conducted on a variety of human aspects in SE. For example, the SLR conducted by Pirzadeh points out the need for conducting more research related to human aspects in the SE context  [1] . Several SLRs have been conducted to explore a wide range of key human aspects, such as culture  [27, 28] , personality  [10, 29] , motivation  [30, 31] , and cognitive biases  [32] . Additionally, SLRs have investigated the impact of various human factors on different aspects of SE, such as software quality  [33] , software development  [34] , and system success  [35, 36] . In the next section, we outline some of these reviews.\n\nCulture influences various aspects of project management, team collaboration, and the design of software products, posing challenges in crosscultural interactions that require formal and informal mentoring, as emphasised in  [27, 28, 37, 38] . Personality traits are extensively studied in SE, with research areas covering pair programming, education, software engineer characteristics, and team effectiveness, often using models such as Myers-Briggs type indicator and five factor model  [10, 29] . Motivation studies in SE have explored factors influencing developers' motivation, demotivation, and their alignment with existing models, and have analysed motivational factors in work practices  [30, 31, 39, 40] . Cognitive biases in SE have been examined in the systematic mapping study conducted by  Mohanani et al. The study identified cognitive biases that can influence decision-making and problem-solving in software development. The findings revealed a wide range of cognitive biases prevalent in SE, and helped to identify techniques to mitigate cognitive biases in SE activities  [32] .\n\nIn a SLR on the impact of human factors on software quality, personal factors were identified as more important than interpersonal or organisational factors, emphasising the significance of addressing human aspects to enhance software quality and project success  [33] . The SLR by Wagner and Ruhe on productivity factors in software development identified a range of factors, categorising them into technical and soft aspects, with soft factors including developer skills, team size, team cohesion, experience, and respect  [34] .\n\nAdditionally, a SLR by Abelein et al. focused on user participation and involvement (UPI) in system success. This study found that human aspects positively affect system success, and UPI has a positive impact on user satisfaction and system use. The researchers recommended further empirical research to explore UPI in specific contexts and its relationship with various contextual factors  [35] . Another SLR examined the impact of user involvement on system success, reporting an overall positive effect of user involvement on system success. This study emphasised that the relationship between user involvement and system success is complex, influenced by various factors and conditions in the development process  [36] .\n\nWhile there have been several SLRs conducted in the field of SE, most of them have primarily focused on individual human aspects such as personality, motivation, cognitive bias, and their influence within specific SE-related processes, including but not limited to cultural influences on collaborative work in SE teams, and cultural effects on requirements engineering (RE) activities. Additionally, there are SLRs that explored the effects of various human factors on different aspects of SE, such as software quality, software development, system success, and RE. Several studies report investigations and surveys of stakeholder/customer interactions and suggest gaps in research around stakeholder/customer interactions in SE  [41, 42, 43, 44] . Critically, there appears to be no SLR that specifically investigates the impact of human aspects on the interactions between software developers and users. Given the vital importance of this relationship in SE, it makes sense to accumulate the collective knowledge on this topic through a dedicated SLR, so SE researchers and practitioners can benefit from learning about the state of the art."

      "title": "3.. Research Methodology",
      "text": "We conducted a SLR to systematically analyse the existing primary studies pertaining to the influence of human aspects on the interactions between software developers and end-users during SE activities. This SLR adheres to the well-defined SLR methodology introduced by Kitchenham and Charters' guideline  [25]  and Kitchenhams' procedures  [26] . The first author developed a review protocol, outlining each step of the SLR process. The next steps of searching primary studies, study filtration, quality assessment, and data extraction was carried out with consultation of the other authors experienced in SLRs and tertiary studies in the SE context. After quality assessment, 46 highly relevant primary studies were identified and information was extracted. These 46 studies were analysed to explore diverse human aspects affecting developer-user interactions, by evaluating the study methodologies, proposed solutions and the effects of relevant human aspects. For data synthesis, we employed a widely recognised meta-analysis technique as outlined in  [45] . An overview of SLR methodology is illustrated in Figure  1 .\n\nIn conducting our SLR, we made deliberate methodological decisions to ensure the rigour and comprehensiveness of our study. One aspect we carefully considered was the initiation of our study based on previous SLRs on human aspects of SE (see Section 2). While this approach could have potentially leveraged existing literature and saved time and resources, we opted for a different approach for several reasons. Firstly, our objective was to investigate the impact of human aspects on developer-user interactions in SE. Prior to initiating our SLR, we conducted an extensive search across multiple digital databases (e.g., IEEEXplore, ACM DL, Wiley, TFO, Springer-Link, ScienceDirect) and other sources (e.g., Google Scholar) to identify any secondary or tertiary studies investigating the impact of human aspects on developer-user interactions. Through this search process, we thoroughly reviewed the available literature and found no existing secondary or tertiary studies addressing this specific topic. Despite the existence of secondary and tertiary studies focusing on various aspects of SE, including individ- ual human aspects and their impact on different facets of SE, there were no comprehensive studies specifically examining the impact of human aspects on developer-user interactions. Therefore, we chose to conduct our own primary search to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this specific area. This decision was based on the absence of relevant literature in the secondary and tertiary sources, as well as the comprehensive examination of primary studies. Secondly, while tertiary study approaches can be valuable in synthesising existing literature, they are inherently limited by the scope and coverage of the primary and secondary studies included in the analysis. By conducting our own primary search, we were able to directly access and evaluate a diverse range of studies, thereby reducing the risk of overlooking relevant research or biases inherent in previous reviews. Additionally, our decision aligns with the iterative and rigorous nature of SLRs, where each step, from search strategy development to study selection and synthesis, is carefully conducted to ensure methodological rigour and transparency."

      "title": "3.1.. Research Questions",
      "text": "We initiated our study by formulating a set of research questions (RQs) based on the framework proposed by Petticrew and Roberts  [46] . This framework, known as PICOC (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and context), was also outlined in Kitchenham and Charters' guideline  [25] . We identified PICOC concepts related to this SLR as specified in Table  1 . RQ1. What are the objectives and methodological approaches for exploring the impact of human aspects on the interactions between software developers and end-users in SE?\n\nThe first RQ explores the primary goals and objectives of each study, and the methodologies employed by researchers to identify the impact of human aspects on the interactions between software developers and end-users in the SE context. This RQ also examines the publication trends, roles and functions of study participants, and the nature of interactions among them.\n\nRQ2. What are human aspects that influence the interactions between developers and end-users?\n\nThe second RQ investigates the human aspects of developers and endusers that have been explored to date in the SE field. It also explores the proposed solutions to address the impact of human aspects in SE, and how these solutions have been evaluated. Further this RQ analyses the positive and negative relationships among human aspects explored in the primary studies.\n\nRQ3. How do the identified human aspects influence the interactions between developers and end-users?\n\nThe third RQ analyses the impact of the identified human aspects on the interactions between software developers and end-users in the SE field. This RQ aims to consolidate understanding of the benefits of promoting human aspects that have a positive impact and to explore approaches that can be employed to mitigate the negative effects of human aspects.\n\nRQ4. What are the identified limitations and future work?\n\nThe fourth RQ examines the limitations and research gaps that were identified in the primary studies included in the review. This involves understanding the constraints or shortcomings of the existing research as well as the areas where further investigation is recommended by the authors of these studies."

      "title": "3.2.. Search Strategy",
      "text": "We identified key search terms based on the PICOC concepts that were used to develop our SLR RQs (see Table  1 ). Initial search query for primary search was developed using the key search terms presented in Table  2 . To ensure comprehensive coverage, we defined alternative search terms by identifying the synonyms of key search terms frequently used in SE (see Table  3 ). We combined these key and alternative search terms using Boolean AND and OR operators to formulate the search query. Our search procedure was performed in two ways: database search (primary search) and snowballing (secondary search). Database search was conducted using the search engines of digital databases including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library (ACM DL), Wiley Online Library (Wiley), Taylor and Francis Online (TFO), SpringerLink, and ScienceDirect. These databases were selected as they contain the most high quality, peer-reviewed papers in SE and Computer Science, and also based on the online databases subscribed by the Monash University library under the \"Computer Science\" category. Our search was not time bound as the goal was to identify all the studies which fit into the given criteria. Our primary search includes papers till April 2023. Database filters stated in Table  4  were used to select the most relevant primary studies. Thirteen highly relevant studies were selected from database search. The breakdown of papers in the database search are detailed in Table  5 . We created different versions of the search query, by modifying it using standard search techniques, and executed these different versions in each database to determine the most effective search query. These techniques include wildcards(*), stemming, searching for exact words/phrases, and considering UK and US English variations. The most effective search query was determined by assessing the relevance of retrieved papers, with the query resulting in the highest number of relevant papers being identified as such. We tried to use the same set of search terms for all the databases but we were able to omit some terms based on the database search rules. We used the term \"human aspects\" and its synonyms (see Table  3 ) in the search query without specifying individual human aspects (e.g., emotions, culture). This approach aimed to prevent bias towards any particular aspect, and it was also necessitated by database constraints that prevented employing all existing human aspects in a single search query. While this approach may have limited the number of papers retrieved during the primary search, its intention was to ensure unbiased results. The formulation and refinement process is outlined in Figure  2 . The search strings used for each database are accessible online in our supplementary information package.  1 he secondary search process was performed by adopting an iterative and exhaustive backward and forward snowballing approach  [47]  after filtering primary search results. Backward and forward snowballing was conducted Iteration 1 -Searching for exact words/phrases with full set of alternative terms (\"End User\" OR End-User OR \"End Customer\" OR End-Customer OR \"End Client\" OR \"End-Client\" OR User OR Customer OR Client) AND (Developer OR \"Software Developer\" OR \"Software Engineer\" OR Coder OR Programmer OR \"Computer Programmer\" OR \"Software Professional\") AND (\"Human Factors\" OR \"Human Aspects\" OR \"Human Influences\" OR \"Human Issues\" OR \"Soft Factors\" OR \"Non-Technical Factors\" OR \"Non Technical Factors\") AND (Interaction OR Relationship OR Involvement OR Association OR Participation) Iteration 2 -With wildcard characters and a selected set of alternative terms (\"End User*\" OR \"End Customer*\" OR \"End Customer*\" OR User OR Customer OR Client) AND (Developer OR \"Software Developer\" OR \"Software Engineer\" OR Coder OR Programmer) AND (\"Human Factor*\" OR \"Human Aspect*\" OR \"Human Influence*\" OR \"Human Issues\") AND (Interaction OR Relationship OR Involvement OR Association OR Participation)  until there were no snowballs left. This involved checking the references and citations of each newly included study to identify additional relevant papers. We employed this snowballing approach due to two main reasons. Firstly, individual human aspects were not included in the initial search query due to the multitude of aspects and there was no way to include all these aspects in the search query due to database limitations. Instead of being confined by database search capabilities, snowballing enabled us to cast a wider net by following citation trails across various sources, thereby capturing relevant literature. Secondly, the absence of a proper taxonomy for human aspects posed another challenge. Without a clear taxonomy, it was difficult to ensure comprehensive inclusion of all the human aspects and accurately capture the breadth of relevant literature. By adopting the snowballing approach, we were able to explore diverse human aspects beyond predefined keywords, by following leads from existing literature. This flexibility enabled us to discover relevant studies that might address aspects not covered by conventional search terms, thus enhancing the comprehensiveness of our review. In ad- rmv: removal, scr: screening dition, we employed another snowballing technique of searching in specific venues  [47] . We specifically searched in the CHASE conference foot_1  due to its strong alignment with our SLR focus. We considered CHASE papers from 2008 to 2023, subjecting them to the same filtration process. Overall, 33 highly relevant studies were selected from snowballing (see Table  6 ) resulting in 46 total papers from both search stages. Figure  3  illustrates the changes in the selected paper sample across multiple stages until the final selection of papers is acquired. In Appendix Appendix A, we have included the papers identified through snowballing, demonstrating the breadth of human aspects covered in our study. These aspects encompass a wide range of factors such as communication, collabo- ration, empathy, motivation, perception, culture, emotions, challenges, performance, coordination, human values, education, personality, engagement, and cognitive style. By leveraging snowballing, we were able to uncover studies that delve into these nuanced aspects, which might have been overlooked by conventional search terms alone. This approach not only enhanced the comprehensiveness of our review but also provided valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of developer-user interactions."

      "text": "Our study employed a rigorous filtration process guided by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We formulated seven inclusion criteria and six exclusion criteria (see Table  7 ). These criteria were established during the development of our SLR protocol and refined during the paper filtration process to uphold the integrity of our paper selection process. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to all the papers to select the most relevant studies."

      "title": "3.3.2.. Filtering of the Papers",
      "text": "Our paper filtration process involved three screening phases. Prior to this process, we downloaded search results from databases and removed duplicates using EndNote foot_2  . We used Google Sheets to deduplicate SpringerLink results due to the lack of an EndNote-compatible export format. We first applied exclusion criteria based on the title, abstract, and keywords. Subsequently, we applied our exclusion and inclusion criteria. During this filtration phase, we conducted a more in-depth examination of the papers. Papers were primarily omitted due to either a mismatch in research focus or a mismatch in paper type. Regarding the mismatch in research focus, we found several papers that did not address human aspects or challenges related to developer-user interactions, as well as papers discussing human aspects of other roles in SE besides developers and users. In terms of paper type, we identified several experiential papers (based on expert opinion) and papers solely providing literature reviews without offering clear outcomes to enhance developer-user interactions. All these papers were excluded adhering to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of our SLR. After this phase, we assessed the quality of selected papers, as described in Section 3.4. To ensure a rigorous and unbiased filtration process, a total of 12 papers were distributed among other co-authors for independent evaluation. During this cross-validation, a high degree of similarity was observed. All discrepancies were thoroughly discussed and resolved during our regular fortnightly meetings. We identified 15 highly relevant papers in this phase.\n\nThe third screening was performed during the data extraction. We read full papers and found a few papers that did not adequately address the RQbased fields in our data extraction form, despite their initial classification as relevant. Our final paper count after this phase was 13 papers (see Table  5 ). After filtering the papers from primary search, we performed snowballing as described in Section 3.2 to identify additional relevant papers. We applied the same screening phases to these papers and found 33 relevant papers (see Table  6 )."

We devised a scoring mechanism that ranged from one to five, encompassing categories such as very poor (1), inadequate (2), moderate (3), good (4), and excellent  (5) . Quality evaluation was systematically applied to all the selected papers using a set of eight distinct criteria detailed in Table  8 . Each criterion was assigned a weight and consequently each paper received a rating between one and five, indicative of its quality ranging from \"very poor\" to \"excellent\". Based on this scoring mechanism, the highest attainable quality score for a primary study was set at five. Papers were classified as \"low quality\" if their average quality score was below two. During the second screening phase, we identified three \"low quality\" papers and excluded them from the final paper set. Is the paper published in a reputable venue?"

The data extraction form comprised 47 questions, divided into distinct sections such as publication details, key areas of the study, research methodology, research gaps, limitations & future work, and research findings. Detailed data extraction criteria are available in our online supplementary information package.  4 Prior to the actual data extraction, we refined the question flow and form structure by conducting four pilot data extractions using papers from each database. The second author reviewed the data extraction form and pilot tests. Upon discussing and finalising the data extraction form, the first author extracted data from four papers, each selected from different databases. The same set of papers was independently extracted by the second author for cross-validation purposes. A very high degree of similarity was observed in the extracted data during this cross-validation phase. Any discrepancies were thoroughly discussed and resolved ensuring an unbiased data extraction process. The first author undertook the data extraction process for the remaining 42 papers, under the close supervision and guidance of the other authors. In addition, regular fortnightly meetings were held, during which the first author discussed the data extraction process with other authors, allowing for peer review and feedback."

      "title": "4.. Data Analysis and Findings",
      "text": "Data was extracted from all 46 primary studies, encompassing a diverse range of data types, including qualitative e.g. details of the study design, study findings, limitations; quantitative e.g. number of studies with evaluation details, number of studies that adopted qualitative data analysis techniques, number of studies conducted in industry setting; and mixed e.g. summarising statistical analyses and qualitative findings supporting specific conclusions from the primary studies. Our analysis involved the utilisation meta-analysis technique  [45, 48, 49]  and visualisation tools. Meta-analysis, which involves statistical techniques and thematic analysis for synthesising findings from multiple studies, guided our data analysis process. Qualitative data analysis commenced by identifying patterns or themes within the data and interpreting their meanings. Subsequently, we systematically categorised and organised extracted data pertaining to related research questions based on their content or meaning. This approach allowed answering research questions by identifying common themes or ideas across the primary studies. Quantitative analysis involved summarising and describing the data using measures such as frequencies or percentages. It enabled the aggregation of results from multiple studies to derive overall estimates or effects sizes. In cases involving mixed data types, we integrated both quantitative and qualitative analysis to draw comprehensive conclusions. Visualisations, such as graphs, charts and tables, were employed to present the integrated findings in a clear and concise manner, allowing for comparisons and interpretations across various data types. The first author synthesised the data under the guidance of other authors, and visualised the findings employing various graphs, figures, and tables. The selected primary studies for this SLR are listed in Appendix A and detailed data synthesis spreadsheet is available in our online supplementary information package.  5 e identified a total of 22 journal papers and 24 conference/workshop papers within the pool of 46 selected studies. We identified primary studies that spanned from 1986 to 2022, as we did not impose a specific time constraints. Since the paper list was gathered till April 2023, there may still be a few papers published after our search.\n\nIn our analysis, we observed that the subject of the majority of primary studies was related to the software industry, accounting for 80.4% of the total. Additionally, 8.7% of the studies were primarily focused on academia, while 10.9% of the studies examined both industry and academia. We identified ten studies that conducted region-specific experiments, such as those exclusively involving Swedish software engineers, Turkish defence projects, Malaysian small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and experiments conducted within an Australian context (SBB12, SBF11, WILEY01, IEEE05). We found a diverse set of application domains within the studies, including healthcare, sales and manufacturing, telecommunications, education, technology, human resource management, retail sector, and more (see Table  9 ). The domains with the highest number of studies were education, healthcare, and sales & manufacturing. Some papers provided details about the SE phases under consideration (see Table  10 ). The requirement elicitation phase was the most frequently studied (13 papers). Design, implementation, and maintenance phases were explored by several studies (6, 6, and 7 papers, respectively), while testing was less common (4 papers). Several studies identified the SE phases most impacted by human aspects. Four papers highlighted requirement elicitation (SPR01, SBB04, SBB15, SBF02), two pointed to design and implementation (IEEE01, SBF01), and one focused on maintenance (WILEY01).\n\nIn the following subsections, we answer each of our research questions. Figure  4  provides an overview of our key findings. the years 1986 to 1998, 2001 to 2004, and 2006 to 2008. However, there were sudden spikes in the years 2000 and 2005.\n\nStarting from 2009, the paper count displayed a steady increase, reaching its peak in 2014. However, there were certain years where no primary studies were found. We analysed the publication trends of human aspects research. Over the years, there has been a consistent effort in academia to explore and understand the dynamics of human aspects between users and developers in SE. In the early years of SE research, particularly in the 1980s, there was a notable focus on improving communication between users and developers in the systems development process. Researchers explored methods and strategies\n\nPublication Year No. of Primary Studies 0 2 4 6 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 2018 2022 No. of Primary Studies to enhance communication channels, understand user requirements, and facilitate collaboration between different stakeholders. Moving into the 1990s, the focus shifted towards addressing issues related to user involvement and overcoming communication difficulties between users and developers. In this era we observed an increased attention to cultural differences as reasons for communication challenges, with proposed guidelines aimed at fostering mutual understanding between information systems managers and diverse user groups.\n\nIn the 2000s, publications focused on overcoming the understanding gap between customers and developers, cultural analysis of communication barriers, and addressing the perception gap between developers and users. There was advocacy for enhancing IT curricula to address the IT-user gap, and research also focused on addressing socio-technical factors causing a developeruser gap. Additionally, research emphasised communication and collaboration between users and developers, and introduced organisational patterns to improve communication in software projects.\n\nThe 2010s witnessed a broadening of research topics to include various areas related to human aspects research. There was significant exploration of user involvement, understanding the customer role, managing user-related risks, empathy and usability, emotions, investigating the impact of motivation, and addressing practitioner challenges associated with human factors in software development. Additionally, there was a notable focus on un-derstanding and mitigating developer-user perception gaps, analysing user feedback in app stores, and exploring various aspects of communication and collaboration between users and developers. In 2014, there was a surge in research focusing on the human aspects of developer-user interactions. Studies explored various topics such as understanding communication gaps in largescale IT projects (SPR02), assessing developers' understanding of usability and empathy (SPR03), investigating the impact of customer interactions on developer motivation (CHASE02), exploring end-user participation methods (SBB07), advocating for better communication between development teams and non-technical customers (SBF06), and presenting empirical findings on usability evaluation methods (SBF08). These studies collectively contribute to a broader understanding of improving communication, collaboration, and empathy between developers and users in software development projects.\n\nIn recent years (2020s), there has been a continued emphasis on improving communication, understanding, and collaboration among different stakeholders involved in software development. Research has also focused on identifying and addressing challenges faced by SE teams, particularly in areas related to team dynamics, virtualisation, and human factors impacting project success. An overview of publication trends is illustrated in Figure  6 ."

Some studies adopted a hybrid approach by developing new models based on existing ones, making this the second most common goal. Among the studies that employed established theories/models, CHASE02 used social-psychological theory to assess motivation in customerdeveloper interactions, and SBB13 applied the precision model to enhance requirements definition in systems development projects through design team meetings. There were several studies which developed new models and guidelines such as a questionnaire to measure user engagement success (IEEE02), a set of challenges in SE teams (IEEE03), and a framework to examine the gap between IT professionals and users to identify similarities and differences (SBB08). The studies which followed a hybrid approach include, a new variation of cultural probes called infrastructure probes (CHASE01), guidelines for selecting proper communication methods using media richness theory (SBB09), and organisation patterns to improve communication and understanding between development team and customers (SBB10, SBF09).\n\nSBF01 presented the evaluation of user-developer communication in largescale IT projects (UDC-LSI) method. The purpose of UDC-LSI method is to increase system success through the increase of UDC in the design and implementation phases. They focused on assessing the system success aspects such as user satisfaction, ease of use etc. They found an overall positive impact on system success, with the majority of positive responses across all considered system success aspects except for data quality.\n\nSBB19 provided a new perspective into the reasons for the difficulties in communication between users and developers. The authors argued that poor communication may result in failed information systems, excessive maintenance and even increased friction between developers and users. Cultural differences were recognised as the cause of this problem. Several guidelines were proposed to assist in developing a mutual understanding of the identified cultural differences."

Empathy has helped to get a better understanding of system usability (SPR03) and to improve developer understanding of usability  (SBF08) .\n\nBoth SPR03 and SBF08 studied empathy. SPR03 explored the origin of novice software developers' empathy towards users and its relation to the improvement in understanding usability. This study found that developer understanding of usability is connected to their empathy towards users. SBF08 investigated the effectiveness of usability evaluations to increase empathy towards users' needs. It showed that the usability evaluation methods that included interaction with users had positive results in generating empathy towards users' needs. Both of these studies found that there is a connection between developer empathy and understanding of usability."

The paper proposed solutions, including two curriculum enhancements: one for hybrid majors, stressing both technical and interpersonal skills, and another for hybrid minors, enabling non-IT and non-business majors to develop technical skills. SBF10 suggested that the difficulties between developers and users are inherent to the cultural differences between these two groups.

      "text": "The study participants encompassed diverse roles and functions. We categorised them into three main groups: developers, users, and intermediaries who facilitated developer-user interactions. In industry based studies, developers held various roles, such as head of IT department, customer support personnel, project sponsor, technical lead, vendor chief architect, and vendor project manager. In academia based studies, developers mainly consisted of IT undergraduates and postgraduates. Users in industry based studies assumed roles such as internal customers from accounting and marketing departments, user managers, customer product owners, and various other business-related positions. In academia based studies, users included non-IT undergraduates, university department staff, and postgraduates. Intermediaries were human factor experts, usability experts, requirements engineers, IT consultants, and technical communicators/writers. Other participants in various roles included quality assurance staff, agile coaches, designers, senior managers, and more. These participants were engaged in various functions (see Table  11 ).\n\nDevelopers and users employed various interaction methods to engage with each other. The most common method was direct meetings (SD01, SPR02, SBB09-SBB11, SBB17, SBF01, SBF03, SBF05, SBF09), with some conducted online through platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Skype. Additional interaction methods included meetings with customer representatives (SD01, SPR02, SBF03), communication through platforms such as JIRA (SBF01, SBB11), emails (SBB09, SBF05, SBB17), app reviews (SBB15, SBB14, SBF12), telephone calls (SBB09, SBB11, SBB17), and interactions facilitated by intermediaries (SBB01, SBB13). A few studies reported no interaction between developers and users (IEEE04, WILEY01, SBB19). However, many studies did not explicitly mention the interaction methods they used.\n\nAnswer to RQ1: We categorised primary studies into four common goal categories: instrument development, enhancing positive impact, mitigating negative impact, and exploring nuances of human aspects. The majority of studies focused on mitigating negative impacts. Regarding study methodologies, questionnaires and interviews were frequently used for data collection, and qualitative methods for data analysis. In terms of study participants, we identified three primary groups: developers, users, and intermediaries, each with various roles. Further, we analysed the publication trends of human aspects research over the eras."

      "title": "4.2.. Identified Human Aspects and Study Outcomes (RQ2) 4.2.1. Studied Human Aspects",
      "text": "We identified a range of human aspects that have an impact on the interactions between developers and users. We considered the most commonly described human aspect definitions in the SE context and the definitions used in our primary studies to group the identified human aspects. We categorised these human aspects into three groups: individual, group related, and skill, experiential, or environment-influenced aspects (see Table  12 ), based on the human aspects taxonomy developed by Grundy et al.  [16] . We defined these three categories of human aspects by extending the original definitions in  [16] . Individual aspects were defined as personal, demographic characteristics that remain relatively stable over the lifetime of a person. Group related aspects are shaped by social contexts and interactions, which may change over time as social dynamics evolve. Skill, experiential, or environment-influenced aspects are context-driven and can change over time due to external factors such as upbringing, training and experience.\n\nThe highest number of primary studies were focused on group related and individual human aspects, with only a small number examining skill, experiential, or environment-influenced human aspects. Within group related aspects, communication was the most explored (62.79%), followed by collaboration (32.56%), culture (16.28%), interpersonal and intrapersonal challenges (16.28%), engagement (6.98%), and coordination (2.33%). Among individual human aspects, perception and cognitive style were the most researched (11.63% each), followed by motivation (9.3%), emotions (6.98%), empathy (4.65%), competence (4.65%), personality (2.33%), and attitude (2.33%). In the skill, experiential, or environment-influenced aspects, the majority of studies were related to performance (9.30%), while others addressed human values (6.98%), knowledge/education (6.98%), and skills/skill level (2.33%). When considering all the human aspects, skills, personality, coordination, attitude, empathy, and competence were the least studied human aspects in the primary studies as illustrated in Figure  8 ."

The most discussed relationships included positive connections between culture and communication and performance and collaboration. Cultural differences were identified as a foundational factor for communication gaps, and organisational culture influenced user-developer communication strategies (SBB19, SBF07, SBF10). Collaboration between developers and users was found to enhance performance (SBB01, SBB02). Negative relationships were observed between interpersonal and intrapersonal challenges and performance, as well as collaboration and these challenges. In both cases, these challenges had adverse effects on the other human aspects (SBB02). Another interesting finding was the positive relationship between culture and these challenges. While individuals' values didn't significantly influence interpersonal challenges, cultural differences led to more frequent and critical challenges (IEEE03)."

      "title": "4.2.3.. Categorisation of Study Outcomes",
      "text": "The outcomes or solutions provided by the studies fell into four main categories: working tools, models, prototypes, or facilitating tool development; theories, theoretical frameworks, or theoretical models; guidelines, approaches, methods, or practices; and empirical insights, indications, or evidence on human aspects in developer-user interactions (see Table  14 ).\n\n\u2022 Working Tool/Model/Prototype or Facilitating Tool Development\n\nThe second highest number of studies provided working tools, models, prototypes, or facilitated tool development and evaluation related to human aspects. For example, SPR04 proposed the RESPECT framework for usercentred and use-case driven RE. RESPECT contains a set of principles to  improve and mediate software-to-usability communication involved in identifying complementarities between the use-case requirements and RESPECT processes. The XML-Based tool for identifying, studying and mediating human-to-human communication known as SUCRE Mediator, aids in studying and comparing processes and mediating communication between usability and software engineers. CHASE01 presented infrastructure probes (IP), a new variation of cultural probes. This can be seen as an ethnographic method to get a deeper understanding of the user's working context thus help to improve the collaboration between developers and users regarding requirements elicitation. SBB13 presented a meeting format using a set of communication behaviours contained in the Precision Model. This format can be incorporated into a general format for running team meetings and interviews, helping developers to better fill in information gaps in users' specifications and generating higher quality information during requirements definition.\n\n\u2022 Theory/Theoretical Framework/Theoretical Model A few studies produced a theory, theoretical framework, or theoretical model as an outcome, with this category having the lowest number of studies. For example, IEEE04 examined how human values, particularly trustworthiness, contribute to successful communication between developers and users. This study explored the factors influencing the delivery of quality requirements and their impact on project success by presenting data patterns. SBB10 found four organisational patterns that complement agile methods by establishing a better baseline of requirements and a better customer-developer working relationship. It was shown that this relationship is strengthened throughout the project life cycle by continually applying these patterns. In SBF09, researchers found that lack of customer involvement, absence of a common communication language, complex business processes, end-user resistance toward system development, lack of trust, lack of leadership, and end-user capacity as challenges that hinder the understanding of the development team. In addition to theoretical frameworks and models, this category includes various hypotheses derived from different factors, such as customerdriven courses, user ability, user commitment, extrinsic motivation, IS-user collaboration, and project performance (see Table  14 ).\n\n\u2022 Guidelines/Approaches/Methods/ Practices\n\nThe third-highest number of studies provided lists of guidelines, approaches, or methods aimed at improving SE outcomes by integrating human aspects or mitigating the negative effects caused by a lack of consideration of human aspects. For instance, SBB04 developed an approach to address understanding gaps between customers and developers. The study emphasised the importance of capturing accurate user requirements early in the development process, attributing challenges to cultural and knowledge gaps between users and developers. To bridge these gaps, the study introduced the use of various set theory diagrams to establish shared understanding between users and developers. SBF06 discussed perceptions of software development practitioners on competence of their customers. The authors argued that one potential way to solve the problem is establishing a common language between development team and non-technical customers, and they proposed the first step of establishing such a common language for information systems development. SBB17 developed an intervention for managing the communication challenges faced by developers and customers during requirements elicitation. The challenges include, understanding real customer requirements, ambigui-ties in the expression of customer requirements, medium of communication, developers' knowledge and developer ability to express requirements.\n\n\u2022 Empirical Insights/Indications/Evidence on Human Aspects in Developer-User Interactions\n\nThe majority of the studies offered empirical insights, indications, or evidence related to human aspects as their outcomes. For instance, SD01 provided insights into communication. The study presented a case study involving the collaboration of human factor (HF) experts, users, and a company developing medical software. Their research highlighted the benefits of integrating user representatives into the software life cycle for end-users. However, it also pointed out that this approach alone might not be sufficient to resolve complex usability issues. Similarly, IEEE05 shared insights on communication. This paper discussed how involving technical communicators in writing online help and crafting system and error messages improved customer satisfaction. The study emphasised that the work of technical communicators added value to the development process by enhancing the quality of information products in these areas. SBB07 provided insights on collaboration. This is a study of a health information system development, that analysed the opinions of physicians (end-users) and developers regarding end-user participation in application development. IEEE03 provided insights into interpersonal and intrapersonal challenges. This study presented a set of relevant human challenges in SE teams, and a refined set of challenges between colleagues (interpersonal), and challenges between an individual and their work (intrapersonal)."

      "title": "4.2.4.. Evaluation Methods Used",
      "text": "The evaluation methods used in the primary studies varied, with only 19 out of the total 46 studies having evaluated their developed solutions (see Table  15 ). The most commonly adopted evaluation methods included statistical analysis (5 studies) and validation using an existing model, theory, or framework (5 studies). Other frequently used evaluation methods were expert feedback (3 studies) and application in real software development projects (3 studies). Only a few studies employed prototypes (1 study), case studies (1 study), and empirical testing methods such as structural equation modelling (1 study). It is worth noting that 27 studies did not evaluate their study outcomes and we identified two main reasons for this. Firstly, in some cases, the evaluation process had not been completed at the time of publication, and was outlined as part of the authors' future work. Secondly, there were instances where evaluation details were neither provided in the paper nor mentioned as future work. In some of these cases, the specific reason for the omission was unclear. However, it is important to note that not all studies may necessitate formal evaluation processes. For instance, empirical studies focusing on industry practices or qualitative research involving interviews may primarily report on findings derived from real-world data rather than evaluating specific interventions or methodologies  [50] . This aligns with the notion that empirical work often involves capturing and analysing existing phenomena or real-world data rather than assessing the effectiveness of interventions. We identified several studies which may not require a formal evaluation due to the empirical nature of their studies (IEEE03, IEEE04, IEEE05, IEEE06, SPR02, SBB03, SBB08, SBB11, SBB12, SBB17, SBF02, SBF03, SBF04, SBF05, SBF06, SBF07, SBF09, SBF11). While the absence of explicit evaluation details may not always imply unreliability, clear and comprehensive reporting is essential for upholding the integrity of research outcomes. It serves to verify the adherence to methodological criteria, thereby ensuring the reliability of the findings. Answer to RQ2: We categorised various human aspects into individual, grouprelated, and skill, experiential, or environment-influenced categories, impacting developer-user interactions. Most primary studies focused on group-related aspects, with communication being the most studied. We examined both positive and negative relationships among these aspects, with only around 14% identifying such connections. Study outcomes fell into four main categories: tool development, theoretical frameworks, guidelines, and empirical insights on human aspects. The majority of studies provided empirical insights as their outcome. Most studies used statistical analysis and validation through existing models or theories for evaluation. However, the majority of studies did not report details regarding the evaluation. We also identified several studies which may not require a formal evaluation due to the empirical nature of their studies."

These effects were attributed to various human aspects, including empathy, motivation, collaboration, and communication. For example, in SBF03, the study explored how the customer role can be effectively implemented in Agile projects. This study found that both developers and customers enjoyed direct interactions, which helped developers better understand the extent of the customer tasks and increased their appreciation for these tasks.\n\nNegative effects comprise developers' unawareness of customer needs, limited domain knowledge, demotivation among developers, negative developer attitudes towards users, increased pressure and stress on developers, and developers being misled by users.

The study uncovered that pre-project partnering substantially enhances coordination and reduces these perception gaps, resulting in a more positive developer-user relationship.\n\nThese negative impacts encompass a lack of trust, reduced collaboration, conflicts, communication breakdown, increased perception gaps, lack of understanding among stakeholders, strained relationships, resistance between developers and users, cultural gap, misaligned stakeholder objectives, and a lack of empathy.

      "text": "We identified various strategies employed by primary studies to mitigate the negative impact on developer-user interactions. Managerial interventions such as coordination and partnering helped to reduce perception gaps and enhance project performance. Building collaborative relationships among all stakeholders fostered cooperation and understanding. Developing hybrid positions, such as business analysts, technical writers helped bridge the IT-user gap, facilitating communication between technical and non-technical areas. Also employing existing team members as communication facilitators and involving business analysts or technical writers to bridge developer-user gap facilitated mutual understanding. Continuous interaction with users, maintaining open communication, and avoiding specialist terminology ensured clarity and alignment in information shared between them. We also found that, it is important to acknowledge that the computer-based systems serve only as a tool to support work for business users, whereas for developers, system development is their primary responsibility. Treating business users as unique individuals and appreciating their specific contributions helped to enhance development. Further, considering business users as clients and dedicating time to understand their needs was considered vital for improving software development. Collaborative user partnering reduced conflicts while enhancing interaction and communication with IS staff. Further we found some strategies that can be implemented via project managers. Project managers should promote an environment where users feel empowered to share their ideas openly. Creating a 'safe space' for both users and developers to be creative is essential, possibly facilitated by external facilitators or internal experienced individuals. Avoiding reliance on a limited group of users, implementing a cautious selection process for appointing users to the design team, employing specialised communication methods (e.g. precision model) or supplementary techniques such as contextual inquiry, which permit designers to spend time observing users in their native environment are recommended during design meetings. The Gap model, which highlights differences between users and developers, can be used to understand real world disparities. These strategies will help to navigate the complexities of human aspects in developer-user interactions effectively."

These impacts are attributed to human aspects including cognitive style, knowledge, skills, collaboration, engagement, and communication."

      "title": "\u2022 Mitigation Strategies for Negative Impact on SE",
      "text": "Studies have employed various strategies to mitigate the negative impact of human aspects on SE and these studies have proposed several strategies for mitigating these effects. These strategies include managerial interventions focused on coordination and partnering to reduce perception gaps and conflicts, while improving project performance, interactions, and communication. Establishing coordination channels and building collaborative relationships can enhance stakeholder collaboration. Additionally, adopting organisational patterns facilitates improved communication and understanding between customers and the development team. Creating an infrastructure for managing the feedback in user reviews helps to streamline the developer-user communication via app reviews, resulting in an enhanced user experience. Further clear articulation of assumptions, provision of meeting notices, and adherence to communication principles are essential for effective communication. Maintaining proper communication with all stakeholders from the outset promotes team commitment to effective planning.\n\nFormal charters can be formulated to establish shared objectives and responsibilities of users and developers. Implementing organisational coordination techniques and partnering procedures before project commencement is beneficial for effective project management. Also potential conflicts and problem areas should be identified before project initiation. Achieving mutual understanding in terms of success definitions and measures enhances the commonality among project stakeholders. Conducting dedicated meetings for reviews, retrospectives, and pre-grooming creates opportunities for team members to address areas where they may have insufficient knowledge or understanding. Studies have also suggested implementing agile approaches such as scrum to overcome interpersonal and intrapersonal challenges. Providing coaching and guidance for leadership roles, fostering in-house leadership with senior guidance, having dedicated feedback sessions and retrospectives, employing software to measure office/team mood, and frequent supervision of these reports by the leader are key strategies for solving lack of leadership issue.\n\nAnswer to RQ3: We classified the impact of human aspects into two major categories as impact on developer-user interactions and impact on SE. We identified positive, negative, or mixed effects in each category. The majority of the studies identified positive effects. Effects on developer-user interactions were categorised into four groups: effects on developers, users and intermediaries, the developer-user relationship, and the body of knowledge. Considering the effects on SE, we identified five groups, covering stakeholders and relationships, organisation and software projects, developed systems, SE processes, and contributions to existing knowledge. We didn't observe any negative effects on the body of knowledge in both categories. We further identified strategies employed by primary studies to mitigate the negative impact of human aspects on developer-user interactions and SE."

      "text": "We identified three subcategories among the limitations related to methodology: study participants; tools, techniques, instruments; and study design. Most studies (35 studies) identified one of more issues under this category.\n\n-Limitations related to Study Participants Studies in this category reported various limitations related to expertise/ experience of participants, demographics of participants, participant bias, number of participants/sample size, and representativeness of the sample. In total, we identified 17 studies reporting this limitation. For example, in IEEE06, the study was based on a customer-driven course at the Computer Science department of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The researchers selected a sample of SE students from this course, but the sample size was quite small, and the study was based on only one course. Therefore, the authors acknowledged that a larger sample size would be needed to generalise the results.\n\n-Limitations related to used Tools/Techniques/Instruments\n\nWe identified eight studies with limitations related to tools and techniques used, and their data collection instruments such as surveys and interviews. ACM01 discussed how developers and users express emotions and politeness by analysing a GitHub data set. The used emotion detection tool was trained with Jira comments, while the politeness tool was trained using Stack Overflow data. They have identified this variability as a potential threat to the reliability of the emotions and politeness tools applied in the research. -Limitations related to Study Design A total of ten studies reported limitations related to study design, data analysis, and other methodology related issues. For example, SBB15 explored communication between developers and users via Apple App Store reviews. The researchers collected data based on a list of the most downloaded applications. This was identified as a limitation in study design, as it may have influenced the relationship between number of downloads and other variables such as ratings. This study made two assumptions during data analysis. Firstly, researchers have assumed missing publishing dates of reviews by using the dates of other reviews. Secondly, they adopted manual analysis to analyse feedback content. These assumptions were identified as data analysis limitations that may affect the internal validity of the results."

These recommendations can be implemented in practice to mitigate the communication difficulties caused by cultural differences. \u2022 Extending the Research based on Current Findings Twenty primary studies proposed various generalisation related future work such as using a bigger sample, conducting more experiments/ evaluations, or improving the proposed solution. In SPR02, researchers explored UDC in large scale IT projects, gaps in communication and how to overcome them. They found that direct UDC is limited, and there is no commonly used method for this in design and implementation phases.

      "title": "5.. Discussion"
    },
    {
      "title": "5.1.. Implications for Research",
      "text": "From our analysis of the limitations and future work proposed in the primary studies, we have identified some areas where more research could be undertaken. Based on this analysis, we offer some recommendations for future research to address these gaps.\n\n\u0184 Human aspects research related gaps: Among the selected primary studies, there are only a few studies (1-2 studies) focusing on empathy, personality, skills, coordination, attitude, and competence related to developer-user interactions. Exploring the impact of these under-researched human aspects and determining the optimal way to integrate them into developer-user interactions in SE activities may enhance these interactions  [2, 16] . These human aspects can be studied individually as well as in combination with other human aspects. These future studies may beneficial in exploring positive and negative impacts of these under-researched human aspects on developer-user interactions. Further they may assist in understanding the ways to capture these human aspects in real-world, and determining the practical ways of improving SE by incorporating their impact.\n\n\u0184 Empathy in developer-user interactions: Empathy was somewhat surprisingly found to be an under-researched area in terms of developeruser interactions in SE, as we found only two primary studies (SPR03, SBF08) regarding empathy. Both these studies were focused on improving developers' understanding of usability. Empathy has been considered vital for fostering human connections in different disciplines  [51] . However in SE, the role of empathy in developer-user interactions, effects of empathy in these interactions and the ways of improving SE outcomes and processes by leveraging empathy has not been studied so far.\n\n\u0184 Research on developer-user personality: There have been numerous studies investigating the impact of personality on SE tasks  [52] . Previous research has also identified SE activities that are influenced by the personality traits of SE professionals  [10] . However, our selected primary studies had only one study which emphasised the importance of considering personality in different SE challenges related to developer-user interactions (SBB12). Therefore, it seems useful to understand how developer and user personalities influence their interactions such as developer-user communication, decision making, and conflict resolution between developers and users.\n\n\u0184 Research on attitude: We found that the area of attitude is underexplored, with only one primary study (IEEE02) addressing this aspect among the papers included in this SLR. This study identified user-developer attitude and user attitude towards the system as critical factors for user engagement success in system development. However, the broader dynamics of how positive or negative attitudes impact the willingness of users and developers to engage with each other, and the evolution of attitudes throughout the course of a software project, remain unexplored in the existing literature. Investigating these aspects could provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay of attitudes in the developer-user relationship.\n\n\u0184 Coordination related research: Coordination is another underrepresented developer-user interaction area. One selected primary study (SBB05) found coordination has a positive impact on project performance during the system development process. Likewise coordination may also be helpful in resolving developer-user conflicts and improving other SE practises. Therefore future research may provide valuable insights into the role of coordination in developer-user interaction by understanding effective coordination practices in resolving developer-user conflicts, and how developer-user coordination needs change over the software development life cycle.\n\n\u0184 Competence related research: Two primary studies related to competence were found and these emphasised the importance of user competence in user engagement with developers (IEEE02, SBB01). Similarly competence may also influence other aspects of developer-user interaction such as communication, understanding. Hence further studies may helpful in understanding the role of competence in fostering effective developer-user communication, reducing misunderstandings, and aligning expectations.\n\n\u0184 Research on the relationships among different human aspects: This was identified as an area with limited studies to date. Communication and collaboration and culture and communication human aspects combinations have been studied in more than one primary study. However, the other human aspect combinations were studied only once which opens several possibilities of future research areas. By far the majority of the selected primary studies (86%) have not investigated the relationships among different human aspects. Thus, more research studies are required to identify the relationships among different human aspects, and their impact on developer-user interactions. By exploring these relationships, researchers can provide further insights into how software teams can effectively leverage various human aspects to improve overall project success and collaboration.\n\n\u0184 Lack of a proper human aspects taxonomy: Similar to prior studies, we identified another limitation during our analysis, which is a lack of agreed definitions in studies of 'human aspects'  [53] . While categorising the identified human aspects, we realised that there is only one preliminary taxonomy for end-user human aspects in SE  [16] . We didn't find any widely agreed taxonomy developed for the human aspects of the developers in the SE context. However, we used this taxonomy for our classification as the human aspects discussed in these studies are common to both developers and users. There is thus a need for conducting evaluations using the current taxonomies and extending them to cater to human aspects of other SE stakeholders (e.g., developers, testers). There may be a need for developing new taxonomies to better capture diverse human aspects of these other stakeholders.\n\n\u0184 Developing a taxonomy to classify the effects of human aspects: There is no known comprehensive taxonomy to classify the effects of human aspects. Developing a taxonomy to classify the effects of human aspects could significantly enhance our understanding of the intricate dynamics at play in developer-user interactions. During our SLR, we observed that several other SLRs have explored the effects of individual human aspects as well as human aspects in general  [10, 30, 32, 53, 54] . However, none of these studies employed a taxonomy to systematically discuss the identified effects of human aspects. Introducing a new taxonomy in future research endeavours may provide a more structured approach to analyse the impact of human aspects and offer valuable insights into how the field has evolved over time. By reclassifying primary papers based on this new taxonomy, researchers can uncover trends, patterns, and changes in our understanding of human aspects in SE.\n\n\u0184 Addressing evaluation limitations: Many primary studies had limitations in their evaluations, which were identified either as limitations within the study itself or during our analysis of the study. Evaluation of most of the proposed tools, theories or guidelines in the primary studies are planned to be completed as future works. Many studies admitted issues related to self-reported information, threats to reliability, and ability to influence the direction of the discussion in semi-structured interviews. Many studies had small sample size, specific geographic focus, variation in participants' expertise, sample size concerns, and context-specificity. Therefore proposed solutions still remain to be tested and evaluated with real-world scenarios and generalised contexts.\n\n\u0184 Exploring the correlation between query specificity and snowballing efficacy: Future SLRs could focus on studying the correlation between the specificity of search queries employed in SLRs and the efficacy of snowballing techniques. This investigation could involve examining how the level of specificity in search queries influences the need for and impact of snowballing in different domains. By gaining insights into this correlation, researchers can develop tailored search strategies that optimise the effectiveness of snowballing, particularly in domains with varying degrees of specificity in research queries."

      "title": "5.2.. Implications for Practice",
      "text": "From our analysis of the findings and recommendations the primary studies, we have identified practical implications of our research for industrial practice. By integrating these insights into our discussion, we aim to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how our research findings can be translated into actionable strategies and practices for practitioners in the field.\n\nAddressing developer-user perception gaps: Research has identified several factors contributing to developer-user perception gaps including uncertainty, instability, and diversity of requirements (SPR01, SBB05, SBB06). It has been shown that top management support, collaboration, and effective communication are instrumental in reducing these perception gaps. In addition, studies have highlighted the negative impact of perception gaps on user participation and project performance. These studies have proposed strategies for software practitioners and project managers to mitigate these challenges. These include fostering collaborative relationships among stakeholders, formalising shared objectives and responsibilities through a formal charter, proactively identifying potential conflicts and problem areas before project initiation, and facilitating both scheduled and unscheduled group meetings between users and practitioners. Additionally, project managers are encouraged to develop their contacts, contracts, and relationships with users early in the project life cycle to foster a deeper understanding and alignment of objectives.\n\nExpressing emotions and politeness in developer-user communication: Studies have delved into the nuances of how various roles in open-source software development express emotions and politeness by analysing GitHub projects (ACM01). The findings revealed notable distinctions between developers and users in their expressions of emotions and levels of politeness. Developers' comments tend to exhibit lower levels of politeness compared to users' comments, with developers receiving a higher degree of politeness in response to their comments than users. Further, developers received a higher level of love and joy in the comments on their issues, while users received more expressions of anger and sadness in theirs compared to developers. These findings suggest that while users often strive to maintain politeness and convey positive emotions, their efforts may not always be reciprocated. As a result, researchers have recommended that developers exercise greater caution and mindfulness in their communications with other contributors. By recognising these disparities, software organisations can implement strategies to foster a more respectful and supportive atmosphere. Creating guidelines or best practices for communication within development teams can help set expectations and promote a culture of mutual respect and understanding. Additionally, providing training or workshops on effective communication techniques and conflict resolution can empower developers to navigate interpersonal challenges more effectively.\n\nEnhancing developer-user communication: Many studies have offered insights into improving communication between developers and users by addressing various aspects of their interaction. Some of these recommendations include addressing cultural differences (SBB19, SBF10, SBF07), using intermediaries to facilitate communication (IEEE05, SBF07), suggestions on communication media selection (SBB09), and enhancing communication in RE process (IEEE01, IEEE04, SBB17, SBF02). These insights offer valuable strategies for industry practitioners to enhance communication between developers and users. Especially researchers have emphasised that cultural differences between users and developers are at the foundation of the communication gaps (SBB19, SBF07, SBF10). Some of the recommendations to bridge these gaps include avoiding specialist terminology and explaining key jargon, considering the use of language from different perspectives to eliminate ambiguity, providing advance notice of meetings and agenda details for adequate preparation, recognising the distinct purposes of technology use for business users versus developers, respecting values associated with different roles, and treating business users as clients by investing time in understanding their needs (SBB19, SBF10).\n\nImproving developers' understanding of usability via empathy: Research suggests a strong link between developers' understanding of usability and their empathy toward users' needs (SBF08, SPR03). They found that engaging in user-based thinking aloud protocols during usability evaluation sessions enhances developers' empathy by exposing them to users' emotions, fostering emotional contagion and heightening empathy toward user needs. This calls for alternative corrective measures over traditional training approaches. For the software industry, these findings underscore the importance of implementing targeted strategies to improve product development processes and user satisfaction. Incorporating usability evaluation methods that encourage direct interaction with users, such as user-based thinking aloud protocols can foster a culture of empathy among developers, leading to software products that better meet user needs. Recognising emotional contagion as a driver of developers' empathy emphasises the need for positive emotional experiences throughout the development life cycle, encouraging user-centred design practices and empathetic communication channels between developers and end-users. Ultimately, embracing empathy-driven approaches to usability can enhance product quality, user experience, and customer satisfaction.\n\nAddressing developer-user understanding gaps: Studies highlighted understanding gaps between developers and users as critical in IT system failures (SBB04). They found that using set theory and Venn diagrams in RE process to illustrate relationships and gaps, aids to resolve understanding gaps. Another study identified key challenges in developer-user understanding and they introduced some organisational patterns to address them. Customer-driven design pattern emphasises clear initial requirements and various approaches for customer involvement in design. Customer involvement with the development team pattern advocates for engaging expert customers in the development process to uncover hidden needs. Illustrating business processes pattern aids in understanding organisational flows, while business process re-engineering streamlines processes for approval. Satisfying customers by results pattern involves designing prototypes for early feedback. Building master trainers pattern enhances customer capacity for long-term impact. These strategies enhance understanding between developers and users, ultimately improving project outcomes and user satisfaction.\n\nAddressing developer-user gaps in general: The researchers have delineated disparities between IT practitioners and users, as well as variances within each group by introducing the gap model  (SBB08) . Their findings revealed that IT professionals felt more in control of technology, whereas users often experienced helplessness when systems failed to meet their expectations. They also found that training and involvement in IS development significantly influenced user attitudes, with technically trained or involved users exhibiting IT professional-like attributes. This underscores the role of education and involvement in shaping user perceptions and attitudes toward technology. Another study proposed enhancements to traditional IT curricula to bridge the IT-user gap (SBB16). It suggested two key approaches for hybrid IT major and hybrid IT minor curricula. For the hybrid major, students are encouraged to specialise in certain areas and collaborate on projects requiring diverse expertise. This approach fosters collaboration and reduces the perception of needing to know everything. The hybrid minor option aims to train non-IT majors as effective liaisons between their work group and the IT department. One approach is to create an IT liaison major, combining business core with technical background. Another approach is to offer an end-user support minor, providing technical training in end-user development, web development, and business-oriented software."

We discuss the threats associated with each stage of our SLR and the mitigation strategies used during our study.\n\nData source and search strategy. Our primary search is not time-bound, but it only includes papers published until April 2023. Therefore, we may have overlooked relevant studies published after that date. Constraints on the number of search terms in digital databases also posed a challenge. To address these threats, we selected the most commonly used digital databases, used consistent search terms across all databases, refined search strings for each database, executed multiple search queries in one database due to search term restrictions, and employed an exhaustive snowballing approach. Also when selecting the search terms, \"human aspects\" term and its synonyms were used without adding any individual human aspects to ensure our search is not biased towards any human aspect. Both primary and secondary search phases covered more than one thousand publications and resulted in a broad set of primary studies.\n\nStudy filtration. Study filtration was initially performed by a single researcher, which may have led to the possibility of missing relevant studies. However, we followed a comprehensive selection process as explained in Section 3.3.2, including three screenings, clear inclusion/exclusion criteria, and cross-validation by multiple authors. Regular discussions and quality assessments were also part of the filtration process as described in Section 3.4.\n\nData extraction and synthesis. Data extraction and synthesis were conducted by one researcher, potentially introducing bias. Additionally, some primary studies lacked sufficient details for extraction. To mitigate these threats, cross-validation was performed for data extraction as described in Section 3.5, and primary studies with less than three pages were excluded during filtration. Data synthesis was discussed with other authors during regular fortnightly meetings to ensure accuracy."

      "text": "We conducted this SLR with the aim of identifying the current body of work in human aspects related to the interactions between software developers and users. We performed a comprehensive search on six digital databases and adopted an exhaustive backward and forward snowballing process. We followed a thorough filtration process comprising three screening phases and 46 papers were selected for data extraction. We synthesised data to answer our four research questions. We found key objectives for conducting these primary studies, and details regarding methodology and participants of each study. We identified human aspects studied in each primary study and categorised them based on a taxonomy of human aspects. We also discovered the relationships among human aspects and the impact of human aspects explored in the primary studies. We analysed the outcomes, evaluation methods, limitations and future work of each primary study. Using these identified limitations and future work, we framed the key research gaps and proposed recommendations for future research and practice. The findings of our SLR will be beneficial in three ways. First, we now have an overview of the positive and negative impacts of human aspects on the interactions between developers and users as well as SE in general. Second, our findings will help to identify ways to leverage the positive effects in developer-user interactions as well as address the negative effects of these human aspects by following the mitigation strategies. These insights will be useful for software practitioners to bridge the gap between developers and users. These will also be helpful in having effective interactions with users. Finally the proposed recommendations will be helpful for the research community for conducting further research on human aspects or research involving human participants.\n\nTable C.19 -Continued from previous page Category Human Aspect Nature of Impact & Paper IDs Impact on User-Developer Interactions Impact on SE Group Related Communication N: SPR04, SBB06, SBB11, SBB16, SBB19, SBB17, SBF09, SBF12 M: IEEE04, SBB05, SBF07 Lack of understanding among stakeholders, Strained developer -user relationship, Failed communication, Cultural gap between stakeholders, Misalignment of stakeholders' objectives.
