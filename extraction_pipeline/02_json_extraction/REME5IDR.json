      "title": "'Digital Hypertension', a new academic field proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension",
      "text": "Recent innovations in digital technology are drastically transforming the healthcare and medical field, including the management of hypertension  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Conventional office blood pressure (BP) based management is being shifted to the management based on 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring. Wearable BP monitoring devices and telemedicine are also gaining attention as promising tools for better understanding patients' conditions. The Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) has proposed \"Digital Hypertension\" as a new research field that integrates digital technology into hypertension management and promotes research activities proactively  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .\n\n'Digital hypertension' is a novel concept that encompasses the development of new technologies for better management of BP (i.e., sensors for detecting environmental factors that affect BP, information processing, and machine learning), analyzing of big data in healthcare  [14] , and the clarification of regional-specific medical needs, including patients' behavior. The data is linked and organized to generate novel values for providing better hypertension treatment and healthcare. Specifically, at the macro-level, it involves conducting population research to make recommendations for healthcare policy. At the micro-level, optimal individualized medical care is provided by consolidating data on individual BP variability (BPV), control status, lifestyle, medication adherence, laboratory values, and health insurance claims through the use of digital technology. Thus, the concept 'Digital Hypertension' encompasses numerous digital technologies and various research theme on hypertension (Fig.  1 )  [5] .\n\nBlood pressure as a core biomarker of digital health \"Digital health\" is a broad concept that encompasses various aspects of health care, including personal health management, disease prevention education, risk prediction, support for diagnosis or treatment for healthcare professionals. Medical programs approved by regulatory authorities are referred to as 'programmed medical devices' (SaMD: Software as a Medical Device). SaMD has a specific intended purpose as a medical device, which includes contributing to the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease that could impact a patient's life and health if it does not function as intended. Clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate the scientific efficacy and safety of SaMD. For example, artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic support software and therapeutic applications (therapeutic apps) are considered SaMD. Therapeutics apps are programs with therapeutic purposes of aiding patients in preventing, managing, and treating their diseases using smartphones or other digital technologies, under the supervision of physicians (Fig.  2 )  [2] .\n\nOn the other hand, software programs that aim to modify lifestyle and manage the users' health conditions using digital data acquired by apps, but are not categorized as programmed medical devices (digital health apps) are called as \"digital behavior modification apps\" (Healthcare app) (Fig.  2 )  [15] . The most important risk and outcome measure in these 'healthcareto-health' digital health domains is BP, and BPV (BP variability) is considered the core biomarker of digital healthcare."

      "title": "The resonance hypothesis of BP surge, basic concept of personalized and optimized anticipation medicine",
      "text": "The goal of our research on digital hypertension research is to establish \"personalized and optimized Anticipation Medicine\" (Fig.  3 )  [16, 17]  that can predict the dynamic surge in BP that triggers cardiovascular events by accumulating time-series data on BPV in real-time, along with multi-bioenvironmental signals in individuals. The aim is to reduce the onset of cardiovascular events. This research is based on \"the resonance hypothesis of BP surge\"  [1, 18] . \"The resonance hypothesis of BP surge\" is a concept that postulates the synchronization and resonance of pulse waves when different BPVs occur simultaneously in a person, leading to generation of a critically large dynamic BP surge in BP (Fig.  4 ). Specifically, peak BPs at different time phases (beat-by-beat, diurnal, day-by-day, seasonal, and yearly) synchronize when various pressor factors (e.g., temperature, mental stress, sleep apnea, exercise) coincide and occur simultaneously, producing a huge dynamic BP surge in BP that can lead to cardiovascular disease.(Fig. 4 )  [1, 18]  The BP profile over 24-h, or BP surge, is influenced by various factors or triggers (Fig.  4 ), and daytime BP and BP responses to stressful situations vary among patients. For example, the acti-sensitivity hypertensive patients (the slope of the regression line of ambulatory BP against the logarithm of physical activity) varies with the season, and BP surges during exercise are higher in winter than those in summer  [17] .\n\nThe resonance of BP surges is more likely to occur in patients with advanced arterial stiffness who are unable to \"attenuate\" BP surges  [19] . Increased BPV and vascular stiffness synergistically create a vicious cycle that can cause cardiovascular events. We have named this vicious cycle, which leads to cardiovascular events, as \"Systemic Hemodynamic Atherothrombotic Syndrome\" (SHATS)  [19] ."

      "title": "Abnormal blood pressure variability and risk of cardiovascular events",
      "text": "It is well known that hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Results from clinical studies have shown that abnormal BPV in office, home and 24-hour ABPM are associated with increased risk of CVD. One of the goals of \"Digital Hypertension\" is to achieve perfect 24h BP control by identifying individual detailed BP properties using time-series BPV obtained by BP monitors, including newly developed wearable BP monitoring devices.\n\nIn general, BP shows diurnal variation, being higher in the morning and lower during sleep at night  [1] . Nighttime BP falls by 10-20% from daytime BP, which is called the \"dipper pattern\". In contrast, there are three abnormal diurnal BP variation patterns: extreme-dipper pattern with a nighttime BP fall of 20% or more compared to daytime BP; non-dipper patterns with 0-10% reduction in nighttime BP compared to daytime BP; and riser pattern, which is defined as higher BP during nighttime compared to daytime BP 1 . All three abnormal diurnal BPV patterns have been shown\n\nto increase the risk of organ damage and onset of cardiovascular events compared to the dipper pattern  [20] . Although nocturnal hypertension is a risk factor for heart failure  [21] , riser pattern is at the highest risk independent of BP level  [22] . Nocturnal hypertension is more common among Asians  [23]  and is also associated with saltsensitive hypertension and sleep apnea syndrome  [1] . In addition, nocturnal hypertension diagnosed by home BP monitoring is also a risk factor for cardiovascular events  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .\n\nExcessive increases in BPV are also a risk. Morning BP surges are associated with an increased risk of stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and organ damage  [20, 29, 30] . Peak systolic BP (daytime) measured by ABPM is also a risk factor for cardiovascular events. In the J-HOP study, patients with higher morning BP levels (measured for 2 weeks)  [31] , especially when the morning and evening BP difference (ME difference) is large (>20 mmHg in systolic BP)  [32]  or when there are increased BPV indices (SC, CV, ARV)  [33] , are at risk of developing CVD. In addition, when maximum home systolic BP (surge BP) exceeded 170 mmHg on even one occasion (average of three measurements), the risk of stroke increased more than 10-fold compared to the stable BP group, which remained below 140 mmHg at all times. (Fig.  5 )  [34]  In analyses conducted from the view point of SHATS, increased BPV indices synergistically increase cardiac load and the risk of cardiovascular events in the group with advanced vascular stiffness  [35, 36] .\n\nThe field of health that involves the use of informa\u019fon and communica\u019fons technology (ICT; i.e. digital technologies) to support health and health-related fields."

      "text": "To facilitate the study of \"Digital Hypertension\", it is essential to develop a small, wearable, non-invasive continuous BP monitoring system that exceeds conventional ABPM and home BP measurement devices in terms of accuracy  [37] . Such a system should be able to predict BP surges and estimate an individual's cardiovascular event risk. In other words, an individual's BP, along with pressor factors, must be measured more frequently and in various situations. Cuffless BP monitors  [37]  are ideal because they are widely available on the market. Technologies for estimating BP without using a cuff include tonometry, machine learning, neural networks, and photoplethysmography with ECG monitoring. While cuffless BP monitors have the potential to drastically change hypertension management, the accuracy of absolute BP measurements during ambulatory use has not been sufficiently verified, making them not yet ready for clinical use  [38] [39] [40] .\n\nWe will introduce the latest information on BP measurement devices that we are developing jointly with industry and academia. A wrist-cuff device based on the oscillometric method (HEM6410T) has been developed, which has comparable accuracy of absolute BP in ambulatory conditions to that of upper arm BP monitoring devices  [41] [42] [43] [44] [45]   39-43 . The device fulfills the validation criteria for accuracy at rest under guidelines (ANSI/AAMI/ ISO). Additionally, the device has shown acceptable agreement with ABPM in a clinical study where patients wore both devices on the same non-dominant arm and measured BPs under office and ambulatory conditions. This BP monitor can capture daily psycho-emotional stress and elevated BP in the workplace (Fig.  6 )  [43] . In a clinical study, there was a significant correlation between wearable BP measured with this device and left ventricular mass index assessed by cardiac MRI  [44] .\n\nThe development of a wrist-type nocturnal home BP monitoring device, which automatically measures BP at regular intervals during sleep, is also underway  [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Unlike the upper arm cuff type, this wrist-type cuff device reduces the discomfort induced by cuff inflation and measurement noise. With the use of this BP monitor, a nationwide multicenter WISDOM study is currently in progress. Although the development of wrist-type and continuous BP monitoring using tonometry method is still in the research stage, it has succeeded in capturing beat-bybeat BPV and can evaluate second-by-second nocturnal BP surges (sec-surge)  [52] . An algorithm has also been developed to automatically detect BP surges based on time-series beat-by-beat BP big data  [53] . The nocturnal peak BP captured by this BP monitoring system is highly correlated with the left ventricular mass index quantitatively evaluated by cardiac MRI  [54] .\n\nAn ICT multi-sensor BP monitoring device equipped with an actigraph, thermometer and barometer that can measure office, home, and ambulatory BP using the same BP monitoring device has been developed. It can also evaluate an individual's BP response to environmental conditions. We named the individual BPV characteristics influenced by temperature, physical movement, and atmospheric pressure as thermosensitive, actisensitive, and atmospheric sensitive hypertension, respectively. Currently, a nationwide multi-center HI-JAMP study using this device is underway  [55, 56] . Algorithms for early detection of atrial fibrillation based on irregular heartbeats and pulse waveforms are also under development  [57] [58] [59] [60] ."

With the use of this system, strict BP control was made possible at home, minimizing seasonal variations in BP for months to years after the disaster (Fig.  7 )  [62] . This system can be applied to routine BP monitoring in various regions of the country, and the individual BP data can be utilized in a personal health record (PHR).\n\n( http://www.jichi.ac.jp/usr/card/research/index_en.html ) [64] \u3002 Furthermore, comprehensive BP management can be implemented by evaluating time-series individual home BP data and environmental data simultaneously and identified risks in specific situation and condition in real world.

      "title": "Digital therapeutics in hypertension",
      "text": "Digital therapeutics refers to utilize technology-based software algorithms/applications (apps) to intervene disease management (Fig.  9 ). In 2017, CureApp HT, a digital interactive smartphone app designed to help users work on lifestyle modifications for lowering BP, have been developed in collaboration with healthcare professionals and a medical software company. The CureApp HT  [72] [73] [74]  is an application that promotes lifestyle behavior change for the six components of non-drug therapy (decrease salt intake, body weight control, exercise, improving sleep condition, stress coping, and reducing alcohol intake) that have been shown to be effective in clinical studies and are recommended in the guidelines  [72] [73] [74] [75] . It involves a personalized interactive education program including lectures and advice given by \"virtual nurse\" as step 1; app supported interventions to implement lifestyle modifications as step 2; and behavioral retention of lifestyle modification as step 3  [72] [73] [74] [75] . CureApp HT supports both the patients and the attending physician (healthcare provider). Physicians are shared the progress of lifestyle modification and home BP values with patients, and the information can be utilized at patients' clinic visit.\n\nIn 2021, the HERB DH1 study that was conducted to evaluate the BP lowering effect of CureApp HT compared to standard lifestyle modification in patients with hypertension not receiving antihypertensive medication, showed the superiority of digital therapeutics for the first time in the world in a randomized controlled trial  [72] . The application was also evaluated its cost-effectiveness  [74] , and medical reimbursement was approved for clinical use in 2022 by the authorities.\n\nTechnologies change the hypertension management from 'dots' to 'line' 'Digital Hypertension' changes hypertension management from \"dots\" to a \"line\". In current 'dots' management, physicians can only obtain limited information at patients' clinic visits. On the other hand, in \"line\" management, physicians can share the information related to patients' home BPs and lifestyle outside the clinic with the help of technologies i.e., home BP telemonitoring devices and apps (Figure  10 , Graphic Abstract). 'Digital Hypertension' will more and more attract attentions and increase in importance in hypertension research field. The individualbased time-series bid data collected by using information and communication technology (ICT) in home and working place could help to realize the optimal individualized anticipation medicine to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events."
