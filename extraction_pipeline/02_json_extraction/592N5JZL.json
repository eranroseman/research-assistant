  "abstract": "The most appropriate targets for systolic blood pressure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among persons without diabetes remain uncertain. \n METHODS We randomly assigned 9361 persons with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. \n RESULTS At 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensivetreatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65% per year vs. 2.19% per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensivetreatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P = 0.003). Rates of serious adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensivetreatment group than in the standard-treatment group. \n CONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

      "text": "ypertension is highly prevalent in the adult population in the United States, especially among persons older than 60 years of age, and affects approximately 1 billion adults worldwide.  1, 2 Among persons 50 years of age or older, isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension,  3, 4  and systolic blood pressure becomes more important than diastolic blood pressure as an independent risk predictor for coronary events, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  The Global Burden of Disease Study identified elevated blood pressure as the leading risk factor, among 67 studied, for death and disabilityadjusted life-years lost during 2010.  14 linical trials have shown that treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes, including incident stroke (by 35 to 40%), myocardial infarction (by 15 to 25%), and heart failure (by up to 64%).  5, 15, 16 However, the target for systolic blood-pressure lowering is uncertain. Observational studies have shown a progressive increase in cardiovascular risk as systolic blood pressure rises above 115 mm Hg,  10  but the available evidence from randomized, controlled trials in the general population of patients with hypertension only documents the benefit of treatment to achieve a systolic bloodpressure target of less than 150 mm Hg, with limited data concerning lower blood-pressure targets.  11, [17] [18] 8] [19] [20] [21]  In a trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the rate of major cardiovascular events was similar with a systolic bloodpressure target of less than 120 mm Hg and the commonly recommended target of less than 140 mm Hg, though the rate of stroke was lower with the target of less than 120 mm Hg.  22  A recent trial involving patients who had had a stroke compared treatment to lower systolic blood pressure to less than 130 mm Hg with treatment to lower it to less than 150 mm Hg and showed no significant benefit of the lower target with respect to the overall risk of another stroke but a significant benefit with respect to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.  23 he hypothesis that a lower systolic bloodpressure goal (e.g., <120 mm Hg) would reduce clinical events more than a standard goal was designated by a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) expert panel in 2007 as the most important hypothesis to test regarding the prevention of hypertension-related complications among patients without diabetes.  24 The current article describes the primary results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which compared the benefit of treatment of systolic blood pressure to a target of less than 120 mm Hg with treatment to a target of less than 140 mm Hg."

An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored unblinded trial results and safety events. The study was approved by the institutional review board at each participating study site. The steering committee designed the study, gathered the data (in collaboration with investigators at the clinics and other study units), made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and vouches for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The writing committee wrote the manuscript and vouches for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analysis. The coordinating center was responsible for analyzing the data. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health participated in the design of the study and as a group had one vote on the steering committee of the trial."

Randomization was stratified according to clinical site. Participants and study personnel were aware of the study-group assignments, but outcome adjudicators were not.\n\nAfter the participants underwent randomization, their baseline antihypertensive regimens were adjusted on the basis of the study-group assignment. The treatment algorithms were similar to those used in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial.  22 hese algorithms and our formulary are listed in Figures  S1  and  S2  and Table  S1  in the Supplementary Appendix. All major classes of antihypertensive agents were included in the formulary and were provided at no cost to the participants. SPRINT investigators could also prescribe other antihypertensive medications (not provided by the study). The protocol encouraged, but did not mandate, the use of drug classes with the strongest evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes, including thiazide-type diuretics (encouraged as the first-line agent), loop diuretics (for participants with advanced chronic kidney disease), and beta-adrenergic blockers (for those with coronary artery disease).  5, 27 Chlorthalidone was encouraged as the primary thiazide-type diuretic, and amlodipine as the preferred calciumchannel blocker.  28, 29 Azilsartan and azilsartan combined with chlorthalidone were donated by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International and Arbor Pharmaceuticals; neither company had any other role in the study.\n\nParticipants were seen monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Medications for participants in the intensive-treatment group were adjusted on a monthly basis to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. For participants in the standardtreatment group, medications were adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 139 mm Hg, and the dose was reduced if systolic blood pressure was less than 130 mm Hg on a single visit or less than 135 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Dose adjustment was based on a mean of three blood-pressure measurements at an office visit while the patient was seated and after 5 minutes of quiet rest; the measurements were made with the use of an automated measurement system (Model 907, Omron Healthcare). Lifestyle modification was encouraged as part of the management strategy. Retention in the study and adherence to treatment were monitored prospectively and routinely throughout the trial.  26"

A committee whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments adjudicated the clinical outcomes specified in the protocol. The primary hypothesis was that treatment to reach a systolic bloodpressure target of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with a target of less than 140 mm Hg, would result in a lower rate of the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in myocardial infarction, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary composite outcome, death from any cause, and the composite of the primary outcome or death from any cause.\n\nWe also assessed renal outcomes, using a different definition for patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 ) at baseline and those without it. The renal outcome in participants with chronic kidney disease at baseline was a composite of a decrease in the eGFR of 50% or more (confirmed by a subsequent laboratory test) or the development of ESRD requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation. In participants without chronic kidney disease at baseline, the renal outcome was defined by a decrease in the eGFR of 30% or more to a value of less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 . Incident albuminuria, defined for all study participants by a doubling of the ratio of urinary albumin (in milligrams) to creatinine (in grams) from less than 10 at baseline to greater than 10 during follow-up, was also a prespecified renal outcome.\n\nPrespecified subgroups of interest for all outcomes were defined according to status with respect to cardiovascular disease at baseline (yes vs. no), status with respect to chronic kidney disease at baseline (yes vs. no), sex, race (black vs. nonblack), age (<75 vs. \u226575 years), and baseline systolic blood pressure in three levels (\u2264132 mm Hg, >132 to <145 mm Hg, and \u2265145 mm Hg).

      "text": "SPRINT showed that among adults with hypertension but without diabetes, lowering systolic blood pressure to a target goal of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with the standard goal of less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and death from any cause. Trial participants assigned to the lower systolic blood-pressure target (intensive-treatment group), as compared with those assigned to the higher target (standardtreatment group), had a 25% lower relative risk of the primary outcome; in addition, the intensive-treatment group had lower rates of several other important outcomes, including heart failure (38% lower relative risk), death from cardiovascular causes (43% lower relative risk), and death from any cause (27% lower relative risk). During the follow-up period of the trial (median, 3.26 years), the number needed to treat with a strategy of intensive blood-pressure control to prevent one primary outcome event was 61, and the number needed to treat to prevent one death from any cause was 90. These benefits with respect to both the primary outcome and death were consistent across all prespecified subgroups, including participants 75 years of age or older.\n\nOwing in part to a lower-than-expected decline in the eGFR and to the early termination of the trial, the number of renal events was small. Among participants who had chronic kidney disease at baseline, the number of participants with a decrease in the eGFR of 50% or more or reaching ESRD over the course of the trial did not differ significantly between the two intervention groups. Among participants who did not have chronic kidney disease at baseline, a decrease in the eGFR of 30% or more to a value of less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 occurred more frequently in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.21% per year vs. 0.35% per year). Among all participants, acute kidney injury or acute renal failure occurred more frequently in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (Table  3 , and Table  S5  in the Supplementary Appendix). The differences in adverse renal outcomes may be related to a reversible intrarenal hemodynamic effect of the greater reduction in blood pressure and greater use of diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers in the intensive-treatment group.  35, 36 With the currently available data, there is no evidence of substantial permanent kidney injury associated with the lower systolic blood-pressure goal; however, the possibility of a long-term adverse renal outcome cannot be excluded. These observations and hypotheses need to be explored further in analyses that incorporate more clinical outcomes and longer follow-up.\n\nThe results of SPRINT add substantially to the evidence of benefits of lowering systolic blood pressure, especially in older patients with hypertension. Trials such as the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial,  17  the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial,  11  and the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial  18  showed The systolic bloodpressure target in the intensivetreatment group was less than 120 mm Hg, and the target in the standardtreatment group was less than 140 mm Hg.

However, trials evaluating systolic blood-pressure levels lower than those studied in these trials have been either underpowered  [19] [20] [21]  or performed without specific systolic blood-pressure targets.  37 A major component of the controversy regarding the selection of the systolic blood-pressure goal in this population has resulted from inadequate data on the risks versus benefits of systolic blood-pressure targets below 150 mm Hg.  11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 37  SPRINT now provides evidence of benefits for an even lower systolic blood-pressure target than that currently recommended in most patients with hypertension.\n\nComparisons between SPRINT and the ACCORD trial  22  are inevitable, because the trials examined identical systolic blood-pressure targets (<120 mm Hg vs. <140 mm Hg). In contrast to the findings of SPRINT, the cardiovascular and mortality benefits observed in the ACCORD trial were not statistically significant and were of a lesser magnitude. Several important differences between these trials should be noted. The ACCORD trial enrolled participants with diabetes exclusively, whereas SPRINT excluded participants with diabetes; in addition, the sample size of the ACCORD trial was only half that of SPRINT (4733 vs. 9361).

The ACCORD trial showed a (nonsignificant) 12% lower risk of its primary composite cardiovascular outcome, with a 95% confidence interval that included the possibility of a 27% lower risk, which is consistent with the cardiovascular benefit observed in SPRINT. The ACCORD trial also used a factorial design that included compari-sons of standard and intensive glycemic and lipid treatment targets in the same trial. A secondary analysis of the ACCORD results showed that, as compared with the combined standard glycemia and blood-pressure treatments, intensive blood-pressure treatment alone reduced major cardiovascular outcomes by 26% without additional benefit from combining the two intensive treatments.  38 Thus, the difference in results between the trials could be due to differences in study design, treatment interactions, or the play of chance. An inherent difference in the cardiovascular benefits of systolic blood-pressure lowering between the population with diabetes and the population without diabetes seems unlikely but cannot be ruled out.\n\nIn the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes trial (intensive systolic bloodpressure goal <130 mm Hg)  23  and in the ACCORD trial (intensive systolic blood-pressure goal <120 mm Hg), the lower blood-pressure target was associated with a nonsignificant 19% lower incidence of stroke (P = 0.08) and a significant 41% lower incidence of stroke, respectively, than the incidence with higher targets. The intensive-treatment group in SPRINT had a nonsignificant 11% lower incidence of stroke, though SPRINT also excluded persons with prevalent stroke or transient ischemic attack at baseline.\n\nIn SPRINT, significant between-group differences were noted in some adverse effects that were attributed to the intervention (Table  S5  in the Supplementary Appendix). Orthostatic hypotension as assessed during a clinic visit (Table  3 ) was observed less frequently in the intensivetreatment group than in the standard-treatment group (P = 0.01), but syncope was more common among participants in the intensive-treatment group than among those in the standard-treatment group (3.5% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.003), as was hypotension (3.4% vs. 2.0%, P<0.001). There was no between-group difference in injurious falls (hazard ratio, 1.00; P = 0.97). There was a higher rate of acute kidney injury or acute renal failure in the intensive-treatment group, as noted above. These adverse events need to be weighed against the benefits with respect to cardiovascular events and death that are associated with intensive control of systolic blood pressure.\n\nThe strengths of SPRINT include a large sample size, the diversity of the population Shown are the cumulative hazards for the primary outcome (a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes) (Panel A) and for death from any cause (Panel B).

The lack of generalizability to populations not included in the study -such as persons with diabetes, those with prior stroke, and those younger than 50 years of age -is a limitation. It is also worth noting that we did not enroll older adults residing in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. In addition, the effects of the lower blood pressure on the central nervous system and kidney cannot be reasonably interpreted until analysis of these end points has been completed.\n\nThe SPRINT results raise important practical issues. Hypertension control to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg is achieved in only about 50% of the general population in the United States, which suggests that control to even that level is challenging.  39 We excluded patients with more severe hypertension, and control of systolic blood pressure to less than 120 mm Hg required, on average, one additional antihypertensive drug. In addition, the median systolic blood pressure in the intensive-treatment group was just above 120 mm Hg, which indicates that more than half the participants had a systolic blood pressure above the 120 mm Hg target. These observations suggest that achieving a systolic blood-pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg in the overall population of patients with hypertension would be more demanding and time-consuming for both providers and patients than achieving a goal of 140 mm Hg, and would necessitate increased medication costs and clinic visits.\n\nIn conclusion, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major The dashed vertical line represents the hazard ratio for the overall study population.
