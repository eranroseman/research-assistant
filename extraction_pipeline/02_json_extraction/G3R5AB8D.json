  "title": "Multimodal Digital Phenotyping Study in Patients With Major Depressive Episodes and Healthy Controls (Mobile Monitoring of Mood): Observational Longitudinal Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Mood disorders are among the most common mental health conditions worldwide. Wearables and consumer-grade personal digital devices create digital traces that can be collected, processed, and analyzed, offering a unique opportunity to quantify and monitor individuals with mental disorders in their natural living environments. Objective: This study comprised (1) 3 subcohorts of patients with a major depressive episode, either with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or concurrent borderline personality disorder, and (2) a healthy control group. We investigated whether differences in behavioral patterns could be observed at the group level, that is, patients versus healthy controls. We studied the volume and temporal patterns of smartphone screen and app use, communication, sleep, mobility, and physical activity. We investigated whether patients or controls exhibited more homogenous temporal patterns of activity when compared with other individuals in the same group. We examined which variables were associated with the severity of depression. \n Methods: In total, 188 participants were recruited to complete a 2-phase study. In the first 2 weeks, data from bed sensors, actigraphy, smartphones, and 5 sets of daily questions were collected. In the second phase, which lasted up to 1 year, only passive smartphone data and biweekly 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire data were collected. Survival analysis, statistical tests, and linear mixed models were performed. Results: Survival analysis showed no statistically significant difference in adherence. Most participants did not stay in the study for 1 year. Weekday location variance showed lower values for patients (control: mean -10.04, SD 2.73; patient: mean -11.91, SD 2.50; Mann-Whitney U [MWU] test P=.004). Normalized entropy of location was lower among patients (control: mean 2.10, SD 1.38; patient: mean 1.57, SD 1.10; MWU test P=.05). The temporal communication patterns of controls were more diverse compared to those of patients (MWU test P<.001). In contrast, patients exhibited more varied temporal patterns of smartphone use compared to the controls. We found that the duration of incoming calls (\u03b2=-0.08, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.04; P<.001) and the SD of activity magnitude (\u03b2=-2.05, 95% CI -4.18 to -0.20; P=.02) over the 14 days before the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire records were negatively associated with depression severity. Conversely, the duration of outgoing calls showed a positive association with depression severity (\u03b2=0.05, 95% CI 0.00-0.09; P=.02).",

      "text": "Mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), are substantial contributors to the worldwide disease burden and impairment, bearing important implications for public health  [1, 2] . They also have an increased association with premature mortality  [3, 4] . Mood disorders are usually recurring and often chronic conditions that typically require long-term treatment  [5] . Currently, the diagnostic landscape and assessment of symptom severity for mood disorders are primarily based on clinical evaluations, interviews, and questionnaires, which are predominantly reliant on subjective interpretations and retrospective recollections by patients and only conducted when the patient visits the mental health professionals. This framework is susceptible to memory bias and may not capture the dynamic symptomatology inherent in mood disorders  [6, 7] . Compounded by the lack of clear biomarkers and a worldwide shortage of adequate mental health resources, the treatment of these conditions has long posed challenges.\n\nIn recent years, the ubiquity of digital technologies, particularly wearables and personal digital devices, has facilitated their integration into different fields of medicine. These devices can measure various physiological metrics, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration rate  [8] . Moreover, through interactions with these devices, significant amounts of digital traces are generated, which can be collected, analyzed, and transformed into valuable information regarding their users' behavior and activities. In the case of psychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders, leveraging digital traces and the associated information holds the potential to introduce greater objectivity in diagnosing and treating these conditions as well as the possibility for continuous monitoring of patients. The emerging field of digital phenotyping harnesses real-time indicators of human behavior to uncover behavioral markers that objectively quantify, monitor, and assess mental health conditions continuously  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .\n\nSeveral digital phenotyping studies have used data collected from personal digital devices to extract behavioral features. These studies typically use clinically validated scales, such as the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)  [15] , to measure symptoms of the disorder, using them as a reference point. Most digital phenotyping studies aim to determine which passive behavioral features, gathered as participants interact with their devices, are most indicative of clinical scores. A recent review  [16]  examined 45 articles and found that most of these studies focus on a single modality. In contrast, a multimodal approach could provide a more accurate understanding of an individual's life and behaviors. In addition, many of the studies involve nonclinical cohorts or individuals who self-identified as experiencing depression through self-administered questionnaires, rather than individuals formally diagnosed with depression."

      "title": "Objectives",
      "text": "In response to significant challenges in digital phenotyping, we designed and conducted the Mobile Monitoring of Mood (MoMo-Mood) study. These challenges include the scarcity of research involving patients with clinically diagnosed mood disorders, the necessity for prolonged observation periods to identify behavioral precursors to recurrent episodes in mood disorders, and the requirement for a multimodal approach to capture behaviors from various data streams. This multimodal digital phenotyping study focused on different types of patients who were receiving treatment for major depressive episodes, including (unipolar) MDD, BD, or borderline personality disorder (BPD), as well as healthy controls. Before MoMo-Mood, we conducted a smaller pilot study (MoMo-Mood Pilot) to test the feasibility of our study design before scaling it to a larger number of participants and patients with less prevalent disorders. In this work, we explore the potential and effectiveness of personal digital devices in capturing clinically significant behavioral indicators from patients with diagnosed conditions over (a maximum of) a period of up to 1 year. The unique combination of patient subcohorts, a wide range of data streams from different devices, and an extended study time allows us to, for the first time, test the feasibility of such a study design at a larger scale and gain insights into what works and what needs to be improved for future studies.\n\nWhile study adherence has been recognized as a challenge in digital phenotyping studies  [17] , how different groups of patients comply with long-term passive data collection remains understudied. Similarly, while past research has suggested that patients with serious mental disorders have similar or even higher rates of smartphone use compared to others  [18, 19] , the frequency and quantity of smartphone use in different groups of mood disorders need to be better examined. To this end, we measured adherence based on the time each person has remained in the study (maximum 1 year). Furthermore, we used smartphone screen activity (on, off, lock, and unlock) time stamps as a proxy for general smartphone use and smartphone apps used for specific types of use.\n\nIn addition to that, we hypothesized that patients (compared to healthy controls) exhibited differences when comparing activities and behaviors that were relevant for assessing mood disorder symptoms or associated psychosocial disability. Here, we focused on 4 domains: social activity, mobility, physical activity, and sleep. Depression is known to be associated with social isolation  [20] , which can potentially be reflected in a person's communication pattern. Fatigue and loss of energy are among the diagnostic criteria for depression  [21, 22] , which can be reflected in mobility and physical activity data. Past research has used passively collected location data from smartphones. It has identified variables such as location variance, location entropy, and time spent at home to be associated with symptoms of depression  [23] [24] [25] . Finally, both increased and decreased sleep are symptoms of depression  [26] . In our study, as a proxy of social activity, we used time stamps for incoming and outgoing calls and SMS text messages through the phone network provider. Location and mobility were measured through the smartphone's GPS and Wi-Fi data, and the variables shown to exhibit significant differences between patients and healthy controls in other studies were investigated. We measured physical activity in 2 ways: first, through actigraphs, and second, through smartphone accelerometers. Sleep timing and duration were measured by actigraphs and bed sensors.\n\nMoreover, to assess several different behaviors, we focused on their temporal patterns by exploring activity rhythms and how patients and controls allocated their time to a particular activity throughout the week. The timing of different activities may contain important behavioral markers linked to mood disorders. Previous research in studying temporal rhythms of activity inferred from different personal digital devices has shown that people tend to have persistent activity rhythms over time  [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, these rhythms and their consistency are linked to personal and sociodemographic characteristics  [31, 32] . A recent study  [33]  suggests that daily activity rhythms inferred from smartphone GPS data are associated with anxiety levels in patients with MDD and BD. While we know that mood disorders impact daily activity and sleep rhythms, the activity rhythms of patients with mood disorders inferred from passively collected data from their smartphones are not well studied  [34] . This work investigates the different activity rhythms inferred from smartphones and evaluates the differences between patients and healthy controls.\n\nWe specifically aim to answer the following research questions (RQs):\n\n\u2022 RQ1: Does study adherence, that is, how long the participants remain in the study, vary between patient subcohorts and healthy controls?"

      "title": "Setting",
      "text": "We initially conducted a smaller-scale pilot study, the MoMo-Mood Pilot, to test our study design. Once the study was deemed feasible, we moved on to a larger-scale study, namely, MoMo-Mood. Other than the number of participants, the main difference between the 2 studies was that for the pilot study, participants were either patients with MDD or healthy controls, as opposed to the main study, where 2 additional patient subcohorts were recruited. The recruitment of all the cohorts for the main study was performed independently from the pilot study. In addition, the pilot study had a shorter maximum data collection period from patients (6 months) than the MoMo-Mood study (1 year).\n\nBoth studies were conducted in Finland. Patients who had already been diagnosed using structured clinical interviews were recruited on a voluntary basis from the mood disorder outpatient treatment facilities at the Helsinki University Hospital Mood Disorder Division, Turku University Central Hospital Department of Psychiatry, and City of Espoo Mental Health Services. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview  [35]  was used for the diagnosis of MDD and BD, and the Structured Clinical Interview-II  [36]  was used for BPD. The patients with any psychotic features, concurrent substance use disorder, or imminent risk of suicide were excluded.\n\nThe studies had an active phase that lasted 2 weeks, during which we collected data from actigraphs and bed sensors loaned to study participants. Different types of data were passively collected (passive data) from smartphone sensors through a smartphone app. Passive data are a byproduct of the participants' use and engagement with personal devices; they do not need to change their behavior or actively engage with the study. During the active phase, we also did ecological momentary assessment (EMA)  [37]  5 times a day. In the second phase of the study, the passive phase, which lasted for up to 1 year, passive data were collected from smartphones (Textbox 1). However, actigraph, bed sensor, and EMA data were no longer collected. Participants received a prompt every 2 weeks on their smartphones to fill out a PHQ-9. They were also presented with PHQ-9 at baseline. The division of the study into active and passive phases was implemented to minimize the risk of study fatigue and burden on participants.\n\nTextbox 1. Raw features description. Sensors and raw features \u2022 Accelerometer: x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and accuracy \u2022 App: foreground use, notifications, and crashes \u2022 Battery: battery level, battery status, and battery health \u2022 Call: type (incoming, outgoing, and missed) and duration \u2022 SMS text messages: type (incoming and outgoing) \u2022 Location: latitude, longitude, speed, and accuracy \u2022 Screen: status (on, off, lock, and unlock) \u2022 Actigraph: activity count and status (active, rest, and sleep) \u2022 Murata bed sensor: heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and stroke volume\n\nThe actigraphs we used did not need to be recharged for 14 days, allowing us to provide fully charged devices to participants without recharging during the active phase. In addition, PHQ-9 asks about depression symptoms in the past 2 weeks, which made the 2-week period a natural choice for the length of our active phase. Given the time frames of when people typically change their smartphones or the operating system on the smartphones, we chose the length of 1 year for the passive phase of the study. The participants could withdraw from the study at any time. Figure  1  demonstrates the study's timeline."

No additional outlier filtering was performed. To analyze the weekly temporal patterns or \"rhythm\" of events, we aggregated these events into 1-hour bins across 8 weeks, resulting in 168 bins for weekly frequency.

For bed sensors, each 1-second epoch was given a status indicating whether the bed was occupied or free. The sleep period was defined as the longest duration during which the bed was occupied. For both sensors, records on the first and last nights were excluded due to a high likelihood of being incomplete. Nights with <3 or >13 hours of sleep were omitted, similar to previous work  [44] .

The MWU test was conducted to compare mean differences in intragroup distances, assessing the diversity of rhythms between groups. Post hoc correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure  [50]  was used to control for the false detection rate during multiple tests."

The mean age of the control group was 42 (SD 14.07) years, and the mean age of the patient group was 34.7 (SD 12.71) years. A total of 77% (23/30) of the control group were female, compared to 71.1% (86/121) in the patient group. Regarding employment, 83% (25/30) of the control group were employed full time, compared to only 9.9% (12/121) of the patient group.\n\nAt baseline, the mean PHQ-9 score of the control group was 1.7 (SD 1.49). For the patient subcohorts, the baseline PHQ-9 scores were 14.6 (SD 5.41) for patients with MDD, 14.57 (SD 5.62) for patients with BPD, and 13.53 (SD 4.73) and 13.53 (SD 4.73) for patients with BD. Figure  2  shows PHQ-9 distribution for the control and patient groups. More detailed information about group-level PHQ-9 score distributions and trajectories for the active phase are reported elsewhere  [14] ."

Adherence declined over time throughout the study; by the end of study week 8, in total 65.7% (99/151) of enrolled participants were still providing questionnaire answers and were thus considered active in the study. At this point in time, the adherence rates for different subcohorts were as follows: 50% (12/24) for patients with BPD, 52% (16/30) for controls, 74% (56/76) for patients with MDD, and 83% (17/21) for patients with BD. Figure  3A  shows the adherence rates and proportion of PHQ-9 answered across the groups throughout the study's passive phase. In addition, survival analysis using the log rank test did not reveal significant differences in adherence levels between all groups. Figure  3B  shows the survival curve depicting the adherence rate assessed with PHQ-9 data. Supplementary survival analysis using smartphone battery data is presented in Figure  S1  in Multimedia Appendix 1. As an additional data quality assessment, we evaluated the data completeness by counting the proportion of missing intermittent daily passive data. We used battery data availability as a proxy for passively sensed data, considering the day as missing if no battery data were available. Combining the active and passive phases, the average passive data missingness across all participants is 10.5%, and more specifically, 4.5% for BD, 20.4% for BPD, 1.2% for control, and 14.1% for MDD groups.\n\nFor each participant we calculated the total number of days with no battery data divided by the number days that participant was in the study. We then calculated the average of these percentages for all participants in a given group to derive the average percentages of passive data missingness."

Higher homogeneity of behavior within a group indicates that members exhibit similar behaviors. To compare within-group similarity, we calculated the cosine distance between individuals' average weekly rhythms within each group (patients-patients and controls-controls). We applied the MWU test to determine significant differences between groups' mean distances, thus evaluating internal group consistency. The analysis timeframe was limited to 8 weeks to ensure a consistent evaluation of temporal patterns.\n\nFigure  9  shows the relative within-group distance for each of the groups. Patients established a more homogenous communication rhythm than the controls, meaning that their time allocation for communication was more similar to one another compared to how the healthy controls compared to each other (MWU test, call: P<.001; SMS text message: P=.04). Because most patients did not have full-time jobs at the time of the study, we also examined the potential confounders by composing the same analysis only on the participants who had full-time jobs. Nonetheless, the previous results persisted, meaning employment did not play a significant role in maintaining communication rhythms. By contrast, patients exhibited less consistent smartphone use rhythms compared to controls (MWU test P=.002). However, among participants with full-time jobs, controls displayed less consistency in smartphone use than patients (MWU test P=.002). Patients exhibited more consistency in activity rhythms captured by accelerometers than controls, across both the entire sample and the group of full-time employed individuals (MWU test P<.001)."

For communication patterns, the duration of incoming calls was negatively associated with depression symptoms (\u03b2=-0.08, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.04; P<.001), indicating that shorter incoming call durations were linked to higher depression severity. In contrast, the duration of outgoing calls was positively associated with depression symptoms (\u03b2=0.05, 95% CI 0-0.09; P=.02), suggesting that longer outgoing call durations were associated with greater depression severity. For physical activity data, the SD of activity magnitude in the morning was negatively associated with depression symptoms (\u03b2=-2.05, 95% CI -4.18 to -0.20; P=.02)."

Our analysis of smartphone use patterns did not reveal significant differences between the groups in terms of the daily quantity of smartphone use. However, the weekly temporal patterns revealed distinct preferences, such that the control group typically made or received calls in the afternoon. Furthermore, we initially hypothesized that patients would exhibit notable differences in activities and behaviors crucial for assessing mood disorder symptoms or associated psychosocial disability across 4 domains: social activity, sleep, physical activity, and mobility. Our findings partially supported this hypothesis, as we found significant differences in mobility and location patterns, particularly in terms of normalized entropy and variance of locations during weekdays. However, the groups showed no notable differences in sleep, social, and physical activity patterns.\n\nThe within-group temporal rhythm analysis revealed more nuanced findings. The patient group demonstrated more similar communication and physical activity rhythms to one another than the control group. By contrast, patients showed more varied rhythms in smartphone screen use. Interestingly, this trend for the smartphone screen patterns reversed when we took employment status into account.\n\nUsing passive data to predict the severity of depression symptoms, we found that depression severity was negatively associated with the duration of incoming calls and accelerometer magnitude variability but positively associated with the duration of outgoing calls."

      "title": "Implications",
      "text": "The similarity in smartphone engagement between patients and controls validates the potential of smartphone data as a reliable source for finding new behavioral markers. Notably, despite being mildly to moderately clinically depressed, the patients remained actively engaged with their smartphones. Furthermore, the analysis supports the value of smartphone data in capturing temporal behavioral patterns and reveals differences in behavioral rhythms, including communication and screen use patterns. However, low adherence rates limit the generalizability of this methodology.\n\nIn contrast to prior research  [10] , our study did not confirm the significance of sleep duration in detecting depression symptoms, although it is well known that both insomnia and hypersomnia are symptoms of depression  [21] . In the future, we will conduct a more fine-grained analysis focusing on the disturbances and individual differences in sleep.\n\nOur exploration of weekday and weekend mobility patterns and location features revealed a significant difference in weekday normalized entropy and location variance between the groups. These findings are consistent with prior research, such as the studies by Saeb et al  [23, 24] , which identified a significant correlation between depression scores and location features, including location variance and location entropy. The importance of mobility and location data is also supported by previous literature  [10, 51, 52] , recognizing these data as crucial components in modeling depression severity.\n\nWhen examining the similarity of behavior among patients and among healthy controls, we found that, across 3 different activity types-communication via calls and SMS text messages, and smartphone acceleration-patients displayed more similar behaviors to one another. These results persisted even when controlling for the participant's employment status. This highlights the importance of temporality and temporal behavioral features as behavioral markers for mood disorders. The tendency for patients to engage in communication efforts or physical activities at similar times of the day or week may suggest common behavioral trends among patients. For example, this could manifest as an increased number of calls in the morning or a noticeable reduction in physical activity during that time compared to the control group. Such patterns might indicate shared disruptions in circadian rhythms, where patients struggle with energy and motivation early in the day. Alternatively, it may reflect a more structured or predictable routine as a coping mechanism, helping patients manage their symptoms.\n\nIt is essential to keep in mind that digital phenotyping studies aim to capture subtle differences and patterns in the behavior of patients and healthy controls, which can possibly be missed even by trained clinicians. Any major behavioral differences between these groups have naturally already been noticed and studied by experts in psychiatry. Our study adds to the body of knowledge in digital phenotyping. It points out essential yet subtle features that need further research and can potentially be used to expand the behavioral symptomology of mood disorders.\n\nOur findings provide valuable longitudinal insights and generalizability by representing different types of patients with major depression. It is important to note that most of our patients experienced from mild to moderate clinical depression, representing the range of severity of most outpatients with depression in health care. However, the inclusion of psychiatric inpatients with severe or psychotic depression, or individuals with BD experiencing manic episodes, might have revealed more marked deviations from standard behavioral patterns. Furthermore, patients were receiving treatment, and it is likely that, for example, the observed sleep symptoms were influenced by ongoing pharmacotherapy.\n\nOur results can help future studies improve their designs, increase adherence, and focus on the most promising digital traces and meaningful features. Ultimately, these findings, combined with insights from future similar studies, may lead to the development of tools for monitoring and in-time intervention for patients with mood disorders."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The research is limited by incomplete data, declining participant adherence, and increasing dropout rates as the study progresses. These are common challenges in digital phenotyping studies that may decrease the study's analytical power, introduce bias, and obscure longitudinal patterns and interactions in the data. The sources of poor adherence and incomplete data collection may stem from technical issues, participant burden, lack of motivation, or health status. Other digital phenotyping studies have similarly reported adherence of various degrees, ranging from 65.3% smartphone data completeness (a study with 334 patients with MDD monitored for 12 weeks  [53] ) to 99% completeness (a study with 29 patients diagnosed with BP monitored for 1 year  [54] ). The adherence may also vary between the study cohorts. For example, a study  [52]  reported average adherence levels of 84.8% for patients with BD and 66.8% for the healthy controls for daily smartphone-reported self-assessments collected over 9 months. However, in our study, adherence remained similar for different subcohorts. Our participants were not followed up on or engaged with after they completed the active phase of the study (approximately 2 weeks after the enrollment). The lack of further follow-up or feedback to the participants has likely played an essential role in our dropout rates.\n\nOur study does not include patients with severe depression, inpatients, and patients with psychotic depression. This limits the applicability of our findings for these cases.\n\nThis study is limited by the data types that we could collect. Thus, it does not capture the full extent of a person's communication (eg, communication via social media or messaging apps). Furthermore, for devices such as bed sensors and actigraphs, we relied on the preprocessed data provided by the manufacturer, which can potentially introduce unknown errors and biases."

This paper provides an overview of the study and compares behavioral patterns at the group level for the passively collected data from smartphones, bed sensors, and actigraphs. Future research should include more detailed analysis at the individual level, a deeper exploration of the parameters highlighted in this study, and an examination of the relationship between passive data and subjective data collected through validated clinical questionnaires.\n\nThe results of this study show that the mobile behavioral data, including features from smartphone use, communication, location, mobility, and sleep, collected within this study can be further used to predict and monitor the patients' depression. The group-level differences observed in this study, based on the comparison of rhythms, suggest the importance of focusing on extracting temporal features from behavioral data. Therefore, further studies are required to validate these findings. We have released an open-source behavioral data analysis toolbox, Niimpy  [45] , to facilitate the studies and encourage researchers to use and further develop it. Furthermore, we propose that future analyses use personalized statistical and machine learning models, accounting for the differences in behavior and sociodemographic information (eg, participant' age, sex, and work status). In the future, we will extend our analyses and explore the possibility of predicting the future mood state and severity of depression from features extracted from the passively collected data."

It also shows the important features and data streams for future analyses of behavioral markers of mood disorders. However, among outpatients with mild to moderate depressive disorders, the group-level differences from healthy controls in any of the modalities remained relatively modest, despite the demonstration of within-individual variations in behavioral patterns linked to the severity of depression. Overall, the sensors used in passive monitoring may more readily detect gross observable behavioral abnormalities, which may emerge only in the epidemiologically rarer severe range of depression or in mania. Therefore, future studies need to be able to combine data from multiple domains and modalities to detect more subtle differences, identify individualized signatures, and combine passive data with clinical ratings."
