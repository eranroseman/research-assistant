  "title": "Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring at Home",
  "abstract": "The diagnosis and management of hypertension, a common cardiovascular risk factor among the general population, have been based primarily on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office. BP may differ considerably when measured in the office and when measured outside of the office setting, and higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Self-measured BP monitoring, the measurement of BP by an individual outside of the office at home, is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement. Several national and international hypertension guidelines endorse selfmeasured BP monitoring. Indications include the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension and the identification of whitecoat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Other indications include confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension and detecting morning hypertension. Validated self-measured BP monitoring devices that use the oscillometric method are preferred, and a standardized BP measurement and monitoring protocol should be followed. Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials indicates that self-measured BP monitoring is associated with a reduction in BP and improved BP control, and the benefits of self-measured BP monitoring are greatest when done along with cointerventions. The addition of self-measured BP monitoring to office BP monitoring is cost-effective compared with office BP monitoring alone or usual care among individuals with high office BP. The use of self-measured BP monitoring is commonly reported by both individuals and providers. Therefore, self-measured BP monitoring has high potential for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the United States. Randomized controlled trials examining the impact of self-measured BP monitoring on cardiovascular outcomes are needed. To adequately address barriers to the implementation of selfmeasured BP monitoring, financial investment is needed in the following areas: improving education and training of individuals and providers, building health information technology capacity, incorporating selfmeasured BP readings into clinical performance measures, supporting cointerventions, and enhancing reimbursement.",

      "text": "ardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure, remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality.  1 Population-based studies have identified a range of risk factors that contribute to incident cardiovascular events,  2  and hypertension is one of the most important.  3 Hypertension is also a risk factor for chronic kidney disease, thereby further contributing to the growing chronic disease healthcare burden.  4 The benefit of antihypertensive medication on cardiovascular disease risk has been demonstrated in several randomized trials among individuals with high blood pressure (BP).  5 According to 2015 to 2016 data,  6  29.0% of US adults had hypertension, defined as an office systolic BP (SBP) \u2265140 mm Hg, office diastolic BP (DBP) \u226590 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication. However, only 48.3% had hypertension that was controlled, defined as an office SBP <140 mm Hg and office DBP <90 mm Hg. According to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines,  5  45.6% of US adults had hypertension, defined as an office SBP \u2265130 mm Hg, office DBP \u226580 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication. The prevalence of hypertension and uncontrolled BP status is disproportionately higher in some minority and underserved groups.  [6] [7] ] [8]  The diagnosis and management of hypertension have been based primarily on the measurement of BP in the office. However, BP may differ considerably when measured in the office and when measured outside of the office setting.  9 White-coat hypertension is defined as having high office BP measurements and not having high out-of-office BP measurements, and masked hypertension is defined as not having high office BP measurements and having high out-of-office BP measurements. The terms white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension apply to individuals not taking antihypertensive medication. For individuals taking antihypertensive medication, the terms white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension are used. Recent evidence suggests that compared with sustained normotension, defined as not having high BP on both office and out-of-office BP measurements, white-coat hypertension is associated with either no increased or moderately increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.  10, 11 hite-coat hypertension is associated with a lesser risk of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with sustained hypertension, defined as having high BP on both office and out-of-office BP measurements.  12 Prior studies have also shown that compared with sustained normotension, white-coat effect is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, whereas masked hypertension and masked uncontrolled hypertension are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.  [13] [14] 4] [15]  These BP phenotypes can be identified only by both office and out-of-office BP monitoring.\n\nThere are 2 standard approaches to out-of-office BP monitoring: ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and selfmeasured BP monitoring. ABPM is a fully automated technique in which BP is recorded over an extended period of time, typically 24 hours. Self-measured BP monitoring at home (referred to herein as self-measured BP monitoring) is the measurement of BP by an individual outside of an office setting at his/her home. There is moderate agreement between BP on ABPM and self-measured BP,  16  suggesting that these measures may not be interchangeable. Although ABPM is recommended as the preferred out-ofoffice BP assessment method in some BP guidelines, it is not well tolerated by some patients.  5, 9 Furthermore, in the United States, ABPM is not widely available in primary care settings and is generally available only in specialized hypertension centers.  9 Therefore, self-measured BP monitoring is an important part of hypertension management and an important adjunct to the evaluation and treatment of high BP in the United States.\n\nSeveral guidelines, scientific statements, empirical studies, and systematic reviews/meta-analyses have been published on self-measured BP monitoring since the joint scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA), American Society of Hypertension, and Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association on self-measured BP monitoring was published in 2008.  17 The writing committee of the current policy statement was tasked with providing contemporary information on the use, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of self-measured BP monitoring for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Although other forms of self-measured BP monitoring exist, including individuals measuring their own BP outside of their home such as at a pharmacy or kiosk, this statement is limited to self-measured BP monitoring at home. We refer readers to the 2019 AHA scientific statement \"Measurement of Blood Pressure in Humans,\" which reviews these other approaches.  18 lthough the present policy statement focuses on the use, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of self-measured BP monitoring, it is important to recognize that there is strong evidence that self-measured BP monitoring adds value over and above office BP measurement for predicting endorgan damage and cardiovascular outcomes. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that self-measured BP is superior to office BP in regard to their association with echocardiographic left ventricular mass index.  19 Compared with office BP, self-measured BP is also a better predictor of urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, proteinuria, and silent cerebrovascular disease, as well as major nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.  20 Using data from the J-HOP study (Japan Morning Surge-Home BP), Hoshide et al  21  showed that self-measured SBP added predictive value for stroke events over and above office SBP and other cardiovascular risk factors. Few studies have compared the association between self-measured BP and cardiovascular events versus the association between BP on ABPM and cardiovascular events. A recent systematic review indicated that there is a lack of strong evidence demonstrating the superiority of self-measured BP monitoring over ABPM or vice versa for predicting cardiovascular events or mortality.  22 Finally, scarce data from randomized controlled trials have examined the impact of out-of-office BP monitoring on cardiovascular outcomes, the effects of antihypertensive medication initiation on outcomes among individuals with white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension, and the effects of antihypertensive medication titration on outcomes among those with white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension."

      "title": "OVERVIEW OF SELF-MEASURED BP MONITORING INDICATIONS IN RECENT HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES, SCIENTIFIC STATEMENTS, AND POSITION PAPERS",
      "text": "Several professional organizations, scientific societies, and writing groups within various countries have issued recommendations to ensure accurate assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines supported the use of out-of-office BP measurements, including self-measured BP monitoring, to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and to manage treated hypertension in conjunction with telehealth counseling or clinical interventions (Class of Recommendation I; Level of Evidence A).  5  This guideline stated that it is reasonable to use self-measured BP monitoring to identify whitecoat hypertension and masked hypertension and may be reasonable to use self-measured BP monitoring to identify white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension among individuals who meet other criteria (Table  1 ). It is also reasonable to use self-measured BP monitoring to monitor the progression of white-coat hypertension to sustained hypertension. Figures  1  and  2  show diagnostic algorithms from the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for using outof-office BP monitoring, including self-measured BP monitoring to identify white-coat effect and masked hypertension, as well as white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension.  5 Unlike other guidelines,  ABPM indicates ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; BP, blood pressure; and HBPM, home blood pressure monitoring (ie, self-measured blood pressure monitoring). Reprinted from Whelton et al.  5  Copyright \u00a9 2017, American Heart Association, Inc.\n\nthe 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines proposed that out-of-office BP monitoring be undertaken to identify these BP phenotypes after 3 months of lifestyle modification. Although ABPM is generally accepted as the preferred out-of-office BP measurement method, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines considered self-measured BP monitoring to be a more a practical approach than ABPM in clinical practice, particularly for individuals taking antihypertensive medication.\n\nIn addition to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, 5 several other guidelines, scientific statements, and position papers in the United States include recommendations for performing self-measured BP monitoring (Table  2 ).  18, [23] [24] 4] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  In 2008, a position paper from the American Society of Hypertension recommended using self-measured BP monitoring to confirm the diagnosis of high BP, to detect white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension, and to evaluate BP in response to treatment.  25 In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended using self-measured BP monitoring to confirm the diagnosis of high BP when ABPM is not feasible.  24 A recent 2018 AHA scientific statement on resistant hypertension also stated that self-measured BP monitoring can be used to exclude the white-coat effect, a requirement for confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension.  23 elf-measured BP monitoring is also recommended in guidelines and scientific statements in several countries or regions outside of the United States (Table  2 ).  [26] [27] ] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  In general, there is consensus among these guidelines or scientific statements on self-measured BP monitoring. These guidelines and scientific statements provide strong support for and greater use of out-of-office BP monitoring, including self-measured BP monitoring.\n\nIndications for self-measured BP monitoring in international guidelines and scientific statements include the diagnosis of hypertension; detection of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension; determination of BP control during hypertension treatment, including assessing for white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension; exclusion of false resistant hypertension (ie, having resistant hypertension based on office BP but with controlled out-of-office BP); Downloaded from  http://ahajournals.org  by on June 8, 2025 July 28, 2020 Circulation. 2020;142:e42-e63.

Improve patient engagement with longterm treatment. Hypertension Canada (formerly Canadian Hypertension Education Program) (2018) 27 Diagnose high BP. Use regularly for patients with high BP who have diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, suspected nonadherence, demonstrated white-coat effect, and masked hypertension. Repeat self-measured BP monitoring to confirm white-coat hypertension. Self-measured BP monitoring is recommended if ABPM is not tolerated or not readily available or because of patient preference. HOPE Asia Network (2017) 28 When a discrepancy exists in the diagnosis of high BP between the office and home settings, results from self-measured BP monitoring have priority. When possible, confirm by ABPM. Other indications include improving adherence and aiding chronotherapy of high BP by identifying isolated morning hypertension. Information and communication technology-based self-measured BP monitoring may help those in remote Asian regions. Taiwan Society of Cardiology and the Taiwan Hypertension Society (2017) 29 Diagnosis of hypertension depends on office BP, complemented by self-measured BP monitoring and ABPM. Confirm white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension; evaluate efficacy of antihypertensive drugs at different times of the day; and assess midterm and long-term BP. National Blood Pressure and Vascular Disease Advisory Committee, an expert committee of the National Heart Foundation of Australia (2016) 30 If office BP is \u2265140/90 mm Hg or high BP is suspected, ABPM or self-measured BP monitoring should be offered to confirm the BP level because out-of-office BP is a stronger predictor of outcome than office BP measurement. Australian Expert Consensus Statement (2015) 31 Self-measured BP monitoring provides a more reliable estimate of BP predicting risk than office BP. Can be used to detect white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension; is a reliable estimate of the effectiveness of antihypertensive medication treatment; may empower patients with BP management, including adherence to therapy; and should be considered for routine use in the clinical management of hypertension. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence UK (2011) 32 Confirm the diagnosis of high BP; consider ABPM or self-measured BP monitoring as an adjunct to office BP to monitor response to treatment. If a person is unable to tolerate ABPM, self-measured BP monitoring is a suitable alternative to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.

The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines 5 used \u2265130/80 mm Hg as the threshold for having high BP on self-measured BP monitoring because this is the BP threshold that corresponds to the recommended threshold in the guideline of 130/80 mm Hg for defining high BP in the office setting (Table  3 ).

      "text": "A more detailed description of self-measured BP monitoring technique and device accuracy is included in the 2019 AHA scientific statement  18  \"Measurement of Blood Pressure in Humans.\" Self-measured BP typically is obtained by an individual using an oscillometric device.  9 Self-measured BP monitoring devices that automatically inflate and deflate the BP cuff are preferred over ones that require manual inflation and deflation by the patient because the former devices are easier to use. Upper arm self-measured BP monitoring devices that measure BP in the brachial artery should be used with appropriately sized cuffs. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2010)  indicate that 52% of men and 38% of women with hypertension require a cuff size different from a standard adult-sized BP cuff.  37 Upper arm self-measured BP monitoring devices are preferred over wrist devices. Some wrist devices have been validated, but most guidelines and scientific statements do not recommend their routine use because of a higher likelihood of errors associated with incorrect positioning.  18 Wrist devices, however, are useful for individuals whose arms do not fit into available brachial cuff sizes or those who may have issues related to using an upper arm cuff over a long-term period (ie, upper extremity lymphedema). Self-measured BP monitoring devices that store readings avoid issues related to the individual incorrectly documenting the measurements. BP readings should be printed or transferred electronically to healthcare providers. BP devices that can measure and transmit data wirelessly to mobile phone applications (apps) are now widely available. An emerging approach to BP assessment is the transfer of data from these apps directly into a growing list of electronic health record patient portals, making the data more accessible to the patient's care team so that the management of BP control is more efficient.  38"

After 5 minutes of rest, he/she should sit comfortably in a quiet room with the arm and back supported, legs uncrossed, and both feet flat on the floor. To begin, a properly sized BP cuff should be placed over a bare midarm (no clothing) with the lower edge of the cuff above the antecubital fossa. The center of the cuff bladder, which is commonly marked by the manufacturer, should be placed over the brachial artery. It is critical that the cuffed arm be relaxed and supported on a flat surface so that the cuff is at the level of the heart. Avoidance of talking or using electronic devices (eg, cell phone) is essential during BP measurements. In addition, the person should be instructed not to share the device with anyone (ie, spouse or other family member) unless the device is equipped to store readings for multiple people."

Some guidelines and scientific statements recommend excluding the first day's readings.  40 If the first day's readings are excluded, the preferred and minimum periods of monitoring should be 8 and 4 days, respectively. Several guidelines and scientific statements also recommend that monitoring be conducted over consecutive days.  26, 40 However, readings taken on nonconsecutive days may also provide valid data. Once BP control is achieved and BP remains stable for several months, monitoring 1 to 3 days every week is probably sufficient.  34"

      "text": "The 2008 joint scientific statement from the AHA, American Society of Hypertension, and Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association, which supported the use of self-measured BP monitoring for the diagnosis of hypertension and evaluation of the effects of antihypertensive treatment,  17  cited evidence that outof-office BP measurements are superior for predicting cardiovascular events to office BP. It also noted the greater availability and convenience and lower cost of self-measured BP monitoring relative to ABPM. Since 2008, additional evidence from meta-analyses in support of the effectiveness of self-measured BP monitoring as an adjunct to hypertension treatment has been published (Table  4 ).  [51] [52] 2] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58]  For this policy statement, we reviewed and summarized meta-analyses that included a comparison of the effectiveness of self-measured BP monitoring with usual care that did not include selfmeasured BP monitoring. The weighted mean difference in the change in SBP between self-measured BP monitoring and usual care was included in all of the meta-analyses, and the weighted mean difference in change in DBP was included in all but one.  55 Many of the publications also included an estimate of the effect of self-measured BP monitoring on achieving a categorical outcome of BP control. However, the level of BP used to define BP control in the categorical outcome was not uniform across the studies, and some studies used the same cut point for self-measured BP and office BP, whereas others used a lower cut point for selfmeasured BP than for office BP.\n\nThree earlier meta-analyses based on results from 14 to 30 trials reached similar conclusions that with selfmeasured BP monitoring compared with usual care, the weighted mean difference in change in SBP was lower by 2.5 to 3.8 mm Hg and in DBP was lower by 1.5 to 1.8 mm Hg.  [51] [52] [53]  Only 1 of the 3 meta-analyses found a statistically significant effect on BP control.  51 Each noted that the summary results were quite heterogeneous across trials. The authors attributed the heterogeneity to study size, study populations, study duration, and the presence and type of cointerventions along with self-measured BP monitoring (eg, educational materials or classes, behavioral change management, communicating treatment recommendations to patients, telemonitoring, telecounseling, medication management by nurses or pharmacists, adherence contracts, and prescription monitoring).\n\nSubsequent meta-analyses stratified by duration or the presence of cointerventions or restricted the analysis by type of interventions to reduce heterogeneity. In 2 more recent meta-analyses,  54, 55  self-measured BP monitoring alone without cointerventions versus usual care was associated with a statistically significant greater reduction in mean SBP (3.9 mm Hg 54 and 4.9 mm Hg  55  ) at 6 months but not at 12 months (1.5 mm Hg  54  and 0.1 mm Hg  55  ).

Healthcare costs may go up as patients seek medical evaluation from increased anxiety resulting from preoccupation with their self-measured BP."

      "text": "Potential healthcare cost savings are associated with self-measured BP monitoring, including the reduction in office visit follow-ups as a result of improved BP control; avoidance of possible overtreatment in patients who have self-measured BP that is lower than office BP, including those with white-coat hypertension; reduction in cardiovascular events; improvement in quality of life; and reduction in lost wages and earnings. Scarce data exist on the cost-effectiveness of selfmeasured BP monitoring versus ABPM among individuals with hypertension who are undergoing treatment. Only a few studies, which are described here, have compared the cost-effectiveness of self-measured BP monitoring with ABPM for diagnosing hypertension. Using a Markov-based probabilistic cost-effective analysis, Lovibond et al  59  estimated lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and cost-effectiveness in a hypothetical UK primary-care population \u226540 years of age with high screening office BP. ABPM was cost saving and resulted in improved health outcomes compared with self-measured BP monitoring and office BP monitoring. The intervention and healthcare costs of self-measured BP monitoring were similar to those of office BP monitoring. Therefore, ABPM was the most cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of hypertension for all sex/ age groups. When the sensitivity and specificity of selfmeasured BP monitoring were assumed to be equal to those of ABPM, self-measured BP monitoring was the most cost-effective strategy. This is an important finding because there is lack of strong evidence demonstrating the superiority of self-measured BP monitoring or ABPM over the other approach for predicting cardiovascular events or mortality.  22 Furthermore, when followup screening was conducted annually, self-measured BP monitoring was the most cost-effective strategy, particularly among younger groups (<60 years of age)."

The authors assumed that patients would cover the cost of their devices. The study estimated that medical expenditures could be reduced by US $1.56 million per 1000 patients over 5 years and attributed the savings to the avoidance of unnecessary antihypertensive medications among patients with white-coat hypertension.\n\nArrieta et al  62  developed a decision-analysis model to estimate the ROI from an insurer perspective comparing self-measured BP monitoring with office BP monitoring for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. The study population included members of a private employee plan (20-44 and 45-64 years of age) and members of a Medicare Advantage plan (\u226565 years of age) in the United States. The reimbursement costs of devices plus the costs of an awareness-raising campaign to educate members about the availability of reimbursement were taken into consideration. For the private plan members, reimbursement of self-measured BP monitoring had a 1-year net savings of $33.75 per member 20 to 44 years of age (ROI, $0.94) and $32.65 per member 45 to 64 years of age (ROI, $0.85). Through 10 years, these net savings increased to $414.81 per member 20 to 44 years of age (ROI, $8.37) and $439.14 per member 45 to 64 years of age (ROI, $7.50). In the first year for the Medicare Advantage plan members, net savings per member were $166.17 (ROI, $3.75) and $1364.27 (ROI, $19.34) by year 10. For the diagnosis of hypertension, the ROIs steadily increased over 10 years for all age groups in both plans. For subsequent treatment of hypertension, the ROIs also steadily increased over 10 years for individuals who were 45 to 64 years of age and those \u226565 years of age. The ROIs were the highest in the latter group.\n\nIn a systematic review, Jacob et al  63  identified studies that compared self-measured BP monitoring with usual care. Self-measured BP monitoring was classified into 1 of 3 types: self-measured BP monitoring with cointerventions (8 studies), self-measured BP monitoring with team-based care (10 studies), and self-measured BP monitoring alone (9 studies). The cost-effectiveness of each type of self-measured BP monitoring was estimated by converting reductions in SBP to quality-adjusted life-years. Most of the studies included individuals with high BP, and self-measured BP monitoring primarily was used to treat hypertension. Self-measured BP monitoring alone was not found to be cost-effective, whereas self-measured BP monitoring with cointerventions and self-measured BP monitoring with team-based care were cost-effective. Estimated median costs per quality-adjusted life-year saved were $2800 to $4000 for self-measured BP monitoring with cointerventions and $7500 to $10 800 for self-measured BP monitoring with team-based care.\n\nPenaloza-Ramos et al  64  conducted a Markov probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the TASMIN-SR randomized controlled trial (Targets and Self-Management for the Control of Blood Pressure in Stroke and At Risk Groups), which included UK participants with hypertension and a history of stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease. Participants were randomly assigned to self-management, consisting of self-measured BP monitoring and self-titration of antihypertensive drugs, or to usual care. The analysis was restricted to those \u226570 years of age and was extrapolated up to 30 years. The results indicated a high probability of self-management of BP being cost-effective compared with usual care at different willingness-to-pay thresholds."

They identified 23 randomized controlled trials published up to February 2012, with 6 studies having performed economic analyses with 8 comparisons of self-measured BP telemonitoring costs versus usual care costs: 4 comparisons (2 studies  66, 67  ) included only intervention costs, 1 comparison (1 study  68  ) included only healthcare costs, and 3 comparisons (3 studies  [69] [70] [71]  ) included both intervention and healthcare costs. Most of the studies included individuals with high BP. Across the 8 comparisons, the cost was significantly higher in the self-measured BP telemonitoring than in the usual care group. Heterogeneity between the studies was significantly high (I 2 = 99.6%, P<0.001). The mean incremental costeffectiveness ratio, defined as the cost per additional 1-mm Hg reduction in BP, was 406.23 euros for SBP and 829.02 euros for DBP. When only healthcare costs were considered, self-measured BP telemonitoring was considered to be cost-effective, with a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 32.21 euros for SBP and 24.69 euros for DBP. These findings suggest that telemonitoring technologies should be less costly before self-measured BP telemonitoring is costeffective.\n\nA subsequent cost-effectiveness study of a cluster randomized trial among individuals with uncontrolled BP showed that self-measured BP telemonitoring and pharmacist care were associated with a reduction in SBP of 9.7 mm Hg and a reduction in DBP of 5.1 mm Hg relative to usual care.  72 Healthcare costs did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. On average, the intervention cost $7337 per person achieving BP control, $139 per 1-mm Hg reduction in SBP, and $265 per 1-mm Hg reduction in DBP."

As reviewed in the Overview of Self-Measured BP Monitoring Indications in Recent Hypertension Guidelines, Scientific Statements, and Position Papers section, national and international guidelines have recommended using self-measured BP monitoring for the routine diagnosis and management of hypertension. Studies published since the 2008 joint scientific statement from the AHA, American Society of Hypertension, and Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association 17 indicate that the use of self-measured BP monitoring in the United States is common, particularly among individuals with hypertension. However, little information is available on how self-measured BP monitoring is systematically used by patients and whether it is tied to a person's system of care. Furthermore, what proportion of self-measured BP monitoring devices being used are validated, whether patients are being trained to selfmeasure their BP using evidence-based self-measured BP monitoring protocols, and to what extent providers are making these recommendations to their patients remain unknown. Self-Measured BP Monitoring Reported by Individuals Using combined data from the 2005 and 2008 Health-Styles mailed surveys, Ayala et al 73 showed that, by selfreport, the prevalence of regular use of self-measured BP monitoring, defined as daily, weekly, or monthly, was 43.2% among adults with hypertension (n=3739). There was a 14.2% (95% CI, 9.2-17.0) relative increase from 2005 to 2008 in the prevalence of regular use of self-measured BP monitoring among adults with hypertension. Using data from the nationally representative NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2009 to 2010, Ostchega et al  74  evaluated the prevalence of self-measured BP monitoring in US adults. The prevalence of self-measured BP monitoring increased with older age and was greater in people who were overweight or obese, had a greater family income-to-poverty ratio, had a higher number of visits to a healthcare professional, or had health insurance. In a subsequent study using NHANES 2011 to 2014 data, Ostchega et al 75 estimated that 38.7% of adults with hypertension (16.7% overall) engaged in self-measured BP monitoring at least monthly. Healthcare providers' recommendation to engage in self-measured BP monitoring was associated with a higher frequency of selfmeasured BP monitoring use."

Survey questions included having a written policy for training patients to obtain accurate self-measured BP measurements, distributing instructional materials for self-measured BP monitoring in newly diagnosed or uncontrolled patients with hypertension, and designating a care team member to train patients to obtain accurate self-measured BP readings. The study revealed that 27.6% of primary care clinics had a written policy for training patients in self-measured BP monitoring, 36.6% distributed written instructional materials to patients for self-measured BP monitoring, and 48.8% designated a team member to provide training to patients on self-measured BP monitoring.\n\nAlthough a high percentage of clinicians report using self-measured BP monitoring with patients, a smaller subset have policies and systems in place to ensure that selfmeasured BP monitoring is recommended for all appropriate patients.

Self-measured BP monitoring is an evidence-based approach for measuring out-of-office BP and is considered to be part of the routine diagnosis and management of hypertension. US and international guidelines and scientific statements recommend self-measured BP monitoring for the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension and the identification of whitecoat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Recommendations also include evaluating BP in response to hypertension treatment, confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension, and detecting morning hypertension. Successful self-measured BP monitoring includes the use of validated automated devices with a properly sized cuff and a standardized measurement and monitoring protocol. Self-measured BP monitoring is a more practical approach than ABPM in clinical practice. The use of self-measured BP monitoring is associated with a reduction in BP and improved BP control, and the benefits of BP lowering with self-measured BP monitoring are greatest when it is conducted with cointerventions. Evidence has indicated that self-measured BP monitoring is cost-effective compared with office BP monitoring or usual care in individuals with high office BP. In the general population and clinical practice, selfreported use of self-measured BP monitoring by individuals and providers is common in the United States. However, little is known about the percentage of individuals and providers using self-measured BP monitoring with a standardized protocol for recommended indications. Overall, self-measured BP monitoring may\n\nDownloaded from  http://ahajournals.org  by on June 8, 2025 Shimbo et al Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring Circulation. 2020;142:e42-e63.

This measure is included in a number of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services quality-reporting initiatives, the Uniform Data System from the Healthcare Resources and Services Administration, and several clinical data registries.  106 Currently, this measure relies solely on office BP readings. The National Committee for Quality Assurance 2019 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set Controlling High Blood Pressure measure was updated to include BP readings taken from remote patient monitoring devices and electronically submitted directly to the provider.  107 It is a Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set requirement that there is documentation in the medical record that the BP readings were taken by an electronic device, digitally stored and transmitted to the provider, and interpreted by the provider. Self-reported BP readings from the patient to the provider are not included in the measure. The National Quality Forum 0018-Hypertension: Controlling High BP and the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set Controlling High Blood Pressure measure should include patient-generated selfmeasured BP readings but should do so in a way that allows broad inclusion of readings from a variety of provider-trusted sources."
