  "title": "Effect of Vaman dhauti (A Yogic Cleansing Technique) on Insulin Resistance in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multisystem metabolic condition induced by insulin resistance and decreased insulin production. In a low-middle-income nation like India, low-cost therapies that empower patients and build on available resources are needed to control diabetes. Hence, we have evaluated the feasibility and impact of Vaman dhauti (kriya yoga, i.e., a yogic cleansing technique) on insulin resistance and other outcomes in patients with T2DM. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 participants with T2DM were randomly allocated into kriya group (n = 50) and control group (n = 50). The kriya group underwent vaman dhauti twice a week for 2 weeks along with routine naturopathy treatments, and the control group underwent routine naturopathy treatments alone for the same period at a residential yoga and naturopathy medical college and hospital. Insulin resistance, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate (PR) were assessed before and after the intervention period. Pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), rate pressure product (RPP), and double product (Do-P) were derived by a standard formula. Results: Kriya yoga (vaman dhauti) participants had a significantly greater reduction in HOMA-IR after 2 weeks of intervention compared with the control group participants. Conclusions: Two weeks of vaman dhauti reduces HOMA-IR and plasma glucose level in patients with T2DM. This is the first study reporting the effects of vaman dhauti on altering the insulin resistance. However, further long-term studies with larger sample size are needed to validate the results of the study.",

      "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a multisystem metabolic condition induced by insulin resistance and decreased insulin production. It is a common disorder with increasing prevalence due to lack of physical activity and increased degrees of obesity. Muscle, liver, and fat cells are among the bodily cells affected by insulin resistance; as a result, even at high insulin levels, these cells are unable to respond to insulin. It is recognized as a complex, chronically positive energy balance-driven disorder of the cardiorenal system and metabolism.  1, 2 ccording to International Diabetes Federation, currently, 537 million persons between the ages of 20 and 79 are thought to have diabetes. This represents 10.5% of the world's population in this age-group. India has the second-highest prevalence of diabetes worldwide, at 77.0 million people.  3 The total estimated prevalence of diabetes was 11.4% in India, and the prevalence of prediabetes was 15.3%, with a considerably higher prevalence of 16.4% in urban areas, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes study.  4 Oral hypoglycemic medication (i.e., biguanides, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors) and insulin-like substance injections are currently the two main therapeutic approaches for type 2 diabetes. Both have adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, syncope, drowsiness, headache, hypersensitive reaction, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, peripheral edema, and cardiac failure. Because of these adverse effects, high costs, and the requirement for continuous administration to prevent glucose fluctuations, their widespread adoption is still limited.  2 Hence, nonpharmacological interventions such as lifestyle modification and yoga (i.e., kriya yoga techniques) have been shown to be beneficial in controlling type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without any adverse effects. Over the past 4000 years, yoga has been growing in popularity in India as a noninvasive, traditional mind-body practice.  5 In yoga, Shatkriya (six cleansing practices) is described to balance an individual's constitution and promote health and well-being by purifying the entire body. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika recommends Shatkriya before pranayama, which includes dhauti (internal cleansing), basti, neti, trataka, nauli, and kapalabhati. The most popular forms of dhauti include vaman dhauti, also known as kunjala kriya, which includes drinking warm saline water and voluntarily inducing vomiting to clear the contents of the stomach.  6 Previous studies suggest that shatkarma techniques (i.e., kapalabhati, kala neti, and vaman dhauti) have been effective in reducing random serum glucose and serum cholesterol.  7 Another comparative study of vamana and virechana karma along with Ayurvedic procedures caused a marked reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) and postprandial blood sugar level (PPBS) in patients with T2DM.  8 A case study on vaman dhauti along with Ayurvedic procedures helps in reducing Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and lipid profile in patients with T2DM.  9  A single-arm clinical trial on vaman karma with Ayurvedic procedures has been done to reduce glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), FBS, PPBS, and symptoms of diabetes in patients with T2DM.  10  These findings contribute to the antidiabetic properties of vaman dhauti. But none of the previous studies have revealed the effect of only vaman dhauti on insulin resistance and cardiovascular parameters in patients with T2DM. This necessitates a randomized control experiment to demonstrate the efficacy of vaman dhauti, which could improve its clinical value. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the impact of vaman dhauti on insulin resistance and cardiovascular parameters in patients with T2DM."

The KG was advised to undergo vaman dhauti along with routine naturopathy treatments for twice a week for 2 weeks (4 times), while the CG was advised to undergo only routine naturopathy treatments for 2 weeks. Assessments were taken before and after the intervention (Fig.  1 ).\n\nParticipants A total of 100 participants were recruited from a residential yoga and naturopathy medical college and hospital located in South India. Both sexes with age between 30 and 60 years and subjects on conventional medical drug therapy, complementary therapy, and alternative medical drug therapy for T2DM were included in the study. Participants with acute and chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular complications, and recent history of surgery and women with pregnancy and lactation were excluded from the study. Study protocol was explained to the participants, and a signed informed consent was obtained from each participant.\n\nIntervention procedure Kriya group. The subjects were advised to undergo vaman dhauti twice a week for 2 weeks (4 times) along with routine naturopathy treatments at residential medical college and hospital. Subjects were instructed to perform vaman dhauti in empty stomach using 1 L of lukewarm water (95\u00b0F-98\u00b0F) mixed with 3 tablespoons of sodium chloride (common salt). Subjects were asked to drink the lukewarm saline water in the squatting position as quickly as possible until they get a gag reflex. Then they were asked to stand and lean forward to vomit. In case, they did not vomit, they will be asked to use their two fingers to rub the tongue as deep as possible, to induce vomiting. Once the stomach is light, they were asked to lie down in shavasana and relax for 10 min.  11 ntrol group.

The basic demographic details of all the participants are provided in Table  1 .\n\nBetween-groups analysis showed a significant reduction in FI and HOMA-IR in KG than the CG. In addition, within-groups analysis showed a significant reduction in weight, body mass index (BMI), FBG, FI, HOMA-IR, SBP, DBP, PR, MAP, rate pressure product (RPP), and double product (Do-P) in KG, while the CG showed a significant reduction in weight, BMI, SBP, DBP, PR, PP, MAP, RPP, and Do-P in the post-test assessments compared with its respective baseline assessments.

Kunjal kriya which involves drinking warm saline water and vomiting it out in empty stomach. This practice cleans the entire digestive and respiratory tract, removing excess bile, mucus, and toxins, and restoring the body's chemical composition, which results in detoxification of the body. It alleviates ailments such as flatulence, constipation, poor digestion, and loss of appetite by reducing excess fatty tissue.  11 Shatkarma helps to tone and stimulate all the abdominal organs by inducing strong muscular contractions in the stomach walls. Excess mucus is removed, helping respiratory functions. These techniques also help to release pent-up emotions and emotional blocks or feelings of heaviness in the heart caused by inner and external conflict and pressures.  13 revious study found that vaman dhauti has a cleansing effect on intestinal flora without significant disturbances, aligning with its role as a purification procedure. Pus cell count remained within normal range, Bacteroides were absent, and Escherichia coli concentrations showed a mild shift after 15 days of vamana dhauti procedure.  14 oga intervention has been shown to help in reducing insulin level and HOMA-derived insulin resistance index in healthy subjects compared with their pre-intervention baseline values. It was also demonstrated that yoga increased the sensitivity of the pancreas islets to the glucose signal in healthy subjects.  5 Yoga therapy helps in reducing body weight, BMI, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acids, and body fat percentage,  15  which might be helpful in reducing insulin resistance in our study.\n\nOur findings of the study indicate that adding practice of vaman dhauti kriya along with routine naturopathy treatments can help to reduce the insulin resistance than the routine naturopathy treatments alone in patients with T2DM.\n\nStrengths of the study This is the first-ever randomized controlled trial performed to find the effect of vaman dhauti on insulin resistance in patients with T2DM. No adverse effects were reported by the participants during the study period.\n\nLimitations of the study Sample size was small, sample size calculation was not made, and a lack of parameters such as glycated hemoglobin and long-term follow-up are the major limitations of the study. Hence, further wellplanned long-term clinical studies are recommended with a larger sample size for the better understanding of the effect of vaman dhauti in patients with T2DM."

Results of the study showed a significant reduction in HOMA-IR and FI levels in KG compared with CG.\n\nInsulin resistance is a major factor in the development and progression of metabolic-related chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, tumors, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It impairs glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues and increases hepatic glucose output, leading to increased fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia.  12 Previous studies showed that vaman dhauti practice caused a marked reduction in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), FBS, and PPBS, and it is believed to increase glucose uptake, reduce insulin resistance, and promote the function of insulin by reducing levels of circulating free fatty acids that are released from intra-abdominal central adipose tissues.
