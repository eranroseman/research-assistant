  "title": "The impact of mobile health interventions on service users' health outcomes and the role of health professions: a systematic review of systematic reviews",
  "abstract": "Background Mobile health (mHealth) tools have gained prominence in global healthcare in recent years, with demonstrated impacts on managing service users' health. While many systematic reviews have assessed the effectiveness of mHealth on health outcomes, the role of health professions in promoting mHealth adoption and leading to improved outcomes is less clear. This systematic review of systematic reviews (SR of SRs) critically appraises and synthesises evidence to examine both the impact of mHealth interventions on service users' outcomes and the role of health professions in facilitating their adoption. Methods Five electronic databases-EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Librarywere searched for systematic reviews published between 1 January 2015 and 8 June 2024. Reviews focused on the impact of mHealth interventions on service users' outcomes and the role of health professions in promoting adoption were included. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were conducted by four independent reviewers. \n Results Fourteen systematic reviews, covering 393 primary studies, were included. mHealth interventions showed positive impacts on clinical outcomes, such as reductions in blood pressure, HbA1c, and cholesterol. Behavioural improvements were also reported, including better medication adherence and physical activity. Psychological benefits, such as reduced anxiety and enhanced patient satisfaction, were noted. The involvement of health professions significantly enhanced mHealth outcomes. However, challenges such as sustainability, accessibility, and usability remain. Discussion This SR of SRs provides critical insights into the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on health outcomes and highlights the important role of health professions in promoting their adoption. While the findings are promising, concerns about training, sustainability, accessibility, and user acceptance need to be addressed to improve",

      "text": "The exponential growth of chronic diseases and the ageing population worldwide pose increasing challenges to adequate healthcare provision  [1] . The crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the practical impact of digital technologies to provide health solutions  [2] . Various digital technologies are being developed and used to help in the medical field, one of which is mobile health technology, which has been harnessed in healthcare services  [3] . Mobile health, also known as mHealth, involves delivering comprehensive medical and health aid to individuals seeking healthcare via mobile phones, laptops, tablets, and wearable devices  [4] . Using mobile health technology significantly affects individuals' healthrelated behaviours, including physical activity, dietary choices, alcohol consumption, sexual conduct, and adherence to medication regimens  [5] . There has been significant growth in the body of literature concerning mHealth over the last decade  [6] , with the United States and the United Kingdom being the most active countries in mHealth research  [7] . Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are considered powerful tools that have led to revolutionary changes in digital health, particularly in access, monitoring, education, and intervention  [8] . For example, a recent systematic review found that mHealth interventions could monitor patients' conditions remotely, deliver clinical consultation, enhance their engagement, and increase their autonomy in their health management  [9] . While there is evidence supporting general effectiveness of mHealth interventions, there is still limited understanding regarding specific service users outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, there is considerable potential for mHealth in various healthcare domains encompassing preventive measures and wellness initiatives, remote and self-diagnostic capabilities, monitoring medication adherence, dissemination of health-related information, and managing chronic diseases  [10] . Therefore, mHealth interventions have received recognition and support from global regulatory institutions  [11] . For example, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have both acknowledged the potential benefits of mHealth on patient outcomes, disease prevention, and reducing the workload of healthcare providers  [12] . The European Commission also described using mHealth as crucial to addressing the healthcare system's challenges in Europe  [13] . In the United Kingdom (U.K.), National Health Services (NHS) Digital and other organisations have highlighted the importance of mHealth interventions in managing health problems to meet the high public demand for health services  [14] .\n\nDuring the outbreak of COVID-19, mHealth had a significant impact on the management of health issues. In India, patients' engagement and utilisation of mHealth increased dramatically during the lockdown  [15] . In Brazil, Randomised Controlled Trial found that using mHealth tools to effectively communicate with the public enhanced people's adherence to preventive measures for COVID-19  [16] . Similarly, in Australia, mHealth interventions were used to provide information about symptoms of COVID-19, prevention, vaccination, and changing behaviour with lifestyle modification for older people  [17] . Likewise, other studies worldwide have reported that mHealth technology successfully fought the COVID-19 pandemic  [18] .\n\nFurthermore, in the U.K., the NHS long-term plan (2019-2024) recommends that health professions be supported to develop digital literacy to use mobile access to digital services. [19] . However, the global literature from high-income countries suggests that there is hesitation among health professions to implement and advocate for the use of digital health technologies in their practice  [20] [21] [22] . This was echoed by a study conducted in Catalonia, which revealed that only 6.5% of the surveyed nurses consistently advocated for integrating digital technology into their regular provision of patient care  [23] . The reluctance of health professions to promote mHealth may reduce their potential in improving service users' outcomes. Understanding the factors contributing to this reluctance as well as the vital role of health professions in promoting mHealth is crucial to maximising the benefits of these interventions for patients. Although there is a growing body of evidence on mHealth, a critical gap remains regarding the comprehensive assessment of mHealth's impact on service users' outcomes and role of health professions in promoting its adoption. Therefore, this review aims to conduct SR of SRs to assess the current state of evidence on the impact of mHealth adoption on service users' outcomes and the influence of health professions in the adoption of mHealth on their service users."

A coding technique was employed to classify and code the identified themes and subthemes. The primary research questions and topics of focus guided the creation of this framework, consistent with established protocols for thematic analysis in systematic reviews  [24] . Four independent reviewers applied the coding framework to ensure consistency and accuracy. Any discrepancies were resolved through team discussion, and the coding framework was refined accordingly.\n\nThe coding process was progressive, with code reviews occurring at various stages. Existing themes from the reviews were discussed with supporting evidence from systematic reviews, and comparisons and contrasts were highlighted.

These interventions focused on patients with chronic diseases and substance use disorders. In six of these reviews, self-management was monitored by health professions, while one review discussed self-management without health professions involvement  [34] .\n\nAdditionally, seven reviews examined the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in enhancing communication. These reviews highlighted a wide range of communication methods, including patient support groups, direct patient-to-patient communication, and communication between patients and health professions  [32, 33, 35, 40, 41, 44, 45] .\n\nFour reviews explored health promotion and prevention interventions, focusing on promoting adherence to chronic disease management, medication regimens, and follow-up procedures.

These tools included mobile applications (apps), video calls, telephone calls, voice messages, text messages, short message service (SMS), social media platforms, video consultations, emails, video conferences, Android tablets, iPads, and web-based platforms.\n\nEight out of the 14 systematic reviews incorporated mobile apps alongside other tools, while the remaining six did not consider apps  [35, 36, 38, 42, 44, 45] . Moreover, eight reviews included SMS as part of their toolset, with two highlighting SMS as the most widely used and favourable tool due to its accessibility, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness  [39, 44] . Additionally, a systematic review  [41]  emphasised the effectiveness and accessibility of video conferencing compared to other tools like SMS, mobile apps, and telephone calls."

[36] , and McCabe, McCann, and Brady  [34]  collectively demonstrate that mHealth interventions positively impact clinical outcomes. Liu, Xie, and Or's  [32]  systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs highlighted self-care interventions, particularly those involving medication monitoring for patients with DM and HTN. These interventions significantly reduced HbA1c levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting blood glucose, and waist circumference. The positive results were further enhanced by effective communication between patients and health professions. However, the same meta-analysis  [32]  did not find notable changes in body weight, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or highdensity lipoprotein (HDL).\n\nMcCabe, McCann, and Brady  [34]  found that mHealth interventions were more effective than face-to-face interactions in reducing hospital admissions for COPD related symptoms and anxiety. However, the study noted that these benefits diminished over time, particularly after a 12-month period.\n\nVan Driel et al.  [36]  focused on lipid-lowering therapy adherence and found that intensified patient care interventions significantly improved adherence, with positive effects on physiological indicators like LDL cholesterol and overall health outcomes. Evidence from this review also suggested that these interventions enhanced shortterm medication adherence and contributed to better quality of life, reduced morbidity, and lower mortality.\n\nFernando et al.  [43]  examined DM-related risk factor management, highlighting the effectiveness of remote interventions in lowering HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, and blood pressure. However, unequal access to mobile devices posed a barrier to the broader implementation of these interventions.\n\nHamine et al.  [39]  demonstrated the usability and acceptance of adherence tools, reporting significant improvements in clinical outcomes for chronic diseases, including blood pressure, weight, lipid profiles, and blood glucose levels."

Van Driel et al.  [36]  found that mHealth interventions positively influenced physical activity, dietary habits, and smoking cessation. Similarly, McCabe, McCann, and Brady  [34]  reported that mHealth interventions were more effective than traditional face-to-face methods in improving quality of life, physical activity, and smoking cessation for COPD patients over a fourmonth period. However, the long-term sustainability of these benefits remains uncertain. Conversely, Liu, Xie, and Or  [32]  suggested that mHealth interventions had a limited impact on diet and physical activity.\n\nAdherence to treatment regimens mHealth interventions significantly improved patient adherence across several studies. Liu, Xie, and Or's  [32]  systematic review found that self-care interventions with medication monitoring features resulted in a substantial reduction in HbA1c levels due to increased adherence. Similarly, Van Driel et al.  [36]  demonstrated that intensified patient care interventions, such as telephone reminders and educational activities, improved adherence to lipid-lowering therapy. Fernando et al.  [43]  supported this, showing that remotely managed modifiable risk factors led to significant reductions in HbA1c, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure (BP) in patients with DM. Furthermore, Hamine et al.  [39]  presented a broader view, asserting that adherence tools were both feasible and beneficial, contributing to improved disease management and enhanced patient confidence. Disalvo et al.

[39]  examined the role of adherence tools, noting a significant increase in patient confidence for monitoring chronic diseases. This psychosocial improvement was marked by reduced anxiety and greater feelings of reassurance and control, which strengthened patients' coping mechanisms. In palliative care, Disalvo et al.  [41]  observed a decrease in depression and anxiety levels, alongside increased patient satisfaction and acceptance of treatment. Similarly, Mwase, Nkhoma, and Allsop  [44]  found that mHealth interventions positively affected psychological outcomes, improving patient satisfaction and support for palliative care. McCabe, McCann, and Brady  [34]  reported that mHealth interventions were more effective than traditional methods in reducing anxiety and depression among COPD patients. However, Irani, Niyomyart, and Hickman  [42]  observed that while patient satisfaction increased, there was limited evidence of improved psychological outcomes in their review. Taylor et al.  [35]  also found that mHealth interventions did not significantly enhance patient confidence.\n\nThe synthesis of findings from five out of the 14 systematic reviews highlights the influence of mHealth interventions on patient self-efficacy  [35, 39, 40, 42, 45] .\n\nThree reviews found that mHealth apps and smartphones improved patients' self-efficacy by encouraging access to healthcare services, active involvement in self-management, and fostering collaborative relationships with health professions  [35, 40, 45] . Hamine et al.  [39]  found that patients' self-efficacy and social support positively influenced adherence to mHealth interventions. Irani, Niyomyart, and Hickman  [42]  reported that self-efficacy, social support, and perceived control improved selfmanagement among heart failure patients using mHealth tools. However, Allida et al.  [37]  highlighted uncertainty regarding the effect of mHealth interventions on self-efficacy when compared to usual care."

Liu, Xie, and Or  [32]  highlighted that feedback, communication, and monitoring by health professions improved outcomes such as adherence to self-management, reductions in fasting blood sugar, and increased disease knowledge. Godinho et al.  [33]  found that communication, coordination, and counselling from health professions enhanced patients' self-management and adoption of mHealth interventions. Additionally, two reviews  [40, 45]  emphasised that the active involvement of health professions improved communication and relationships between health professions and patients, promoting relationship-centred care.\n\nHamine et al.  [39]  found that mHealth tools led by health professions were widely accepted by patients with chronic conditions, though health professions expressed concerns about workload, technological dependency, and implementation costs. Mwase, Nkhoma, and Allsop  [44]  identified that active involvement in coordinating patient care, especially decision support, reduced outpatient services and improved both diagnosis and psychosocial outcomes. Redfern et al.  [38]  underscored the critical role of health professions in developing and delivering mHealth interventions, particularly in improving medication adherence for cardiovascular disease management.\n\nAlthough some reviews did not explicitly focus on the role of health professions, they still recognised their significant impact. For instance, Allida et al.  [37]  found that interactions between patients and health professions led to enhanced behaviour changes, self-management, and motivation. Van Driel et al.  [36]  showed that coaching, advising, and counselling by health professions improved adherence to lipid-lowering medications, reducing cardiovascular disease risks. Other reviews  [41, 43]  indicated that follow-up calls post-discharge were effective in palliative care, improving patient outcomes. McCabe, McCann, and Brady  [34]  noted that the sustainability of mHealth interventions was dependent on the continued involvement of health professions, particularly for periods exceeding six months. Irani, Niyomyart, and Hickman  [42]  found that health professions' facilitation of mHealth interventions significantly enhanced patientprovider relationships."

      "text": "The findings from the included reviews indicate that the barriers to widespread adoption of mHealth interventions are varied. Unequal access to mobile devices among patients remains a significant challenge, hindering the universal use of these interventions  [43] . Additionally, the reluctance of health professions to fully integrate mobile applications into clinical practice represents a major obstacle  [40, 41] . Another notable barrier is the lack of continued monitoring by health professions, which is essential for maintaining the long-term impact of these interventions, particularly beyond 12 months  [34, 38] .\n\nConcerns have also been raised about the limitations of one-way communication tools, which may lead to misunderstandings  [35] . Furthermore, reviews identified issues such as a lack of digital literacy and skills among service users, as well as limited access to internet services, both of which pose significant challenges to mHealth adoption  [38, 39, 41] . Technological dependency, implementation costs, and concerns about usability have also been cited as complexities in implementing adherence tools  [38, 39] .\n\nTraining of health professions has been highlighted as a critical factor influencing the successful adoption of mHealth interventions  [33, 44] . Additionally, user acceptance of mHealth, influenced by their digital literacy, was found to impact adoption rates significantly  [32, [39] [40] [41] 44] ."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The present SR of SRs synthesises 14 systematic reviews from 393 primary studies to explain the impact of mHealth interventions on the health outcomes of service users. It concurrently examines the role of health professions in promoting these interventions. Covering a wide range of chronic diseases and substance abuse, managed through mHealth tools, the findings of this SR of SRs reflect the current evidence on the impact of mHealth interventions across different healthcare settings. Despite the mixed results, many reviews reported in the findings of this paper highlight the effectiveness of mHealth in delivering care at primary, secondary, and palliative levels, with a particular focus on prevention, self-management, and lifestyle improvements in primary care.\n\nThe current SR of SRs underscores the wide-ranging benefits of mHealth interventions in improving clinical, behavioural, psychological, and psychosocial outcomes. Clinically, mHealth interventions have demonstrated the ability to reduce glucose levels, HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipid profiles, thereby slowing the progression of chronic diseases. These clinical improvements contribute to a decrease in patient admissions and hospitalisation costs. Consistent with these findings, a previous meta-analysis on the comparative effectiveness of mobile phone interventions also found that mHealth significantly improves health outcomes  [46] .\n\nAlthough mHealth has successfully promoted lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity, improved diet, weight management, treatment adherence, smoking cessation, and reduced alcohol use the long-term sustainability of these behavioural changes remains underexplored, as supported by prior evidence  [47] . Consequently, investing in mHealth interventions as a complement to existing health services could yield substantial benefits  [48] .\n\nFurthermore, this review highlights the positive psychological and psychosocial impacts of mHealth interventions. The findings indicate increased self-efficacy, better adoption of mHealth tools, and active engagement in behavioural changes, aligning with existing evidence  [32, 49] . Increased self-efficacy has facilitated better collaboration with health professions and improved selfmanagement in conditions such as heart failure, DM, and HTN.\n\nSeveral reviews included in this SR of SRs reported reductions in depression and anxiety, as well as improvements in patient satisfaction, assurance, and treatment acceptance, all of which strengthened coping mechanisms. These findings align with previous RCTs. For example, Bendtsen et al.  [50]  demonstrated significant mental health improvements among university students using a mobile health intervention, while Serrano-Ripoll et al.  [51]  conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis showing that smartphone app-based psychological interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms in people with depression. However, Tan et al.  [52]  found that these psychological benefits were limited in breast cancer patients, suggesting that while mHealth shows promise, its psychological effects remain inconsistent across different populations and require further research.\n\nThis review found that users preferred SMS, smartphone apps, and video conferencing for mHealth interventions. While SMS is widely recognised as a commonly used tool in other studies  [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] , this review highlighted that the combination of these tools promotes mHealth adoption and enhances the management of health conditions  [33, 37, 39, 41, 42] . This supports the channel complementarity theory, which posits that individuals use multiple sources to gather health information  [58] . However, the effectiveness of these tools is contingent upon factors such as digital literacy, the specific features of the mHealth tools, and the involvement of health professions  [36, [43] [44] [45] .\n\nIn this SR of SRs, human-led mHealth interventions led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes, including HbA1c, SBP, DBP, FBG, and LDL levels. Studies that involved health professions reported higher adherence to medication, diet, and exercise, particularly in the DM, CVD, and COPD. These findings are consistent with previous studies that underscore the importance of human support in improving outcomes related to weight, exercise, and diet  [59] [60] [61] .\n\nThe role of health professions through communication, feedback, coaching, and counselling was critical in fostering behavioural changes and promoting self-management. This finding is supported by other reviews  [62] [63] [64] . Furthermore, the present review emphasises that two-way communication and social support are more effective than one-way tools in engaging patients and improving outcomes, aligning with the findings of previous studies  [65] [66] [67] . Similarly, a prior review on COPD demonstrated that frequent feedback from health professions significantly improved adherence to physical activity and exercise  [68] .\n\nAdditionally, this review emphasises the essential role of health professions in enhancing user engagement with mHealth interventions. Nevertheless, challenges such as access, sustainability, workload, cost, and the need for training for both patients and professions persist. These factors are critical in influencing the adoption of mHealth interventions, as confirmed by other reviews  [18, 69, 70] . Addressing these challenges is essential for advancing mHealth innovations and improving service delivery.\n\nWhile the results of this SR of SRs support the effectiveness of mHealth interventions, it is important to consider the impact of study quality on these findings. High-quality reviews in this paper  [36-38, 41, 43, 45]  provide robust evidence, particularly regarding improvements in clinical outcomes, patient adherence, and the role of health professions. These high-quality studies employed more rigorous methodologies, contributing to the reliability of the outcomes. However, lower-quality reviews reported in this paper  [32, 33, 35, 39, 40]  often presented mixed results, particularly around long-term sustainability and the comprehensive impact of mHealth interventions. This variability suggests that conclusions drawn from lower-quality studies should be interpreted cautiously, underscoring the need for more rigorous future research to solidify the evidence base for mHealth interventions."

      "title": "Strengths and limitation",
      "text": "The strength of this review lies in its comprehensive synthesis of recent evidence on the effects of mHealth interventions across diverse health outcomes. It systematically examines the role of health professions in promoting mHealth, offering valuable insights into their influence on service user engagement and clinical outcomes. Several steps were taken to reduce variability in data interpretation. EndNote version 21 software was used to manage references and remove duplicates during the screening process. Additionally, four reviewers independently conducted data extraction and synthesis, with cross-validation of the findings through team discussions and coding refinements, ensuring a more rigorous analysis. Furthermore, this review followed a pre-published protocol, enhancing the transparency and methodological rigor of the study. Despite these measures, the review has certain limitations. The search and inclusion criteria were limited to reviews published in English, potentially excluding relevant studies in other languages. Moreover, the findings of this SR of SRs are dependent on the analyses conducted by the authors of the included reviews, which may still lead to variability in the interpretation of results."

The review highlights the benefits of mHealth interventions on clinical, psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial outcomes. The evidence supports the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in disease management, health promotion, and prevention through a variety of mHealth tools. The involvement of health professions significantly improves user adoption and communication. However, key factors such as digital literacy, the design of mHealth tools, and professions engagement must be considered when implementing mHealth services. Further experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term sustainability of mHealth adoption. Future research should also investigate the factors influencing health professions' active involvement in promoting mHealth interventions."
