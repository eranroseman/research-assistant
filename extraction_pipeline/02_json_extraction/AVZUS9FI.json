  "title": "Solutions toCybersecurity Challenges in Secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications: A Multivocal Literature Review",
  "abstract": "Context: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) technology is evolving rapidly, meeting modern transportation needs and driving economic and technological progress. V2V brings numerous benefits, enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with infrastructure like Roadside Units (RSUs), which helps minimize collisions, reduce fatalities, and boost road safety for passengers, drivers, and pedestrians alike. Beyond safety, V2V improves traffic management and optimizes routes. However, these advancements also introduce new challenges. Greater reliance on IT makes vehicles more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and increases costs related to system installation and maintenance. This highlights a pressing need to advance V2V technology to enhance overall safety. Objective: This research focuses on identifying the primary challenges and effective practices within Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. Method: We conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) using tailored search strings derived from our research questions. This process adhered to all standard MLR steps, including protocol development, initial and final selection, quality assessment, data extraction, and synthesis. Results: We have identified a list of 18 challenges in the context of V2V communication. 10 of these challenges were marked as critical challenges based on the criterion of \u226520 % occurrences in both formal and grey literature. We also identified related practices for the identified critical challenges. The identified challenges were further analyzed based on different variables such as publication periods and study strategies. \n Conclusion: We recommend that automotive industries should prioritize addressing these challenges to enhance their readiness for secure V2V communication. Our overarching goal is to develop a Cybersecurity Challenges Mitigation Model (CCMM) based on MLR findings and industrial survey outcomes, assisting companies in the automobile sector to assess their readiness for secure V2V communication development.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is used for inter-vehicular communication, employing wireless mode for vehicle connections  [1] . VANET primarily utilizes two types of communication: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. Through V2V communication, a vehicle interacts with others in the network to send, receive, or exchange valuable traffic-related information, including speed, direction, road conditions, traffic jams, and accidents  [1] . For connecting to external networks like the internet, a vehicle connects with stationary equipment known as Roadside Units (RSU) (or Roadside Infrastructure), referred to as V2I communication  [2] . Sensors collect data on vehicles and share it with others through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) messaging and cloud infrastructure via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)  [3] . V2V and V2I communication models are used to connect VANET. The area of V2V technology is rapidly developing, meeting the transportation needs of citizens and contributing to economic growth and technological advancement. The growth of cities and global mobility has significantly increased the number of vehicles on the roads  [4] .\n\nIntegrating information technologies and telecommunication into transportation systems is known as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)  [5] . These technologies aim to address crucial issues like traffic congestion and passenger safety. The VANET components of mobile vehicles are connected wirelessly, allowing them to form a network spontaneously while driving. VANET offers decentralized settings for traffic data distribution without needing fixed infrastructures  [5] . The V2V and V2I use the Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) protocol  [6] . Using the assistance of another vehicle within range, a vehicle transmits safety signals to remote vehicles. The sender can still use other active vehicles if the vehicle in range cannot forward the message.\n\nConsequently, VANET equips all vehicles with enough storage and power to transmit information about accidents, traffic congestion, and emergencies to nearby members  [7, 8] . However, when information is sent over an unrestricted wireless channel, attackers can eavesdrop, alter, duplicate, or delete it. For example, attackers could alter safety-related alerts to cause accidents or fabricate fake traffic jams to disrupt normal operations  [9, 10] . Effective communication between vehicles in the network is crucial in information distribution for increased traffic safety and travel comfort  [11, 12] . While V2V has many advantages, however, it poses several cybersecurity challenges and exposed to cyber attacks  [13] .\n\nV2V technology enables direct vehicle communication, making it possible without relying on any established infrastructure. V2V technology communication applies to safety and emergencies  [14] . Information exchanged over wireless channels requires a protected environment to prevent threats on the V2V networks, such as: i. Bogus messages with fake information intended to cause accidents. ii. Leak of the geographical position and identity of other vehicles. iii. Unauthorized access occurs when malicious entities use network services without authorization or privileges. iv. Impersonation or spoofing, when an attacker attempts to pass as another node to receive messages or use privileges not meant for them. v. Denial of service, rendering resources and services inaccessible to network users through jamming or sleep deprivation  [15] .\n\nV2V technology is gaining popularity and may be used by every vehicle soon  [16] [17] [18] [19] . This innovation can increase traffic safety and reduce delays or gridlock. Although this technology has several advantages for consumers, cybersecurity challenges in V2V communication should be considered to protect against cyber-attacks.\n\nV2V communication enables the exchange of vital traffic information, such as speed, direction, traffic conditions, accidents and other safety critical data, to enhance road safety and efficiency  [1] . Many cybersecurity challenges have been reported in the V2V communication technology  [13, 15, 20] . Despite the importance of V2V technology, there is a knowledge gap in Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) studies to address practices of the challenges in general and particularly, the identification and analysis of cybersecurity challenges in this domain.\n\nThis research aims to identify cybersecurity challenges and their corresponding practices through MLR for the automotive industry related to V2V communication. It intends to assist various organizations in addressing potential attacks involved in V2V communication, achieving a higher level of cybersecurity while dealing with cyber threats. The primary goal of this MLR is to identify cybersecurity challenges and their practices in V2V communication using a pre-defined protocol, reviewing both grey literature and formal literature  [21] .\n\nMLR is widely used in the field of software engineering  [22] [23] [24]  . The identified results in the study will serve as a foundation for other researchers to explore these challenges and practices to address the problems faced in V2V communication.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, and based on the literature survey and available resources, the research presented in this paper is novel due to the clear research questions and MLR methodology. We have formulated the following research questions:\n\nRQ1: What are the cybersecurity challenges in V2V Communication from a Software Engineering perspective?\n\nThis question aims to identify a list of cybersecurity challenges and analyze each challenge to be addressed.\n\nRQ2: What are the practices/solutions that can be implemented to address the cybersecurity challenges? This question aims to identify the best possible practices for addressing cybersecurity challenges.\n\nThese questions are designed to identify cybersecurity challenges and associated best practices from different perspectives."

      "text": "Cybersecurity is the protection of various information systems, the data within them, and the services they provide against abuse, dangerous elements, and illegal access, encompassing related infrastructure, software, and hardware  [25] . Automotive Vehicles (AVs) rely on sensing, communication, and artificial intelligence, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks  [25] . As vehicular systems have advanced rapidly due to the swift progress in technology, the potential for cyber threats on these systems continues to grow. Therefore, to enhance the safety of automotive vehicles, the industry must apply cybersecurity principles at different stages to govern security, safety, and protection from various forms of damage, including illegitimate access, malicious attacks, and any kind of cyber threats  [26] ."

VANET technology employs moving vehicles as network nodes to construct a mobile network. Upon joining the VANET, each vehicle transforms into a wireless router or node, facilitating connections between vehicles up to 300 m apart and resulting in a network with a broad coverage area  [28] . Mobile internet is generated as vehicles connect to the network when entering its signal range and cease connection when leaving. VANETs utilize various wireless technologies, including WiFi, such as DSRC. There are two types of VANET communication  [28, 29] ."

      "title": "2.2.. Overview of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)",
      "text": "The objective of V2V is to share critical essential details with drivers and warn them about incidents in realtime. Utilizing Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology  [30] , vehicles interact with each other, broadcasting electronic data, including the speed of the vehicles, GPS location, route, track history, vehicle control information, steering wheel angle, brake status, and transmission state. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), V2V communication messages serve as essentialsafety messages (BSMs), transmitting dynamic information between vehicles, such as speed, location, and headings  [31] . Vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) exchange important messages, enabling applications like changing traffic routes, crash avoidance, traffic data, content caching, and entertainment, among others  [32] . V2V communication serves several purpose, including traffic management, driver assistance apps, safety, and direction optimization. With road traffic collisions causing nearly 1.35 million fatalities annually worldwide  [31] , various applications can contribute to enhancing traffic safety using DSRC technology  [33] . DSRC enables vehicles to detect obstacles, avoid traffic accidents  [34] , identify sharp bends, and alert other drivers  [35] . Vehicles can warn each other if a collision is imminent, and a traffic control system for safe overtaking, highway fleet management, can be established using DSRC, which allows vehicles to safely pass/overtake each other, maintaining the necessary distance during lane changes  [36] . A specific vehicle signals others for a lane change when needed, enabling effective traffic management using DSRC communications. To ensure reliable V2I and V2V communication among unrelated moving entities, a PKI-based security infrastructure system proposed by the United States Department of Transportation (USDT) named the Security Credential Management System (SCMS) is implemented  [37] . Attaching certificates to each message protects the communication's security, integrity, and privacy, along with the verification and authentication of basic safety messages. Digital certificates created by SCMS are utilized by approved participating automobiles to authenticate BSMs. Although the use of SCMS is recommended for the current peer-to-peer V2V and V2I communication to enable secure and trusted essential safety message exchange across entities, user privacy and security issues arising from the extensive and intricate complexity of this PKI-based system must be resolved before implementation  [28] ."

      "text": "One major risk in V2V communication is the potential for communications to be intercepted and altered before reaching the intended recipient or for tracking drivers' activities. This poses a threat to driver privacy and can compromise the security of the vehicle. In a VANET  [38] , where the wireless communication environment exposes essential data to external users or hackers, safeguarding against improper use is crucial. The dynamic changes in network topology and the high mobility of vehicles make securing information sharing more challenging. Security requirements for VANET encompass assuring data integrity, authenticating users, securing data, maintaining privacy and secrecy, scalability, non-repudiation, and addressing mobility concerns. This section delves into the research conducted on security issues in VANET and V2V communication. Numerous researchers have explored security challenges in these domains, their findings and limitations are shown in Table  1 .\n\nUpon analyzing Table  1 , it is evident that none of the individual or studies employed a systemtic process, such as Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), to identify cybersecurity challenges and their corresponding practices/solutions.\n\nThe research presented in this paper aims to identify, through Multivocal literature review, cybersecurity challenges in V2V communication and their related best practices/solutions."

      "title": "3.. Research methodology",
      "text": "We perform a Multivocal literature review. The Multivocal literature review is a research methodology designed to systematically review formal and grey literature  [21] . The term 'grey literature' refers to a broad range of informal publications, such as technical reports, blogs, white papers, etc. Through MLR, we aim to gather sufficient data to bridge the knowledge gap between academics and industry practitioners. In this research, we conducted MLR following the guidelines proposed by Garousi et al.  [21] . MLR has been widely used in the software engineering  [22] [23] [24] 47] . MLR comprises three phases. The first phase involves protocol development, encompassing the planning phase of MLR. This phase includes settling research objectives, formulating research questions, determining source selection, outlining the search method, establishing inclusion and exclusion criteria for publications, and defining standards for quality evaluation, data extraction, and synthesis. We designed the MLR protocol first that wasinitially reviewed by fellow researchers of the Software Engineering Research Group at the University of Malakand (SERG-UOM). Suggestions from the reviewers were incorporated, and the final protocol was presented at the 2nd Annual International Workshop on Software Engineering (WSE-2022), themed 'Cybersecurity Culture' at University of Malakand. The second phase of MLR involves the implementation of the protocol, while the final phase focuses on reporting findings. This study integrates primary and secondary research to provide a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity challenges and their corresponding practices related to V2V communication. To provide a comprehensive overview, we systematically integrated primary research with relevant ssecondary studies, selected through rigorous process, to reveal broader trends and patterns across the research domain. Fig.  1  presents the MLR workflow.\n\nFurthermore, we have formulated the following research questions to investigate variations in outcomes based on study strategies and publication periods.\n\nRQ3: Do the identified cybersecurity challenges in V2V Communication vary based on the study strategies? RQ4: Do the identified cybersecurity challenges in V2V Communication vary based on publication periods?"

      "title": "3.1.. Search strategy",
      "text": "Search strategy is used to select and retrieve the related sources for review. To define the search strategy for the MLR is plan to:\n\n\u2022 Construct search terms for the identification of population, intervention and outcome. \u2022 Identifying the related synonyms and spellings.\n\n\u2022 Keywords verification in the related paper.\n\n\u2022 Usage of Boolean Operators.\n\nIt is essential to outline the criteria for source inclusion/exclusion and the quality assessment checklist. We have adopted the PICO criteria from the literature as the initial step in creating the search string  [48]  as  Kitchenham (2007)  suggested  [49] . Other researchers also used the similar approach  [50, 51] . The PICO criteria involve identifying Population, Intervention, and relevant Outcomes as shown in Table  2 .\n\nResearch question is formulated as below: N. Ullah et al. Information and Software Technology 179 (2025) 107639\n\nUsing these PICO criteria, we derived search terms and created search strings based on the research questions. These search terms were applied to academic databases and the Google search engine, and we identified synonyms from the obtained papers as shown in Table  3 . As illustrated in Table  4  these synonyms are connected using Boolean operators. Ultimately, we formulated the following search string to identify cybersecurity risks, challenges, and threats in V2V communication:\n\n(\"Cybersecurity in V2V communication\" OR \"V2V communication\" OR \"Information security in V2V communication\") AND (\"Cybersecurity risks\" OR \"Cybersecurity challenges\" OR \"Cybersecurity issues\" OR Practices OR Solutions OR Guidelines).\n\nThe MLR search result and review timetable are shown in Tables  4  and  5  respectively.\n\nEach phase of the search strategy and publication selection was thoroughly reviewed by the research supervisor (the secondary author) during the research meetings. No major issue was found during the review meetings.\n\nThe search string was used in the following digital libraries for searching relevant literature:\n\n\u2022 IEEE Xplore ( http://ieeexplore.ieee.org ) \u2022 ACM digital library ( http://dl.acm.org ) \u2022 ScienceDirect ( http://www.sciencedirect.com ) \u2022 Springer Link ( http://link.springer.com ) \u2022 Google Scholar ( https://scholar.google.com ), engine \u2022 Google ( http://www.google.com ), engine\n\nWe used a snowballing approach as a post-search technique to include potential literature in the study that may have been missed out by the search engine during the initial search phase. This involved examining the reference sections of relevant publications (backward snowballing) and citing the studies chosen in the literature (forward snowballing). This approach led to an enhanced sample size as it explored more citations and references  [52, 53] . Other researchers also used the similar technique  [54, 55] .\n\nIn Fig.  2 , the X-axis of the graph represents both formal literature (papers published in conference proceedings and journals) and grey literature (white papers, technical reports, blogs, etc.) of the finally selected articles. The Y-axis of the graph represents the frequencies of each category. It is evident that more attention has been given to cybersecurity challenges in V2V communication in the formal literature, while the grey literature comprising technical reports, white papers, blogs, etc. has lower frequencies.\n\nIn"

The secondary reviewer extracted the data independtly from the 16 publications randomly choosen papers. The results were compared with the identified results of the first reviwer and found no major differences. From each paper a list of quotes were extracted, where each quote represent a list of cybersecurity challenges that are facing by V2V communications. Initially, the primary reviewer identified a list of 24 cybersecurity challenges, the secondary reviewer carefully reviewed the identified cybersecurity challenges, some of the related challenges were merged. This process yields a final list of 18 cybersecurity challenges as depicted in Table  8 .\n\nFor quality assessment criteria, each question of the reviewed studies was graded on a three-tier scale: Yes, Partially, or No. We assigned the values as follows: 1 \u2192 Yes, 0.5 \u2192 Partially, and 0 \u2192 No, for both formal and grey literature articles. Based on the data, almost 91 percent formal primary studies obtained a score of >50 percent on the QA questions and 82 percent grey literature primary studies obtained a score of >60 percent on the QA questions, implying that the both selected formal and grey primary sources are relevant to the study research questions. Studies with publication scores having predetermined thresholds (less than 3/8 for formal literature and less than 2/5 for grey literature) are excluded from further analysis to ensure the inclusion of only highquality evidence. Upon this process based on quality scores led to the removal of two formal literature articles and two grey literature articesl, yielding a refined dataset for further analysis. Details regarding publications score are based on the aforementioned quality evaluation criteria for the finalized formal and grey literature are shown in Appendix-A and Appendix-B respectively.

      "title": "4.1.. Cybersecurity challenges faced during V2V communication",
      "text": "To answer RQ1, this study identified a list of eighteen cybersecurity challenges in V2V communication as depicted in Table  8 .\n\nTable  9  presented the list of identified ten critical cybersecurity challenges.\n\nTo address RQ 2, this study identified associated best practices for the ten critical cybersecurity challenges, as presented in  Tables 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 . Each critical cybersecurity challenge with identified practicesare discussed below.\n\nCCC1: Denial of Service (DoS) attack:\n\nThe most familiar attack in VANET attacks is DoS. A hacker who conducts a denial of service attack disrupts communication between vehicles. It tries to stop the node from connecting to the network. Attackers also attempt to block all services offered to users, resulting in packet loss or communication delays  [61] .\n\nCCC2: Spoofing attacks: Spoofing is the most complicated type of attack, in which the valid signal is replaced by a bogus signal, resulting in incorrect position information for a connected vehicle. Tampering with the GPS signal can create turn-by-turn faked data, leading a linked vehicle to an incorrect location. Ultimately, this could compromise the consistency of cloud services for sustaining connected vehicle applications. The reliability of the location information is compromised, and personal information is revealed. Further, the validation of the connected vehicle also needs to be re-examined once an attack is detected  [62] .\n\nCCC3: Bogus warning messages:\n\nIn bogus warning messages, the aim is to broadcast false or bogus information in the network to create confusion, which may lead to a misinterpretation of the actual incident. Attackers send false information to vehicles for selfish reasons. For example, an attacker might disseminate bogus information related to roadblocks, congestion, and accidents to clear the road for its easy movement  [63] .\n\nCCC4: Sybil and man-in-the-middle attacks: In a Sybil attack, an attacker creates several fake identities with the aim of broadcasting multiple messages using these bogus identities to disrupt or disconnect the regular operation of VANETs. For instance, a single vehicle can broadcast messages about multiple identities simultaneously, creating theimpression that the messages are coming from numerous vehicles. This could be done to trick other vehicles into thinking there is traffic congestion and forcing them to alter their paths, clearing the road  [64] .In a \"man-in-the-middle attack,\" the attacker closely monitors communication, modifies messages, and may gain access to control the entire V2V communication, while the nodes in V2V communication believe they are communicating with each other privately  [64] .\n\nCCC5: Spamming and replay attacks: Ads and other spam communications pose an increased risk of transmission latency, which could lead to accidents. Like advertisements, these messages are useless to users. Dealing with spam is challenging due to the lack of centralized administration and infrastructure  [38, 46, 65] . Replay attacks have the unique ability to be carried out by illegitimate nodes. They involve the attacker broadcasting messages that have previously been forwarded to entities repeatedly to trick other network nodes into removing priority messages from the waiting list. Repeated replays can impact the system's performance and increase bandwidth costs. The adversary replicates the original message transmitted earlier to delay traffic. The procedure of a replay attack involves broadcasting an earlier message to achieve the current message's objective, such as tampering with the entity and location routing tables. This creates confusion for the government and prevents the recipient from discovering the sender's identity  [66] .\n\nCCC6: Real-time adversaries:\n\nIn VANET, transmitting security messages at the exact time is one of the basic requirements. When an emergency message is received by a malicious vehicle, it may delay the forwarding/broadcast of the message. Thus, the intended/neighbor vehicle doesn't receive the message at the right time to avoid an accidental situation  [46] . For V2V communications in VANET, Road Side Units (RSUs) are important nodes. Due to vehicle mobility and dynamic topology, the attacker adds  an interruption to the authenticating demand packet issued by the vehicle. As a consequence, a vehicle in need of authentication may have already shifted to another RSU for service  [67] . CCC7: Black hole, Grey hole, and Wormhole attacks (BGW):\n\nIn a black hole attack, the vehicle denies participating in communication or drops packets in between, creating a black hole. All traffic is sent to the node that does not openly exist within this zone. The routing protocol is tricked by an attacker who assumes the identity of a node that has the straight path to the destination node. This causes all nodes to start believing the fake direction instead of the route discovery process, resulting in malicious nodes intercepting data packets instead of forwarding them  [64] . The grey hole attack utilizes the concept of selective forwarding and is reversible from the black hole attack. Malicious nodes will select which packets to drop and forward, perhaps lowering the network's packet delivery ratio rather than reducing all of the data-containing packets  [64] . Actually, a wormhole is a private tunnel created by two participating malicious nodes in a network that can forward data from one node to another. It hides the real paths between them and compels other nodes to route across the established tunnel  [64, 68] . CCC8: Eavesdropping attacks:\n\nThe objective of an eavesdropping attack is to obtain private information from secure data. Therefore, hidden details can be exposed to non-registered users, and the leaked data may include the location of the vehicle and user identity, which are further used to track the vehicles  [64] .\n\nCCC9: Location falsifications: Vehicular location privacy is more beneficial in the VANET environment, as a hacker or attacker can misuse the privacy of passengers or drivers, such as the place/location most visited by a particular passenger or driver. Location authentication systems are essentialand are usually applied in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. To prevent any mishaps and ensure the safety of passengers, the authentication of location information provided by the vehicles is important  [67] .\n\nCCC10: Authentication and authorization issues: Authenticity is the basic requirement in Autonomous Vehicle (AV) networking to ensure the network nodes' safety against malicious attacks. Illegal actors may access sensitive data without the necessary authentication, compromising other cybersecurity criteria like confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Any authentication or identification process flaw may have severe consequences for the whole network  [62] ."

      "title": "4.2.. Analysis of cybersecurity challenges based on study strategies",
      "text": "To answer RQ3, the finally selected papers are classified into four categories based on the study strategies used, as shown in Table  20 . These study strategies are experiments, literature review, survey, and others. The 'others' category means mixed methods, formal methods, focus group sessions, etc. We identified different cybersecurity challenges based on the distribution of papers across these four study strategies. Our results show that in the literature we identified a list of 18 cybersecurity challenges.\n\nTable  20  shows that each study strategy identified 18 cybersecurity challenges except 'others'. The 'others' category has identified 16 challenges and has missed the two challenges CC7: fuzzy injection attacks and CC13: session hijacking. We have categorized these challenges into critical ones based on the criterion of occurrences of \u226550 % of the articles. Other researchers in the literature have used a similar criterion for the criticality of challenges  [69] . However, practitioners, based on their requirements, can define their own criteria. Based on the criterion of \u226550 % occurrences for critical challenges, by examining the data in Table  20  regarding the literature review, we identified 4, 6 and 1 critical challenges in the categories of Literature Review, survey, and 'others' category respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the most-cited critical challenge in each study strategy in Table  18  is 'Denial of service attacks,' and 'Repudiation attacks' are cited (27 %) critical challenges in the experiment. 'Spoofing attacks' is the most often cited (70 %) critical challenge in the literature review. 'Denial of service attacks' is the most often cited (78 %) critical challenge in the survey, and 'Denial of service attacks' is cited (53 %) critical challenge in the 'others' category.\n\nSince the data were ordinal, we used the linear-by-linear chi-square test to identify any statistically significant difference between the identified cybersecurity challenges based on study strategies. Because it is more effective than the Pearson chi-square test, the linear-by-linear association test is chosen when determining whether there is a statistically significant difference between ordinal variables  [70] . Other researchers also used the similar approach  [69] . The linear-by-linear chi-square test is used to identify significant differences among the challenges across different study strategies. We identified four significant differences for the challenges 'Denial of service attacks,' 'Information and hardware tampering,' 'Spamming and replay attacks,' and 'Spoofing attacks.' These results suggest that the challenges identified across different strategies share more similarities than differences. The four cybersecurity challenges were cited more frequently in surveys compared to other strategies. This is likely due to surveys typically having larger sample sizes than experiments or literature reviews. Additionally, survey respondents are often experts who encounter these cybersecurity challenges regularly in their work."

      "title": "4.3.. Analysis of cybersecurity challenges based on publication periods",
      "text": "To answer RQ4, the finally selected papers are classified into two periods, i.e., 2009-2015 and 2016-2021, as shown in Table  21 . No date bounds were included in the MLR search phase. However, papers from 2009 till the end of 2021 (End 2021 is the finalization of the search phase in our MLR process) were retrieved and finally selected based on our pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. By examining the data in Table  21 , we found that 14 cybersecurity challenges have been cited in the literature in the first period. We have used the criterion of \u226550 % occurrences in the literature to identify the critical challenges amongst the list of identified challenges. Based on this criterion, there is no critical challenge in the first period, 2009-2015. However, by relaxing the criteria, we hardly found one critical challenge. This most cited challenge is 'real-time adversaries' (48 %), i. e., almost 50 %.Between the periods 2009-2015, the real-time adversaries have the highest number (48 %), which means that real-time adversaries were the obstacle for automotive industries. However, over time, this inclination has significantly changed because we find a downturn in the frequency of real-time adversaries, which has reduced to 29 % in the second period 2016-2021. In the second period, 18 cybersecurity challenges, in total, have been cited in the literature. Throughout these 18 challenges, only two critical challenges have been reported in \u226550 % of the articles. These critical challenges are 'Denial of service attacks' (61 %) and 'Spoofing attacks' (55 %).\n\nThe Linear-by-Linear chi-square test is employed to identify any statistically significant differences among the identified cybersecurity challenges based on publication periods. This test is chosen because it is more effective than the Pearson chi-square test, especially when determining whether there is a statistically significant difference between ordinal variables  [70] . Other researchers have used similar approaches  [69] . The Linear-by-Linear Chi-square test is used to identify significant differences among the different challenges across publication periods. Six significant differences have identified for the challenges 'Authentication and authorization issues,' 'Denial of service attacks,' 'Information and hardware tampering,' 'Spamming and replay attacks,' 'Spoofing attacks,' and 'Sybil and man-in-the-middle attacks'. These results suggest that the challenges identified across different periods share more similarities than differences. The six cybersecurity challenges were cited more frequently in 2016-2021 period compared to 2009-2015 period. This is likely due to the facts that countries have been enhancing their infrastructures by adopting vehicle-to-vehicle communications technologies, which may have introduced new and more cybersecurity challenges."

    },
    {
      "title": "1) Construct validity",
      "text": "We employed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) as our research strategy, following a pre-defined MLR protocol for searching relevant literature. The MLR guidelines were strictly adhered to, covering both formal and grey literature. While acknowledging the potential threat that our search string might have missed some relevant literature, we implemented rigorous measures to address this concern. The search string, designed following MLR guidelines, underwent thorough testing across various search venues before the actual search phase. To enhance construct validity, we conducted our research using prominent digital libraries in the computing discipline, as outlined in section 2. Our search encompassed four digital libraries two search engines, and employed the snowballing technique. As a result, we achieved comprehensive coverage of relevant sources, providing sufficient evidence of our identification of most cybersecurity challenges and practices in V2V communication.\n\n2) Internal validity The cybersecurity challenges and related practices obtained through the MLR process represent the latestdepiction of the existing challenges and practices in secure V2V communication. However, in the MLR process, sources selection and data extraction process may be subject to bias. To mitigate this threat, we thoroughly screened the articles, retrieved through the search phase, based on the pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and selected the sources based on a set of quality assessment criteria. Please refer to Tables  6  and  7  for the quality assessment criteria for both formal and grey literaturerespectively. In order to ensure internal validity, we have provided a list of the finally selected publications from formal literature in Appendix -A, and the list of papers from the grey literature in Appendix -B, from which we extracted the data. Each phase of the MLR underwent validation through a systematic process and periodic assessments by the primary and secondary authors, reducing the risk of biasedness in the process of publication selection and data extraction. Inter-rater reliability tests were conducted to minimize researcher's bias during the selection and data extraction process of primary studies. A small random sample of publications was selected by the secondary reviewer, and data were independently extracted according to the data extraction form. While it was not feasible for the secondary reviewer to check each and every paper, the results of data extraction were compared with those generated by the primary reviewer, revealing no major differences, implying that the identified results are reliable and relevant to the research questions. Furhter, we plan to validate the MLR findings and to find additional cybersecurity challenges, if any, and their related practices through a questionnaire survey in the industry at the next stage of our study. A similar approach has been used by other researchers  [72] [73] [74] .\n\n3) External validity Generalizing the study outcomes poses another potential threat. To address this concern, we have identified the cybersecurity challenges and relevant cybersecurity practices from a substantial sample of relevant sources that were selected based on a pre-defined and validated MLR protocol. Further, we have not put any date boundaries or specific country while searching the literature. This may give a substantial evidence for generalization of our findings.\n\n4) Conclusion validity Through the implementation of MLR, we have compiled sufficient evidence to support our conclusions regarding the existing cybersecurity challenges and practices of secure V2V communications. We reviewed the literature in a systematic way using MLR guidelines and evaluated sources based on quality assessment criteria, thereby enhancing confidence in the identification of cybersecurity challenges and practices and mitigating threats to conclusion validity."

      "text": "The study comprehensively reviews vehicular communication, particularly Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. Through a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), we identified a list of 18 cybersecurity challenges and associated best practices for addressing the critical challengesin V2V communication, as outlined in Table  5 . Among these identified 18 challenges in total, we identified10 challenges as critical challenges based on the criteria of \u226520 % citations in both formal and grey literature. The most cited critical cybersecurity challenges are \"Bogus warning messages,\" \"Denial of service attacks,\" \"Spamming and replay attacks,\" \"Spoofing attacks,\" and \"Sybil and man-in-the-middle attacks.\"The identified cybersecurity challenges were further analyzed based on different variables such as study strategy and time. The analysis of the identified challenges based on study strategy, we found significant differences for four critical challenges: 'Denial of service attacks,' 'Information and hardware tampering,' 'Spamming and replay attacks,' and 'Spoofing attacks.' Additionally, we conducted an analysis based on publication periods (Table  18 ). We identified significant differences for six critical challenges: 'Authentication and authorization issues,' 'Denial of service attacks,' 'Information and hardware tampering,' 'Spamming and replay attacks,' 'Spoofing attacks,' and 'Sybil and man-in-the-middle attacks.'We recommend that automotive industries prioritize addressing these cybersecurity challenges to enhance their readiness for secure V2V communication. Our next goal of the research is to empirically validate the MLR outcomes through a questionnaire survey in the industry, exploring differences and similarities between MLR findings and industrial perspectives. Our overarching goal is to develop a Cybersecurity Challenges Mitigation Model (CCMM) based on MLR findings and industrial survey outcomes, assisting companies in theautomobile sector to assess their readiness for secure V2V communication development."
