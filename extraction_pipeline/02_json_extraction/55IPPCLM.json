  "title": "A systematic review with meta-analyses of text message-delivered behaviour change interventions for weight loss and weight loss maintenance",
  "abstract": "Short Message Service (SMS)-delivered behaviour change interventions are frequently used to support weight management. This systematic review examines the effectiveness of SMSdelivered behaviour change interventions for weight management. Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SMS-delivered adult weight management interventions to control groups, published between 1990 and 2018. Weight change was examined using random effects meta-analyses at intervention cessation and post intervention follow-up. Subgroup analyses examined intervention duration, SMS frequency, theory use, SMS interactivity, and SMS tailoring. Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria (2,705 participants). For weight loss interventions (n=12, 1,977 participants), the mean differences in weight change was -2.28kg (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.17 to -1.36kg). No studies reported post intervention follow-up. For weight loss maintenance interventions (n=3, 728 participants) the mean differences in weight change was -0.68kg (95% CI, -1.31 to -0.05kg) and post intervention follow-up (n=2, 498 participants) effects were -0.57kg (95% CI, -1.67 to 0.53kg). No subgroup differences were found. SMS-delivered behaviour change interventions for weight loss led to significant small to moderate weight loss and weight loss maintenance compared to control groups. Evidence on long-term effects is limited. SMS-delivered behaviour change interventions are a potentially effective and scalable intervention option for obesity treatment.",

      "text": "Carrying excess weight is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality 1 . In 2017, 52% of adults worldwide and 65% of adults in the UK were classified as overweight or obese  1, 2  . A reduction in weight can have clinically significant health improvements. Achieving 5-10% weight loss is associated with reductions in cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity and mortality  3  , with some guidelines suggesting that weight change of 3-5% may lead to clinically meaningful health benefits  4, 5  . Behavioural changes in diet and physical activity can lead to weight reductions in individuals with excess weight and reduce the risk of comorbidities and chronic conditions  6  and can be effective for long-term weight reduction  7, 8  .\n\nThe rising prevalence of mobile phone ownership worldwide, has created a new avenue for behaviour change interventions  9  . Mobile phones can be used to deliver interventions through Short Message Service (SMS), often referred to as text messages  10  . Evidence-based weight management delivered through mobile phones is potentially scalable and costeffective to support weight loss and weight loss maintenance  9  . The widespread use of mobile phones increases the potential to reach large population segments, including those from disadvantaged and less privileged backgrounds who are at greater risk of overweight and obesity  11, 12  .\n\nThe effectiveness of weight management interventions delivered via SMS remains unclear.\n\nSeveral systematic reviews have shown promising results for behaviour change and weight management interventions which include SMS alongside other components  10, [13] [14] [15] [16]  . A systematic review of weight management interventions using SMS reports a weighted mean change in intervention participants of -2.56kg (95% CI, -3.46 to -1.65kg) based on six studies  17  . However, the review includes interventions using additional components such as mobile applications or mobile linked devices such as Fitbits and studies included children and non-RCT studies. Another systematic review of a range of mobile phone delivered weight loss interventions including SMS reported a pooled effect size of -0.23 (95% CI = -0.38, -0.08) based on ten studies, equivalent to a 3.1kg weight loss  18  . This review also found that personal contact and more frequent interactions (1-4 interactions per day) were associated with greater weight reduction. An additional systematic review of SMS-delivered weight maintenance interventions reported a weighted effect size of -0.82kg (95% CI -1.43 to -0.21kg) based on three studies  19  , suggesting potential for SMS to support weight loss maintenance following weight loss. Another systematic review of mobile phone delivered weight management interventions on weight change in adults with obesity and found a weighted effect size of -2.35kg (95% CI, -2.84 to -1.87kg) based on 20 studies  15  . This review examined the association between intervention duration and weight loss. Weighted effect sizes were -2.25kg (95% CI -3.34, -1.16 I 2 =92%) at 3-4 months, -2.66kg (95% CI -3.94, -1.38"

      "title": "Data Analysis",
      "text": "Studies reporting sufficient data to calculate mean differences in weight change in kg at intervention end and post intervention follow up, were meta-analysed using RevMan (version 5.3). Meta-analyses were conducted to examine the difference between intervention and control groups for weight change at the end of the active intervention period, or the reported measurement time point closest to the end of the intervention.\n\nWhen studies tested multiple versions of the intervention against a comparison condition, then the interventions were treated as separate studies, with control participants divided by the number of interventions in the meta-analysis. When a choice of weight outcomes was available (e.g. measurement vs self-report), the more objective measure was chosen. When a choice of weight change analysis was available (e.g. completers vs intention-to-treat analysis), the outcome that took account of missing data was chosen. When studies reported average weights at baseline and follow-up, weight change was calculated by subtracting the baseline weight from the final weight. When standard deviations for weight change in kg were not reported and could not be converted using the guidelines from the Cochrane handbook  23  , the formula provided by Avenell et al.,  24  was used. Effect sizes were calculated separately for weight loss and weight loss maintenance studies. All pooled effects were calculated as mean difference in weight change using a random effects model (inverse-variance approach). The I 2 statistic was used to quantify degree of inconsistency between studies  25  . I 2 levels of \u226525% and \u226550% were interpreted as an indicator for moderate and substantial heterogeneity respectively. The test for subgroup differences available in RevMan 5.3 was used to examine subgroup differences. Subgroup analyses were conducted for the weight loss interventions only, due to an insufficient number of weight loss maintenance studies. One weight loss study was excluded from the tailoring subgroup analysis due to a high degree of tailoring seen in other aspects of the intervention  26  . Interrater agreement for key risk of bias indicators was calculated using the kappa statistic  27  ."

Details of the included studies are presented in Table  1 .\n\n---Figure  1 ------Table 1 --- Fifteen studies were included  26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42]  of which 12 focused on weight loss  26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [35] [36] [37] [38] 41, 42  and three on weight loss maintenance  34, 39, 40  . The studies were published between 2009-2017. In these 15 studies, 1,380 participants were allocated to an intervention arm and 1,336 participants to a control arm. Studies were conducted in the USA (n=7); Australia (n=3), Europe (n=3) and Asia (n=2).\n\nFourteen studies were individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one was a quasi-RCT  32  .\n\nMost studies (n=14) were two-armed trials comparing an intervention to a control group.\n\nOne study had three-arms, comparing two SMS interventions to the control group  39  . Weight change was the primary outcome in all studies but one  31  which reported weight change as a secondary outcome. Sample sizes ranged from 30  30  to 710 participants  31  . Five studies included fewer than 100 participants  29, 30, 32, 41, 42  , six included between 100 and 200 participants  26, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39  , three between 200-500 participants  34, 37, 40  and over 500 participants  22  . The median number of participants per study was 125 [IQR 90 to 107.75].\n\nParticipant dropout ranged from 2% 22 to 50%  37  . Weighted average drop out was 17%, of which 20% dropped out of an intervention arm and 17% dropped out of a control arm. Loss to follow up demographic details were reported in one study  40  : participants lost were more likely to be younger (42.8 vs 50.5 years), female, white British, previously part of a commercial weight loss group and had a higher BMI at the start of the intervention.\n\nFor the 2,716 participants in the 15 studies, the weighted average age was 47.6 years. Two studies included women only  32, 41  . The remaining 13 studies contained both men and women. The weighted average of the proportion of men across all participants was 41% [IQR 17.7 to 42.95%]. The weighted average BMI before weight loss was 31.3 kg/m 2 [IQR 28.6 to 34.1kg/m 2 ] and weighted average of participant's baseline reported weight was 88.0kg [IQR 82.4 to 97.1kg] (Table 1).\n\nThe duration of weight loss interventions ranged from 2 months 32 to 12 months  26, 35, 38  , the mean and median duration was 6 months. Cost of intervention delivery was reported in two studies  33, 34  . A 12 month weight loss intervention reported a total cost, including operational costs and personnel hours, of $21,113.61 for 163 randomised participants which equated to approximately $130 per participant  33  . A 6 month weight loss maintenance study reported an overall delivery cost per participant of approximate AU$80.00  34  .\n\nSix studies reported using theory to develop their interventions  26, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  (self efficacy theory  43  , health belief model  36  , transtheoretical model  36, 37  , self-regulation theory  36  , social-cognitive theory  26  , planned behavioural theory  26  , regulatory focus theory , contingency model in mobile phone weight loss  43  ). Three studies reported using one theory  [37] [38] [39]  (the transtheoretical model  37  , social cognitive theory  38  , regulatory focus theory  39  ). Three studies reported using multiple theories  26, 35, 36  . Nine studies did not mention theory  [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [40] [41] [42]  .\n\nThe frequency of SMS delivery to participants ranged from messages 3-4 times a day  36, 38  to once every 2 weeks  26  , with a median of one SMS per day. Two studies tailored frequency to participant's preference  34, 42  .\n\nSMS interactivity was reported in nine studies  30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, [40] [41] [42]  . This included replying to messages with weekly weight (n=7)  32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 42  ; questions about diet (n=2)  36, 41  ; or responding to educational questions (n=1)  30  . Six studies sent automated feedback response based on computer algorithms  30, 35, 36, 38, [40] [41] [42]  , two studies did not respond to replies  33, 37  and one study responded with customised researcher feedback  32  .\n\nStudies used a range of modes of SMS communication, including generic (n=3)  29, 32, 33  and tailored (n=6)  30, 31, [36] [37] [38] [41] [42] [43]  ."

      "text": "This review specifically examined SMS as the primary delivery route of behaviour change interventions for weight management, thereby allowing conclusions to be drawn about this particular form of delivery. Previous reviews confounded SMS with a variety of other delivery components. Some of the included studies included delivery components other than SMS, such as websites or social media platforms  18  . However, all included studies used SMS as the primary delivery route making it unlikely that obtained effects are driven by other delivery components. The lack of subgroup differences for weight loss studies might be due to a lack of power as only twelve studies met inclusion criteria. In addition, some of the subgroups might have been too broad to detect more subtle differences. For example, interventions categorised as generic rather than tailored differed to some extent, with some personalising SMS (e.g. by using participant names) and others sending the same SMS to each participant. Descriptions of delivery aspects of interventions were not always fully clear to facilitate coding. Some of the interventions were short term (i.e. between 3-6 months), limiting generalisability of SMS effects in the longer term. However, no difference between subgroups emerged on the basis of intervention timing. Subgroup analyses focused on form of delivery aspects of the SMS interventions, and did not examine intervention content such as behaviour change techniques. The majority of studies were conducted in western countries, however, preliminary evidence suggests that SMSdelivered weight loss interventions may also apply to non-western countries, including research from Korea 29 and Iran  32  ."

Weight loss effects reported here are comparable in magnitude to other reviews that include a SMS within multicomponent mHealth interventions  15, 17, 18  . For example, a systematic review examining mobile health interventions including SMS for adults with obesity reported a weight effect of -2.35kg (95% CI, -2.84 to -1.87kg)  15  , similar to -2.28kg (95% CI -3.17, -1.39kg) found in the current review.\n\nSmall to medium effects of SMS-delivered weight loss interventions have the potential to translate into clinical impact  6, 44  , particularly given the scalability and reach of this automated delivery format. Aveyard et al.,  45  for example found that primary care patients referred to a commercial weight loss intervention by their general practitioner lost -2.43kg This review did not find differences in weight loss effects on the basis of intervention duration, SMS-frequency, use of theory, SMS interactivity and SMS tailoring. A previous systematic review of mobile health interventions found highest weight loss effects at six months with a reduction in effects sizes at 12 months, which remained statistically significant  15  . The current review found a similar pattern of effects sizes, typical for weight loss results over time  46  . Three studies showed significant weight effects at 12 months (-2.03kg, 95% CI -3.66,-0.40kg), suggesting that significant long-term net weight loss is possible despite some likely weight regain. Moreover, similar to a previous review  19  , SMS were found to have small effects on weight loss maintenance following weight loss induced through non SMS-delivered interventions, but this effect did not last.\n\nNo significant association between frequency and weight change effects were found, in contrast to a review of weight loss interventions delivered via mobile phones who report an association between frequent interactions (1-4 interactions per day) and greater weight reduction  18  . This review found a trend that less frequent weekly or bi-weekly SMS interactions were associated with greater weight effects (-2.88kg, 95% CI -4.56, -1.21kg) compared to daily interactions (-1.56kg, 95% CI -2.26, -0.86)."

This requires further investigation particularly in light of the lack of associations between delivery features and weight effects found in this review. Although theory use was not found to be associated with more effective interventions, in line with previous evidence  47  , a better understanding of the mechanisms through which SMS work is critical to optimise SMS effectiveness, including form of delivery and SMS content features. Limited information on how SMS interventions were developed was reported. Optimisation of SMS content and delivery may benefit from more rapid and iterative experimental developments, prior to testing intervention content in a randomised controlled trial  48, 49  .\n\nRegardless of the lack of evidence on the mechanisms, the effectiveness of SMS-delivered weight loss interventions suggests that these should be considered as a potentially effective public health tool to treat overweight and obesity, in those interested in receiving such support."

The current review showed a greater proportion of men participating in included studies compared to other weight loss intervention studies  50, 51  , suggesting that SMS-delivered weight loss interventions may be engaging for men.

      "text": "compared to -1.18kg for patients provided with brief general practitioner advice. Results of this review suggest that referral to SMS-delivered weight management interventions has the potential to boost weight loss effects over and above standard treatments and advice. SMS-delivered weight management interventions may provide a potentially effective alternative for those unable or unwilling to engage in group-based weight loss interventions."

    {
      "text": "However no full cost-effectiveness analysis of SMS-delivered weight management interventions were conducted. Given the relatively low resource costs of automated intervention delivery, cost effectiveness could be implied. However, high quality evidence is required to examine and quantify cost-effectiveness of SMS delivered weight management interventions. Future research might benefit from a better understanding of how different populations engage with and integrate SMS into their daily life. For instance, there might be age, sex or cultural difference in terms of the number, frequency, types and sources of messages individuals receive. Any SMS-delivered intervention needs to be meaningfully embedded within a pre-existing message context. Moreover, the way in which a participant integrates an SMS-delivered intervention into daily routines and social interactions requires further exploration. CONCLUSION SMS-delivered behaviour change interventions are effective to support weight loss and weight loss maintenance in the short term, leading to small to medium effects. Limited evidence exists for long-term post-intervention effects. Differences in weight loss effects could not be explained by examining intervention duration, SMS frequency, use of theory, SMS interactivity, and SMS tailoring. SMS-delivered weight management comprises an effective, potentially cost-effective and scalable intervention option to treat obesity."

However, the focus of this review was mHealth in general and not SMS-delivered interventions specifically. The current literature suggests that SMS-delivered weight management interventions can lead to clinically significant weight loss for health. The effectiveness of weight loss and weight loss maintenance behaviour change interventions primarily delivered via SMS remains unclear, and limited evidence exists as to the intervention characteristics that may be associated with more effective SMS-delivered weight management behaviour change interventions. This systematic review examined a) the effectiveness of SMS-delivered behaviour change interventions for weight loss and weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity, and b) intervention characteristics which might explain variation in effectiveness."

      "description": "The duration of weight loss maintenance interventions ranged from 1 to 3 months; the mean and median duration was 2 months. The weighted average participant baseline weight was 93.2kg [IQR 88.2 to 104.2kg]."

      "description": "compared to -1.18kg for patients provided with brief general practitioner advice. Results of this review suggest that referral to SMS-delivered weight management interventions has the potential to boost weight loss effects over and above standard treatments and advice. SMS-delivered weight management interventions may provide a potentially effective alternative for those unable or unwilling to engage in group-based weight loss interventions."
    },
    {
      "description": "However no full cost-effectiveness analysis of SMS-delivered weight management interventions were conducted. Given the relatively low resource costs of automated intervention delivery, cost effectiveness could be implied. However, high quality evidence is required to examine and quantify cost-effectiveness of SMS delivered weight management interventions. Future research might benefit from a better understanding of how different populations engage with and integrate SMS into their daily life. For instance, there might be age, sex or cultural difference in terms of the number, frequency, types and sources of messages individuals receive. Any SMS-delivered intervention needs to be meaningfully embedded within a pre-existing message context. Moreover, the way in which a participant integrates an SMS-delivered intervention into daily routines and social interactions requires further exploration. CONCLUSION SMS-delivered behaviour change interventions are effective to support weight loss and weight loss maintenance in the short term, leading to small to medium effects. Limited evidence exists for long-term post-intervention effects. Differences in weight loss effects could not be explained by examining intervention duration, SMS frequency, use of theory, SMS interactivity, and SMS tailoring. SMS-delivered weight management comprises an effective, potentially cost-effective and scalable intervention option to treat obesity."
