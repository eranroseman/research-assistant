  "title": "Obesity Prevention/Treatment Choice architecture as a means to change eating behaviour in self-service settings: a systematic review",
  "abstract": "The primary objective of this review was to investigate the current evidence base for the use of choice architecture as a means to change eating behaviour in self-service eating settings, hence potentially reduce calorie intake. Twelve databases were searched systematically for experimental studies with predefined choice architecture interventions in the period of June 2011-March 2012. The 12 included studies were grouped according to type of interventions and underwent a narrative synthesis. The evidence indicates that (i) health labelling at point of purchase is associated with healthier food choice, while (ii) manipulating the plate and cutlery size has an inconclusive effect on consumption volume. Finally, (iii) assortment manipulation and (iv) payment option manipulation was associated with healthier food choices. The majority of studies were of very weak quality and future research should emphasize a real-life setting and compare their results with the effect of other more well-established interventions on food behaviour in self-service eating settings.",

      "text": "Rates of obesity and overweight are increasing and the type and volume of food intake are crucial determinants of this development  (1) . With increasing rates of people eating outside home  (2, 3) , public eating environments have been identified as venues well suited to health promotion  (4) (5) (6) (7) .\n\nTraditional approaches for changing the health behaviour of individuals have primarily focused on the influence of individual factors rather than environmental factors  (8) . Thus, there is a growing interest in studying the effect of changes in food environments out of the home. But increasing evidence suggests that the environment impacts our behaviour not only through reflective and cognitive pathways, but that dietary behaviours and physical activity may also be influenced by non-reflective automatic pathways  (9, 10) , hence individual health promoting strategies might fail. This recognition has fuelled a new research interest into the mechanisms and effects of interventions, assuming that human behaviour is shaped through mechanisms and pathways building on what is often referred to as dual process theories. Such intervention designs and principles have become known as nudging or choice architecture."

      "text": "This study assumes that it is possible to influence consumers' behavioural preferences towards healthier options by redesigning the environment in which consumers make their food choices, and thereby taking into account the specific activation of the brain's automatic and reflective processes. This review focuses on studies that undertake these dual processes in an experimental manner in out-ofhome self-service eating environments or laboratories. For the sake of transparency and effect measure accuracy, this review limits itself to interventions that do not alter selection nor give financial incentives for behaviour change."

The first stage included a systematic literature search through selected online databases with a predetermined search strategy conducted by L.R.S. S.L. and L.R.S. carried out the second stage in March 2012 with the same search terms and strategy. This was done to ensure that the most recent studies were included. The electronic search included the following databases: CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus, Global Health, MEDLINE, Social Policy & Practice, Web of Science, EMBASE, Adolec, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA and IBSS. Furthermore, key authors in the field were contacted by email to identify any unpublished or ongoing research, and the reference list of each of the identified studies was searched for relevant additional publications. Furthermore, the searches also included reviews and meta-analyses, which were used as a source of information.\n\nThe search terms were identified based on current literature and in collaboration with the Danish Nudging Network (iNudgeYou.com), which consists of key staff from research institutions in Denmark with expertise in choice architecture interventions. Their expertise was used merely in identifying the search terms and they were not involved in the data synthesis or the conclusions of this report."

      "title": "Data extraction and data synthesis",
      "text": "It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis of the included studies because of the high heterogeneity in type of intervention and selected outcome measures. Furthermore, the heterogeneity in age and social factors of the participants as well as the intervention settings made it hard to make comparisons between them. The studies differed in the following areas: intervention site (worksite cafeteria, school canteen and experimental food laboratory); type of intervention (altering size and shape of food and beverage containers to limit consumption volume; promoting healthy food choices by labelling nutritional information or logos; limiting food consumption volume by modifying assortment; and changing food choices by changing payment methods [PMs]); participants (ranging from school children aged 4-18 in the United States to working-age adults in the Netherlands); outcome measure (food sales, food intake and food choice); and type of meal (lunch, dinner or just water).\n\nTherefore, a narrative synthesis was adapted to this review. As there are limited validated tools available for narrative synthesis, a strategy was adapted and developed from Popay et al.  (11) . Studies were grouped according to the type of intervention and a narrative synthesis was applied to each group. The studies were divided into four groups according to intervention strategy: health information at point of purchase (HIPOP), container and cutlery (CC), food assortment (FA) and PMs. As there were only one study in both FA and PM, these were narratively synthesized together (FAPM)."

An increase in variety from 6 to 24 different coloured jelly beans resulted in more than a twofold increase in number of jelly beans eaten if they were organized according to colour, rather than all mixed together. This finding was concurrent in both children and adults (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05). Furthermore, how the sweets were organized and displayed was associated with perceived variety, which was also associated to consumption volume, irrespective of actual variety. See Table  4  for further details.\n\nJust et al.  (16)  showed inconsistent results, and to some degree adverse effects of an experiment with college students pre-selecting their meal compared to college students ordering their meal while queuing. Although it was hypothesized that subjects were more prone to unhealthy food purchases in the cafeteria queue, more subjects chose 'nutritious' foods compared to subjects pre-selecting their meal (no overall association test was executed between nutritious and less-nutritious foods, nor was actual consumption data presented).\n\nThe second experiment in Just et al.'s (16) 2 \u00a5 2 study found strong evidence of an association between payment option and food choice. The use of debit cards that were restricted (RD) to purchasing 'nutritious' foods was associated with a decrease in total calorie consumption, compared to cash payment and use of unrestricted debit card (test for association was carried out on the individual foods). The experiment also showed that the RD group had a greater proportion of energy intake from nutritious foods and that they were less likely to order desserts. All three groups (unrestricted debit card, restricted debit card and cash) had $20 available in either, 100% cash or, 50%/50% cash and prepaid debit card or, 100% prepaid debit card."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "As frequent food consumption outside home has been shown to be associated with obesity  (25) (26) (27) (28) , and all-youcan-eat-buffet-style dining is associated with excess calorie intake (29), self-service eating must be acknowledged as a potential venue for health promotion. Self-service eating constitutes the eating situation where the consumers choose the type and the amount of food and drink they want to consume. This review identified most studies on self-serve plate eating in buffet-style lunch canteen, whereas choice architecture studies on dinner eating were more rare. It is acknowledged that choice architecture studies on self-serve snacking (e.g. vending machines) and choice architecture interventions on breakfast meals are highly underrepresented in the literature. The overall results of the intervention studies reviewed are inconsistent. The majority of studies found evidence of an association between the intervention and the primary outcome. Only one study  (20)  had the opposite result to what was hypothesized, but when changing the setting in which the intervention was executed, the findings correlated with the preset hypothesis. Some studies had consistent findings that correlated with the preset hypothesis, but they were mainly one-serving experiments with a single outcome measure. Studies aimed at reducing consumption volume in these self-service settings were mainly successful, except from one study that found no evidence of an association between plate size and energy intake  (21) . Interventions aimed at changing food choice were more inconsistent. Some studies found evidence of choice architecture changes being associated with increase in fruit and/or vegetable sales  (14, 18) , while others did not  (13) . One study found evidence of choice architecture being successful in increasing sales of healthy entr\u00e9es (17) while others did not  (14, 18) .\n\nHIPOP studies were the least heterogenic in intervention design and the most researched area. A reason for that might be not only health professionals, but also the retail and restaurant business, have conducted research in this area. Furthermore, the media have for a long time focused on the importance of food labelling, which might have affected consumer mentality. A large cross-sectional study on consumer behaviour in Danish commercial outlets has shown that labelling at POP is highly sought after. Fortyfour per cent of subjects felt that more information on nutrient declarations was needed and 29% felt that 'unhealthy' foods should be clearly marked as unhealthy  (30) . However, labelling foods as 'healthy' has been associated with the stigmatization of being less tasty  (31)  and that potential adverse effect would need to be further investigated.\n\nFour out of five studies on HIPOP assessed whether the participants had noticed the POP information material. The results ranged from 52% (18) to 99%  (15) . However, these data were collected in post-intervention questionnaires with limited information attached. Only Vyth et al.  (18)  reported a response rate that was quite low (36-48%). Nevertheless, the dual process theory  (10)  emphasizes the importance of labels that demand less mental effort of consumers, in either making rational choices based on the automatic system, or using the health information to activate reflective choice processes so the consumer choice is healthier.\n\nThe studies included in this review that aimed at limiting the volume of consumption rather than changing food choice were very interesting in regard to their design and findings. Although the studies were prone to bias and inaccuracy, the approach used is worth further research (see Table  3 ). Interestingly, Freedman & Brochado's  (19)  study was the only one measuring plate waste. They found very strong evidence of a decrease in waste during their intervention in which they gradually reduced portion size (P < 0.001). If population health is perceived holistically, the link between eating in public, food waste and the environment needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nTo underline the importance of portion size, studies have shown that the increase in portion size is one of the key factors for increasing obesity rates  (32) , hence its significance must not be underestimated. Although the findings of this review show inconsistent results on the effect of choice architecture on consumption volume, the potential of simple and cheap ways to reduce energy intake should be embraced.\n\nNevertheless, the actual public health effect of choice architecture needs to be contrasted with the achievable effect you would get out of regulating food availability or differentiating prices. Choice architecture that encourages healthy behaviour through reflective or automatic processes might be a feasible alternative in limiting overconsumption. The UK House of Lords is implementing various choice architecture strategies throughout the financial, environment and health sector  (33) ; however more quality research is needed on the effects, whether it is for influencing food choice or influencing consumption volume."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This review found inconsistent evidence supporting the use of choice architecture to change food consumption behaviour. Manipulating CC size showed inconsistent evidence of reducing consumption volume, but these studies are yet to be tested in naturally occurring environments. Interventions with health or nutrient information at POP showed some evidence of effect on food choice, but inconsistently on what type of foods. Choice architecture studies of food display and PMs are emerging, but it is yet too early to assess their effectiveness.\n\nStudies included in this review were generally of short duration and had questionable methodology. This review should be seen as an indicator for current and future research needs within the choice architecture area."

    {
      "title": "Implications for public health",
      "text": "At the current level of evidence, choice architecture cannot be recommended as a strategy for changing food consumption behaviour. Premature focus on choice architecture as a health promotion tool might cause neglect of other population level interventions that are potentially more effective, hence harming public health. It is therefore recommended that existing and more evidence-based strategies should be kept in place and perhaps be supplemented by choice architecture interventions."
