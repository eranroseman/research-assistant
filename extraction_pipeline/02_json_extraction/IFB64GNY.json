  "title": "A comparative analysis of digital health usage intentions towards the adoption of virtual reality in telerehabilitation",
  "abstract": "Background: With the rapid development of the metaverse and the problem of non-attendance in traditional rehabilitation, virtual reality in telerehabilitation has become increasingly vital in modern medicine. However, research on determining predictors that influence the public's behavioral intention to adopt VR-based telerehabilitation has not been extensively studied. Objective: This study aims to propose a new research model with a comparative analysis on understanding factors affecting the public's behavioral intention to adopt VR in telerehabilitation for different user groups. Methods: A total of 215 respondents from the general public completed an online questionnaire to validate the proposed research model. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS and AMOS. The proposed model was additionally validated using CFA and multiple linear regression. Results: This study found that effort expectancy, threat appraisals, and trust had a positive significant influence on the public's behavioral intention to adopt VR in telerehabilitation. However, performance expectancy and facilitating conditions had no significant relationship with behavioral intention. Notably, the average of the primary factors for older adults was generally higher than for younger adults. Conclusions: The present study confirms the applicability of the proposed research model. Our findings contribute up-to-date insights for related stakeholders to minimize implementation failures and develop successful adoption strategies for the future expansion of telerehabilitation.",

      "text": "Recently, an increase in the global elderly population, an unhealthy lifestyle, and a rise in the prevalence of disability have been the key factors driving the demand for rehabilitation services. However, limited appointment times, inconvenient travel distances, and declining motivation pose a challenge to the participation rate in rehabilitation treatments. Additionally, the COVID-19 epidemic has prompted worldwide healthcare organizations to consider alternative digital approaches for delivering medical services remotely.\n\nMeanwhile, due to the latest technological advances in digital health and medicine, various approaches have been developed to improve patients' participation in rehabilitation programs. Recently, the applications of a metaverse in medicine have become increasingly important in the healthcare industry  [1] . Metaverse in medicine refers to the medical Internet of Things (MIoT) accessed via a combination of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) technology, which can deliver medical services via 3D avatars  [2] [3] [4] . Of those, telerehabilitation with virtual reality is one of the promising treatments that use information and communications technology to deliver rehabilitation services to patients remotely  [5] . Previous literature examined that VR in telerehabilitation has been widely adopted in digital health  [6] [7] [8] [9] . This cutting-edge technology can save time, transportation fees, and medical expenses while enhancing access to rehabilitation programs  [10] [11] [12] . Using VR in telerehabilitation, healthcare providers can offer conventional rehabilitation services like evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and education via the Internet  [13] . Telerehabilitation with VR also offers patients prescribed goal-oriented exergames and task-based exercises in virtual settings to improve balance, gait, and motivation in treatment  [12, 14, 15] . With the rising applications of VR platforms in digital medicine, the global telerehabilitation market is projected to grow significantly at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15% between 2020 and 2027  [16] .\n\nAlthough VR-based telerehabilitation is a growing trend in digital health, telehealth initiatives fail 75% of the time globally and 90% in developing countries  [17] . The public's acceptance of virtual environments in telerehabilitation is seen as a long-term challenge that requires further investigation. To further popularize the use of VR in telerehabilitation, behavioral intention is considered a vital factor affecting the success rate of digital health. However, previous research mainly focused on the technological, feasible, safe, and effective aspects of telerehabilitation. The existing literature lacks comprehensive insights to support future decision-making on VR in telerehabilitation  [18] . There is still much to explore regarding the variables influencing the public's behavioral intention to use VR in telerehabilitation. Therefore, healthcare organizations and service developers need to understand the behavioral intention to use VR-based telerehabilitation to comprehend patients' needs and reduce implementation failure  [19] .\n\nDespite the rising number of potential applications for telerehabilitation using virtual reality, research regarding the public's usage intentions is still in its infancy. The use of VR-based telerehabilitation is viewed not only as a technological acceptance behavior but also as a health-promoting action that assists patients in preventing health threats  [20, 21] . However, prior research primarily applied the technology acceptance model (TAM) or the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model to analyze user behavior in the context of VR in telerehabilitation  [14, 22, 23] . Recently, the protection motivation theory (PMT) has been widely adopted to explain protective behavior in the telehealth field  [24] [25] [26] [27] . There is still a lack of research on examining the usage intentions of telerehabilitation with the combination of the UTAUT and PMT. Additionally, previous studies have not shed light on comparing user intentions across different age groups using a comprehensive analysis. Determining the public's perceptions of VR-based telerehabilitation regarding different age groups is essential for healthcare organizations and service developers to understand the actual needs and drawbacks of the currently used VR technologies. However, there is still much investigation needed to examine the user's needs with a multi-group analysis.\n\nThus, this study proposes to understand factors affecting the public's behavioral intentions to adopt VR in telerehabilitation. Additionally, a multi-group analysis will be conducted to analyze age differences. Notably, this study focuses on the following two contributions:\n\nTo propose a new research model that integrates existing theories to indentify key predictors of behavioral intentions to adopt digital health technology.\n\nTo advance the knowledge of VR in telerehabilitation by comparing behavioral intentions between different age groups through a comparative analysis."

The proposed theoretical framework is illustrated in Fig.  1 . Five hypotheses are proposed as follows: H1: Performance expectancy positively affects behavioral intention in using VR in telerehabilitation  [39] [40] [41] . H2: Effort expectancy positively affects behavioral intention in using VR in telerehabilitation  [42] [43] [44] . H3: Facilitating conditions affect behavioral intention in using VR in telerehabilitation  [38, 45, 46] . H4: Threat appraisals positively affect behavioral intention in using VR in telerehabilitation  [20, 24, 39] . H5: Trust positively affects behavioral intention in using VR in telerehabilitation  [31] [32] [33] ."

The reasoning is that potential telerehabilitation users include not only those over the age of 60 but also adolescents and adults, particularly employees who require repetitive movements that pose a risk of injury. In Hong Kong, 14,299 people received rehabilitation treatments in the last 12 months. The sample arose from the database of the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation  [56] . A simple random sampling method was adopted to select 225 participants as respondents, which was in line with previous telehealth-related research  [57] [58] [59] . A detailed explanation of related definitions and key terminology was provided to the participants before the survey. A total of 215 valid samples were received via Google Forms with the support of a rehabilitation center in Hong Kong. The method was also in line with recent research  [60, 61] . Detailed explanatory information and the letter of invitation are summarized in Appendix B."

First, the CFA was applied to test the proposed model's reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. The thresholds of Cronbach's alpha (\u03b1), composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE) were set to 0.6, 0.7, and 0.5, respectively. [62] [63] [64] [65] . Additionally, the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) was used to evaluate the discriminant validity of the model  [66] . The value of HTMT is calculated by comparing the correlations of the indicators on the other constructs with the correlations of indicators inside the same construct  [66] . An acceptable value of HTMT should be less than 0.85, 0.9, or between confidence intervals of -1 and 1, respectively  [66] [67] [68] . In addition, chi-square to degrees of freedom, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and comparative fit index (CFI), were applied to determine the model fitness. This study adopted the recommended values of \u03c7 2 /df < 5, RMSEA < 1, SRMR < 0.08, and CFI > 0.9  [65, 69] . Further, the age differences were determined using Welch's ANOVA test. An alpha level of 0.05 was applied in the current study. In addition, multiple regression analysis was used to test and validate the relationship between the model parameters using SPSS  [70] . The values of R, R-Square, adjusted R-Square, beta coefficient (\u03b2), p-value, and tvalue were also determined in the analysis."

Further, the results also indicate that PE and FC had no significant relationship with BI. In terms of age categories, older generations have higher averages for PE, EE, TA, T, and BI than younger adults. Practical implications for developers are summarized as follows: (i) Establish promotional campaigns for VR technologies; (ii) Improve an easy-to-use user interface with detailed guidelines, simple data visualization, multiple languages, adjustable icons, and fonts; (iii) Target both older generations and workers who require repetitive movements; (iv) Build trust through sufficient data protection measures and communication strategies. Thus, our findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders to develop well-established user adoption strategies for VR-based telerehabilitation in the future."

      "text": "Telerehabilitation uses information and communications technology to deliver rehabilitation services like evaluation, diagnosis, therapy, and education to patients via the Internet. Virtual reality in telerehabilitation also provides goal-oriented exergames and task-based exercises to improve patients' balance, gait, and motivation toward rehabilitation.\n\nBenefits: Save time, minimize therapy spending, and transportation fees, and improve access to rehabilitation services under the COVID-19 circumstances.\n\nConnection methods: Video-conferencing platforms, smartphones, wearable sensors, Virtual Reality, and Robotics. Key terminology -The AI Analysis System provides diagnostic clues, identifies error causes, and develops a better treatment plan for patients.\n\n-The automated IoT system allows the collection of patient information such as their body position and range of movement. Patients can track their health information and receive real-time feedback from the IoT-based vision. -Immersive VR technology refers to the use of VR headsets, hand controllers, data gloves, or bodysuits to interact with a virtual environment. It enables patients to visualize the rehabilitation process through an immersive computer display. -Non-immersive VR technology uses a computer or television screen to create a two-dimensional environment that does not require any additional immersive equipment. Goal-oriented games allow real-time feedback and utilize motion-tracking sensors to exemplify the required ranges of motion for patients to improve."
