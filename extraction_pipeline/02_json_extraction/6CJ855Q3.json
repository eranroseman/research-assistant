For example, searching and entering individual food items and converting them into actual dietary information, such as nutritional composition and calories, are bothersome and laborious. Furthermore, single health care platforms that integrate diverse biometric data, including blood glucose, body weight, blood pressure, and physical activity level, are limited, so users have needed to input those data, introducing the possibility of typing errors and decreasing compliance.\n\nA single platform that automatically integrates various data and contains an artificial intelligence (AI)-based food recognition program that replaces the complicated manual input of dietary information with a single photograph of each meal might overcome those limitations and be an appropriate digital health care option for people with T2D. A mobile health care platform, Auto-Chek Care (Aprilis Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea), can be linked to a glucometer, a scale with bioelectrical impedance analysis, a sphygmomanometer, and a watch-type pedometer through Bluetooth, allowing all of those data to be automatically collected on the platform for integrated analysis in a single smartphone application. Furthermore, deeplearning technology of object detection and convolution neural networks now enables AI-based recognition of food contents in photographs. An AI-based food recognition program, FoodLens (Doing-Lab Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea), recognizes multiple food items in a single photograph. It passed the Korean Information Security Technology accreditation test in January 2018 with a recognition rate of 86.6% in food classification. Once users take a photograph of multiple foods just before eating, diet and nutritional data are automatically assembled into the integrated digital health care platform from this program.\n\nTo investigate the utility of this approach in a clinical setting, we evaluated the efficacy of the integrated digital health care platform using an AI-based dietary management solution in adults with T2D. We additionally explored the efficacy of this platform combined with intermittently applied personal continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and remote feedback from medical staff. More specifically, we assessed whether use of this platform without feedback (group B) improved glycemic measures, compared with standard diabetes care (group A) in adults with T2D. We further evaluated the effect of this platform with intermittently applied personal CGM and remote feedback from medical staff (group C) on glycemic measures, compared with the other groups for 48 weeks."

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio using a random-number table provided by the Biostatistics Department of Samsung Biomedical Research Institute. Routine diabetes care with hospital visits every 3 months was applied for individuals in control group A. Those in experimental group B were introduced to the digital integrated health care platform to use by themselves without monitoring or assistance from medical personnel. Those in experimental group C were helped by medical staff to successfully install the platform on their mobile device and educated at the hospital on its use and application. The individuals in groups B and C received a glucometer (Auto-Chek Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GM01RAA; APRILIS Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea), a sphygmomanometer (Auto-Chek Signature Blood Pressure Monitoring System, TMB-1597-BT; APRILIS Co., Ltd.), a scale with bioelectrical impedance analysis (Auto-Chek Plus Body Fat Analyzer; APRI-LIS Co., Ltd.), and a watch-type pedometer (Auto-Chek Plus Smartband Q8; APRILIS Co., Ltd.), all of which connect automatically to the platform via Bluetooth. The FoodLens (DoingLab Co., Ltd.) AI-based food recognition program recognizes multiple foods from a single photograph, which participants were asked to take prior to eating. Diet and nutritional data, including food groups and calories, were thus automatically incorporated into the platform from this program  (8) . As shown in the demonstration video  (10) , because it recognizes multiple foods from various cultures in a single photograph, users do not have to take photo of each food item individually. The subjects in group C also received a CGM device (Dexcom G5; Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) and were asked to use it for 1 week every 3 months to monitor and obtain glycemic data for individualized feedback. Continual monitoring of the integrated health care data (blood glucose, CGM metrics, body weight, blood pressure, exercise, and diet) by medical staff and personal educational feedback via text messages were provided only to those in group C. Clinically registered dietitians sent nutritional intervention messages to those in group C based on their integrated health care data. Details on the nature of intervention messages are provided in Supplementary Appendix 2 and Supplementary Table  1 . Follow-up visits after baseline were scheduled every 12 weeks for a total of 48 weeks."

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "In this 48-week, open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial involving adults with T2D who had HbA 1c 7.0-8.5% and BMI $23 mg/m 2 , use of the integrated digital health care platform with AI-driven dietary management improved glycemia (as indicated by the change in HbA 1c ) during 48 weeks without affecting the number of hypoglycemic events and produced more weight loss for 24 weeks. Furthermore, use of the platform with intermittently applied personal CGM and feedback from medical staff led to better glycemia and more weight loss persistently for 48 weeks, compared with routine diabetes care.\n\nOur findings suggested the feasibility of improving glycemia using an integrated digital health care platform without modifying medication. Although the degree of HbA 1c reduction was relatively moderate even in group C as well as group B, it might have been affected by the relatively low baseline HbA 1c level of our population, especially for the intervention of group C. Although the extent of decrease in HbA 1c from baseline was not varied by the baseline HbA 1c level in group B, that in group C tended to be higher in individuals with higher baseline HbA 1c level in subgroup analyses. It suggests that rather than the simple introduction of the platform, interventions accompanying patient education and personalized feedback might show grater magnitude of effects on glycemia in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes, like other glucose-lowering therapies  (13) .\n\nIn previous trials, several digital health care applications have been shown to be effective for managing T2D, consistent with our findings (4-6,14,15). In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of mobile health care applications for T2D self-management, the overall effect on HbA 1c expressed as mean difference was \u00c00.40% (95% CI \u00c00.69 to \u00c00.11%) (4), similar to our results. However, not all of the trials demonstrated efficacy in terms of a significant reduction in HbA 1c compared with the control group  (16) (17) (18) , and low usage of the applications might have decreased their benefits  (16) . BlueStar, a mobile application designed to improve the self-management of diabetes, improved HbA 1c levels in a small trial  (19) , and it was the first application approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as mobile prescription therapy  (16) . However, a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effects of BlueStar on glycemic control measured by HbA 1c among people with T2D at different clinical sites revealed no difference between the intervention and control arms  (16) . In that analysis  (16) , although an increase in application use corresponded with the reduction in HbA 1c level, the overall usage was low, and it varied significantly by site. Therefore, simplicity, convenience, and user-friendliness to enable consistent use could be important for maximizing the efficacy of health care applications for T2D management. In this respect, the strengths of our application are the automatic integration of data from various devices and an AI-based food recognition that requires only a single photograph of each meal. Particularly, AI-based food recognition can markedly reduce the cognitive burden of dietary records, one of the most laborious parts of diabetes selfmanagement. Also, in our study, active use of the application, as indicated by the NDI, correlated with the reduction in HbA 1c level. Although the NDI tended to decrease during follow-up even with our application, it was maintained at a mean We found that simply introducing the digital integrated health care platform without education or feedback from medical staff (group B) improved glycemia at weeks 24 and 48 and weight loss at weeks 12 and 24, compared with routine diabetes care (group A). Although digital health care applications equipped with automatic input of glucose levels or physical activity have been evaluated in previous studies  (6, 18) , they did not provide automatic and comprehensive integration of data from diverse multiple devices, including glucometers, scales with bioelectrical impedance analysis, sphygmomanometers, and watch-type pedometers, as our intervention did. Furthermore, the AI-driven dietary solution eliminates complex manual input by recognizing all foods in a single photograph and directly converting them into diet and nutritional information, which can reduce the cognitive burden of diabetes self-management. Image-assisted dietary assessment has been reported to curtail the underreporting of dietary intake, compared with the traditional approach (20). Baptista et al. (  21 ) asked adults with T2D what they wanted from a \"perfect\" application for diabetes self-management, and one of the primary themes was relief from the cognitive burden of self-management. This included tracking and visualizing multiple sources of diabetes-related data, automating uploads, and connecting data using linked devices, all of which our platform can do. Although participants in group B did not receive additional recommendations or education, they could use the biometric and diet records organized in the platform to self-manage their diabetes. Also, they could review the trend graphs to check for improvement and check whether they had achieved their goals in biometric measurements and daily calorie intake, which can be set or modified by the users. Since participants in all three groups were regularly visiting a diabetes specialist at one of the three university-affiliated hospitals every 3 months and getting routine diabetes care at the outpatient clinic, individuals in group B as well as those in group C could consult with their physicians (diabetes specialists) at clinic whether their goal settings were appropriate. Furthermore, because our subjects participated voluntarily and with informed consent, we might have recruited highly motivated people, which could be related to the considerable NDI, even in group B. The greater improvements in glycemia in group B, compared with group A, suggest that even the simple introduction of a convenient, user-friendly digital integrated health care platform could improve T2D self-management for those with regular medical access who are capable and motivated.\n\nGreater reductions were demonstrated in group C than in group B in HbA 1c from    (22) (23) (24) (25) , including a systematic review and meta-analysis  (22, 25) . In a randomized trial of 366 participants with poorly controlled diabetes of both types (HbA 1c $8%) in New Zealand, a greater reduction in HbA 1c (mean \u00c08.85 mmol/mol) was noted in the intervention group (9 months of automated, tailored text messages) than in the control group (mean \u00c03.96 mmol/mol)  (23) . This improvement in glycemic control was sustained 2 years after randomization  (24) .\n\nLimitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, our study population was restricted to Korean adults with T2D who had baseline HbA 1c 7.0-8.5% and BMI $23 mg/m 2 and not using insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist, or antiobesity medication. Thus, effects beyond those in the studied population cannot be adequately inferred. Thus, further studies may be needed before extrapolating our findings to more obese patients, people with more poorly controlled T2D (baseline HbA 1c >8.5%), or users of insulin and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist. Second, because the number of hypoglycemic events was collected from questionnaires and CGM was used only in group C, the detection rate might not be the same for each group. However, the change in the number of hypoglycemic events from baseline in group C did not differ from that in the other groups. Third, since our study was conducted in the Republic of Korea, where the smartphone ownership rate is the highest in the world  (26) , our intervention may not be feasible for underresourced individuals with less technology access in countries with lower rates of smartphone ownership. Fourth, health care devices linked to the platform were limited to certain products at this point. Lastly, in comparing groups B and C, effects of intermittent CGM and supports from medical staff could not be discriminated since CGM was provided only in group C. However, the main objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of our platform using an AI-based dietary management compared with the routine care in adults with T2D (group A vs. B), and comparison between groups B and C was an additional exploration.\n\nA 48-week intervention using an integrated digital health care platform with AI-driven dietary management in adults with T2D produced a greater reduction in HbA 1c levels for 48 weeks and more weight loss for 24 weeks than routine diabetes management without affecting the number of hypoglycemic events. Furthermore, use of this platform with intermittently applied CGM and remote feedback from medical staff increased weight loss consistently for 48 weeks, compared with routine diabetes care, and improved HbA 1c values for 36 weeks compared with a simple introduction of the platform without feedback. Therefore, our integrated digital health care platform with AI-driven dietary management could be a safe and efficacious tool for improving self-management of T2D.\n\nFunding.
