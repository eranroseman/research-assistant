  "abstract": "Background: Although the transition out of military service is a high-risk time for suicidal ideation (SI), a paucity of research examines the development of SI during this transition process and veteran subgroups at risk for SI as they readjust to civilian life. Methods: A population-based, longitudinal post-9/11 veteran cohort reported SI frequency at 3, 9, 15, 21, and 27 months post-separation using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. We identified distinct trajectories of SI over time (i.e., classes) using latent class growth analysis and examined demographic and military service predictors of class membership overall and by gender using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Four SI trajectories that were similar across genders were identified: resilient (90.1%), delayed onset (5.0%), remitting (2.7%), and chronic (2.2%). Younger age, minority race/ethnicity, medical and other (vs. honorable) separation types, and Veterans Health Administration service utilization were associated with increased odds of assignment to a higher-risk trajectory (delayed onset, remitting, and/or chronic vs. resilient), whereas continued service in the National Guard/Reserves and officer rank was associated with lower odds of assignment to a higher-risk trajectory. Conclusions: Findings regarding veterans at greatest risk for SI following military separation can inform targeted assessment and early intervention efforts.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "The transition from military service to civilian life can be challenging. Some veterans may experience a loss of sense of self and purpose and stress associated with the need to re-establish or redefine occupational, social, and recreational roles during this time  (Brenner & Barnes, 2012; Mobbs & Bonanno, 2018) . Such stressors may impact health and well-being in a myriad of ways, including increases in suicidal thoughts and behaviors  (Brenner et al., 2008; Pease et al., 2015) . Sokol et al. (2021)  recently proposed that transition out of military service creates a \"deadly gap\" consisting of, \"limited psychiatric services and increased suicide risk factors,\" which may explain increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors during this time. Limited research on post-9/11 veterans has indeed shown increased suicide rates in the years following separation from military service. One study found suicide rates were highest in the year following military separation for male veterans, declining significantly over the next 6 years; similar findings were not observed for female veterans for whom rates remained relatively stable during the same time period  (Bullman et al., 2015) . A second study that assessed changes in suicide risk within the first-year post-separation found that risk peaked between 6 and 12 months for all post-9/11 veterans and then declined moderately over the next 5 years  (Ravindran et al., 2020) . The transition period may be particularly challenging for veterans with administrative (i.e., general, including medical, and separation under other than honorable conditions) or punitive (i.e., bad conduct or dishonorable) discharges who have been shown to experience higher suicide rates  (Barr et al., 2019; Reger et al., 2015)  and odds of SI  (Brignone et al., 2017; Hoffmire et al., 2019)  following separation and who may have more limited access to or experience confusion about eligibility for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits (e.g., educational assistance and/or healthcare;  Hoffmire et al., 2019) .\n\nSimilar research examining trends in non-fatal suicidal thoughts (i.e., suicidal ideation  [SI] ) and behaviors following separation from military service is lacking, however, as is research examining the association between factors other than separation type and changes in SI during this transition period. This is a critical knowledge gap. Nearly 20% of US veterans report SI following separation from military service  (Hoffmire, Monteith, Forster, et al., 2021) , more than double the rate of SI globally  (Nock et al., 2008) . Furthermore, veteran men and women are at 13% and 15% increased odds of experiencing lifetime SI, respectively, compared to their nonveteran peers  (Hoffmire, Monteith, Forster, et al., 2021) . While most who experience SI do not die by suicide, SI has been theoretically  (Klonsky et al., 2018)  and empirically  (Franklin et al., 2017)  identified as one of the strongest risk factors for suicide. In one metaanalysis, only prior psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide attempts were shown to be stronger risk factors for subsequent suicide, yet SI is also one of the most common reasons for such hospitalizations and a major risk factor for subsequent suicide attempts  (Franklin et al., 2017; Jobes & Joiner, 2019) . Furthermore, SI is an important, often recurrent or chronic, mental health morbidity with serious negative implications for well-being and functioning and there are limited evidence-based treatments for SI. As such, experts in the field of suicidality increasingly stress the importance of improving identification and treatment of SI as a valuable clinical endpoint  (Jobes & Joiner, 2019; Kleiman, 2020) .\n\nAccordingly, understanding trends and drivers of SI during the military transition period can inform the following: (1) treatment of SI itself, to reduce veterans' distress and improve health and functioning during this challenging time; and (2) effective upstream suicide prevention services, by addressing a major suicide risk factor. Fortunately, though a high-risk period, the transition from military to civilian life presents unique opportunities for both the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) to address both upstream suicide risk factors (e.g., financial/employment problems, housing instability, and barriers to care  [Blosnich et al., 2020; Holliday et al., 2021; Monteith et al., 2021] ) and proximal risk factors indicating elevated risk, including the provision of support for veterans experiencing SI. Multiple programs already exist that could be leveraged to do so. For example, the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) provides resources, tools, and training to transitioning service members with the aim of ensuring that they are adequately prepared for the transition  (Kamarck, 2018) . The VA Solid Start Program, newly initiated in 2020, contacts recently separated veterans by phone three times during their firstyear post-separation to provide information about and assistance connecting with a multitude of VA benefits and community partner organization (e.g., home loans and healthcare, including mental healthcare; specifically, Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020a). Such programs could be leveraged to identify veterans who may be struggling with thoughts of suicide and ensure that they are connected with relevant supports, including mental health services.\n\nTo inform such efforts, the current study aimed to (1) identify classes of unique trajectories of change in SI frequency among a population-based sample of post-9/11 veterans during the first 3 years post-separation from military service and (2) document key demographic and military service predictors of class membership. Predictors were assessed for the entire sample and separately for men and women given gender differences in veteran suicidal\n\n1943278x, 2022, 3, Downloaded from  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sltb.12831  by University Of Iowa Libraries -Serials Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2025].

Predictors (age at separation  [Ravindran et al., 2020] , race/ethnicity [Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020b], type of separation [e.g.,  Reger et al., 2015; Brignone et al., 2017] , military rank  [Vogt et al., 2020] , Veterans Health Administration [VHA] use  [Hoffmire et al., 2020] , and war deployment history  [Reger et al., 2018] ) were selected based on prior research or theory suggesting that these factors may impact suicidal thoughts and behaviors."

      "text": "The Veteran Metrics Initiative (TVMI) study  (Vogt et al., 2018)  is a prospective cohort study that assessed post-9/11 veterans' well-being throughout the first 3 years of their transition from military to civilian life. All United States (US) service members who had separated from active duty service or deactivated from the National Guard/Reserve (NG/R) in the prior 90 days and who resided within the continental US were identified from the VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) in the fall of 2016. Study recruitment used a modified Dillman approach with four invitation/ reminder letters  (Dillman et al., 2014)  inviting all eligible veterans (i.e., the full separation cohort; N = 48,965) to complete an online survey. Potential participants received a $5 pre-incentive with the invitation letter and those who completed the survey received additional incentives for each survey completed and $20 at baseline, with incentives increasing by $5 at each subsequent time point  (Coughlin et al., 2011) . Data were collected at six time points: baseline (T1; within approximately 90 days of separation) and at approximately 9, 15, 21, 27, and 33 months (T2-T6) post-separation. Overall, 9566 participants (n = 7823 men, n = 1743 women) responded at T1. After reducing the denominator by known undeliverable mailings (n = 4682) and deceased individuals (n = 2), the response rate was 23%, consistent with that of other studies of post-9/11 veterans, which typically range from 20% to 30%  (Coughlin et al., 2011) . Follow-up response rates were 75% at T2 (n = 7200), 75% at T3 (n = 7201), 68% at T4 (n = 6480), 61% at T5 (n = 5844), and 55% at T6 (n = 5249). A total of 3733 veterans completed all surveys. Respondents were similar to the sampling frame on many characteristics (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, and branch of service), although lower-ranking enlisted service members were less likely to participate than officers  (Vogt et al., 2018) .\n\nOf the 9566 veterans that participated in this study, fourteen did not provide data for SI at any time point and were excluded from the analysis. Table  1  summarizes participant characteristics for the current analysis (N = 9552), presenting bivariate associations with gender. The majority of the participants was men (81.8%), White non-Hispanic (65.6%), less than 35 years of age at separation (56.4%), enlisted (76.1%), and reported at least one war deployment (70.4%). Less than one third (27.3%) of all participants were still serving in the military (NG/R), and two thirds (66.1%) reported an honorable separation. Approximately one third (31.2%) of participants reported using VHA services at least once during the first 3 months post-separation. Women were more ethnically and racially diverse and less likely to report a war deployment."

The other discharge category included those who reported an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions (UOTHC) or a punitive discharge (i.e., bad conduct or dishonorable). Military rank was characterized as warrant officer or officer versus enlisted. VHA users were those who reported using a hospital and/or clinic in the VA healthcare system within 3 months of military separation or demobilization.

Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) maximized SI data are available in the latent growth models. To assess for differences in trajectories by gender, we conducted modeling with the total sample and within gender-stratified samples. First, we compared a variety of simple growth curve models using chi-square difference tests. For all three samples, a model with intercept  (1 , 1 , 1 , 1) ,  linear (0 , 1 , 2 , 3) , and  non-linear (0 , 1 , 4 , 9 ) growth parameters generally fit best, and these parameters were included in subsequent models.\n\nSecond, we regressed a specified number of latent classes onto the growth parameters to establish the optimal number of trajectories. No predictors were included in these models. We examined latent class growth analyses (LCGA; intercept, linear, and non-linear growth parameters fixed) and latent growth mixture models (LGMM; allowing select growth parameters to be freely estimated) with 1 to 5 classes. Residual variance in the participants' observed SI scores was constrained to be equal. Models were evaluated on multiple fit indices: (1) Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criteria (BIC), and sample size-adjusted Bayesian information criteria (aBIC), with lower values indicating better fit  (Jung & Wickrama, 2008) ; (2) Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test (LRT) and boot-strapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT), with a significant p-value indicating the model with k classes fits the data better than the model with k -1 classes  (Nylund et al., 2007) ; (3) entropy values and average posterior probabilities (APP) with values closer to 1 indicating better accuracy of classification  (Lubke & Muth\u00e9n, 2007; Nagin, 2010) ; and (4) the proportion of individuals assigned to each class >1%  (Hipp & Bauer, 2006) . Lastly, we examined the plots of mean SI frequency across time and considered past research and theory to select the optimal number of classes. The best-fitting models were those with all growth parameters fixed (i.e., LCGA) rather than models with freely estimated growth parameters (i.e., LGMM; fit indices for latent growth mixture models available upon request).\n\nFinally, we considered the role of predictors in class membership. Missing data on the predictors were minimal (<4%). Prior to entering predictors in the models, we examined cross-tabulations of each known class, from the unconditional models selected in the previous step, by predictor group to ensure cell sizes were sufficient. For cell sizes less than 10, predictor categories were collapsed when conceptually possible. When groups were not able to be collapsed, that predictor was omitted from analyses. For the women veteran analysis, multiracial/other race non-Hispanic and Hispanic groups were combined due to small cell sizes in some trajectory classes. Furthermore, military rank was omitted for women due to small cell sizes across identified classes. Finally, women with a separation type of \"other\" (n = 3) were removed from the predictor analysis in the women veteran sample as collapsing with honorable or medical separation was not conceptually meaningful. All predictors were included in the total and male samples. In all models, predictors were regressed on the discrete latent class variable using multinomial regression, following the 3-step method (RU3STEP) from  Asparouhov and Muth\u00e9n (2013) . Results assess predictor associations (odds ratios [ORs]) with most likely class membership. ORs are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and only those ORs that are statistically significant and reflect at least a small effect (OR of \u22651.61 or \u22640.62) for our study parameters (i.e., P 0 = .02 [prevalence of the chronic SI class]) are presented and discussed as \"practically meaningful\"  (Chen et al., 2010) ."

      "text": "Fit indices (e.g., information criteria, LRTs, and classification accuracy metrics; Table  2 ) and plots of SI frequency by assigned class suggested that a 4-class solution best described SI changes over time for the total, men, and women samples. For the total sample and for men, the information criteria and BLRT improved as number of classes specified increased, though the LRT and entropy values suggested that the 4-class solution was more parsimonious than the 5-class solution. The 5-class solution contained an additional trajectory that differed only slightly from trajectories already represented in the 4-class solution (see also, Figures  S1  and  S2 ). For women, the LRT suggested that the 2-class solution fit best. However, the aBIC and BLRT that have been shown to outperform other fit indices in models with small sample sizes and unequal class sizes improved with specification of a third, fourth, and fifth class  (Jung & Wickrama, 2008) . Given that the entropy values and APPs were similar for the 3-, 4-, and 5-class solutions, we inspected the plots to adjudicate the results (Figure  S3 ). Ultimately, as was the case for the total sample and men, the 4-class solution appeared optimal for women because it contained an additional trajectory with notable differences in mean level of SI when compared to the trajectories represented in the 3-class solution, while the fifth class in the 5-class solution was small and did not contain notable differences in form than already existing trajectories. The four-class solution was also most consistent with prior theory (e.g.,  Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018)  and most likely to be replicated in future studies.\n\nIntercept, linear, and quadratic growth parameters for the 4-class models are displayed in\n\nTable 3, and mean SI frequency by known class across time is displayed in Figure 1.

Lastly, for men, medical separation was associated with significant and meaningfully higher odds of being in the delayed-onset class whereas this association was not observed for the total sample.

Age of 25-35 years at separation was associated with higher odds of being in the delayed relative to resilient class in the total sample but not among women. Still serving in the NG/R and VHA use was not significantly associated with lower odds of being in the remitting compared to resilient class for women whereas they were for the total sample.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This is, to our knowledge, the first study to assess SI trajectories experienced by veterans during the \"deadly gap\" following military service  (Sokol et al., 2021) . Classes identified in this study, resilient, remitting, delayed onset, and chronic align with prior research assessing trajectories of other health outcomes, such as resilience and dysfunction following trauma  (Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018) . Understanding SI trajectories and their predictors can provide critical information to tailor and identify optimal timing for both clinical (e.g., VHA and community-based mental healthcare) and upstream public health interventions  (Henly et al., 2011) . Our findings revealed that the majority of veterans do not experience substantial SI in the first 3 years after service (90.1%), demonstrating that most veterans are resilient and suggesting that suicidefocused interventions should be targeted for the minority of veterans with symptomatic trajectories (9.9%). While\n\nAdjusted Delayed Remitting Chronic OR 95% CI OR 95% CI OR 95% CI Deployment history (ref: not deployed) Deployed to a war 1.16 0.91, 1.47 1.02 0.73, 1.42 1.16 0.83, 1.63\n\nNote: Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% C.I.) represent the change in odds of assignment to each comparison class relative to the reference class (resilient) per unit increase in each predictor (i.e., compared to covariate reference group).\n\nORs in bold indicate statistical significance p < .05.\n\nSee Tables  S1  and  S2  for gender-stratified multinomial logistic regressions models.\n\na Meets OR effect size criterion (\u22651.61 or \u22640.62). Abbreviations: UOTHC, under other than honorable conditions; NG/R, National Guard/Reserves; VHA, Veterans Health Administration.\n\nT A B L E 1 (Continued) some veterans (i.e., those in the chronic and remitting classes experiencing SI at the time of transition; 4.9%) would benefit from immediate mental health support (e.g., through VHA or community services), others (5%) may not appear to be symptomatic, or \"at risk\" at the time of separation (i.e., experience minimal SI at the time of transition) but rather experience delayed SI onset (e.g., younger and racial-ethnic minority veterans) and thus may benefit more from programs addressing upstream suicide risk factors (e.g., TAPS, VA Solid Start, or other/new suicide-prevention focused transition programs and services; Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020a;  Kamarck, 2018) . Limiting such transition programs to the first year following separation from service or to VHA settings may be inadequate as the majority of veterans do not use VHA services and increases in SI continued outside the 1-year time window in the delayed-onset class. Moreover, as the majority of people who die by suicide do not have contact with a mental health provider in the year prior to death but do have contact with a primary care provider during that time period  (Morin et al., 2019) , screening and interventions in primary care settings may be particularly important for veterans expected to experience delayed onset SI. This necessitates, however, prioritizing connection to VHA or other community healthcare providers even for veterans who may not appear to need mental healthcare at separation. Findings regarding predictors of membership in symptomatic trajectories were particularly notable for age at separation, race and ethnicity, and type of military separation. Younger veterans, both those less than 25 and 25-35 years of age at separation compared to those 35 years and older, were at elevated odds of being in the delayed-onset and chronic trajectory classes as compared to the resilient class. This is consistent with other research indicating that younger veterans have experienced higher and markedly increasing suicide rates in recent years (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020b). It remains critical to connect younger veterans with VHA or community healthcare services early and often and to ensure the VA continues to promote expansion of suicide prevention efforts for all veterans, despite their use of VHA services, by building community connections (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018). We also observed that veterans who identified as racial and ethnic minorities were at elevated odds of experiencing symptomatic trajectories. While veteran suicide surveillance efforts, which recently expanded to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in suicide rates, have found that suicide rates are lower among non-Hispanic Black veterans as compared to non-Hispanic White veterans (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020b), average trends may mask experiences of subgroups of Black veterans at elevated risk (e.g., based on time since separation and/or other sociodemographic or health factors). It is critical that efforts to understand differences in suicide risk by race and ethnicity are expanded and that future research seeks to understand how factors such as experiences of discrimination, racism, and trauma relate to trajectories of suicide risk among racial and ethnic minority veterans  (Joe et al., 2008; Polanco-Roman et al., 2019) . For separation type, still serving in the NG/R was found to reduce the odds of being in any of the higher-risk SI trajectories as compared to the resilient trajectory. This is likely to be explained, at least in part, by a greater tendency for those who are doing well to continue serving in the NG/R. Conversely, experiencing a medical separation was associated with increased odds of being in the chronic class and experiencing an \"other\" separation type, which included separating under other than honorable conditions and punitive discharge types, was associated with substantially increased odds (OR = 5.26) of being in the remitting class. These findings highlight the need to (1) connect veterans with medical separations to VHA or other health services early and to maintain those care connections and (2) continue expansion of VHA mental health services to recently separated veterans with other than honorable separations (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017). This is particularly important given prior research suggesting that connection with such services can help to reduce suicide risk for veterans with administrative discharge types  (Hoffmire et al., 2019) . Of note, while veterans who experienced higher risk trajectories were more likely to report using VHA services, this finding likely reflects the increased healthcare needs, including mental health, among VHA users.\n\nLastly, while gender differences in classes identified and predictors of class membership were minimal overall (i.e., same class structure and similar predictors of symptomatic trajectories), some nuanced differences were observed (i.e., differences in significance and magnitude of associations with trajectory classes). Future research to assess additional clinical and/or trauma-related predictors of SI class membership among veterans should carefully consider theoretical and research-driven hypotheses regarding potential gender differences on a case by case basis during study design given existing evidence that some suicide risk factors are differentially associated with SI among men and women veterans (e.g., military sexual trauma and combat, substance use disorders, and stressful life events;  Bohnert et al., 2017; Hoffmire, Monteith, Denneson, et al., 2021; Ilgen et al., 2010; Monteith et al., 2016) .\n\nIn summary, assessing different types of health trajectories, including SI frequency, is critical as analyses that focus on average change over time may mask different patterns of readjustment. This is particularly true when most of the population follows a \"healthy\" trajectory (e.g., resilient), and thus, the average experience is not representative of individuals experiencing symptomatic health trajectories who could benefit from interventions. It is thus important to consider how trends in suicide rates following separation for service-both those reported to date and in future research-could be impacted by such heterogenous risk classes; an absence of a clear trend for a large group does not preclude the possibility that there are subgroups of veterans experiencing higher suicide rates proximal to military separation."

      "title": "Study limitations",
      "text": "This study has several limitations to consider. First, PHQ-9 item-9 was used to measure SI. In contrast with other measures that ask about active thoughts of killing oneself, this measure addresses passive SI. While appropriate for our focus on upstream predictors of suicide risk and our goal to inform early intervention efforts during the transition from military service to civilian life, future studies should assess whether findings are similar for active SI and suicidal behaviors. Second, the smaller number of women in our sample made selecting the optimal number of classes more challenging (especially given a population-based sample with mostly healthy individuals) and precluded some more nuanced comparisons in the women-specific model. While attention to healthcare needs, preferences, and health outcomes among women veterans has increased in recent years, it is critical that researchers oversample women in veteran samples to better inform gender-sensitive care  (Hoffmire, Denneson, et al., 2021) . Third, from a statistical perspective, we chose to constrain variance in model parameters to zero, which results in less within-class variation than freely estimating model parameters. However, we did compare constrained models to those with freely estimated intercepts and the same number and form of classes were observed. Constrained parameters were chosen because the AIC, BIC, and aBIC values were similar, or in some cases smaller. Fourth, the initial TVMI study response rate (23%) may be considered low according to conventional survey standards and raises the question of whether non-response bias was a concern in this study. However, the response rate is in line with what has been observed for similar population-based studies of veterans  (Coughlin et al., 2011)  and prior TVMI analyses  (Vogt et al., 2018)  suggest that non-response bias was not a large concern for this study. Finally, not including mental health and trauma history (e.g., combat experiences and military sexual trauma) predictors in this analysis may be viewed as a limitation, though this was an intentional decision that was guided by the current state of knowledge about veterans' experiences of SI as they separate from service. In particular, because this was the first analysis to identify SI trajectories among recently transitioned veterans, it was imperative to first establish the SI classes and evaluate basic subgroup differences in SI trajectories. A critical next step for this line of research will be to examine the impact of other individual-and relationship-level characteristics known to impact suicide risk (e.g., physical and mental health, well-being, social support, and trauma history) on class membership-both at the time of military separation and throughout the transition period. Elucidating which veterans are at elevated risk for experiencing delayed-onset SI is particularly important to ensure those veterans, who may not appear to be at risk during transition, still receive necessary services to ameliorate factors that may drive future SI."

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "We found that most veterans do not experience frequent SI during the first 3 years post-separation from active duty military service; however, a substantial minority of veterans demonstrated symptomatic SI trajectories. Key predictors of symptomatic SI trajectories included younger age, racial/ethnic minority groups, other or medical separation, enlisted rank, and using VHA. These findings can inform transition services, both within and outside VHA, aimed at improving the health and quality of life of recently separated veterans and reducing their long-term suicide risk."
