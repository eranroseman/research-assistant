  "title": "Effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing on adult behaviour change in health and social care settings: A systematic review of reviews",
  "abstract": "Background The challenge of addressing unhealthy lifestyle choice is of global concern. Motivational Interviewing has been widely implemented to help people change their behaviour, but it is unclear for whom it is most beneficial. This overview aims to appraise and synthesise the review evidence for the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing on health behaviour of adults in health and social care settings. \n Methods A systematic review of reviews. Methods were pre-specified and documented in a protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42016049278). We systematically searched 7 electronic databases: CDSR; DARE; PROSPERO; MEDLINE; CINAHL; AMED and PsycINFO from 2000 to May 2018. Two reviewers applied pre-defined selection criteria, extracted data using TIDIER guidelines and assessed methodological quality using the ROBIS tool. We used GRADE criteria to rate the strength of the evidence for reviews including meta-analyses. \n Findings Searches identified 5222 records. One hundred and four reviews, including 39 meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria. Most meta-analysis evidence was graded as low or very low (128/155). Moderate quality evidence for mainly short term (<6 months) statistically significant small beneficial effects of Motivational Interviewing were found in 11 of 155 (7%) of meta-analysis comparisons. These outcomes include reducing binge drinking, frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption, substance abuse in people with dependency or addiction, and increasing physical activity participation.",

      "text": "There is overwhelming epidemiological evidence that health behaviour such as smoking, substance abuse (drugs and alcohol), physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The cost to the UK NHS for diseases associated with poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and obesity are estimated to be in excess of \u00a312 billion  [1] . The challenge of addressing unhealthy lifestyle choice is complex and requires sustained behaviour change. The UK NICE (2014) guidelines  [2]  recommend a range of behaviour change approaches, guided by a taxonomy of interventions  [3] , aimed at changing health-related behaviour of individuals, communities or whole populations.\n\nMotivation to change is a key component of the behaviour change process as it guides and maintains goal-related behaviour  [4] . One approach to change motivation and subsequent behaviour is Motivational Interviewing, introduced by William Miller in 1983 to help people with alcohol problems change their drinking behaviour  [5] . The approach was developed further in the 1990s into \"A collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person's own motivation and commitment to change\"  [5] . Motivational Interviewing aims to explore and resolve ambivalence that people might have about health behaviour in favour of change. It encourages people to say why and how they might change and pertains both to a style of relating to others and a set of skills to facilitate that process. The four overlapping processes involve: 1) engaging in a working relationship; 2) focusing on a problem to change; 3) evoking the person's desire to change; 4) planning the change  [5] . In 1997 an international organisation of trainers established 'The Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT)' with an aim to improve the quality and effectiveness of counseling and consultations for professional delivering Motivational Interviewing. The organisation has grown to represent 35 countries and 26 languages, which demonstrates the global popularity of this intervention. Some reviews report positive outcomes for Motivational Interviewing and suggest it could be useful for a wide range of behavioural and health problems  [6] [7] [8] [9]  whilst others are more cautious in their conclusions and recommendations  [10] [11] [12] .\n\nMany different health care professionals and other groups are using behaviour change interventions including Motivational Interviewing to help people change or adapt their behaviour. However, it is unclear for which behavioural problems and populations Motivational Interviewing is most beneficial, or in some cases, where there is evidence of no effect or possible harm. This overview aims to identify, appraise and synthesise the review evidence for the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing on health behaviour of adults in a wide range of health and social care settings to answer the following question;\n\nWhat is the strength and quality of the current evidence to support the use of Motivational Interviewing to change adult behaviours in health and social care settings?\n\n\u2022 Reviews using structured, pre-planned methods to synthesise research studies addressing a clearly defined topic or research question (which could comprise either quantitative, qualitative or mixed methodology)\n\n\u2022 Published from January 2000\n\n\u2022 Interventions described as Motivational Interviewing or Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) delivered in any format (e.g. face to face, online, group, text or telephone)\n\n\u2022 English language\n\n\u2022 Interventions focused on adults."

We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria to assess whether the quality of the evidence presented in the meta-analyses was high, moderate, low or very low  [16]  for all available comparator data within each review. This involved judgement of risk of bias relating to study design, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias  [17] .

We tabulated the intervention, comparison, outcome, number of studies and participants' data relating to effectiveness and the GRADE of evidence  [18] . Using the data relating to effectiveness we noted whether there was statistically significant evidence of benefit or harm for each outcome reported in the metaanalyses, or if there was no evidence of benefit or harm (no statistically significant effect)."

MI alone and in combination with CBT/ varied: e.g. usual care, Treatment as usual, GP advice with no training in MI Adherence and clinical outcomes Effects were inconsistent from study to study, and only a minority of lowest risk of bias RCTs improved both adherence and clinical outcomes. NR (LOW) (Continued )  Burke et al (2003) [106] To review individually delivered interventions that incorporated the four basic principles of MI. 30 trials (n = 6275). ranged from 22 to 952, mean of 206 Multiple groups of people from different settings Adapted MI (AMI) / varied: AMI + relapse prevention (RP); RP alone; CBT; No treatment; placebo control; education booklet; brief feedback Drinking frequency); BAC (peak) blood alcohol concentration exercise adherence and HIV risk behaviour Only 11 /30 studies produced statistically significant effect of MI. AMIs were equivalent to other active treatments and superior to no-treatment or placebo controls for problems involving alcohol, drugs, and diet and exercise. M-A (UNCLEAR) No high quality evidence. For all behaviours combined there is Low quality evidence of small effects of MI judged against a \"weak\" comparison but no benefit over a \"strong\" comparison Moderate quality evidence (assessed by GRADE) that MI increases physical activity participation in some populations, but the data is limited by small trials (See Tables 5 & 6) High quality trials are required and justified due to the large number of people who remain inactive. Focus should be on intervention fidelity. As the narrative reviews in this section are judged as high chance of bias, no further conclusion can be drawn with confidence. More research is needed to assess fidelity of technology assisted MI Dunn et al (2001) [107] To examine the effectiveness of brief behavioural interventions adapting the principles and techniques of MI to four behavioural domains 29 RCTs (n = 6330 ranged from 23-1726) Mixed male /female, with health problems; substance abuse, smoking, HIV risk and diet/exercise problems MI /no treatment or a comparison treatment Binge drinking, exercise participation, drug usage, cigarette usage, Only modest evidence that MI works at least as well as other treatments for clients with low baseline readiness. The evidence is inconclusive NR (UNCLEAR) Hettema et al (2005) [8] To assess the effectiveness of MI across multiple behavioural problems 72 RCTs and controlled studies. (n = 14,26) 16/37 (43%) were predominantly or entirely African American MI/ no treatment or placebo; MI added to standard or specified treatment; standard or specified treatment alcohol use, treatment compliance Large variation in effect size across studies. No relationship between outcomes and methodological quality or other outcomes e.g. time of follow-up assessment, comparison group type or provider. Manualised interventions yielded weaker effect. M-A (UNCLEAR) Lundahl et al (2010) [108] To investigate the unique contribution MI has on counselling outcomes and how MI compares with other interventions. 119 studies (some RCTS) (n = 9618) Majority sample were white, African American Or Hispanic. Other groups not recorded MI/ Waiting list/ control groups; TAU with a defined or specifically named program; written materials; an attention control group. Multiple outcomes Judged against weak comparison groups, MI produced statistically significant small effects. Judged against specific treatments, MI produced nonsignificant results M-A (UNCLEAR) Martins et al (2009) [109] To critically review the research in three emerging areas in which (MI) is being applied: diet and exercise, diabetes, and oral health. 37 empirical studies; 24 exercise and diet; 9 diabetes; 4 oral health (n = 15012) Adult obese women, southern Asian women; adults with diabetes, smokers physically inactive adults, MI / behaviour therapy Varied weight loss, fat intake, oral health, exercise uptake.

M-A (HIGH) O'Halloran et al (2014) To determine if MI leads to increased physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness or functional exercise capacity in people with chronic health conditions. 10 RCT or controlled trial (n = 981) People 18 or over with a chronic health condition. MI / Supervised exercise x 1; behavioural weight loss x1; WLC x2, Standard written information/ education x 2; usual care x 2 Physical activity levels; cardiorespiratory Fitness; functional exercise capacity Moderate quality evidence that MI may have a small positive effect on self-reported physical activity in people with chronic health conditions. M-A (LOW) Rubak et al (2005) [9] To evaluate the effectiveness of MI as an intervention tool and to identify factors shaping outcomes in the areas reviewed. 72 RCTs (19 meta-analysis) (n = 4173) Mainly adults (older adolescents also included) MI/ Traditional advice giving' e.g. patients' problem is viewed from a biomedical perspective. Health outcome; e.g. blood glucose, blood cholesterol; BMI, smoking cigs/day, blood alcohol, BP; utilisation of healthcare services; length of hospital stay, subjective reports. MI outperforms traditional advice giving in the treatment of a broad range of behavioural problems and diseases. A prolonged follow-up period increased the percentage of studies showing an effect. M-A (UNCLEAR) Shingleton et al (2017) [105] To describe and evaluate the methods and efficacy of technology-delivered MI interventions (TAMIs). 41 studies most RCTs (34 adults' population n = approx. 11000) Mainly adults with substance abuse problems; other health or social problem e.g. weight gain, addiction, criminals, Technologydelivered MI interventions (TAMI) (some combined with other therapy) / various TAU e.g. Follow-up with school nurse Acceptability/ feedback regarding the intervention and/or behavioural or psychological change related to the target health behaviour Limited data regarding efficacy. Strategies to deliver relational components remain a challenge. Future research should incorporate fidelity measures. TAMIs are feasible to implement and well accepted. NR (HIGH) Thompson (2011) [110] To review MI and to inform education, research and practice in relation to cardiovascular health. 9 studies, 3 including MI (n = 546 (MI = 266) Adults with at least one or more newly diagnosed or existing cardiovascular risk factors MI/ TAU Obesity, Smoking, treatment non-compliance, physical inactivity medical outcomes e.g. BP. MI is an effective approach to changing behaviour. It offers promise in improving cardiovascular health status. NR (HIGH) Domain 4: Reviews Focused on Behaviour Change Interventions in Specific Settings (Continued )\n\nSmoking cessation. One comparison from a review on smoking cessation was judged to provide moderate quality evidence. This review comparing Motivational Interviewing with usual care or brief advice, provides evidence of beneficial effects on abstinence from smoking, particularly when attention was paid to treatment fidelity  [12] .\n\nSubstance abuse (drugs). One comparison from a review of people with substance abuse dependency and addiction provides evidence of a benefit of Motivational Interviewing when compared with no intervention. The other four comparisons derived no benefit or harm when Motivational Interviewing was compared with usual care or any other treatment  [56] . author Objective Type and Number of studies Participants Intervention / Comparison Outcomes Summary of authors results Meta-analysis (M-A) or Narrative review (NR) and overall Risk of Bias (ROBIS score) Implication for clinical practice and research (Interpretation of authors of overview) Kohler et al (2015) [112] To examine changes in alcohol consumption after brief MI for young people with existing alcohol use problems, who were admitted to an emergency care unit alcohol positive, with an alcohol-related trauma, or with a history of elevated alcohol consumption 6 RCTs (2 specifically over 18) n = 1433 age 18-25) Young people in emergency care who screened positively for past or present risky alcohol consumption. BMI/ standard care, including written information (e.g. alcohol-use risk handout, educational brochure. Alcohol consumption, frequency and quantity MI was never less efficacious than a control intervention. Two trials found significantly more reduction in one or more measures of alcohol consumption in the MI intervention group. M-A (UNCLEAR) Narrative reviews support the meta-analyses suggesting there is no difference in outcome between professional groups who deliver MI. High quality research assessing competency and fidelity of MI interventions is needed to confirm if any benefits reported by Merz et al (2015) are sustained over 12 months. Knight et al (2006) [118] To identify the extent to which MI has been used in different physical health settings and appraise the effectiveness of MI 4 RCTs, 1 nonrandom controlled trial and 3 pilot studies. Hypertension, diabetes, asthma, hyperlipidaemia and heart disease. MI/ TAU (usual care) Psychological, physiological and life-style change outcomes MI has high face validity across several domains in physical health care settings. Recommendations for its dissemination in this area cannot yet be made. NR (UNCLEAR) Lundahl, et al (2013) [6] To investigate MI's efficacy in medical care settings 48 RCTs (n = 9618) Reported as moderator analyses rather than general participant description MI in medical setting/ 7 studies used a traditional waiting list group, (2) 16 studies used information only groups, 28 studies employed ''treatmentas-usual\" Prognostic markers, disease endpoints, risk reduction behaviours; physical functioning and quality of life, substance abuse, patient adherence to medical advice and patient approach to change. The emerging evidence for MI in medical care settings suggests it provides a moderate advantage over comparison interventions and could be used for a wide range of behavioural issues in health care. M-A (UNCLEAR) Merz et al (2015) [113] To identify evidence to reduce alcohol use and prevent alcohol related consequences in young adults (18-24 years old) admitted to the emergency department following acute alcohol intoxication. 4 RCTs (n = 618) Young adults (18-24). Brief MI/ usual care (2 trials); 1 x personalised feedback + phone booster at 1 & 3 months; 1 x education brochure + 5 min discussion Various alcohol-related outcomes: change in alcohol use, alcohol-related problems/risks, drinking & driving Inconclusive evidence. Most effective interventions include at least one therapeutic contact several days after the event. Successful interventions included booster sessions. Benefits were sustained over 12 months. NR (LOW) Noordman et al(2012) [114] To review effectiveness of faceto-face communication-related BCTs provided in primary care and to explore which health care provider is more effective in using face-to-face communication-related BCTs? 50 RCTs. 9 include MI 18+ years. People with risky lifestyle behaviour. Patients with heart or vascular disease BCTs including MI/ advice, pamphlets (or booklets) unstructured information, minimal care \"usual care\" to no intervention. Subjective (self-reported) and objective outcome measures related to patients' lifestyle behaviour. MI, education and advice can be used as effective communicationrelated BCTs delivered by physicians and nurses. NR (LOW) Purath, et al (2014) [117] To review MI interventions used to elicit health-related behaviour change among older adults in primary care settings. 8 RCTs and Pilot RCTs (n = 1388) Older people. Average participant age was over 60 years MI / varied 1 x newsletter; 4 x usual care; 1 x tailored information; 1 x telephone information call Weight loss, participation in physical activity; smoking cessation; fruit and vegetable consumption MI may be effective when incorporated into health promotion and disease prevention interventions. NR (UNCLEAR) Taggart et al (2012) [115] To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions used in primary care to improve health literacy for change in smoking, nutrition, alcohol, physical activity and weight. 52 studies Adults aged 18 years and over. Mixed sex, different socioeconomic backgrounds MI/ no description Health literacy outcomes; Knowledge Skills; Self efficacy Individual MI counselling and written materials were more effective in achieving impacts around smoking cessation compared to group education. NR (LOW) VanBuskirk et al (2014) [116] Is MI effective in improving behaviour modification in patients seeking treatment for health conditions in primary care settings? 12 RCTs varied from 26-515 (n = 3326) Primary care patients; mixed race and sex. MI / no treatment; mailed pamphlet; usual care; usual care + pamphlet; antismoking advice Substance use outcomes; bodyweight reduction; physical activity, adherence.

Four comparisons from a review of Motivational Interviewing for promoting physical activity participation were judged to provide moderate quality evidence when Motivational Interviewing was compared with a control or usual care. One out of the four comparisons provide evidence of benefits. No benefit was found for the other three comparisons, including outcomes for people with cardiovascular disease and obesity  [111] .\n\nSexual health.

      "text": "This overview is the first to integrate and systematically grade the quality of the evidence for the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing interventions across a wide range of settings and populations for people with many different health problems and diseases. We have created a comprehensive map of all reviews relating to Motivational Interviewing to provide clarity relating to an intervention for which there have been multiple overlapping (and sometimes conflicting) reviews. Conflicting review evidence can create barriers and challenges to practitioners wanting to deliver evidence-based practice. This overview provides practitioners, policy makers and researchers with a summary of the quality and strength of the evidence for Motivational Interviewing. It signposts practitioners to the most up to date reviews, enabling them to efficiently access best review evidence to support clinical decisions. We found no high-quality evidence from the meta-analysis data within any review, mainly due to methodological flaws in the reviews and poor quality of the included studies.\n\nMotivational Interviewing appears to be most effective for stopping or preventing unhealthy behaviours (categorised as Domain 1) such as binge drinking, reducing the quantity and frequency of drinking, smoking and substance abuse. For gambling behaviour, low quality evidence of short to long-term effectiveness suggests that further research on the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing is warranted to address this significant public health problem  [62] . For promoting healthy behaviour (categorised as Domain 2) where people may have little desire to change, most of the evidence is inconclusive or of low quality. For example, there is low quality evidence for the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing for weight loss outcomes in obese and overweight adults. The exception in Domain 2 is physical activity promotion where there is moderate quality evidence of beneficial effects of Motivational Interviewing for increasing physical activity in people with chronic health conditions. However, the trials assessing adherence to physical activity participation were small and further high quality research in this field is justified to investigate the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing in different populations, settings and context."

      "text": "The exploration of moderator variables from meta-analysis data does not provide enough data to be confident about the effects of different modes of delivery for Motivational Interviewing. Reviews that focus on the mode of delivery report inconsistent results  [45, 51, 95, 105] . The TIDieR guidelines  [14]  capture some of the features that are relevant to intervention delivery but the mode of delivery is considered to be an important component of intervention and is not reported consistently in the literature  [121] . Recent reviews have compared telephone  [51]  or technology-delivered Motivational Interviewing interventions (TAMIs) [105] and report inconsistent results or no beneficial effects. For example,  Shingleton et al (2016)  [105] found that TAMIs are feasible to deliver but there is limited evidence of effectiveness. For an intervention that relies on building and developing a relationship between client and provider it seems unlikely that this mode of delivery could be successfully adapted for Motivational Interviewing without considerable focus on training and fidelity measures."

However, the NICE (2014) Programme Development Group (PH49) are cautious about making general recommendations due to lack of details of intervention components reported in this field of research  [2] .\n\nThis overview has identified clear gaps in the evidence in support of most of the interventions categorised in Domain 2 (e.g. weight loss programmes for obesity, oral health behaviour, management of diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders, adherence to medication and engagement with interventions). The high quality reviews on smoking cessation  [12]  and alcohol abuse  [49]  both recommend caution when interpreting results. However, the overall effect size reported by Lundahl et al [108] of 0.22 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.27) is similar to other complex behavioural intervention  [122, 123] . If applied to the 1 million smokers in the UK, or the millions of physically inactive people globally [124], it is plausible that the impact of Motivational Interviewing on health at a population level may be larger. Further rigorous research is required to support this assumption."

Reviews that compared different health care providers found either no difference between groups [114] or reported limited conclusions due to small sample size  [12] . It is difficult to comment on the cost effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing as it was not the focus of this overview, however we identified very little health economic data. Where cost data was available from a trial of smoking cessation in the UK, no clear conclusions could be drawn as the sustained quit rates did not reach statistical significance  [12] ."

It highlights the discrepancy between the widespread recommendations of Motivational Interviewing as a universal behaviour change strategy and the available evidence supporting this approach. We carried out a comprehensive search with an inclusive selection criteria and it is unlikely that we missed any reviews written in English prior to our initial search, but this overview is not exhaustive.\n\nThe conclusions of this overview are highly dependent on, not only the quality of the reviews but the studies within the reviews. We extracted data according to the TIDieR guidelines  [14]  but many intervention details were missing, making it difficult to draw conclusions with confidence. This problem needs to be addressed in future trials to facilitate data synthesis and provide clear recommendation to all stakeholders. Our assessment of review quality (ROBIS)  [15]  and evidence quality (GRADE)  [17]  are subjective judgements and we used these judgements to categorise the evidence, concentrating our conclusions on those judged to be moderate quality (or low bias for narrative reviews). Some may consider our methods overly critical, but authors of the higher quality reviews are equally cautious with their recommendations  [11, 12, 49] ."

      "text": "The established Network of Trainers (MINT) alone have delivered Motivational Interviewing around the world to millions of people [126] but many questions remain unanswered regarding effectiveness.\n\nRecommendations for clinical practice. Many different health professional groups are using Motivational Interviewing but the evidence for training reported in the literature is limited. The 'Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity code' (MITI) has evolved over the last 10 years  [127]  with an aim to standardise the delivery of Motivational Interviewing interventions. Guidelines for the minimum intervention content and training requirements for Motivational Interviewing are available and should be followed to standardise intervention delivery  [127, 128] .\n\nRecommendations for future reviews. This overview has identified and brought together systematic reviews relating to Motivational Interviewing interventions; however further systematic reviews are warranted to inform clinical practice and future primary research in this field. Recommendations include, but are not limited to; 1. Research should address the fact that in clinical practice Motivational Interviewing is often delivered in combination with another psychological intervention. Systematic reviews exploring combined interventions were excluded from this overview; consequently, it is important to identify and appraise any existing systematic reviews relevant to this, prior to planning new reviews or primary research.\n\n2. Future systematic reviews would benefit from the development of a taxonomy to ensure meaningful categorisation of the delivered intervention which considers the theoretical basis for Motivational Interviewing. Meaningful categorisation of Motivational Interviewing should be central to informing clinically relevant analyses and subgroup analyses.\n\n3. A systematic review to explore the cost-effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing as an intervention for those health conditions where there is moderate quality evidence of a beneficial effect of Motivational Interviewing on patient outcomes.\n\n4. A systematic review to explore the barriers and facilitators to delivery of Motivational Interviewing, focussed on those health conditions where there is moderate or high quality evidence of a beneficial effect."

The use of reporting templates, recognised guidance and best practice for the conduct of systematic reviews and primary research is essential. e.g. PRISMA [129] and TIDieR  [14] .\n\nRecommendations for future primary research.\n\n1. Exploration of the effect of Motivational Interviewing should consider long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Subgroup analyses should explore the length of intervention delivery and time since the end of the intervention.\n\n2. Investment in training would need to be large to impact on change in practice [130] and this along with other issues relating to sustainability of the intervention e.g. context, should be considered in future trials.\n\n3. To ensure avoidance of research waste  [131, 132]  it is essential that researchers are fully aware of existing reviews before embarking on further reviews, and that critical systematic reviews of evidence are completed prior to further primary research."

Training issues are fundamental to the success of any complex intervention and Motivational Interviewing, like other surgical, therapy or other behavioural interventions, requires practice of skills and a basic level of competency. There is no formal requirement for training in Motivational Interviewing or evaluation therefore practitioners can claim to use the approach without assessment, and competency is likely to influence outcome. Hall et al (2016) suggest that investment in training would need to be large to impact on change in practice [125]."

Training issues are fundamental to the success of any complex intervention and Motivational Interviewing, like other surgical, therapy or other behavioural interventions, requires practice of skills and a basic level of competency. There is no formal requirement for training in Motivational Interviewing or evaluation therefore practitioners can claim to use the approach without assessment, and competency is likely to influence outcome. Hall et al (2016) suggest that investment in training would need to be large to impact on change in practice [125]."

Interventions targeting practical medication management skills, interventions administered to individuals' vs groups, and those interventions delivered over 12 weeks or more were associated with improved adherence outcomes. MI interventions might be effective at enhancing medication adherence in adults treated for chronic diseases.
