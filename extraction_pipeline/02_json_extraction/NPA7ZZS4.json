  "title": "Effectiveness of mobile health intervention in medication adherence: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Low medication adherence is known to pose a great risk of poor treatment outcomes among patients with chronic diseases. Recently, mobile applications (apps) have been recognized as effective interventions, enabling patients to adhere to their prescriptions. This study aimed to establish the effectiveness of mobile app interventions for medication adherence and the affecting features and dropout rates by focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Method: This study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of mobile app interventions targeting medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases. Electronic searches of eight databases were conducted on April 21, 2023. Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software was used to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) of pooled outcomes, odds ratios (ORs), and con dence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis was applied to investigate and compare the effectiveness of the interventional strategies and their features. The risk of bias of the included RCTs was evaluated by applying the risk of bias (ROB) tool. Publication bias was also examined using the fail-safe N method. Results: Twenty-nine studies with 2,684 participants were included. The meta-analysis ndings showed a positive impact of mobile apps on improving medication adherence (SMD = 0.386, OR = 2.34). The subgroup analysis results revealed greater effectiveness of interventions using interactive strategies (SMD=1.367, OR=2.678), context-aware reminders (SMD = 0.664, OR = 2.452), data-sharing (SMD = 0.321, OR = 2.449), and pill dispenser (OR = 2.436). \n Conclusion: The current study found that mobile interventions had signi cant effects on medication adherence improvement. Subgroup analysis showed that the roles of stakeholders in health providers' interactions with patients and developers' understanding of patients and disease characteristics are critical. Future studies should incorporate advanced technology re ecting acceptability and the needs of the target population.",

      "text": "Increases in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, with diverse complications, in aging populations bring nancial burdens to nations and are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. [1, 2]  Issues related to non-adherence in patients with chronic diseases can cause the fast deterioration of disease conditions and increased risks of complications, which eventually lead to increased mortality. [3]  The risk of non-adherence and its negative impact on health have resulted in diverse efforts to use health information technology, which has been considered bene cial and cost-effective, to improve medication behavior. [4]  The de nition of medication adherence is \"the process by which patients take their medications as prescribed\" and involves the continuous efforts of patients as well as family and health providers. [5, 6]  To prevent non-adherence or the poor implementation of a prescribed regimen (e.g., skipping, extra, or reduced doses), one of the most effective strategies is regularly monitoring drug intake. [7]  Prior behavioral and educational interventions showed rather modest effects.[8] and uniform interventions were distinct from solutions for diverse non-adherence phenotype. [8]  Mobile health is considered a signi cant breakthrough in the eld of disease management. [9]  In response to increases in preparedness for uncertain and complex healthcare environments, technological advancement is expected to support healthcare professionals as well as patients. Mobile health, in particular, which is considered a subset of digital health, includes health information technology, telemedicine, and personalized medicine.[10] The use of this technology enables patients to engage in disease management anywhere and anytime, assuring frequent and consistent contact with patients, the timely provision of intervention with health information, and the facilitation and motivation of patients to conduct self-management. [11]  Mobile data provide health providers with real-time access and enables the monitoring of patient data. [12]  This could also be a means to create diverse forms of health data that provide opportunities to improve healthcare systems. Information from this analysis offers possibilities for innovation, impactfully addressing various concerns and predicting future health. The correct use of patient data and information was also highlighted as safety and privacy concerns.\n\nAlong with Smartphones, diverse devices, such as wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, are integrated into mobile health. This has been considered an unprecedented opportunity as cutting-edge technology has become a promising solution in the detection and management of diseases. [13, 14]  The rapid development of this technology through the integration of smart devices into mobile health is recognized as suitable for supporting patients and healthcare providers. [15]  A number of systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of mobile health in disease management and medication adherence. However, the reviews on the suitability of using mobile applications (apps) were restricted in scope to speci c patient groups and types of health behavior or did not secure the robustness of results, including non-randomized clinical trials (RCTs). And application-based interventions, such as wearable and smart devices, have been insu ciently examined. A previous meta-analysis of 14 mobile app interventional studies with 1,785 patients with chronic diseases revealed a signi cant improvement in medication adherence. However, the quality of evidence was concerning as small sample-sized studies with a high risk of bias were included.\n\n[16] More recently, a 2021 meta-analysis of 12 RCTs also reported improvements, yet the data were from self-reported adherence scores and limited to cardiovascular disease. [17]  Given the increased interest in mobile health, signi cant studies have been conducted to identify the effectiveness of mobile apps for chronic disease management. A recent overview of previously conducted systematic reviews revealed the bene ts and cost-effectiveness of the interventions applied.[18] Yet there is a lack of research analyzing speci c features of apps or smart devices. A previous value assessment suggested elements requiring optimizations. [19]  Thus, the present study aimed to determine the functions and features of mobile apps, focusing on varying degrees of technological applications for app development and effectiveness."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study included RCTs using mobile apps to improve medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases. The ndings indicated statistically signi cantly higher medication adherence in the intervention group than in the control group, and dropout rates differed according to the characteristics of the interventions. The subgroup analysis results indicated the importance of comprehensively designed interactive applications, and achievable levels of personalized features are essential. About half of the included studies (14 out of 29) targeted patients with cardiovascular disease. Perhaps medication adherence is a high priority for patients with these diseases.\n\n[56] Thus, sustainable interventions to reduce nonadherence are required to decrease the relative hazard and the ndings of this study revealed the potential of using mobile apps as a solution.\n\nApp-based interventions featuring interactions with healthcare providers showed substantial improvement in medication adherence. Particularly, the subgroup analysis revealed the importance of data-sharing with healthcare providers and a previous study reported that health data fostered positive patient-clinician relationships. [57]  This is consistent with previous review studies reporting better outcomes when healthcare providers were involved. [17, 58]  Apps could ensure patient-clinician interaction and, when they were data-based, obtain better disease management for patients. In disease surveillance, early detection, and timely intervention, the further incorporation of advanced features (e.g., AI, electronic health records) would optimize patient support for disease management  [59]  Thus, the key to encouraging the wider use of health apps is a strategy to overcome existing barriers to health services that require long terms and traveling great distances.\n\nThe current study analyzed medication adherence using data recorded electronically. As the lack of accuracy and sensitivity of self-reported measures has been reported, electronic event monitoring or pill counting has consistently been suggested for measuring medication management.[60, 61] As a healthcare monitoring system, tracking and analyzing health data can not only identify the reason for non-adherence but also provide data-driven recommendations for individuals. The current subgroup analysis revealed the signi cance of dispensers. Changes were made to electronic adherence monitoring devices to achieve highly accurate data for medication adherence. By detecting user adherence, health providers were able to draw patterns of medication behavior for how misuse occurs,[62, 63] incorporating individualized healthcare planning.\n\n[63]\n\nAlthough they were unable to estimate effectiveness, recently published studies integrated diverse devices (e.g., electronic weight scales). [29, 37, 42, 48, 50, 51, 55, [64] [65] [66]  Moreover, the rapid growth of wearable devices (e.g., wearable biometric sensors) has brought dramatic changes to monitoring patients' behavior and health conditions.[67] Previous reviews pointed out the importance of these devices, and studies suggested that well-established data-sharing with health providers could promote optimal disease management planning.[66, 68] Although it was unable to con rm with statistical analysis, ease of use and functionality would key to success that focusing on implementation of multiple system, these are often missed out. As a previous study identi ed,[69] the effectiveness of future applications is likely to be in uenced by how each device is integrated.\n\nHealth monitoring devices play a role in compliance with medication regimens,  [70]  and the advantages could also be related to the motivation for self-care. A previous review revealed that medication compliance was better in patients who monitored their health indicators daily  [71, 72]  Advanced sensor system technology can provide novel methods for improving the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. [73]  Furthermore, the clear visualization of monitoring data long term and from multiple sensors allows better accessibility to health data in a comprehensive manner. [74]  Future reviews focusing on rigorous analyses of technological strategies that could reduce non-adherence and improve self-care are needed.\n\nThe current analysis showed that the effectiveness of reminders was questionable. A previous study identi ed that the impact on adherence varied depending on the types of reminder and alarm frequency. Simple reminders did not result in better medication adherence outcomes, consistent with suggestions from a previous study. [75]  In this regard, context-aware reminders have been suggested. Context-aware reminders were initiated when a dose was due, had not been taken, or was still safe to take in the included studies that used diverse technologies from sensors in pill blisters to AI for medication intake recognition. [76]  Future studies guiding reminder optimization in the context of individual patients would ensure not only the quality but also the person-centeredness of mobile health interventions."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The current review was not without limitations. First, grey literature and unpublished papers were not searched, so some papers that might have affected the ndings were not included. The language in the electronic database searches was limited to English and Korean. Thus, caution is needed in interpreting the pooled estimates of the intervention effects. Methodological discrepancies in measuring medication adherence between studies made it impossible to pool estimates in all 29 included studies, so they were divided into two reports, making it challenging to use the pooled estimates to ascertain the effectiveness of mobile interventions on medication adherence. In addition, the quality assessment revealed that most studies lacked concealing and blinding, which could have affected the overall quality of this review."

The ndings demonstrated that mobile apps could assist with medication intake required over a long period and time management. The inclusion of health providers in data-driven interactions showed promising outcomes in improving medication adherence. While the greater effectiveness of particular features or devices was not conclusive, the ndings indicated the importance of carefully considering end-user acceptance and preferences.\n\nRecommendations for future studies include incorporating more diverse and advanced technologies into mobile app interventions and conducting robustly designed studies."
