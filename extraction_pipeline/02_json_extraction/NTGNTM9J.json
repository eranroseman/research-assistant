  "title": "Improvement and Maintenance of Clinical Outcomes in a Digital Mental Health Platform: Findings From a Longitudinal Observational Real-World Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital mental health services are increasingly being provided by employers as health benefit programs that can improve access to and remove barriers to mental health care. Stratified care models, in particular, offer personalized care recommendations that can offer clinically effective interventions while conserving resources. Nonetheless, clinical evaluation is needed to understand their benefits for mental health and their use in a real-world setting. Objective: This study aimed to examine the changes in clinical outcomes (ie, depressive and anxiety symptoms and well-being) and to evaluate the use of stratified blended care among members of an employer-sponsored digital mental health benefit. Methods: In a large prospective observational study, we examined the changes in depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety symptoms (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and well-being (5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index) for 3 months in 509 participants (mean age 33.9, SD 8.7 years; women: n=312, 61.3%; men: n=175, 34.4%; nonbinary: n=22, 4.3%) who were newly enrolled and engaged in care with an employer-sponsored digital mental health platform (Modern Health Inc). We also investigated the extent to which participants followed the recommendations provided to them through a stratified blended care model. \n Results: Participants with elevated baseline symptoms of depression and anxiety exhibited significant symptom improvements, with a 37% score improvement in depression and a 29% score improvement in anxiety (P values <.001). Participants with baseline scores indicative of poorer well-being also improved over the study period (90% score improvement; P=.002). Furthermore, over half exhibited clinical improvement or recovery for depressive symptoms (n=122, 65.2%), anxiety symptoms (n=127, 59.1%), and low well-being (n=82, 64.6%). Among participants with mild or no baseline symptoms, we found high rates of maintenance for low depressive (n=297, 92.2%) and anxiety (n=255, 86.7%) symptoms and high well-being (n=344, 90.1%). In total, two-thirds of the participants (n=343, 67.4%) used their recommended care, 16.9% (n=86) intensified their care beyond their initial recommendation, and 15.7% (n=80) of participants underused care by not engaging with the highest level of care recommended to them. Conclusions: Participants with elevated baseline depressive or anxiety symptoms improved their mental health significantly from baseline to follow-up, and most participants without symptoms or with mild symptoms at baseline maintained their mental health over time. In addition, engagement patterns indicate that the stratified blended care model was efficient in matching individuals with the most effective and least costly care while also allowing them to self-determine their care and use combinations of services that best fit their needs. Overall, the results of this study support the clinical effectiveness of the platform for improving",

      "text": "The prevalence of mental health needs in the United States has been on an upward trend in recent years, with 21% of adults meeting criteria for a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder in 2020, up from 18% in 2010  [1] . National data indicate that <50% of people with mental health concerns are able to access mental health services  [1] . Traditional models of mental health care are inadequate, as they rely heavily on high-cost providers delivering scheduled, time-limited encounters, and training programs are decades away from adequately closing the provider shortage gaps  [2, 3] . In addition to a pervasive shortage of mental health professionals to provide needed care  [4] , issues related to cost, accessibility, and stigma also prevent individuals from accessing evidence-based care to address mental health concerns  [1] . Thus, innovative models for mental health care that are scalable, resource sensitive, and acceptable to individuals are needed to sufficiently improve the provision of robust mental health care in the United States.\n\nInnovative and flexible models of mental health care leverage technology and telecommunications to provide more rapid and scalable access to a myriad of mental health services, from self-guided \"self-help\" techniques to access to providers who deliver secure, remote care  [5] . An advantageous feature of digital mental health platforms is their flexibility in offering a variety of care modalities, enabling users to exercise their preferences in accessing care in a way that best fits their needs and comfort level. Stepped care delivery models further accelerate improvements in mental health care access and affordability. There are currently 2 models: progressive and stratified. A progressive model recommends the lowest-intensity intervention first to all individuals and intensifies care if or when symptoms do not improve  [6] . This is the prevailing system used by the United Kingdom National Health Service's Talking Therapies program (formerly called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies)  [7] . The evidence supporting this model suggests that patients' baseline symptomatology does not impact the efficacy of low-intensity or high-intensity treatments  [8, 9] .\n\nHowever, recent research suggests the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies program may not adequately support or match the complexity of patients' presenting mental health issues  [10] . There are several criticisms  [11]  of the progressive approach, including (1) low-intensity interventions may not be suitable or acceptable for everyone; (2) patients who do not respond to low-intensity treatment may develop negative attitudes toward treatment or be deterred from undergoing further treatment;  (3)  engaging in high-intensity treatment after a minimal intervention may be unnecessarily burdensome; and (4) those with greater clinical needs may have to wait longer to receive a more effective level of care and, in the interim, experience an exacerbation of symptoms and additional impairment.\n\nAs an alternative, a stratified model considers patient characteristics, preferences, and baseline mental health symptoms to identify and deliver the most clinically effective yet least burdensome and least costly initial intervention from a range of care modalities of different intensities  [12] . Stratifying care with personalized recommendations is thought to be more patient-centered and is responsive to key drawbacks of the progressive stepped care approach  [11] . In some stratified systems, more specifically blended care models, patients can access multiple modalities simultaneously; that is, they can use their recommended treatment modality as well as additional modalities of lower intensity than their recommended starting point (eg, digital tools plus provider sessions, as opposed to digital-only or provider-only session). While advantageous from a delivery perspective and found to be effective  [13, 14] , stratified, blended models can be more difficult to evaluate because of the complexity and variety of care pathways offered to patients and the variability of \"blends\" that patients may use at different points in time."

      "title": "Research Questions",
      "text": "Prior findings regarding the clinical superiority of progressive models over stratified models are mixed  [15, 16] . These mixed results and the criticisms of progressive stepped care suggest that by incorporating patient-level factors to match individuals with the most effective yet least costly mental health services, stratified, blended models can offer more personalized care and increase access while optimizing resources. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of and engagement in a digital mental health platform that uses a stratified blended care approach to deliver therapy, coaching, and self-guided digital services. Specifically, we tested two research questions:  (1)  Was this approach clinically effective, that is, did participants with elevated baseline mental health symptoms significantly improve their mental health as defined by depression, anxiety, and well-being scores, and did participants without elevated baseline symptoms maintain good mental health from baseline to 3-month follow-up? (2) Was this approach effective in stratifying resources, that is, did people follow, underuse, or overuse mental health services at the levels they were recommended?"

A proprietary algorithm factored in a combination of the participant's clinical acuity, their modality preference, and their topic of focus to recommend an initial care pathway (eg, digital programs, coaching, and therapy). Participants were not required to follow the recommendation; instead, it was offered as an appropriate suggested starting point. Participants who were recommended therapy also had access to coaching and digital content, and those who were recommended coaching also had access to digital content as part of their recommendations (Figure  1 ). Participants could also self-refer or be referred by a provider to a different combination of care from their recommended combinations. Eligible members were invited to complete a screener for the study via email, which collected their demographic information (age, gender identity, race, and ethnicity). All screeners were sent within 2 weeks of onboarding, with most members receiving the screener approximately 1 week after onboarding. During this time, the members were able to engage with the digital mental health services outlined in the Intervention section. A total of 2 factors determined the length of time it took to send the screener: research staff availability and demographic balancing. Limits were set such that enrolled study participants reflected the current distribution of age, gender, ethnic/racial identity, and mental health symptom acuity observed in the platform's commercial population. Out of the 8786 individuals who were eligible and invited to participate, 950 (10.81%) enrolled, provided informed consent, and completed the baseline survey, hosted by Qualtrics (Qualtrics International Inc). They were then emailed a link to complete a follow-up survey 12 weeks after the baseline survey.\n\nThe baseline and follow-up surveys each took 30 to 45 minutes to complete."

Overusing care occurred when participants used a higher level of care than what they were initially recommended (intensified their care above what was originally recommended, regardless of whether that use step-up was self-referred or referred by a provider). Because participants who were originally recommended therapy as their care modality could not step up their care any higher, only participants who were recommended coaching or digital content or coaching could overuse care. Finally, we defined the underuse of care as participants using a lower level of care than their recommendation and not using any higher care modality.

Of the 362 participants who were recommended coaching, 73 (20.2%) intensified their care to meet with a therapist. Of the 48 participants who were recommended digital content, 13 (27%) intensified their care to access coaching and 2 (4%) participants intensified their care to access a therapist.\n\nIn total, 15.7% (80/509) of the participants underused care; that is, they did not engage with the care they were recommended or with a higher-intensity care. Specifically, 15 (15%) of the 99 participants who were recommended therapy declined the invitation to connect with a therapist, and 65 (10.8%) of the 362 participants who were recommended coaching declined the invitation to connect with a coach. A post hoc chi-square analysis comparing the likelihood of clinical improvement or recovery among groups of underusers, overusers, and those who engaged with their recommended level of care found no significant differences in outcomes between groups."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "We examined the clinical effectiveness of and engagement in a digital mental health platform that uses a stratified blended care model to deliver mental health services. We found significant improvements in depressive, anxiety, and well-being symptoms among participants with elevated baseline symptoms and high rates of maintaining low symptoms and well-being among participants with lower clinical risk at baseline. Between 60% and 66% of the participants experienced clinically meaningful improvement or recovery in depressive, anxiety, or well-being symptoms over 3 months. We observed the greatest improvements in well-being (90% score increase), followed by depressive (37% score reduction) and anxiety symptoms (29% score reduction). These results are similar to the published rates of recovery in stepped care systems, which range from 40% to 60%  [24] .\n\nAmong participants with a lower baseline risk (defined as having scores that did not meet the clinical cutoff for that measure), mental health symptoms did not escalate above the clinical threshold or significantly worsen overall; anxiety symptoms remained stable, and depressive symptoms and well-being slightly improved on average. Between 87% and 92% of the participants experienced maintenance of good mental health at follow-up. Given that prevention and well-being promotion are cost-effective for mental health care and provide a positive return on investment for payers  [25] , our results lend further support to digital mental health services as being helpful for maintaining good mental health. Examining both symptom improvement and prevention of escalating symptoms is crucial to evaluating whether a model of mental health care is improving population health.\n\nMost participants engaged with their personalized care recommendation, with only around one-third overusing or underusing services. Two-thirds (343/509, 67.4%) of the participants used the recommended level of services; that is, they engaged with their recommended care services but did not step up to use higher-intensity care. Rates of meeting the care recommendation were the highest for therapy, with 85% (84/99) of people who were recommended therapy having at least 1 visit with a therapist.\n\nWe also found that less than one-fifth (86/509, 16.9%) of the participants overused care; that is, they engaged with a care modality of a higher intensity than the one they were initially recommended. Although we did not have data available on referral pathways, participants could use a higher intensity of care through 2 channels: self-referral by contacting member services through the platform with their request and provider referral where a coach could refer a participant to a therapist if they had a demonstrated clinical need. Interestingly, patterns of overuse matched the intensity hierarchy of services: 20% (73/362) of the people who were recommended coaching moved up 1 level of intensity to therapy, 27% (13/48) of the people who were recommended digital content moved up 1 level to coaching, and only 4.2% (2/48) of the people who were recommended digital content moved up 2 levels to therapy. This further supports the accuracy of the initial care recommendations of this model. In addition, the fairly low rates of overuse are encouraging, considering long-held beliefs about psychotherapy as the gold standard for mental health treatment at all levels of care  [26] .\n\nFinally, less than one-fifth (80/509, 15.7%) of the participants underused care; that is, they only engaged with lower-intensity care modalities than their recommendation. The rate was slightly higher for those who were recommended therapy (of the 99 participants, 15 (15%) did not have a visit with a therapist), while among those who were recommended coaching, 10.8% (65/362) did not have a visit with a coach or therapist. These rates of treatment nonadherence are consistent with those observed in psychotherapy research  [27]  and are better than those observed in previous research on digital interventions  [28] . A post hoc analysis did not find statistically significant differences in improvement or recovery between people who followed their recommended care and those who overused or underused care. However, the lack of significance could be an artifact of low statistical power, given the skewed proportion of participants in the underuse and overuse categories. Future research that examines reasons for underusing or overusing care qualitatively would provide further insight into why this occurs for some people and may allow programs to stratify individuals into levels of care more appropriately.\n\nIt is difficult to compare the effectiveness of stratified blended care approaches in real-world contexts with that of other studies in the literature because most research has been conducted within highly controlled clinical trials, which lack ecological validity (eg, see Andrews et al  [13]  and Ho et al  [29] ). However, in one trial comparing stratified and progressive stepped care models, 76% of eligible screened patients engaged in treatment (high intensity or low intensity depending on personalized treatment recommendations)  [16] . Thus, the engagement rate observed here is similar to that in research settings with high internal validity, suggesting that this platform is relatively accurate in recommending effective care. Our observational results of stratified blended care engagement patterns indicate that this model was efficient in matching individuals with the most effective and least costly care while also allowing them to self-determine their care and use combinations of services that best fit their needs."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Although this investigation demonstrated improvements in depression, anxiety, and well-being over time in a sample of digital mental health platform users, the observational nature of this study presents a limitation. The inclusion of a comparison or control group in an experimental design would confirm the causality of the observed changes. The 3-month time frame of this investigation also limits our conclusions to short-term gains; a longer-term follow-up period is needed to determine the persistence of improvements. Only 9.25% (950/10,270) of the individuals who were eligible and invited to participate enrolled in this study. The reasons for this are not known but may be due to a combination of factors, such as the time commitment needed, as each survey took between 30 and 45 minutes to complete. In addition, although study materials highlighted the separation between the study and their employer, most invitations to participate were distributed to workplace email addresses, which may have given the impression to participants that their employers would be involved or aware of their participation in this investigation. Although the retention rate of this investigation was 73.26% (696/950) overall, the sample was limited to those who used at least 1 piece of content or sought a provider. More individuals were registered for the platform but did not use any care. This is common in real-world settings, as individuals may register for services without the intention of using them immediately. There were no significant differences on key demographic characteristics and baseline symptoms between the sample who met eligibility criteria and those who did not, which helps to bolster the generalizability of our findings.\n\nIn addition, we were unable to discern between self-referrals and provider referrals for the 16.9% (86/509) of the members who sought more intensive services beyond their initial care recommendation. It is possible that the 17% include some individuals who were appropriately identified for intensification of services (ie, a coach detected additional symptoms, or a member disclosed additional pertinent information that was not detected in the assessment algorithm that determines care recommendations).\n\nFinally, most of the sample (312/509, 61.3%) identified as women, and only 34.4% (175/509) identified as men. Furthermore, the percentage of nonbinary people in this sample was higher than the overall US population  [30]  at 4.3%. There are several possibilities for the disproportionate numbers of women and nonbinary people enrolling in this study. First, the disproportionate number of nonbinary people in the sample may reflect a younger population, who are more likely to identify as transgender or nonbinary than older populations (5% vs 1.6% overall)  [30] . In addition, we provided multiple nonbinary options for participants as opposed to a single all-encompassing option (eg, \"nonbinary\"), which may have encouraged identification. Finally, women and people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning, including people who identify as nonbinary, are more likely to experience mental illness  [31, 32] . Women are more likely to seek help than men (due in part to societal expectations of stoicism and self-reliance for men, as well as mental health stigma), which might have affected their likelihood of signing up for the Modern Health app and participating in research  [33] . Regardless of the reason for the lack of men in this sample, it is possible that the results here may be different among other populations, and we encourage future research to examine these potential differences."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "Overall, the results of this study lend support to the utility and effectiveness of the stratified blended care model used in this study to improve access to and use of mental health services. In a resource-constrained ecosystem, using a stratified blended model, such as the one evaluated, can make efficient use of limited and costly services while centering the individual's needs, preferences, and receptivity to mental health care. The deliberate allocation of resources preserved the more intensive and costly resources for those who are most likely to benefit from them while providing beneficial care at all levels. As our results indicate, meaningful clinical improvements can be gained through stratified blended care while honoring the individual's personal preference for how they want to engage in care.\n\nResearch continues throughout the field of mental health to determine the therapeutic approaches, techniques, and tools that can be adapted and disseminated for digital delivery while preserving safety, quality, validity, and efficacy  [34] . As progress continues, the constraints of the traditional tertiary care model of mental health will eventually give way to a more comprehensive approach that can serve the full spectrum of mental health from primary prevention to treatment."
