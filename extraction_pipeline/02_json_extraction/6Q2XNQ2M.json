  "title": "Motivational Interviewing: An Evidence-Based Approach for Use in Medical Practice",
  "abstract": "Background: Motivational factors in health-relevant modes of behavior are an important matter in medical practice. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a technique that has been specifically developed to help motivate ambivalent patients to change their behavior. Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Special attention was paid to systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerning the efficacy of MI in the medical care of various target groups. The present review focuses on the relevance of MI for patients with highly prevalent disorders. Results: Meta-analyses reveal statistically significant mean intervention effects of MI in medical care with respect to a variety of health-relevant modes of behavior, in comparison to standard treatment and no treatment in the control groups (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55; 95% confidence interval: [1.40; 1.71]). Statistically significant effect sizes were reported for substance consumption, physical activity, dental hygiene, body weight, treatment adherence, willingness to change behavior, and mortality; effects on healthpromoting behavior were mixed. Studies of the factors that contribute to the efficacy of MI suggest that it exerts its effects largely through the selective reinforcement of statements made by the patients themselves about potential changes in their behavior. Conclusion: MI has been found useful for strengthening the motivation for behavioral change in patients with various behaviorally influenced health problems and for promoting treatment adherence. It can be used to optimize medical interventions. Further research is needed with respect to its specific mechanisms of action, its efficacy in reinforcing health-promoting modes of behavior, differential indications for different patient groups, and the cost-efficiency of the technique across the spectrum of disorders in which it is used.",

Other important motivational factors for medical practice stem from the often insufficient adherence to medication, which, according to a number of studies, lies between 31.2% and 59.1% and also represents a significant factor in the chronification of health impairments  (3) (4) (5) .\n\nFurthermore, societal changes in recent decades that challenge our understanding of the clinician's role are reflected in the concept of \"shared decisionmaking,\" according to which treatment steps should be developed in consultation with the patient  (6) .\n\nMotivational interviewing (MI)  (7) , which originated in the field of addiction treatment, is a promising concept for encouraging motivation to change in patients that are currently either unwilling or ambivalent to change, and can be deployed even with limited time resources. Since the first publications on the approach in the early 1980s, it has also been increasingly used, and successfully so, in other disciplines. This article presents the basic principles of the approach from the perspective of their applicability in medical practice. To assess the effectiveness of the method, systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in the PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases since 2005 on the effectiveness of MI across disorders in medical treatment settings, as well as on the effectiveness of MI on medication adherence, were selectively searched and summarized using the search terms (\"Motivational Interviewing\" AND (\"primary care\" OR \"medical care\")."

      "title": "Basic tenets of motivational interviewing",
      "text": "Although MI is not a theory-guided approach, it nevertheless combines a variety of evidence-based approaches from cognitive psychology and social psychology. MI assumes that people with problematic behaviors (for example, smoking, high-risk alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, lack of medication adherence, insufficient exercise) have different levels of readiness for behavior change.\n\nAccording to Janis and Mann's conflict-theory model of decision-making  (8) , the advantages of healthy behaviors (such as better health prognosis and improved fitness, among others) are always countered by disadvantages of behavior change (for example, loss of hedonistic reinforcers, significant effort, possible side effects of medication). The assumption in MI is that people with problematic behaviors are not fundamentally unmotivated to change their behavior, but are instead ambivalent, that is to say, their problem behavior conflicts at least to some extent with their self-concepts, values, or life goals, with those affected potentially having subjectively good reasons against a behavior change. If this ambivalence is not recognized, wellintentioned medical advice is perceived by patients as an assault on their freedom of choice, which, according to socio-psychological reactance theory  (9) , increases their motivation to restore their own subjective power to make decisions. This, in turn, often results in non-compliance either in the form of open disagreement or non-adherence to recommendations. A prerequisite of sustained encouragement of motivation to change is that patients become more aware of their behavioral discrepancies and actively confront their behavior. Therefore, MI is defined as \"a person-centered, goal-oriented style of communication with particular focus on expressions of change. The goal is to increase personal motivation for and commitment to behavior change by eliciting and intensifying a person's own reasons for change in an atmosphere of acceptance and empathy\"  (7) . In line with self-determination theory (SDT;  [10] ), the approach recognizes the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. As such, the atmosphere of acceptance and empathy represents a necessary condition for patients' self-disclosure in interviews relating to difficult or stigmatized subjects such as substance use, overeating, or health problems. The authors of MI have repeatedly emphasized that MI is not a technique, but a fundamental therapeutic style that does not seek to make people change their behavior against their will. Roger's person-centered therapy  (11)  forms an important basis of the approach, whereby MI is characterized by a goal-oriented approach and can essentially be combined with other therapeutic methods. The hallmark of MI is a differentiation into inner attitude (\"human image\"), methods and principles of implementation, as well as different processes of implementation (Box 1)."

A partnership-like, unpatronizing collaboration with the patient (\"communication on equal terms\"), in which the clinician does not assume the role of the expert (superior to the patient).\n\n2. A fundamental attitude of acceptance and empathy towards the patient's needs, experiences, and points of view. In addition to unconditional regard for the patient, this includes ensuring their autonomy of choice and decisionmaking in relation to behavior change as well as the desired goals and methods of change (patient autonomy).\n\n3. Compassion for the patient's life and experience, as characterized by the clinician not pursuing their own interests and giving highest priority to the patient's needs.\n\n4. Evoking motivation to change by exploring and reinforcing the patient's reasons for change. This also includes developing discrepancy between current problem behavior and the patient's goals and values (for example, \"You said that it's important to you to do more exercise again. How does that tie in with your smoking?\")."

At least 50% of reflections should be complex and go beyond simple repetition  (12) . Complex reflections refer either to non-explicit content that is inferred or to emotional elements (for example, patient: \"I do think my cough comes from smoking.\"; physician: \"And that worries you.\").

From a methodological perspective, this is achieved in a three-step process (elicit-provide-elicit) by first asking for consent (\"Would you like to know more about...\"), secondly, offering the information in a neutral way (for example, \"Scientific studies have shown...\"), and finally asking the patient for their view (for example, \"What do you think about...\").\n\nInformation that the patient does not want or that they perceive as threatening usually causes reactance.\n\nConflicts during an interviewing session typically occur when interventions are not suited to the patient's current motivation to change, for example, when a patient with high-risk alcohol consumption is given recommendations for action, whereas the patient is not yet clear about whether their alcohol consumption constitutes problematic behavior. This can manifest interpersonal dissonance (discord; for example, \"Are you trying to imply that I'm an alcoholic?\") or in a reversion to \"sustain talk\" (\"In my case, exercise wouldn't do any good anyway\"). In situations such as these, in addition to treating the patient with empathy, it is particularly important to emphasize their autonomy (\"Only you can decide whether you want to change something about that\") (Box 2, 3)."

      "text": "Since the approach was first developed, the number of MI-specific publications has increased exponentially, to the extent that there are now more than 1300 randomized trials and around 150 reviews on the effectiveness of MI in a variety of behaviors and target populations. The majority of studies address problematic substance use. By means of a systematic literature search limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases on the effectiveness of MI in medical care settings using the search terms (\"Motivational Interviewing\" AND [\"primary care\" OR \"medical care\"]), it was possible to identify a total of nine systematic reviews published since 2005, of which two were metaanalyses. Both meta-analyses found small to moderate effect sizes with regard to various health-related behaviors such as blood pressure, substance use, and medication adherence of d =0.18 (95% confidence interval [0.03; 0.33]; p =0.02) (  13    (14) . Effect sizes represent the improvement in the outcome criterion relative to controls; odds ratios > 1 indicate superiority of the MI group. The practical effect of the intervention is expressed by the binomial effect size display (BESD), in which the probability of success in the treatment group is subtracted from the probability of success in the control group. Values of >50% indicate a greater effect for the condition in question. Particularly marked treatment effects were found for a reduction in substance use, physical inactivity, body weight, and mortality, as well as for improved dental hygiene, acceptance of further treatment, and self-monitoring of health behavior (for example, with regard to blood glucose monitoring and nutrition). No significant effects were seen for eating disorders, self-care behaviors, or individual medical parameters such as heart rate. Effect sizes were greater when the intervention was delivered by the treating clinicians (versus medical/technical assistants). The average treatment effects were significant across all outcome measures, but were most pronounced for patient self-reports (OR = 1.69; [1.55; 1.84]), followed by third-party assessments (OR = 1.48; [1.24; 1.78]), and lowest for biological outcome parameters (OR = 1.18; [1.09; 1.28]) (14). According to Lundahl et al. (2013), effect sizes decrease over time, but five studies with follow-up surveys after more than 13 months nevertheless demonstrate significant effects compared with controls (OR = 1.14; 95% CI [1.03; 1.28]).

So what could you next step be?\" Patient: \"I think, to start with, I'll try not to drink any alcohol for the next two months. Maybe that will already make a difference to my liver values, like you said.\"\n\nClinician: \"That's a great idea! I suggest we make an appointment in six weeks and see how it went, and do another blood test at the same time.\" routine treatments and psychoeducational control conditions.\n\nReviews of the effects of MI on medication adherence across disorders not limited to medical care found positive, albeit small, effects with a pooled relative risk of 1.17 ([1.05; 1.31]; p < 0.001)  (15)  and a Cohen's d of 0.23 ([0.08; 0.37], p > 0.001), with the included studies being of heterogeneous quality  (16) .\n\nA systematic review of the overall effectiveness of MI across settings and based on 104 published reviews (of which 39 were meta-analyses) found good evidence for cessation or prevention of unhealthy behaviors, particularly with regard to problematic substance use (primarily alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco), whereas the evidence for health-promoting behaviors (except the promotion of physical activity) was more heterogeneous and, in terms of the methodological quality of the studies included, weaker  (17) . With regard to potential moderator variables, effects were found compared to control groups that had received either no treatment or unspecified routine treatment, but not compared to control conditions with other evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy  (17) . Although studies on the effectiveness of MI in substance-related disorders point to greater cost-effectiveness for MI compared to other evidence-based interventions  (18) , corresponding reviews on the cost-effectiveness of MI across disorders are lacking to date  (17) .\n\nOn the basis of the studies conducted to date, MI has proved to be an evidence-based, effective, and comparatively economical method of promoting behavior change in ambivalent patients, particularly in the case of problematic substance use. There are not yet enough studies of high methodological quality available for a variety of other medical fields of application, such as motivation to adopt health-promoting behavior, to be able to make detailed statements on the indication for and differential efficacy of MI."

The technical hypothesis, according to which the effectiveness of MI is achieved through basic skills such as open-ended questions, active listening, affirming, and summarizing in the form of selective reinforcement of patients' selfmotivational utterances, is the hypothesis that has been the most extensively studied to date and, comparatively, has received the most empirical support  (19) (20) (21) . The relational hypothesis, in contrast, assumes that relationship quality and therapeutic empathy are the most significant factors for the effectiveness of MI. This hypothesis has been investigated to a lesser extent and is deemed to be insufficiently substantiated, with one critical review pointing out that, in the majority of studies considered, the MI clinicians studied differed insufficiently in these characteristics to be able to demonstrate effects on effectiveness  (19) . The conflict resolution hypothesis states that the effect of MI can be attributed to a large extent to exploration and resolution of conflict, although here again, the empirical evidence is heterogeneous. In their review, Magill and Hallgren  (19)  conclude that the various factors should be regarded more as necessary than as sufficient conditions for the effect of MI, whereby further research needed."

Continuing education courses on the basic principles of MI, which usually last 2 days, are regularly offered by German Medical Councils and various private sponsors, and specialist literature on different fields of application is available in German  (7) . A number of German-speaking trainers are members of the international Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers ( www.motivationalinterviewing.org/trainer-listing )."

      "text": "A 47-year-old female patient that had been diagnosed in 2010 with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (ANA titer 1: 1280, anti-Scl-70+, anti-CCP-Ab+) presented due to immobilizing pain and significant circumferential enlargement of the left upper leg. Other symptoms of disease included pronounced sclerodactyly, Raynaud syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, and impaired esophageal motility. The patient had undergone numerous immunosuppressive treatments (including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and tocilizumab) in the past. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed calcinosis universalis with massive involvement of the left upper leg, axillae, and paravertebral region. Calcinosis universalis is a rare complication that has been described in patients with myositis, psoriasis, uremia, and systemic sclerosis. It is characterized by deposits of calcium phosphate crystals (hydroxyapatite) that can accumulate in the deep dermis, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscles. There are no treatment approaches as yet that have a long-term effect in reducing calcinosis in systemic sclerosis. An attempt at treatment with the Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib initially led to mild colliquation of calcinosis in the upper leg. However, this attempt needed to be discontinued due to recurrent episodes of pyrexia and infectious complications."
