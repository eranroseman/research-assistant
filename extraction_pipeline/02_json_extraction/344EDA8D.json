      "text": "In 2006, at the World Congress of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering in Seoul, Korea, Professor Barry Allen, incoming president of the International Organization for Medical Physics (IOMP), proposed at the General Meeting of the International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM) the formation of a task group named \"Health Technology and Training Task Group (HTTTG)\" for the purpose of bringing the expertise of medical physicists and biomedical engineers to address the health needs in developing countries. Prof Joachim Nagel, then president of the IFMBE, was supportive of a joint initiative, and noted that IFMBE already had arrangements with the World Health Organization (WHO) to this effect. The concept was adopted by the IUPESM, and the HTTTG was formed, with B. Allen as chair, and J. Nagel as co-chair  [1] .\n\nThe first task was to define the elements of the health system, in a way consistent with the WHO classification of health services in Primary, First referral, Second referral and Last referral levels  [2] . HTTTG planned to assist countries in defining their health technology needs and identifying and rectifying health system constraints for adequate management and utilization of health technology, particularly through training, capacity building and the development and application of appropriate technology.\n\nThe second task, consolidated after B. Allen visited several health services in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Region, was the formation of Actions Groups (AG) to address the technical aspects of what were considered essential subjects. Each AG was to elaborate specific requirements and explore commercial availability or propose a development project to satisfy equipment design criteria. Six AGs, listed below, were created with a nominated chair, who then selected the group members. By the end of 2007, the AGs were populated with a total of 50 international experts, who provided an expression of interest, a brief CV and a provisional action plan  [2] : 1. Telemedicine. 2. X-ray source and imaging. 3. Ultrasound source and imaging. 4. Basic blood chemistry analysis. 5. Palliative radiotherapy. 6. Pap smear testing."

      "title": "2. Evaluation visits",
      "text": "To formulate recommendations for action by the HTTTG, in May 2007 Barry Allen visited several health services in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Region, and in November 2007, in the Philippines' provinces of Pampango and Zimbales, and also in Mindora. He visited provincial and district hospitals, as well as urban and rural \"health stations\" (later to be called \"health centers\"), and where available, national and regional referral hospitals. He made recommendations for vertical integration of the health services and advocated for telemedicine, insisting that the capability and functions of the health stations needed to be increased, especially regarding the provision of basic diagnostic equipment, such as x-ray, ultrasound and blood analysis units. Details of these visits can be found in the IUPESM website  [2] .\n\nIn Vietnam he also saw that most cancer patients were treated for very advanced cancers, and thus, decided to set up a workshop in November 2008 on \"Palliative Radiotherapy in Developing Countries\" in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, the proceedings of which were published  [3, 4] . Although most of the workshop participants were from Southeast Asia, it was also attended by some AG Chairs. One of them was the AG Chair on X-Ray Imaging, Cari Borr\u00e1s, who, after lecturing in the workshop, did a comprehensive evaluation of some diagnostic radiology departments in the Mekong Delta, to follow up on B. Allen's visit the year before, but focusing exclusively on diagnostic imaging services. There are 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta Region; their geographical distribution is shown in Fig.  1 .\n\nThe evaluation, which followed the criteria established by the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization  [5] , included visits to three radiology departments in the Kien Giang Province of the Mekong Delta Region (see their location in Fig.  2 ), as well as to several district hospitals and health centers with diagnostic imaging equipment. Recommendations were made regarding needed equipment and staff, type of equipment and staff training, and image acquisition techniques. Because of the serious problems encountered with film processing, it was proposed that health centers desiring imaging equipment only acquire ultrasound units for obstetric work. (If the machine is portable, a welltrained nurse/technician can go with it to other health centers on a periodic basis, thus expanding the health services coverage). It was suggested that health stations do not offer x-ray services, but if they had to (for example to diagnose tuberculosis), the recommended equipment was the World Health Imaging System-Radiography unit, a basic x-ray system developed by WHO  [5] , that requires less operator training, is easier to maintain, and can be used with computed radiography (CR) phosphors instead of film/screens. The digitized images could then be sent to the district or provincial hospital for interpretation by a radiologist.\n\nWhen discussing the final report  [6]  with the health authorities in the Kien Giang Province, they expressed great disappointment. Based on B. Allen's visit, they were expecting that the HTTG would now provide funding resources to implement at least some of the recommendations made by the two experts, with which they fully concurred. C. Borr\u00e1s had to tell them that no money was currently available for such a purpose.\n\nDespite financial constraints, B. Allen performed two additional country evaluations, a comprehensive one in Vanuatu in 2008 and a review of the Philippines's Cebu Island Level 1 and Level 2 Hospitals in October 2009. The report \"Vanuatu Health: Review of Medical Equipment Needs 2008\", documented both diagnostic (including mammography) and therapy services at all the health care levels, from the National Referral Hospital in Vila Central Hospital, Efate, to health centers and even dispensaries  [7] . Such an extensive review was possible thanks to a grant from the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine (ACPSEM). In fact, one of the recommendations made by B. Allen was to suggest that the health authorities request aid from Australia, especially technical visits from engineers who could repair x-ray equipment."

      "title": "3. Administrative issues",
      "text": "In 2009, at the World Congress (WC) in Munich, Germany, the HTTTG scope and potential financial support were discussed at length. The reports prepared by Allen and Borr\u00e1s were reviewed and the IUPESM decided that the training component of the HTTTG was something that the constituting organizations, the IOMP and the IFMBE, were already doing, and so, the HTTTG became the Health Technology Task Group (HTTG) and has remained with that name till today. It was also suggested that country evaluations would be better addressed by WHO with its regional and national offices.\n\nAlso, during the WC 2009 -as originally planned-the Chairmanship of the HTTG rotated with J. Nagel becoming chair and C. Borr\u00e1s Co-chair. This pattern of having the chair and the co-chair coming from the IOMP or the IFMBE and rotating every three years in synchrony with the World Congress has been kept for the whole existence of the HTTG. Table  1  shows the list of Chairs and Cochairs appointed by the IUPESM over the years.\n\nIn 2011, HTTG specific terms of reference (TOR) were drawn and approved by the IUPESM at the WC 2012, in Beijing, China. These TOR were revised at the 2013 IUPESM Table 1 HTTG Chairs (2006-2022) Period Chair Co-Chair/Vice-Chair 2006-2009 Barry Allen, IOMP\n\nAC Meeting held during the International Conference on Medical Physics in Brighton, UK, in 2013. Among the changes, were that the position of co-chair was changed to that of vice-chair. An additional modification to the TOR was made in 2017 \"to invite and encourage the participation of the immediate past Chairperson in the HTTG functions during in the following 3 years after retirement of such Chairperson\". At the IUPESM Administrative Council meeting during the ICMP 2013, it was recognized that financial issues had been the main drawback for the proper development of the HTTTG. The expectation, expressed in an October 2006 HTTG report  [2] , that funds to cover the acquisition and deployment of equipment and for the implement of appropriate training programs matched to the required equipment, could be obtained from international sponsors, never materialized. Eventually, the IUPESM approved that the HTTG have a budget, with funds to come from the IOMP and the IFMBE directly."

      "text": "As is normal in all organizations, the activities carried out by their task groups have the imprint of the Chair. So, in the period 2009-2012, under J. Nagel as Chair, the HTTG worked very closely with WHO, specifically in the: publication of the First WHO Call for Innovative Technologies that address global health concerns, 2009, and announcement of the results, 2010; participation in the First Global Forum on Medical Devices, Bangkok, Thailand, 2010; soliciting papers for the IUPESM journal Health and Technology (H&T), of which J. Nagel was founding editor; cooperation with the WHO Patient Safety Program (previously the World Alliance for Patient Safety), and revision of the Health Technology Management (HTM) Impact Indicators worked out by J. Nagel with pilot projects in Namibia and Senegal  [8] .\n\nThe collaboration between the HTTG and H&T journal (a journal published by Springer and the IUPESM in cooperation with WHO), has continued till today. Figure  3 , taken during the ICMP 2013 in Brighton, UK, shows a photo of Lodewijk Bos, from Utrecht, the Netherlands, then H&T Editor-in-Chief, and C. Borr\u00e1s, then HTTG Chair, discussing common goals.\n\nThe collaboration between the HTTG and WHO has been strengthened over the years, mainly thanks to Adriana Velazquez Berumen, WHO's Team Leader on Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostics in Geneva, Switzerland. Figure  4 , taken at the WC 2015 in Toronto, Canada, shows a photo of Adriana Velazquez and Yadin David, then HTTG Chair, celebrating their cooperating efforts in biomedical and clinical engineering.\n\nFrom 2011 on, emphasis was placed on organizing workshops, courses, symposia, and tutorials, that were held in conjunction with either WCs or regional Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering events. In fact, as Table  2  shows, efforts were made to hold HTTG workshops during international conferences of the IOMP (ICMP) and the IFMBE (MBCE). The advantage of such activities, apart from the limited financing required, is that they could be attended by a large number of participants. The slides presented at these scientific/educational occasions were uploaded in the IUPESM website  [9] . Some of them are still relevant today. Some presentations resulted in scientific publications by the authors; these are also referenced in Table  2 .\n\nThe venues were also very useful in promoting networking among medical physicists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, biomedical engineers, and clinical engineers at the international level (see Figs.  5  and  6 ).

The most outstanding ones, with their principal investigator (PI) name and affiliation, are listed in Table  3 . As the projects evolved, the PIs presented progress and partial results at HHTG educational events  [9] . At these occasions, the HTTG set up meetings with technical experts in the researchers' subjects so that they could exchange ideas and continue the scientific interaction. The HTTG Chair also helped some  Fig. 6 Medical physicists and biomedical engineers fraternizing during the MBCE 2014 in Dubrovnik, Croatia.

      "title": "6. The publication: \"Defining the Medical Imaging Requirements for a Rural Health Center\"",
      "text": "The HTTG workshop on \"Defining the medical imaging requirements for a health station\", held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, at the ICMP 2011, was so well received and elicited so many questions from the participants that, rather than publishing the Workshop Proceedings, it was decided to write a book, under the aegis of the HTTG, expanding on the conclusions of the Workshop in a didactic manner and restricting the requirements to rural health centers within resource limited areas of developing countries. The effort proved to be very challenging, and the book was not published (by Springer) until 2017 (see book cover in Fig.  7 ).\n\nThe book establishes the criteria for the type of medical imaging services that should be made available to rural health centers; provides professional rural hospital managers with information that makes their work more effective and efficient; offers a valuable resource for those physicians, medical physicists, and service engineers who provide virtual and physical consultations, and it also offers insights into government, nongovernmental and religious organizations involved in the planning, establishment, and operation of medical facilities in rural areas.\n\nAs Barry Allen wrote in the Forward, \"this book differs from the usual approach, whereby most books on the subject start by explaining medical imaging modalities and then list what they are good for. Instead, this book starts by describing the health situations that present most often in a rural health center and then suggests how some imaging modalities, such as X-rays and ultrasound, can support the clinical diagnoses. With such limited resources, how can the center function well, what does the staff need to know, and who can be consulted? The role of telemedicine is expected to be of major importance in the integration of the rural service with the major hospital system, bringing specialist expertise to the smallest medical centers. These substantial challenges need careful planning if the centers are to achieve their objectives.\n\nThis book describes the crude reality of rural medical services in the emerging world. Even the clinical images shown in Chap. 2 come from medical facilities in remote areas. By sharing their experiences, the authors have imparted their knowledge and commitment to meeting the challenges facing rural medical centers. These challenges need to be addressed by thoughtful planning, careful equipment and imaging protocol selection, continuous staff training, and the implementation of quality control programs. This publication attempts to cover these issues; I commend it to the rural health centers of the world\"  [25] ."

      "text": "A lot of effort has been made in the development and operation of the HTTG; we acknowledge everyone's contribution, as we believe that the collaboration of medical physicists and engineers is essential to improve health care delivery  [26] . As the world and the IUPESM are slowly recovering from the pandemic, the 2022 World Congress in Singapore may serve as an ignition point to re-establish HTTG activities and even have a deeper involvement in Health Technology. In fact, at the 2022 WC there are special symposia organized jointly by medical physicists and biomedical engineers; will they become the seeds for renewed and proactive HTTG projects?\n\nFor a long time IUPESM was known mainly for the World Congress. Let's use the opportunity and change this. Barry Allen would be very pleased. Those who worked with him and loved him feel we should fulfill his vision. We owe it to him."

Depending on the applica- tion, the response time, estimated originally as 1 h, became as short as 5 min Dr. Hosea published manuscripts on the subject [21, 22]. He hopes that his proposal will be accepted by a joint task force of IFMBE's Clinical Engineering Division and the Global Clinical Engineering Alliance, within their program \"Centers of Excellence\" Prof. Rabbani is the Director of Dhaka University Telemedicine Program, run by BMPT and fully functional.
