  "title": "A patient-centered interactive voice response system for supporting self-management in kidney transplantation: design and field testing",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Self-management is the ability to control one's own responses to treatments, physical and psychological side effects, and lifestyle choices related to a chronic condition. Purpose: To describe the development of a standard and practical usercentered design process for an interactive voice response system (IVRS) to improve self-management in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. Methods: The IVRS was constructed utilizing the four phases of the Center for eHealth and Wellbeing Research (CeHRes) roadmap: the contextual inquiry, the value specification, the design phase, and evaluation. First, a literature review, background analysis, and needs assessment were used to identify the needs and problems and solutions related to self-management of KT recipients. Then, with the help of a team of experts and KT recipients, a logic model was created and evaluated. The IVRS was developed through iterative design development in response to these findings. Finally, fifteen end users (KT beneficiaries and health professionals) participated in a usability field test by completing a thinking -aloud test and a questionnaire based on the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: The review study indicates the necessary of self-management education and the potential outcomes and functionalities of information technology intervention. The situation analysis and needs assessment led to the final important requirements for the design of the intervention. All values were identified in three meetings with principal stakeholders, and a logic model was designed. The user test yielded an average SUS score of 81.2, and these results served as the basis for the usability requirements. Health Care Providers (HCPs) struggled with storing the profile of registered patients, setting up medication and personalizing adherence calls, and educational calls and follow-ups.",

      "text": "Kidney transplantation (KT) is the transfer of a healthy kidney from a matched donor into the body of another person with renal failure  (1) . It is the most promising choice for patients with endstage renal disease  (2) . After KT, patient's compliance to a comprehensive and continuous regimen of medical advice plays a crucial role in determining both short and long-term results  (3) . Prior studies have demonstrated that non-adherence to immunosuppressants is linked to a 60% higher risk of graft rejection among KT recipients  (4) . Several observational studies have reported elevated rates of non-adherence to lifestyle recommendations  (5, 6) . For instance, Kobus et al. revealed that 85.3% of patients did not alter their diet post-kidney transplant, while 64.2% were unaware of dietary guidelines  (7) .\n\nSelf-management is managing symptoms, treatments, psychological and physical complications, and lifestyle behaviours associated with a chronic disease  (8) . Currently, self-management is considered a significant aspect of successful health care. It significantly improves patients' health status and quality of life, however reduces the rate of hospital readmissions  (9) . Inadequate self-management may result in rejection of a graft  (9) .\n\nAutomated telephone intervention approaches may be necessary to overcome the various barriers to improving selfmanagement. Interactive voice response system (IVRS) allow users to engage with a series of structured voice-recorded messages and can provide responses to inquiries using their touch-tone phones  (10) . IVRS has many advantages over other digital health solutions  (11) . IVRS calls can be more time saving than other self-monitoring methods, which can be especially helpful for people with low literacy skills  (12, 13) . Listening to voice prompts and responding with simple numeric answers can be much less cognitively and numerically demanding than producing a detailed report of self-monitoring data  (14) . IVRS includes facilitating two-way real-time communication, such as soliciting inquiries and receiving responses, as well as personalized interventions. Given the relatively low per-contact cost of IVRS, regular health monitoring messages can be dispatched to maintain communication with patients. Furthermore, due to the ubiquitous nature of mobile phones carried by patients, instances of missed or unsuccessful calls are highly improbable. IVRS can also be used to provide timely feedback in response to self-monitoring data. A review of studies has found that IVR for self-monitoring leads to promote clinical outcome  (15) . This study has showed IVRS interventions lead to alternation health behaviours of patients, and enhance healthcare utilization, yielding positive impacts in various crucial domains such as immunization, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests  (15) . Another review study has shown IVR-based interventions exhibit promise in influencing specific health behaviours, notably medication adherence and engagement in physical activities  (16) . IVRS has been applied in many healthcare settings. Some studies have investigated the effectiveness of the IVRS in reducing cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome  (17)  and other studies have investigated effectiveness in physical activity  (13, 18) . This system has been effective in evaluation of adverse events after discharge of emergency department  (19) .\n\nDigital health products are acknowledged as necessary for the sustainability of healthcare systems, and the quality of software, particularly usability, plays a vital role in their success and acceptance  (20) . A fundamental strategy for the development of digital solutions is usability testing, a widely employed method to assess whether designated users can effectively and efficiently achieve the intended use  (21) . A digital product success in large scale depends on the presence of sufficient usability  (22) . Usability in digital health products can have a significant impact on patient care; enhanced usability can result in more efficient completion of tasks, reduced errors, and improved treatment outcomes  (20) . There are many studies focused on the usability of IVRS  (14, 18, 23) , but there are few studies on the usability of IVRS for self-management and in patient populations. This study attempts to fill this gap by reporting on our development method and evaluating IVRS usability. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an ordinary and practical user-centred design process for an interactive voice response (IVR) system to improve the self-management of KT recipients (especially for patient education and monitoring). We assume that all participants contributing to this usability testing study of the IVRS will provide valuable suggestions for further advancement."

      "text": "The IVRS was developed by using the Center for eHealth and Wellbeing Research (CeHRes) roadmap and User Centered Design (UCD) process. The CeHRes roadmap outlines a practical methodology to provide guidance to practitioners (such as designers, developers, and project managers) and researchers in the development and implementation of eHealth innovations. As shown in Figure  1 , CeHRes roadmap includes five distinct stages for investigating and assessing the appropriateness of an eHealth technology for the intended audience and for its effective implementation in real-world settings  (24) .\n\nThe CeHRes roadmap in this study includes four phases: (1) contextual inquiry phase (literature review and background & problem analysis) (2) value specification phase (needs analysis), (3) design phase (logic model and content), and (4) evaluation phase (usability and field testing) (Figure  2 ).\n\nThe UCD methodology allows for direct end-user involvement throughout the design process and supports the development of a tool that produces the best results  (25) . This technique involves rigorous usability testing of the initial release to find areas where feature and usability improvements are needed  (26) . This method is highly iterative in and of itself. Phases were repeated to evaluate intermediate designs, and to improve system as well as optimize the system or application  (27) .\n\nInvolving end users in the development and evaluation process helps researchers and developers design acceptable, practical, and validated tools that are appropriate for the end-user context. A user-based approach allows researchers to solicit feedback from patients and providers."

To develop self-management interventions with optimal usability and feasibility, a deep and early understanding of the perspectives of both patients and the medical community was considered essential  (29) . Therefore, a study involving focus group interviews with both KT recipients (n = 12) and HCPs (n = 8) was conducted to (1) determine their readiness to use IVRS for self-management and (2) explore needs and preferences regarding the content of the intervention (30)."

The expert panel consisted of nephrologists, patient education specialists, nurses, and medical informaticians. Third, the expert panel agreed on feasible intervention components, behavior change techniques (BCTs), appropriate users, and circumstances.

During this phase, the IVRS underwent usability tests in the field, wherein a high-fidelity prototype was employed within the actual context where the intervention would be implemented. These tests were conducted with KT recipients (n = 10) and HCPs (n = 5), using the thinking-aloud method  (34, 35) , as suggested by Nielsen  (27, 36) . Task completion, user problems, and satisfaction were the three quality factors examined in this study.\n\nParticipants were observed working with the IVRS, and two researchers asked them to think aloud to clarify their decision making and to express user difficulties and errors encountered  (37) . Two evaluators managed the testing sessions and executed a thorough analysis of the findings. The researchers employed the verbal protocol methodology to gather data. Despite the verbal protocol being the traditional method with restricted probing techniques in relation to more interactive user engagement approaches like communication-based and coaching methods, it proficiently replicates a true contextual experience by refraining from rendering any external support to the participants  (38, 39) . The participants were directed to think aloud (verbalization their thoughts) while engaging in problem-solving tasks, with an emphasis on the notion that the intent of these activities was not to assess their digital competencies but rather to evaluate the usability of IVRS. Additionally, field notes were meticulously recorded throughout the problem-solving endeavors to document any observed technical challenges, user-friendliness, and learning processes, as well as nonverbal behaviors pertinent to task management. The evaluator prompted the participants to maintain their verbalization when they ceased doing so. In instances where a participant struggled to resolve a task after multiple attempts, the evaluator offered a cue to ascertain whether and how the task could be resolved. The observational lists were argued by the researchers to achieve a consensus regarding task performance and the recognized issues and errors. Following task analysis, patients completed the validated 10-item System Usability Scale (SUS) to get a comprehensive picture of usability  (40) . Each item was assigned a 5-point Likert rating, and the scores were summed to obtain a total score (the range is 0-100; a score of at least 70 is considered appropriate)  (40, 41) . The IVRS possible to assess the relevant functions for HCPs. In order to evaluate the severity of each problem encountered, a score ranging from 0 (indicating no usability problem) to 4 (indicating a usability catastrophe) was assigned  (42) . Tasks were classified as successfully completed (1 point), partially completed (0.5 points), or not successfully completed (0 points)  (41) .\n\nThe KT recipients' tasks included the following.\n\n\u2022 3 Results"

Interventions should complement regular contact with HCPs and provide proper self-management support from HCPs. Both patients and HCPs expressed doubts about (real-time) monitoring of symptoms due to time constraints. In addition, interventions should be engaging, open, challenging, and safe. Finally, patients emphasized that IVRS use should be a choice and never forced. Based on these findings, requirements for intervention design were formulated.

In this context, we formulated a comprehensive, eHealth-supported educational care pathway for individuals who have undergone kidney transplantation, adhering to the CeHRes framework and employing a literature review alongside eHealth focus groups with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and a patient advisory panel. The objective of the care pathway is to empower KT recipients to effectively manage their condition by furnishing them with immediate feedback regarding their personal health behaviors, particularly in relation to medication adherence. This process ensures that the user, with his or her wants, needs, and requirements, is always at the center of the development process of the IVRS. The UCD approach to system development improves functionality, usability, and the likelihood of intervention effectiveness  (44) .

E-health platforms can provide tailored information about medication regimens, enhancing patient knowledge and confidence  (48) .\n\nIn the design process of an eHealth-based intervention, it is imperative to draw upon theoretical frameworks, evaluate the most contemporary evidence, assimilate contextual information pertaining to the setting in which the intervention or application will be implemented, and engage all principal stakeholdersparticularly patients  (49, 50) . In the present investigation, the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) was constructed upon a foundation of several behavioral change theories.\n\nFeedback increase the efficacy of e-health interventions by promoting user comprehension and engagement, which are essential components for informed decision-making, behavioral modification, and self-monitoring outcomes  (51, 52) . Behavioral interventions, which include counseling, reminders, selfmonitoring, and feedback regarding medication adherence, have demonstrated substantial advancements in medication compliance  (4, (53) (54) (55) (56) . A notable function that was considered involved the provision of feedback concerning the intake of immunosuppressive medications.\n\nPersonalization is necessary to ensure that the system is useful for users, and different characteristics such as country of origin, gender, age, or comfort with the technology should be taken into account. A person-centered approach in the development of new health technology systems is essential to ensure that applications can be better tailored to the needs of different ageing populations  (57) . Personalization is frequently cited as one of the important advantages of e-mental health applications and is also related to increased engagement  (58, 59) .\n\nMany studies have been applied CeHRes Roadmap to design and development digital health interventions  (48, 49, 58, (60) (61) (62) (63) . By incorporating the diverse groups of stakeholders at each relevant phase, we have ascertained that the intervention is tailored to meet the requirements of end-users and is viable for sustainable integration into clinical practice. This singular aspect distinguishes our eHealth tools from others, the overwhelming majority of which are conventionally conceived by software developers with minimal or no contributions from healthcare research teams (50). The technique could be compared to common linear development cycle models such as waterfall design so that design and potential usability problems could be identified early and corrected quickly, saving time and development costs. An iterative process of UCD was used to develop IVRS, which included personalized calls, feedback, and educational and tailoring calls. To our knowledge, there were no studies suggesting a UCD process for IVRS starting with need assessment."

      "title": "4.2. Usability evaluation",
      "text": "We chose a pluralistic walkthrough as a popular usability technique to have experts evaluate the preliminary design. This method provided a range of skills and perspectives to focus on usability difficulties. However, this method makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of a task with any degree of accuracy. We assessed the following version using Thinking Aloud testing, a flexible and trustworthy evaluation technique. As a result, we received prompt and excellent user feedback.\n\nThe KT recipients stated one usability issue. To fix this, we updated the section to have fewer subsections, and we assigned code to each subsection that was linked to the section.\n\nThe usability testing of a system is one of the most essential characteristics for the adoption of IVRS, and other digital health systems  (64) . We developed an interface design that takes into account patient, needs and considers standards for good interface design. This interface must be considered in light of healthcare requirements based on the analysis of self-management behavior.\n\nOut of the nine distinct usability challenges identified, two were uniformly encountered across all tasks: (1) the ambiguous functionality of the keys as indicated by their icons; and (3) the lack of assistance. In the ongoing investigation HCPs noted that the first and second obstacles were challenging and caused a significant consumption of their time. Our findings are consistent with those reported in prior research  (65, 66) . Consequently, it is imperative for designers and developers of health information systems to prioritize the enhancement of suboptimal navigation\n\nGanjali et al. 10.3389/fdgth.2024.1386012\n\ncontrols within these systems, as this concern is shared by both experts and users.\n\nIn the present evaluation of effectiveness, it was observed that the majority of HCPs successfully accomplished all three assigned tasks; however, two individuals encountered difficulties in completing tasks two and three. This inability may be attributed to the usability challenges we identified under the categories of \"suboptimal search functionalities\" and \"inadequate data presentation and information management.\" The issues related to \"suboptimal search functionalities\" and \"inadequate data presentation\" resulted in an extensive array of seizure conditions, thereby disorienting the participants. In a study aimed at investigating the usability of a physician-to-physician teleconsultation application within an orthopedic clinic, Choemprayong (2021) identified several usability concerns associated with mobile applications, including errors in data entry, challenges in presenting extensive datasets, and difficulties in item selection from lists  (67) . In his research, Chen emphasized the importance of effective navigation and search functionalities as critical determinants influencing users' evaluations of mobile health applications  (68) . Schwab (2018)  contended that user-friendly navigation serves as the cornerstone of an exemplary mobile application, as it facilitates productivity and enhances overall effectiveness  (69) .\n\nBased on the results of the usability test with end users (average SUS score of 81.2 and 88.8), we assume the IVRS is a user-friendly system. Currently, there are few research studies on user testing of IVRS: Thirumalai et al.  (18)  evaluated the usability of an IVRS aimed at increasing physical activity levels. This system received an average score of 81 (SD 5) on the SUS, they found challenges such as incentives for completing a call and incremental goal setting that were modifiable. Compared to this study, we encountered fewer usability issues and a similar score SUS. Korpershoek (41)  studied the usability and usefulness of mobile self-management apps for COPD patients and found SUS to have a score of 91."

      "title": "4.3. Limitations",
      "text": "A limitation of the study is that the IVRS was developed only for KT recipients and nurses responsible for patient education. Further development and usability testing for physicians remains to be done. One limitation of this study was that the usability sessions were not audio-or video-recorded, which would have allowed for deeper analysis of the loud comments. Operationalization is important phase of CeHRes roadmap, which unfortunately was not done in our study. It is suggested to use this section as the main section in studies. There are a number of obstacles such as IVRS software cost and lack of acceptance by a number of users or lack of motivation of users due to chronic disease. We overcame these obstacles by creating feedback along with a motivational message of the patient's behavior. On the other hand, there are facilitators such as the willingness of teaching nurses to use the IVRS for selfmanagement, which reduces their workload and has changed education from face-to-face to virtual. Physicians also considered IVRS as useful and helpful for patients."

      "title": "4.4. Recommendations",
      "text": "One of the notable strengths of this research lies in the systematic and comprehensive methodology employed in the development of IVRS aimed at supporting self-management, in alignment with the CeHRes roadmap and User-Centered Design (UCD), which actively involved key stakeholders across various forums, including focus groups, Delphi rounds, and surveys. This engagement is critical for obtaining profound insights into the specific requirements and potential obstacles related to the acceptance and utilization of technology. Furthermore, we utilized well-established theoretical frameworks, specifically Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs) and self-regulation theories, to guide the design and assessment of our IVRS, thereby enhancing both the reproducibility and efficacy of the intervention. For researchers and planners, this study can serve as a guide for developing IVRS interventions that meet end-user needs and preferences, have high potential for effectiveness, and can be used by the targeted community. In developing an IVRS, all phases are based on theory and evidence, and user needs and preferences are carefully considered. We have applied IVRS in a real-world setting and with real patients, which helps improve IVRS capabilities in an iterative process.\n\nFuture research should focus on evaluate the feasibility of IVRS interventions in daily practice in other chronic patients. The next step was to evaluate the impact of mobile Health (m-Health) interventions on meaningful patient outcomes and health care utilization. Recent studies of IVRS interventions in patients with KT recommend using Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with sufficient sample size and 1-year follow-up to conclude about behavior change and treatment effects  (41, 70) ."

The CeHRes roadmap employed to the development of an IVRS intervention tailored to the needs and preferences of the target populations, KT and HCP, with a high likelihood of improvement in medication adherence, knowledge and quality of life. An iterative process of UCD was used to develop IVRS, which included personalized calls, feedback, and educational and tailoring calls. Operationalization phase was not employed in our study. It is suggested to use this phase in studies. There are a number of obstacles such as IVRS software cost and lack of motivation of users due to chronic disease. We overcame these obstacles by creating feedback along with a motivational message of the patient's behaviour. This study rendered detailed reports about ehealth intervention development. For researchers and planners, this study can serve as a guide for developing IVRS interventions that meet end-user needs and preferences, have high potential for effectiveness, and can be used by the targeted community."
