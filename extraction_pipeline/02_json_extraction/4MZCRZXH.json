  "abstract": "Introduction: In this study we examined the co-occurrence of alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco among a large cohort of grade 12 students in Canada, and then explored if the age of initiation of these substances was associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), screen time, and BMI. Methods: This cross-sectional study used student-level data from grade 12 students in years 1 to 5 (2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016) of the COMPASS study. Random intercept linear regression models were used to examine the impact of age of initiation of alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use on student average daily physical activity, daily screen time and BMI. Results: Twenty-eight percent of students had only tried one substance with alcohol being the most reported single substance used (25%). The most common co-occurrence was students reporting having tried all three substances (27%). Nineteen percent of students reported no substance use by grade 12. Younger age of first use of alcohol was associated with increased MVPA in grade 12. Earlier initiation of cannabis and tobacco were associated with increased screen time in grade 12. Age of first use of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco were not associated with BMI in grade 12. Conclusion: While no specific cut-off age was identified this study indicates that for every year tobacco and cannabis use are delayed among children, there are subsequent reductions to screen time in grade 12. Early initiation of alcohol was associated with increased MVPA in grade 12. Early initiation of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco were not associated with BMI in grade 12.",

      "text": "High school is when many youths begin to experiment with tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis. According to the 2014-2015 Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drug Survey, 67% of Canadian youth in grade 12 reported drinking alcohol in the past year, 33% reported using cannabis in the past year and 9% reported being a current smoker (daily or occasional)  (Government of Canada, 2016) . In Canada, the average age of initiation is 13.5 for alcohol and tobacco and 14.2 for cannabis  (Government of Canada, 2016) . These substances are associated with acute and chronic health consequences and there is increased risk the earlier substance use is initiated  (Butt et al., 2011; Cobb-Clark et al., 2015; Mason and Spoth, 2012; Nelson et al., 2015; Patton et al., 2002; Richmond-Rakerd et al., 2017) . Furthermore, many youths are experimenting with multiple substances  (Leatherdale and Burkhalter, 2012) . Results from the 2008-2009 Youth Smoking Survey indicate that while 12% of students in grades 7-12 reported the use of only one substance, the same number reported concurrent substance use  (Leatherdale and Burkhalter, 2012) . This highlights the need to examine both age of first use and comorbid use when studying substance use among youth.\n\nAdditionally, research has linked substance use and obesity in youth  (Farhat et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2013) . There is evidence that adolescent alcohol use contributes to subsequent poor body composition in young adulthood  (Pasch et al., 2012) . Binge drinking is a particularly problematic pattern of use among youth  (Chung et al., 2018)  and youth who engage in binge drinking once per month are consuming as many as 13,200 additional Calories per year  (Battista and Leatherdale, 2017) . This suggests that reducing substance use rates among Canadian youth may contribute to a reduction in overweight and obesity. Currently 34% of Canadian adolescents aged 12 to 17 years are living with overweight or obesity  (Statistics Canada, 2015) . Adolescent obesity is associated with both metabolic risk factors in adolescence and an increased risk of obesity and other chronic diseases in adulthood  (Reilly et al., 2003) . Overweight youth tend to also be at higher risk for poor social and economic outcomes  (Reilly et al., 2003) .\n\nOther modifiable behaviours that are associated with substance use include moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen time  (Carson et al., 2011; Tabak et al., 2015) . In addition to body composition improvements, MVPA benefits youth's cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, motor skills, and academic outcomes  (Donnelly and Lambourne, 2011; Janssen and Leblanc, 2010) . In contrast, elevated screen time is associated with increased adiposity, metabolic syndrome, and anxiety and depression in adolescents  (Bai et al., 2016; Maras et al., 2015) . It is recommended that adolescents accumulate at least 60 min per day of MVPA and no more than 2 h per day of recreational screen time  (Tremblay et al., 2016) . Currently, Canadian adolescents aged 12-17 engage in an average of 46 min per day of MVPA and 3.8 h per day of screen time  (Roberts et al., 2017) .\n\nPrevention programming is typically targeted towards specific behaviours  (Michie et al., 2011) . However, research has shown that behaviours rarely occur in isolation and comprehensive programming may be a better approach  (Laxer et al., 2017; Michie et al., 2011) . As such, it is important to understand the relationships between different risk behaviours among youth. Therefore, this study had two objectives. First, we examined student use and co-use of alcohol, cannabis, and cigarettes among a large cohort of grade 12 students. Second, we then explored if the age of initiation of these substances was associated with MVPA, screen time, and BMI."

The study used activeinformation, passive-consent permission protocols, which is important for collecting unbiased data within studies examining youth substance use  (White et al., 2004) . Parents were sent study information via mailed letter or automated phone call, and could choose to withdraw their child from the study by contacting the COMPASS recruitment coordinator. All students within a participating school were invited to participate in the study and students could refuse to participate at any time. Participating students completed the COMPASS student questionnaire (Cq), which is a paper-based, self-administered, anonymous survey. The current study examined Cq data from 42,355 grade 12 students enrolled in 106 schools across years 1-5 of the COMPASS study. Response rates from years 1-5 of the COMPASS study were Y1: 79%, Y2: 79%, Y3: 79%, Y4: 80%, and Y5: 77%. Students with missing data on age of substance use information or control variables were excluded from the study, resulting in a final sample of 35,221 students. A comparison of students with complete versus missing data can be found in Appendix Tables  1  and  2 . Students with missing data on any of the outcome measures were excluded from the corresponding analyses."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study investigated student substance use among a sample of grade 12 students in years 1 through  5 (2012-2016)  of the COMPASS study. This was first investigated descriptively by examining the percentages of students who had tried alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, or some combination of those substances by grade 12. The association between the age at first use and MVPA, screen time, and BMI in grade 12 was then assessed. By the time COMPASS students were in their last year of high school, the vast majority had tried one or more substances. Consistent with previous research, among users, alcohol was the most common substance used, and it was hard to find a student who smoked tobacco or cannabis who had not also used alcohol  (Leatherdale and Burkhalter, 2012) . This is likely owing to the social acceptability of alcohol in the Canadian context, the perceived social benefits of alcohol, and the influence of high-user peers can have on other adolescents  (Kuntsche et al., 2005; Yarnell et al., 2013) . These results are consistent with previous literature that indicates multi-substance use is highly prevalent among Canadian youth and that prevention efforts should address this  (Leatherdale et al., 2008; Leatherdale and Ahmed, 2010) . It is also noteworthy that < 1 in 5 students reported no substance use by grade 12, clearly highlighting the ongoing need for more effective prevention efforts targeted to high school aged youth. This study identified a mean of 115 min of MVPA per day and 505 min per day of screen time. These estimates are much higher than what has been identified using objective measures in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (46 min of MVPA and 228 min of sedentary behaviour)  (Roberts et al., 2017) . Due to the large sample size of the COMPASS survey it was not feasible to obtain objective measures. Self-reported physical activity and screen time measures from the COMPASS study have been validated and shown to be consistent with other self-report surveys  (Leatherdale et al., 2014a (Leatherdale et al., , 2014b)) . The COMPASS survey is also not able to identify concurrent screen time and examined older students than the CHMS potentially leading to greater estimates  (Roberts et al., 2017) . The outcome variables were square root transformed in the analyses to account for the skewed nature of the data.\n\nConsistent with the literature that suggests modifiable risk behaviours co-occur (de la  Haye et al., 2014; Leatherdale, 2015) , age of first substance use was associated with both MVPA and screen time. Younger age of first use of alcohol was associated with increased MVPA in grade 12. It is hypothesized that this is due to the relationship between team sport participation and alcohol consumption: youth Fig.  2 . Plotted beta estimates from the regression models of age of first use of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco on average daily minutes of MVPA (square root transformed) of grade 12 students in Canada from years 1 to  5 (2012-2016)  of the COMPASS study. All models controlled for sex, ethnicity, weekly spending money, current substance use, and data collection year. The markers have been replaced with a dash (-) at ages that are not significant at p < 0.05. Fig.  3 . Plotted beta estimates from the regression models of age of first use of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco on average daily minutes of screen time (square root transformed) of grade 12 students in Canada from years 1 to  5 (2012-2016)  of the COMPASS study. All models controlled for sex, ethnicity, weekly spending money, current substance use, and data collection year. The markers have been replaced with a dash (-) at ages that are not significant at p < 0.05. participation in team sports has been associated with increased alcohol use both in adolescence and young adulthood  (Kwan et al., 2014; Lisha and Sussman, 2010) . However, this is an effect that may be modified by socioeconomic status, which was not controlled for in this study. There is evidence that lower socioeconomic status is associated with lower levels of physical activity and team sport participation in youth  (Pan et al., 2009) . No relationship between age of initiation of cannabis and tobacco was seen with MVPA. This is in line with research that suggests that team sport participation appears to be protective against cannabis and smoked tobacco products  (Lisha and Sussman, 2010) .\n\nInitiating cannabis and tobacco at a younger age was associated with more screen time in grade 12. These results are in line with other findings indicating that screen time clusters with other risk behaviours among youth  (Carson et al., 2011; Iannotti et al., 2009) . This is in contrast with other research that has examined the relationship between cannabis use and screen time and found null results  (Sampasa-Kanyinga et al., 2018; Zuckermann et al., 2019) . This is potentially because this literature has dichotomized screen time based on the recommended 2 h limit in the Canadian 24 Hour Movement Guidelines whereas we examined this variable continuously  (Tremblay et al., 2016) . Most Canadian youth are not meeting this guideline and there is a wide range of screen time among these youth  (Roberts et al., 2017) . No trend was seen between age of first use of alcohol and screen time. However, initiating alcohol use between ages 12 and 16 was associated with decreased screen time. This is contrary to research studying the opposite relationship which has found links between television and movie watching, media exposure, and alcohol use  (Jernigan et al., 2017) . It is thought this relationship may be due to youth consuming more alcohol engaging in MVPA and subsequently displacing screen time from their day.\n\nAge of first use of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco were not associated with BMI in grade 12 although tobacco ever users had a higher BMI on average than never users. This is consistent with the literature that links the use of tobacco products with increases in BMI  (Green et al., 2018) . Despite the fact that age of first use was found to be associated with MVPA and screen time it is not surprising that no consistent trend was seen with BMI. This survey does not collect sufficient information to consider energy intake which is a significant mediator of the relationship between screen time and BMI  (Cameron et al., 2016) ."

      "text": "The primary strength of this study was its large sample size. The inclusion of grade 12 students across the first 5 years of COMPASS data collections allowed for the inclusion of almost 40,000 students in the analyses. Due to the self-reported nature of survey data, these results may be subject to social desirability bias, likely leading to the underreporting of the risk factors studied. However, the use of self-reported measures in this study allowed for the collection of such a large sample. In addition, to encourage participation and honest reporting, a passive consent protocol was used and students were assured their answers would be kept confidential  (Thompson-Haile et al., 2013) . Despite the breadth of the COMPASS survey, this study lacked data on socioeconomic status and energy intake which may have helped to explain the relationships between age of initiation of substance use and the outcomes of interest. This study also had missing data for 17% of students. Previous work examining these students found that missing students were more likely to be substance users however no differences were found for the main outcomes of interest in this paper (physical activity, screen time, and BMI)  (Qian et al., 2015) . Students who answered \"I don't know\" were also more likely to be current drinkers, smokers and cannabis users, and have higher daily MVPA and screen time and BMI. This missing data may suggest a weakened association between age of initiation and the outcomes of interest. Additionally, this study used cross-sectional data and required participants to recall of the age at which they initiated substance use, which could be 10 years ago or more. Cross-sectional research by Golub and colleagues indicates that older students (age 18) were less likely to report alcohol initiation by age 10 than 12 year old students indicating some differential recall by age  (Golub et al., 2000) . All participants in this study were surveyed at approximately the same age so as long as any potential recall error was also independent of the outcome, recall bias should not be a significant limitation of these results. Additionally, as with any cross-sectional research, reverse causality cannot be ruled out. This study asks students about their MVPA, screen time habits, and BMI in grade 12 and it is unknown what the status of these variables would have been when students initiated substance use. Finally, these results are based on a convenience sample that is not nationally representative, therefore these results may not be representative of all Canadian youth.\n\n-1.00 -0.50 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Beta estimate Age of first use Alcohol Cannabis Tobacco Fig. 4.

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "There are many benefits to delaying substance use among youth. Early substance use is associated with physical and mental health problems, educational underachievement, and subsequent problematic substance use in adulthood. The results of this study indicate that sedentary behaviour prevention efforts may also benefit from delaying early substance use among youth. While no specific cut-off age was identified it appears that for every year tobacco and cannabis use are delayed, there are subsequent benefits to screen time in grade 12. There were no consistent associations between age of initiation and BMI and early initiation of alcohol was associated with increased MVPA."
