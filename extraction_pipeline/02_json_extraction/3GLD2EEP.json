  "abstract": "Behavior-change lifestyle interventions are fundamental in children and adolescent obesity management. This scoping review discusses optimal behavior-change lifestyle interventions in the treatment of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. A literature search on diet, physical activity, and behavioral intervention for obesity treatment in children and adolescents aged 0-19 years was conducted in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from June 2016 to November 2022 were retrieved to identify recent advancements. Obesity outcomes included body weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, and fat percentage, among others. The 28 located reviews included: four studies on diet therapy; five on physical activity (exercise training); one on sedentary activities; 18 on multicomponent behavior-change lifestyle interventions, including three that incorporated gaming; three with eHealth, mobile health (mHealth), or telehealth, with one in each category; and two on motivational interviewing. Behavior-change lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity in children and adolescents were associated with moderate effects, with low-quality evidence for diet therapy and high-quality evidence for exercise training, both for weight or BMI reduction. Long-term intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions with parental involvement demonstrated better effects.",

The effect on weight measures persisted in trials with 18-to 24-month follow-ups for both BMI (-1.49 kg/m 2 ) and BMI z-score (-0.34 units).  7 milar impacts were reported in some non-Cochrane reviews in children 2-5 years of age (BMI: -0.17 kg/m 2 ),  32  in children and adolescents under 19 years of age (BMI and BMI z-score: -0.255, 18 trials),  23  in children and adolescents 6-12 years old (BMI z-score:\n\n-0.09 units, four trials), in adolescents (BMI and BMI z-score: -0.54 Hedges' g),  38  and in children and adolescents of different socioeconomic backgrounds (BMI z-score: -0.16 to -0.08 units), respectively.  39 sistance training physical activity combined with calorie restriction in children and adolescents <18 years old (23 trials) reduced the body fat percentage (-2.1%) and whole-body fat mass (-1.9 kg, goodquality evidence), although body weight and BMI were not significantly reduced.  29 Besides obesity reduction, behavior-change lifestyle interventions were effective in weight maintenance for 6-12 months in children and adolescents (BMI z-score: 2.22-2.00 units, 11 trials).  34 ttings Some systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported on eligible community and school interventions for obesity treatment in children and adolescents. Community group interventions (20 trials) were delivered in various settings, including home, outpatient clinics, and community health services, with various intervention delivery methods including face-to-face, online, phone, mobile applications, and mixed methods. These interventions were associated with a reduction in BMI z-score by 2%-9% from 6 weeks to 24 months. BMI z-score decreased significantly (i.e., \u226510%) when including a psychological component (four trials). The involvement of digital technologies, such as online interventions in addition to face-to-face sessions did not add better effects.  35 hool nutrition interventions in various populations from Asia  36, 37  were effective in BMI reduction (-0.94 kg/m 236 and -2.03 kg/m 237 ) although effects differed by the intervention duration, sample characteristics, sample size, and engagement of parents.

However, parents continue to influence the dietary intake of adolescents as well as other behaviors by role modeling and through the home environment.  40 Recognizing the impact of foods and behaviors in changing relationship dynamics is an important consideration in the obesity management of adolescents.  10  the Cochrane reviews (44 trials, 4781 participants),  7     7  Most trials used multidisciplinary intervention approaches with a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral components. Optimal parental involvement was often integrated as age increased. It is important to highlight that obesity management for adolescents improved self-esteem and body image in short and medium terms, with the improvement in self-esteem independent of weight-related outcomes.  7 Motivational interviewing was often incorporated to initiate weight management interventions for adolescents and parental involvement.  30, 31 though various intermittent fasting approaches may play a role in adolescent obesity control, there is insufficient evidence of benefit beyond adjunctive caloric reduction or energy-balance activity intervention. Exercise training was moderately effective in reducing obesity and increasing lean body weight in adolescents. Although little research into novel lifestyle approaches for adolescents has been conducted, the concepts of focusing on health-promoting behaviors at all stages of the weight management process, rather than a weight-centric approach, are consistent with clinical guidelines.  41"

However, gender, age, duration of intervention, intervention type (behaviors targeted), intensities, intervention delivery, and comparators may influence the effect size.  46 Few studies reported gender differences in effect size. Behavior-change lifestyle interventions produced a greater effect size in 0-6-year-olds than in 6-11-year-olds and 12-17-yearolds, with the least effect observed in 6-11-year-olds.  [5] [6] 6] [7]  This suggests that childhood and adolescent obesity should be identified as early ing challenges and developing effective solutions).  47 More than half of studies included in the Cochrane reviews on diet, physical activity, and behavioral treatment of childhood and adolescent obesity used behavioral therapy components with different levels of intensity that incorporated single or multiple BCTs.  45 Some selected reviews demonstrated that integrated psychological components improved the effects of community interventions.  35 Regarding values and preferences, the least valued component by patients is the burden of behavior-change strategies (stimulus control and self-monitoring).  45 Simpler guidance such as the traffic light food reminder is preferred.  48 garding the active components of successful BCTs for obesity management, a systematic review assessed BCTs from the 41 CALO-RE taxonomy-a refined taxonomy of BCTs to help people change their physical activity and healthy eating behaviors-used during behaviorchange obesity treatment RCTs in children and adolescents.

Motivational interviewing is an evidencebased counseling approach described as four processes: engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning. Motivational interviewing was used explicitly in clinics as a treatment intervention to strengthen adolescents' commitment to choosing healthy lifestyles and managing their weight.  30, 47 In clinics, motivational interviewing was also used at the parental decision-making level to influence the lifestyle behaviors of young children under 10 years of age; however, more information is needed regarding the effects.  53 With complete participation and high implementation fidelity, motivational interviewing-based interventions could produce small to medium effect sizes (SMD: -0.18 to -0.63) across a range of anthropometric outcomes in adolescents (BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percentage). Greater effects were reported in adolescent girls and adolescents with complete participation (\u226511 years old; g = 0.22).  31 Additional investigation is needed to better sustain long-term behavioral changes in children and adolescents.  31, 54 gital technology Digital tools and technologies including games, eHealth, mHealth, and telehealth are increasingly used in behavior change and weight management. Some of the technologies have shown effects on obesity outcomes and on quality of life. However, the effects were small, and the quality of the evidence was low or very low (authors' report). Further, well-designed studies are needed before conclusions on the effect of digital technology on obesity management in children and adolescents can be made. 24, [26] [27] [28]   were poorly or inconsistently reported. 45  The authors concluded that there is low-certainty evidence that lifestyle and behavioral interventions are effective for obesity management among children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. Safety data remain lacking across all intervention modalities. 42  Our findings are reflected in recommendations of various expert panels and current guidance in Australia,  51  the People's Republic of China,  56  the Republic of India,  57  the United States,  4  and some European countries,  58  among others."

This restriction may limit the uptake of interventions that may be useful for obesity management, but that cannot be assessed using a RCT study design (eligible for inclusion in the included systematic reviews). Interventions targeting behavior-change per se (e.g., diet/energy intakes, healthy eating, and lifestyle promotion trials) were also left out. In addition, because of time constraints, data were extracted by a single reviewer, which may have resulted in some bias in data collection.\n\nThe low-to-moderate effect of behavior-change lifestyle interventions reported in the reviews was mainly related to body weight, BMI, and BMI z-score outcomes. The adequacy of BMI-related indices in the evaluation of obesity reduction in children and adolescents should be exercised with caution because of their low discrimination of body fat change.  59 Nonetheless, a small change in these outcomes at the population level may have great significance in public health. In addition, obesity treatment in children and adolescents should focus more on health quality and overall well-being of the child or adolescent instead of being confined to anthropometric measures. This review excluded cardiometabolic changes as a main outcome, however, the significance of reducing cardiometabolic risk, which is often experienced by children and adolescents with obesity, cannot be omitted from obesity treatment."

Aerobic plus resistance exercise in children and adolescents 6-18 years of age with longer term programs (>24 weeks) of 2-3 days (most 3 days) per week, with sessions lasting 20-60 min/day, were reported to work better.

Obesity treatment and weight maintenance interventions lasting 12 months or more resulted in a slightly bigger effect size.

Combined diet and physical activity interventions resulted in a higher effect size than any single component, but with overlapping confidence intervals among the intervention types. 46 Comprehensive, intensive interventions with a combination of diet and physical activity and behavior therapy showed improvement in BMI z-score (-0.46 units), which is assumed to be effective in reducing cardiometabolic risks in children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. 46 Behavior-change components Behavior-change strategies providing techniques to modify diet and physical activity patterns are key components in behavior-change lifestyle interventions.

However, relatively little is known about the efficacy of specific characteristics of these multicomponent interventions or their efficacy for different subgroups of children and adolescents. 5-8 Given the importance of social support in familyinvolved interventions, a mixed method evidence synthesis conducted in high-income countries identified the critical features of successful weight management lifestyle interventions for children and adolescents 0-11 years old. The systematic review used qualitative comparative analysis to identify critical pathways to effectiveness conducted in Australia, New Zealand, North America, and Western Europe. The findings suggested that three important mechanisms are among the critical features of successful weight management lifestyle interventions for children and adolescents 0-11 years old with overweight: (1) providing families with physical activity sessions, practical behavior-change strategy sessions, and calorie intake advice; (2) ensuring all family members are on board via delivering discussion/education sessions for children and adolescents and parents, delivering age-appropriate sessions, and aiming to change behavior across the whole family; and"

      "text": "Behavior-change lifestyle interventions combining diet, physical activity intervention, and behavior-change strategies may be useful for obesity treatment in children and adolescents. The quality of evidence is very low to low, and the effects are small to modest (the authors' report). Long-term intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions of 26 h or more total contact with sufficient parental involvement demonstrated better effects. Digital technologies were evaluated in some selected systematic reviews but the effects on childhood and adolescent obesity treatment are unclear. More well-designed studies are needed on behavioral-change lifestyle interventions for childhood and adolescent obesity treatment. In addition, some authors have drawn attention to the heterogeneity of the included studies in their systematic reviews and to the low quality of many primary studies, thus the translation of the evidence to policy should be cautious. Side effects are infrequently reported across all intervention modalities. Monitored (called follow-up) interventions between 2 weeks and 3 years did not show negative effects on linear growth, behavior dis-orders, or well-being. However, there is a need for further studies assessing the safety of these interventions. Insufficient energy intake during nutritional interventions may cause an unbalanced diet and lead to related adverse effects. Long-term physical development (linear growth), behavior disorders, quality of life, and the overall well-being of children and adolescents should be prioritized throughout behavioral lifestyle interventions. Importance We identified reviews covering a wide variety of behavior-change lifestyle interventions, including different components administered across multiple settings (e.g., school, family, community, and clinics). The observed moderate effects may have been influenced by study characteristics, implementation factors, and the social, economic, and cultural factors in the settings where it was conducted. Interventions should meet individual needs while considering contextual obesogenic factors. For children and adolescents, especially the latter, developmental characteristics may be the main determinants of efficacy and safety. Safety data in behavior-change lifestyle interventions in childhood and adolescent obesity treatment were infrequently reported in the reviews. Core safety data monitoring should be prioritized in the future, particularly potential adverse effects on linear growth, behavior disorders, body image, psychological well-being, and family interactions. Structured monitoring systems and reporting templates should be further developed and implemented. The findings of this overview of reviews are consistent with recent practice guidelines and similar reviews on obesity management for children and adolescents. Multidisciplinary lifestyle interventions that address diet, physical activity, and sedentary and sleep were widely recommended as the basis of all obesity treatment approaches in the world. 4,55 Ells et al. conducted an overview of the Cochrane systematic reviews on the effectiveness and risks of obesity treatment in children and adolescents. Authors reported that multicomponent behavior-change lifestyle interventions may be beneficial in achieving small, short-term reductions in BMI, BMI z-score, and weight in children and adolescents 6-11 years old.

Behavior-change treatments should be of high frequency (via fre-quent contact), of longer duration (26 h or more total contact), and incorporate psychological components and age-appropriate parental involvement. Motivational interviewing and some BCTs are promising components of behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents, but their mechanisms of action need further study. Multitier social and environmental support systems are important for successful behavior-change interventions."
