  "title": "Text message questionnaires for Patient-Reported Outcome Measures after Cesarean section-A feasibility study",
  "abstract": "Background: Inadequate pain relief with moderate to severe pain remains a challenge after cesarean section and may significantly impair postoperative recovery. However, detailed assessment on the timing of severe pain, opioid consumption, influence on activities such as mobilization, breastfeeding, and caring for the infant are difficult to conduct, especially after discharge. Short message services (SMS)-based questionnaires may offer a low-cost way of providing such data but with the risk of insufficient response rates. We assessed the feasibility of collecting detailed, prospective data on postoperative pain and recovery during the initial hours and days following cesarean section using SMS-based questionnaires. Methods: Prospective Danish single-center cohort study involving elective cesarean sections under spinal anesthesia with fentanyl and bupivacaine. The postoperative pain regimen consisted of paracetamol, NSAID and oral morphine by request. Patients received an SMS-based questionnaire at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h postoperatively, as well as on days 7 and 30. Primary outcome: Response rate and time from receiving the SMS to completion of the questionnaires. Secondary outcomes: Opioid consumption and Patient Reported Outcomes Measures on pain and recovery. Results: From December 2022 to June 2023; 100 patients were included. The response rate was 78% at 6 h postoperatively, decreasing to 63% at 24 h. The median response time from receiving to answering the SMS-based questionnaire at 6 h after cesarean section was 23 min (IQR 2-72), decreasing to 20 min (IQR 2-78) after 24 h. Severe pain, corresponding to a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score >6, was reported by 57% (95% CI 65-84) at 6 h, decreasing to 28% (95% CI 34-58) at 24 h. Median opioid consumption within the first 24 h was 30 mg (IQR 20-50). Conclusion: SMS-based questionnaires on Patient Reported Outcome Measures are a feasible and cost-effective way of prospectively collecting frequent data with acceptable response rates, even shortly after cesarean section. Secondarily 66% of patients reported severe pain during the first 24 h following cesarean section, with the highest pain scores within the initial 12 h. Future studies should focus on optimizing pain-management within this timeframe.",

      "text": "This study addressed the reliability of collecting serial patient-centered outcomes from postoperative patients using their own hand-held devices (telephones). In a single center cohort of elective cesarean delivery cases, how consistently study participants responded to telephone text-message prompts for pain and analgesia outcomes at multiple intervals during the first 24 h was good. This data collection method was useful to detect pain episodes that require better treatment."

      "title": "1. | INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Cesarean section (CS) is a common procedure with approximately 13,000 annual cases in Denmark.  1  Pain after CS is generally of a moderate to severe degree and inadequate pain relief may significantly impair postoperative recovery and the ability to take care of the newborn.  2  A recent Danish multicenter survey used an 11-item obstetric quality of recovery score (Obs-QoR-11)  3  on 861 CSpatients and found that 45% had experienced severe pain in the initial 24-48 h following their CS (unpublished observations, Lindelof et al. 2022). These findings are in line with similar research that utilized the Obs-QoR-10 score.  4 Another recent Danish randomized placebo-controlled trial on elective CS patients,  5  investigated the effect of transmuscular quadratus lumborum blockade on morphine consumption and found an average use of 94 mg oral morphine equivalents (OME) in the control group, indicating a considerable amount of postoperative pain. Despite such indications of severe pain in the initial postoperative period after CS, there is a lack of sufficiently detailed prospective data on pain-intensity, timing and its effects on recovery and the ability to care for the newborn during that period.\n\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROM) have gained increasing interest as a means of evaluating health outcomes from a patient perspective and can be used prospectively to track real-time outcomes following surgery.  6 PROMs are commonly applied using structured questionnaires enabling patients to report their self-conceived health status.  7, 8 wever, collecting PROMs at numerous timepoints in the immediate postoperative period can be both expensive and time consuming. Consequently, there is an increasing trend toward using electronic-PROMs through network-and short message services (SMS).  6 This method could provide an effective low-cost way of collecting data prospectively both in-hospital and after discharge. However, whether this is feasible in patients who have just had a CS and also need to focus on their newborn child has, to our knowledge, not been investigated previously.\n\nThe primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility of obtaining detailed prospective collected data on postoperative pain and recovery within the first hours and days following CS using SMS-based questionnaires. Secondarily, to do a detailed assessment focusing on timing of severe pain, opioid consumption, and influence on activities (e.g., mobilization, breastfeeding, nursing the infant, etc.) following elective CS."

The questionnaires were developed with inspiration from international consensus regarding obstetric recovery,  2, 3, 9  and the use of a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0-10 for pain assessment, with an NRS >6 as cut-off for severe pain.  10, 11 As part of the process of developing the questionnaires, we consulted patients, maternity staff, anesthetists, and obstetricians to determine key areas of focus during the first postoperative days after a cesarean section they find important. Then the questions were developed and tested by using standardized methods for designing and conducting surveys.  12, 13 The questionnaires were initially tested on professionals and subsequently on 10 CS-patients. Afterward, adjustments were made, and the questionnaires were re-tested on 5 CS-patients, with no further need for adjustments.\n\nSubsequently, the questionnaires were programmed in the web-based database REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)  14  and designed to present well on a smartphone screen. Finally, the questionnaires were set-up to be sent out as an SMS via an external server (Sure-SMS, Denmark) with links to the questionnaires in REDCap. The questionnaires sent at the various time points consisted of 14-19 short questions that could be answered on the phone in less than 3 min (Supplemental Content X). After 24 h the questionnaire also included the 10-item obstetric recovery score: Obs-QoR-10.  15"

      "title": "3. | RESULTS",
      "text": "From December 2022 to June 2023, 100 patients were included. No patients who were approached for inclusion in the study declined to participate. A total of 86% (CI 0.8-0.9) of the included patients responded to minimum one of the questionnaires that were sent within 24 h, and 14% (CI 0.1-0.2) did not respond to any of the questionnaires. The response rate for questionnaires sent at 6, 12, 18, 24, 48 h as well as 7 and 30 days after CS ranged from 63% to 78% during the initial 24 h, this response rate remained within the same range after 48 h and 7 days, only declining to 57% after 30 days (Figure  2 ).\n\nThe median response time from receiving an SMS-based questionnaire to submitting answers was shortest for the questionnaire after 24 h; 20 min (IQR 2-78 min) and longest at 18 h after CS; 68 min (IQR 26-153 min) (Table 1). Severe pain, defined as NRS >6, was reported by 57% (CI 65-84) at 6 h following CS, decreasing to 28% (CI 34-58) at 24 h and 3% (CI 2-13) after 48 h. Severe pain at any time during the first 24 h after CS was experienced by 66% (CI 56-75) (Table 1). Self-reported pain specifically during mobilization from lying to sitting position was highest in the first 6 and 12 h with median NRS 7 (IQR 5-8), declining to median NRS 5 (IQR 4-7) at 24 h and NRS 0 (IQR 0-1) after 30 days.

Two patients reported opioid use after 7 days; one of these the first 6 h and remained median 0 (IQR 0-0) thereafter. For pruritus the median score was NRS 3.5 (IQR 0-6.25) at 6 h, then the score declined to NRS 0 (IQR 0-0) for the rest of the questionnaires.\n\nAll 14 non-responders were contacted in order to explore their reasons for not completing any of the questionnaires, five of them replied. The main causes for not replying included factors such as breastfeeding, low energy, worrying for the newborn, feeling busy focusing on other things, and/or attending to other children. One patient mentioned pain as a reason for not having the energy to answer. Two patients wrote that pain improved quickly, and they therefore perceived the questionnaires as less relevant for them."

      "title": "4. | DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this study we found that SMS-based questionnaires sent at fixed time intervals shortly after elective CS had an overall participation rate of 86%, and a response rate of 63%-78% at the four questionnaires within the first 24 h regarding self-reported pain and recovery scores.\n\nFurthermore, 66% of patients experienced severe pain during the first 24 h with the highest reported pain scores within the initial 12 h.\n\nEven though the pain scores were high, the patients reported that it did not affect breastfeeding, but it did affect mobilization. The total opioid consumption in the first 24 h was a median of 30 mg OME and no patients were still taking opioids after 30 days. No patients were bothered by dizziness or nausea.\n\nThe threshold for acceptable response rates in questionnaires remains controversial, as there is no agreed standard for an acceptable minimum. However, it is generally accepted that a response rate below 60% is suboptimal, a response rate of 75% and above is good F I G U R E 2 Response rate to questionnaires at specific timepoints.\n\nT A B L E 1 Patient characteristics and outcomes.\n\nPatient characteristics (n = 100) Age (year), mean (SD) 33.6 (5) BMI, mean (SD) 26.3 (5.6) Prior cesarean section, n (%) 59 (59%) Primary outcomes Time after surgery 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h 48 h 7 days 30 days Response rate per questionnaire, % (95% CI) 78 (69-85) 71 (61-79) 68 (58-76) 63 (53-72) 66 (56-75) 64 (54-72) 57 (47-67) Response time (min) from receiving each SMSquestionnaire to answering, median (IQR) 23 (2-72) 44 (9-262) 68 (26-153) 20 (2-78) 26 (7-150) 25 (2-108) 33 (6-201) Secondary outcomes Severe pain (NRS >6) at any time during the last 6 h, % (95% CI) 57 (65-84) 52 (62-82) 41 (48-71) 28 (34-58) 3 Severe pain (NRS >6) at any time during the past 24 h, % (95% CI) 66 (56-75)\n\nOpioid consumption (mg) per 24 h, median (IQR) 30 (20-50)   Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index, kg/m 2 ; CI, confidence interval; IQR, interquartile range; NRS, numeric rating scale; SD, standard deviation. and a response rate between 60% and 75% is adequate for collecting representative data.  16 study with a methodology similar to ours involved 530 cesarean section patients who answered six survey questions daily and sent their responses via SMS. Study personnel manually entered the responses and contacted non-responders daily via SMS and phone calls. They reported an overall participation rate of 82%.  17 Our response rate of 57%-78% at specific time points during the first month is lower. This is likely because we did not contact the nonresponders but could also be due to our number of questions appearing less manageable (19 vs. 6). Another study of 114 participants with insertion of an intrauterine device after delivery, received an SMS at week 0, 5, 12 and 24 postpartum and their response rate was 71%-79%.  18 Our method differs, as we employed frequent intervals with four questionnaires within the first 24 h. This approach may be more relevant when evaluating whether studies on postoperative pain should focus on the time in the PACU, the maternity ward or after discharge.\n\nOther studies have collected PROMs in the obstetric population by other methods and have generally reported lower response rates than our study. A study of post-cesarean section surgical site infection on 105 patients, used a mobile app to collect PROMs on postpartum days 3, 7, 10 and 30 with a response rate of 45%.  19 An Irish study of birth experience after CS sent questionnaires by postal mail and reported a response rate of 55%.  20 Postal invitations were also sent to 4904 Norwegian women to answer an online survey on experiences with pregnancy, birth, and postnatal care with a response rate of 56%.  21 r study support that questionnaires delivered via SMS may provide a higher response rate than postal invitations, and potentially at a lower cost. Thus, SMS provides a unique mean of gathering questionnaire data in post-cesarean patients and considering the widespread use of smartphones, accessing an SMS link to answer questionnaires may be preferable, as it requires minimal effort and can be done at the patient's convenience. In addition to the method of data collection, approaching patients in person during enrollment increases the response rate.  22 We included our patients by personal approach in the PACU and our response rate is higher than similar studies on PROM where patients have not been approached in person when enrolled in the study. For example, in a large Australian study of PROMs in a mixed elective surgery population (n = 2700) with SMS surveys 1-and 4-weeks post-surgery. They reported a response rate of 37.3% and 21.9%.  23 Another explanation for the difference in the response rate might be that individuals are more inclined to reflect on their experience following cesarean section, an emotional and unique event, compared to general surgery, which they may be more likely to forget once fully recovered.\n\nRegarding our secondary outcome of severe postoperative pain, 66% of the patients in the study reported severe pain during the first 24 h. This supports the results of the survey by Lindelof et al., where 45% of 861 patients retrospectively reported severe pain in the initial 24-48 h post CS (unpublished observations, Lindelof et al. 2022). In this context, it is noteworthy that the current practice of multimodal pain medicine at the majority of Danish hospitals, including our institution, does not involve routine use of intrathecal morphine or abdominal nerve blocks, which are otherwise recommended by international consensus guidelines for pain management in CS patients.  2, 24 r patients received a median of 30 mg of OME in the first 24-h post-surgery. However, oral morphine was given per request, and pain after CS has a risk of being undertreated due to fears that analgesic drugs might induce maternal and neonatal side-effects, 2 hence there is a risk of less dispensed morphine than the patients might have needed. Our patients reported severe pain but at the same time received relatively low amounts of morphine in the first postoperative days. Especially when comparing with the Danish study by Hansen et al., where the CS patients in the control group used a mean dose of 94 mg OME/24 h through patient-controlled analgesia.  5 Thus, morphine consumption may be a poor surrogate outcome measure for F I G U R E 3 Self-reported pain at movement and at rest.\n\npain after a CS especially when not administered by a patientcontrolled method.\n\nA limitation of our study is that we did not follow-up by SMSreminders, phone calls or personal contact. However, our primary outcome of the study was to assess the response rate on a questionnaire delivered by an SMS without additional need for study personnel or reminders.\n\nReminders were not sent due to the brief interval between each questionnaire, and in order not to disturb the participants excessively.\n\nThus, if we had sent out reminders our response rate could potentially have increased.  22 In the end, the highest response rate is achieved when a questionnaire is completed in person with the patient by an investigator. The recent study by O'Carroll et al.  4  is a good example of this, with an almost 100% response rate when accessing 1638 patients face-to-face 1 day after CS or vaginal birth with the Obs-QoR-10 score. Though, there was a declining response rate to 80%\n\nwhen following up with a telephone interview 30 days later. However, studies with a face-to-face investigator requires substantial resources, making it challenging to maintain frequent contact in large numbers of patients and may not be feasible after discharge. Another limitation of our study is the risk of response bias.  25 To address this, we reached out to all of the 14 non-responders. They primarily reported that prioritizing time and energy to care for the newborn and attending to their other children was the limiting factor for responding, and it was not primarily related to pain. However, there is a potential bias as both those who do not experience pain and those with severe pain may choose not to respond. Consequently, both could be factors contributing to non-response. These missing data constitutes a limitation to our secondary outcomes related to pain.\n\nOur study also has several strengths. The prospective reporting of PROMs by our patients is a significant advantage with regards to pain intensity and recovery, as it limits recall bias and provides information at the exact pre-specified time. Thus, SMS surveys for gathering clinical data removes time variation for reception of the questionnaires, as opposed to traditional \"face-to-face\" interviews where the exact timing of the interview may depend on availability of study personal. Furthermore, the use of SMS surveys may help address the challenge of collecting data during the night. However, some delay in response time during nighttime can still be expected as reflected in the proximity between the 12-h upper quartile and 18 h\n\n(Table  1 ). The time variation on SMS surveys could potentially be improved even further by adding pre-specified timeslots for completion, to avoid \"retrospective\" data, but at the risk of a reduced response rate. However, even without enabling this function, we found a response time ranging from 23 to 68 min from reception to completion which seems reasonable. It is also advantageous that patients enter data directly into the secure database from their mobile phones. This enhances data security and also saves resources. Finally, our study is the first to provide data on response rates for surveys every 6 h within the initial 24 postoperative hours after CS.\n\nIn conclusion, our SMS-based questionnaires had a response rate of 63%-78% regarding self-reported pain and recovery scores, even shortly after cesarean section. Thus, SMS-based questionnaires on\n\nPROMs may be a feasible way of collecting these data prospectively, frequently and cost-effectively. Secondarily, our results support that approximately 66% of the patients experience severe pain during the first 24 h following cesarean section, with the highest reported pain scores within the initial 12 h. Future studies should focus on optimizing pain-management within this timeframe."
