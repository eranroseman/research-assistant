  "title": "The efficacy of interventions to improve psychosocial outcomes following surgical treatment for breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Objective Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women across the world. The majority of women diagnosed with the disease undergo surgery, which is often associated with significant psychosocial morbidity. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for women following breast cancer surgery. Method A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using keyword and subject headings within 7 databases. Included studies employed a quantitative methodology presenting empirical findings focusing on interventions for female breast cancer patients following surgery. Results Thirty-two studies were included and based on conventional values of effect sizes. Small effects emerged for the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in relation to anxiety (Hedges g = 0.31), depression (0.38), quality of life (0.40), mood disturbance (0.31), distress (0.27), body image (0.40), self-esteem (0.35), and sexual functioning (0.22). A moderate to large effect emerged for the efficacy of interventions in promoting improvements in sleep disturbance (0.67). Clear evidence emerged for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in promoting improvements in anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Conclusion This is the first meta-analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions on a range of psychosocial outcomes following breast cancer surgery. The meta-analysis highlighted that cognitive behavioral therapy was consistently the most effective psychosocial intervention promoting improvements in anxiety, depression, and quality of life. However, there are shortcomings in existing studies; the length of the follow-up period is typically short and the generalizability of findings was limited by small samples, both of which should be addressed in future studies.",

      "text": "difficulties are also significantly higher following surgical treatment for breast cancer.  8 However, it is often assumed that the distress experienced by women with breast cancer abates after the initial treatment, yet stress-related symptoms may actually increase after surgery and treatment completion, as patients leave the \"safety net\" provided by contact with the oncology team.  7 A recent meta-analysis suggested anxiety after a diagnosis of cancer may persists for up to 10 years or more.  9 Collectively, these findings underscore the need to address the psychosocial well-being of breast cancer patients following surgical treatment and reconstruction.\n\nThe past decade has seen an increase in the development of interventions to reduce psychosocial morbidity and improve coping and adjustment following breast cancer treatment. Psychosocial interventions are broadly defined as any supportive interaction involving 2 or more individuals whose purpose is to promote awareness and education, provide emotional support and encouragement, and assist with problem solving.  10 Psychosocial interventions that have been utilized with breast cancer patients following surgery include group therapy, individual counseling, psychotherapy, and psychoeducational interventions.  11, 12 Generally, such interventions have only focused on a limited number of patient outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence indicates psychosocial interventions provide a consistent beneficial effect for cancer patients  13  and specifically breast cancer patients.  11 However, little is known about which intervention is most effective following breast cancer surgery. The aim of this systematic review and metaanalysis was to evaluate the efficacy of interventions on a range of psychosocial outcomes following surgical treatment for breast cancer, both mastectomy and breast conservation surgery."

      "text": "2.1 | Search, selection, and review strategies Two chartered health psychologists, a medical librarian, and a consultant plastic surgeon formed part of the panel to develop an appropriate search strategy. Four methods were used to identify relevant studies: a keyword search, a subject search, a backward search, and a forward search. Literature searches were performed using 7 electronic databases: PsycINFO (1976-2015), CINAHL (1998-2015), MEDLINE (1975-2015), Academic Search Complete (1980-2015), AMED (1996-2014), Cochrane Library (1975-2015), and EMBASE (1974-2015).\n\nThe search terms were grouped into 3 blocks: block 1-breast neoplasms, breast oncol*, breast cancer, breast tumor, and breast tumour; block 2-mastectom*, lumpectom*, and prophylactic; and block 3-family therap*, group therap*, psychosocial rehabilitation, anxiety management, relaxation therap*, cognitive therap*, cognitive behaviour*, therap*, social support, support groups, counsel*, counselling, counselling, group counsel, group counselling, and group counselling. The terms relating to the types of surgical procedures (block 2) were combined with OR and NOT prophylactic, referring to prophylactic mastectomy. Terms within each block were combined using OR, and then the results of each block were combined using the AND function. Duplicates were excluded. This study was approved by a university ethics committee, and a review protocol was developed and followed but is not available to access. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) female adult breast cancer survivors; (ii) any type of primary breast cancer surgery including mastectomy and breast conservation surgery; (iii) psychological, psychoeducational, and/or psychosocial intervention; (iv) written in English; (v) quantitative methodology; and (vi) presenting empirical findings. Studies were excluded if interventions focused on physical rehabilitation, physiological outcomes, and palliative and/or metastatic breast cancer and were published as a conference abstract or a case study. A backward (reference) search was performed, which involved hand searching the reference list of articles included in the analysis. A forward (citation) search was also performed using Scopus. Additionally, as part of the systematic search procedure, review articles were also obtained and examined to identify any additional articles.\n\nTwo blinded raters (H.M. and E.G.) independently applied a 14item quality assessment checklist from a standardized quality assessment tool to each study.  14 Discrepancies were systematically resolved by consensus. Each study was assessed against the 14 items using a 3point scale (2 fully met, 1 partially met, and 0 did not meet the criterion). A total score was calculated by summing the number of \"yes\" responses, multiplying this by 2, and adding this to the number of partials. If a criterion was not applicable, it was excluded from the score calculation. The total possible score was calculated as 28 minus 2 times the number of not applicable. Lastly, a summary score (total sum/total possible sum) was calculated, representing the methodological quality of each article. These scores were calculated as a linear score from 0 to 100 and divided into 3 categories representing low, moderate, or high-quality studies. Studies with a score of 75 or more were considered as high quality, 50 to 74 as moderate quality, and 49 or less as low quality."

      "text": "We used Hedges g as the effect size statistic. Hedges g calculates the difference between intervention and control group means (d) divided by the pooled standard deviation multiplied by a factor (J) that corrects the underestimation of the population standard deviation.  15 rough pooling variances, Hedges g standardizes outcomes across studies and allows for comparison among disparate outcome measures.\n\nEffect size calculations used a random-effects model. This assumes that analyzed studies represent a random sample of effect sizes, subsequently facilitating the generalizability of results.  16 The heterogeneity between studies was calculated using the heterogeneity I 2 statistic. The I 2 statistic calculates what proportion (0-100%) of the observed variance reflects variance in true effect sizes, rather than sampling error. A value of 0% represents no observed heterogeneity, and an I 2 value of 25%, 50%, or 75% tentatively signifies low, moderate, or high heterogeneity between studies, respectively.  17 To minimize heterogeneity, when studies reported outcomes at multiple time points, the furthest time point was used to calculate effect size. We used the conventional values of effect size 18 in this analysis. An effect size of 0.2 demonstrated a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect. We used the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software for all statistical analyses.  19"

      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of interventions on a range of psychosocial outcomes in breast cancer patients. The meta-analysis demonstrated small effect sizes on 8 psychosocial outcomes: anxiety, depression, quality of life, mood disturbance, distress, body image, self-esteem, and sexual functioning. A moderate to large effect size was detected on sleep disturbance. Within this meta-analysis, anxiety (k = 14), depression (k = 14), and quality of life (k = 13) were the most commonly reported outcomes. This is not surprising given the high incidence of anxiety and depression after surgical treatment for breast cancer, with as many as 30% of women reporting experiencing anxiety and depression,  6  and the widely recognized impact of anxiety and depression on quality of life.  7 Moreover, cognitive behavioral therapy was the most common intervention for both anxiety and depression, often reporting significant treatment  22, 23, [25] [26] [27]  This meta-analysis provides clear evidence for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in improving outcomes in relation to anxiety,  10, 23, 37, 39  depression,  22, 25, 26, 37  and quality of life.  [25] [26] 6] [27] [28]  Meta-regression indicated the number of sessions was not a significant moderator of depression or quality of life, although we can conclude the number of sessions is related to effect size for the outcome anxiety. However, we cannot conclude if the length of the sessions moderated the effect size or the timing of the intervention or who delivered the intervention, as a large portion of the studies did not report significant details of the interventions. This should be addressed in future research to develop effective evidence-based interventions to enhance breast cancer care.\n\nA previous meta-analysis demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy following treatment for adult cancer survivors on anxiety, depression, and quality of life with a large effect size (g = 1.99), based on 4 studies.  52 The findings of this meta-analysis\n\nare conservative yet consistent with previous literature. Moreover, a meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of psychological interventions for breast cancer patients reported strong treatment effects for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in improving anxiety, depression, and quality of life. 53 This meta-analysis is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions to improve a range of psychosocial outcomes following breast cancer surgery. Previous literature 52 has predominately focused on anxiety, depression, and quality of life. While these are undoubtedly important outcomes, our meta-analysis goes beyond this and considers less explored yet emerging research outcomes. However, this meta-analysis cannot conclude if the period following breast cancer surgery is optimal to provide support for breast cancer patients; this warrants further investigation.

Consequently, robust conclusions cannot be drawn surrounding which intervention would be most effective for specific psychosocial outcomes, with the exception of cognitive behavioral therapy improving outcomes in relation to anxiety, depression, and quality of life. The quality of both the systematic review and meta-analysis is dependent on the quality of studies analyzed. One review suggests the more rigorous the review, the less likely it is to conclude there is evidence that psychosocial interventions in oncology are effective. 54 Consequently, the design of the studies included must be considered. While the majority of studies utilized a randomized controlled trial study design, a number of studies employed a pretest and posttest design. Therefore, in the studies that employed a pretest and posttest design, the findings may be attributed to changes that occurred independently to the intervention; for example, Meta-Analysis: Mood distrubance Study name Statistics for each study Hedges's g and 95% CI Hedges's Standard Lower Upper g error Variance limit limit Z-Value p-Value Classen 2008 0.35 0.11 0.01 0.14 0.56 3.29 0.00 Fobair 2002 0.50 0.23 0.05 0.05 0.95 2.20 0.03 Hoffman 2012 0.45 0.14 0.02 0.18 0.73 3.29 0.00 Jones 2011 0.11 0.08 0.01 -0.04 0.26 1.41 0.16 0.31 0.10 0.01 0.12 0.51 3.15 0.00 -1.00 -0.50 0.00 0.50 1.00 Decline of outcome Improvement of outcome Meta-Analysis: Distress Study name Statistics for each study Hedges's g and 95% CI Hedges's Standard Lower Upper g error Variance limit limit Z-Value p-Value Antoni 2001 0.31 0.20 0.04 -0.09 0.70 1.52 0.13 Gunn 2005 0.52 0.16 0.03 0.21 0.83 3.31 0.00 Jones 2013 0.02 0.05 0.00 -0.09 0.12 0.33 0.74 Marcus 2010 0.21 0.11 0.01 -0.02 0.43 1.81 0.07 Sandgren 2000 0.57 0.28 0.08 0.03 1.12 2.06 0.04 0.27 0.11 0.01 0.05 0.49 2.35 0.02 -1.00 -0.50 0.00 0.50 1.00 Decline of outcome Improvement of outcome FIGURE 2 (Continued)\n\nincreased support from family members may improve psychosocial well-being. A number of studies acknowledge an absence in randomization and/or the process of randomization did not result in equity between groups. Therefore, further evidence with randomized controlled trial study designs may be required to confirm significant treatment effects are not linked to weaker study design. This meta-analysis did not include unpublished studies, as we considered published peer-reviewed studies would provide the strongest evidence regarding the efficacy of psychosocial interventions. However, we recognize effect sizes may be overestimated with the absence of publication of null findings. This review also reported both primary and secondary outcomes of studies within the metaanalysis. Subsequently, we acknowledge the possibility of reporting small effect sizes for secondary outcomes. Seven studies were excluded because the published data were not suitable for metaanalysis, and the required data could not be obtained from the authors.  11, 23, 25, 37, 39, 44, 48 e studies included in this meta-analysis present a number of limitations. The majority of the studies recruited a sample of highly educated, middle-class White women who were likely to be motivated to participate in health research. Furthermore, 3 studies  26, 30, 45  utilized samples with clinically depressed and highly distressed participants, and another study included women experiencing chronic insomnia.  27 Consequently, a significant improvement is more likely, as participants who experience considerable psychological symptoms may be more likely to engage in interventions and hence benefit more from the intervention, enhancing the likelihood of detecting significant treatment effects.  55 We recommend that researchers should be aware of the sample when assessing the findings. Future studies may want to consider screening for psychological symptoms and including only those participants with elevated scores. This would allow for resources to be targeted at those who would benefit most from the intervention and reduce the likelihood of bias from the ceiling/floor effects.\n\nSeven studies acknowledged limited generalizability from small sample sizes (n < 50) and hence were underpowered to evaluate changes in the multiple outcomes that were measured.  25, 36, 38, 40, 46, 47, 49 tably, studies with low statistical power have a reduced chance of detecting a true effect.  56 A number of studies also reported limited generalizability from single-center trials, and the use of a single highly trained therapist within the interventions. Furthermore, many of the interventions included multiple components; subsequently, it is often not possible to determine which component an improvement is attributable to. As Czaja and colleagues  58  acknowledged, the decomposition of psychosocial interventions to identify effective components is an important goal within the field of psycho-oncology and should be addressed in future studies. Moreover, no studies included in this meta-analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of interventions. However, there is a pressing need for studies to address cost issues for breast cancer interventions to determine if the initial intervention cost becomes cost-effective over time.  56 For example, a reduction in the number of general practitioner visits may result in overall cost-effectiveness of an intervention.  57 We recommend future investigators to"

However, the number of sessions was a significant moderator for anxiety (k = 9; B = 0.015; P = .04). In regard to publication bias, all funnel plots displayed a greater number of studies to the right of the mean. However, as a disproportionate number of studies did not fall to the bottom right of the plot, this suggests systematic bias does not significantly contribute to our estimate of the efficacy of interventions in relation to psychosocial outcomes. Funnel plots are displayed in FigureS3, accessible online via supporting information. Trim and fill procedures inputted 5 studies for depression, 1 study for anxiety, 4 studies for quality of life, 1 study for sexual functioning, and 2 studies for mood disturbance and distress, and no studies were inputted for self-esteem and body image. Orwin's fail-safe N was calculated to assess the robustness of the overall effect for each outcome. Orwin's fail-safe N indicated 198 nonsignificant studies for depression, 81 for"

This is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve a range of psychosocial outcomes following breast cancer surgery. This meta-analysis has demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in improving outcomes in relation to anxiety, depression, and quality of life. This meta-analysis is of significant importance given the potential widespread integration of evidenced-based psychosocial interventions in clinical cancer care. Future research priorities should focus on strengthening studies both conceptually and methodologically, to meaningfully pool data to determine which intervention components are required to enhance breast cancer survivorship. Currently, robust conclusions cannot be determined regarding the efficacy of different types of psychosocial interventions. However, this meta-analysis provides a methodical, novel, and secure evidence base for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety, depression, and quality of life following breast cancer surgery.

However, the number of sessions was a significant moderator for anxiety (k = 9; B = 0.015; P = .04). In regard to publication bias, all funnel plots displayed a greater number of studies to the right of the mean. However, as a disproportionate number of studies did not fall to the bottom right of the plot, this suggests systematic bias does not significantly contribute to our estimate of the efficacy of interventions in relation to psychosocial outcomes. Funnel plots are displayed in FigureS3, accessible online via supporting information. Trim and fill procedures inputted 5 studies for depression, 1 study for anxiety, 4 studies for quality of life, 1 study for sexual functioning, and 2 studies for mood disturbance and distress, and no studies were inputted for self-esteem and body image.

This is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve a range of psychosocial outcomes following breast cancer surgery. This meta-analysis has demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in improving outcomes in relation to anxiety, depression, and quality of life. This meta-analysis is of significant importance given the potential widespread integration of evidenced-based psychosocial interventions in clinical cancer care. Future research priorities should focus on strengthening studies both conceptually and methodologically, to meaningfully pool data to determine which intervention components are required to enhance breast cancer survivorship. Currently, robust conclusions cannot be determined regarding the efficacy of different types of psychosocial interventions. However, this meta-analysis provides a methodical, novel, and secure evidence base for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety, depression, and quality of life following breast cancer surgery.
