Since the book was published in 1993, more than 50 000 copies have been printed, and it has been translated into more than 25 languages. A list of these languages and contact addresses of local publishers is available on request from WHO Press, World Health Organization, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.\n\nBasic epidemiology starts with a definition of epidemiology, introduces the history of modern epidemiology, and provides examples of the uses and applications of epidemiology. Measurement of exposure and disease are covered in Chapter 2 and a summary of the different types of study designs and their strengths and limitations is provided in Chapter 3. An introduction to statistical methods in Chapter 4 sets the scene for understanding basic concepts and available tools for analysing data and As with the first edition of Basic epidemiology, examples are drawn from different countries to illustrate various epidemiological concepts. These are by no means exhaustive or comprehensive and we encourage students and teachers to seek locally relevant examples. Each chapter starts with a few key messages and ends with a series of short questions (answers are provided) to stimulate discussion and review progress.\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge contributions to the first edition from John Last and Anthony McMichael. Martha Anker wrote Chapter 4 for the first edition. In the second edition, Chapter 4 was written by Professor O. Dale Williams.

However, it was not until the nineteenth century that the distribution of disease in specific human population groups was measured to any large extent. This work marked not only the formal beginnings of epidemiology but also some of its most spectacular achievements.  1 The finding by John Snow (Box 1.1) that the risk of cholera in London was related to the drinking of water supplied by a particular company provides a well-known example; the map (see Figure  4 .1) highlights the clustering of cases. Snow's epidemiological studies were one aspect of a wide-ranging series of investigations that examined related physical, chemical, biological, sociological and political processes.  2 omparing rates of disease in subgroups of the human population became common practice in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This approach was initially applied to the control of communicable diseases (see Chapter 7), but proved to be a useful way of linking environmental conditions or agents to specific diseases. In the second half of the twentieth century, these methods were applied to chronic noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer, especially in middleand high-income countries."

For example, Richard Doll and Andrew Hill studied the relationship between tobacco use and lung cancer, beginning in the 1950s.  4 Their work was preceded by experimental studies on the carcinogenicity of tobacco tars and by clinical observations linking tobacco use and other possible factors to lung cancer. By using longterm cohort studies, they were able to establish the association between smoking and lung cancer (Figure  1 .1). among non-smokers over subsequent decades. Male doctors born between 1900-1930 who smoked cigarettes died, on average, about 10 years younger than lifelong non-smokers 5 (Figure  1 .2).\n\nSmoking is a particularly clear-cut case, but for most diseases, several factors contribute to causation. Some factors are essential for the development of a disease and some increase the risk of developing disease. New epidemiological methods were needed to analyse these relationships. In low-and middle-income countries where HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are common causes of death, communicable disease epidemiology is of vital importance. This branch of epidemiology has now become important in all countries with the emergence of cephalopathy (BSE), and pandemic influenza. Epidemiology has evolved considerably over the past 50 years and the major challenge now is to explore and act upon the social determinants of health and disease, most of which lie outside the health sector.  [6] [7] [8]  Definition, scope, and uses of epidemiology Definition Epidemiology as defined by Last  9  is \"the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the prevention and control of health problems\" (see Box 1.2). Epidemiologists are concerned not only with death, illness and disability, but also with more\n\nTable 1.1.

Smallpox illustrates both the achievements and frustrations of modern public health. In the 1790s it was shown that cowpox infection conferred protection against the smallpox virus, yet it took almost 200 years for the benefits of this discovery to be accepted and applied throughout the world.\n\nAn intensive campaign to eliminate smallpox was coordinated over many years by the World Health Organization (WHO). An understanding of the epidemiology of smallpox was central to its eradication, in particular, by:\n\n\u2022 providing information about the distribution of cases and the model, mechanisms and levels of transmission; \u2022 mapping outbreaks of the disease;\n\n\u2022 evaluating control measures (Box 1.4).\n\nThe fact that there was no animal host was of critical importance together with the low average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case.\n\nWhen a ten-year eradication programme was proposed by WHO in 1967, 10-15 million new cases and 2 million deaths were occurring annually in 31 countries. The number of countries reporting cases decreased rapidly in the period 1967-76; by 1976 smallpox was reported from only two countries, and the last naturally-occurring case of smallpox was reported in 1977 in a woman who had been exposed to the virus in a laboratory. Smallpox was declared to be eradicated on 8 May 1980.  13 everal factors contributed to the success of the programme: universal political commitment, a definite goal, a precise timetable, well-trained staff and a flexible strategy. Furthermore, the disease had many features that made its elimination possible and an effective heat-stable vaccine was available. In 1979, WHO maintained a stockpile of smallpox vaccines sufficient to vaccinate 200 million people. This stockpile was subsequently reduced to 2.5 million doses, but given renewed concern about smallpox being used as a biological weapon, WHO continues to maintain and ensure adequate vaccine stocks.  14"

In the 1950s, mercury compounds were released with the water discharged from a factory in Minamata, Japan, into a small bay (Box 1.5). This led to the accumulation of methyl mercury in fish, causing severe poisoning in people who ate them.  15 his was the first known outbreak of methyl mercury poisoning involving fish, and it took several years of research before the exact cause was identified. Minamata disease has become one of the best-documented environmental diseases. A second outbreak occurred in the 1960s in another part of Japan. Less severe poisoning from methyl mercury in fish has since been reported from several other countries.  15, 16   umatic fever and rheumatic heart disease Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are associated with poverty, and in particular, with poor housing and overcrowding, both of which favour the spread of streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections. In many affluent countries, the decline in rheumatic fever started at the beginning of the twentieth century, long before the introduction of effective drugs such as sulfonamides and penicillin (Figure  1 .7). Today the disease has almost disappeared from most high-income countries although Box 1.4.

The first cases were thought to be infectious meningitis. However, it was observed that 121 patients with the disease mostly resided close to Minamata Bay. A survey of affected and unaffected people showed that the victims were almost exclusively members of families whose main occupation was fishing and whose diet consisted mainly of fish. On the other hand, people visiting these families and family members who ate small amounts of fish did not suffer from the disease. It was therefore concluded that something in the fish had caused the poisoning and that the disease was not communicable or genetically determined.  15 at is epidemiology?\n\npockets of relatively high incidence still exist among socially and economically disadvantaged populations within these countries. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the role of social and economic factors that contribute to outbreaks of rheumatic fever and to the spread of streptococcal throat infection.

In 1915, endemic goitre was named as the easiest known disease to prevent, and use of iodized salt for goitre control was proposed the same year in Switzerland.  18 The first large-scale trials with iodine were done shortly afterwards in Ohio, USA, on 5000 girls aged between 11 and 18 years. The prophylactic and therapeutic effects were impressive and iodized salt was introduced on a community scale in many countries in 1924.\n\nThe use of iodized salt is effective because salt is used by all classes of society at roughly the same level throughout the year. Success depends on the effective production and distribution of the salt and requires legislative enforcement, quality control and public awareness (Box 1.6). 200 250 900 Rheumatic fever cases per 100 000 Year 150 100 50 0 1870 1930 1960 1900"

It is now clear that the main cause of increasing lung cancer death rates is tobacco use. The first epidemiological studies linking lung cancer and smoking were published in 1950; five case-control studies reported that tobacco use was associated with lung cancer in men. The strength of the association in the British doctors' study (Figure  1 .1) should have been sufficient to evoke a strong and immediate response, particularly as other studies confirmed this association in a wide variety of populations. Had the methods for calculating and interpreting odds ratios been available at the time, the British study referred to in Figure  1 .1 would have reported a relative risk of 14 in cigarette smokers compared with never-smokers, too high to be dismissed as bias.  21 owever, other exposures, such as to asbestos dust and urban air pollution also contribute to the increased lung cancer burden. Moreover, the combined effect of smoking and exposure to asbestos is multiplicative, creating exceedingly high lung cancer rates for workers who both smoke and are exposed to asbestos dust (Table  1"

Hip fractures increase exponentially with age as the result of age-related decreased bone mass at the proximal femur and an age-related increase in falls. With the rising number of elderly individuals in most populations, the incidence of hip fracture can be expected to increase proportionately if efforts are not directed towards prevention.\n\nAs hip fractures account for a large number of days spent in hospital, the economic costs associated with hip fracture are considerable.  23, 24   n a study of cost of injuries in the Netherlands, hip fracture -which ranked only fourteenth of 25 listed injuries in terms of incidence -was the leading injury diagnosis in terms of costs, accounting for 20% of all costs associated with injury."

The World Health Assembly resolved in 1977 that all people should attain a level of health permitting them to lead socially and economically productive lives by the year 2000. This commitment to the \"health-for-all\" strategy was renewed in 1998 and again in 2003.  2  Practical definitions of health and disease are needed in epidemiology, which concentrates on aspects of health that are easily measurable and amenable to improvement.\n\nDefinitions of health states used by epidemiologists tend to be simple, for example, \"disease present\" or \"disease absent\" (see Box 2.1). The development of criteria to establish the presence of a disease requires a definition of \"normality\" and \"abnormality.\" However, it may be difficult to define what is normal, and there is often no clear distinction between normal and abnormal, especially with regard to normally distributed continuous variables that may be associated with several diseases (see Chapter 8).\n\nFor example, guidelines about cut-off points for treating high blood pressure are arbitrary, as there is a continuous increase in risk of cardiovascular disease at every level (see Chapter 6). A specific cut-off point for an abnormal value is based on an operational definition and not on any absolute thre n shold. Similar considerations apply to criteria for exposure to health hazards: for example, the guideline for a safe blood e lead level would be based on judgment of the available evidence, which is likely to change over time (see Chapter 9)."

For example, hepatitis can be identified by the presence of antibodies in the blood; asbestosis can be identified by symptoms and signs of specific changes in lung function, radiographic demonstration of fibrosis of the lung tissue or pleural thickening, and a history of exposure to asbestos fibres. Table  2 .1 shows that the diagnosis of rheumatic fever diagnosis can be made based on several manifestations of the disease, with some signs being more important than others.\n\nIn some situations very simple criteria are justified. For example, the reduction of mortality due to bacterial pneumonia in children in developing countries depends on rapid detection and treatment. WHO's casemanagement guidelines recommend that pneumonia case detection be based on clinical signs alone, without auscultation, chest radiographs or laboratory tests. The only r equipment required is a watch for timing respiratory rate. The use of antibiotics for suspected pneumonia in children-based only on a physical examination -is recommended in settings where there is a high rate of bacterial pneumonia, and where a lack of resources makes it im-f possible to diagnose other causes.  5 ikewise, a clinical case definition for AIDS in adults was developed in 1985, for use in settings with limited diagnostic resources.  6 The WHO case definition for AIDS surveillance required only two major signs (weight loss \u2265 10% of body weight, chronic diarrhoea, or prolonged fever) and one minor sign (persistent cough, herpes zoster, generalized lymphadenopathy, etc).

A clear and concise definition of what is considered a case ensures that the same entity in different groups or different individuals is being measured.  3 Definitions used in clinical practice are less rigidly specified and often influenced by clinical judgment. This is partly because it is often possible to proceed stepwise with a series of tests until a diagnosis is confirmed.\n\nTable 2.1.

These are fundamentally different ways of measuring occurrence (see Table  2 .2) and the relation between incidence and prevalence varies among diseases. There may be low incidence and a high prevalence -as for diabetes -or a high incidence and a low prevalence -as for the common cold. Colds occur more frequently than diabetes but last only a short time, whereas diabetes is essentially lifelong.\n\nMeasuring prevalence and incidence involves the counting of cases in defined populations at risk. Reporting the number of cases without reference to the population at risk can be used to give an impression of the overall magnitude of a health problem, or of short-term trends in a population, for instance, during an epidemic. WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record contains incidence data in d the form of case numbers, which in spite of their crude nature, can give useful information about the development of epidemics of communicable diseases.\n\nThe term \"attack rate\" is often used instead of incidence during a disease outbreak in a narrowly-defined population over a short period of time. The attack rate can be calculated as the number of people affected divided by the number exposed. For example, in the case of a foodborne disease outbreak, the attack rate can be calculated for each type of food eaten, and then these rates compared to identify the source of the infection.\n\nData on prevalence and incidence become much more useful if converted into rates (see Table  1 .1). A rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the corresponding number of people in the population at risk and is expressed as cases per 10 n people. Some epidemiologist n s use the term \"rate\" only for measurements of disease occurrence per time unit (week, year, etc.). In this book, we use the term\n\nTable 2.2.

In this case, P has to be multiplied P by the appropriate factor: 10 n . If the data have been collected for one point in time, P is the \"point preva P lence rate.\" It is sometimes more convenient to use the \"period prevalence rate,\" calculated as the total number of cases at any time during a specified period, divided by the population at risk midway through the period. Similarly, a \"lifetime prevalence\" is the total number of persons known to have had the disease for at least some part of their lives.\n\nApart from age, several factors determine prevalence (Figure  2 .2). In particular:\n\n\u2022 the severity of illness (if many people who develop a disease die within a short time, its prevalence is decreased); \u2022 the duration of illness (if a disease lasts a short time its prevalence is lower than if it lasts a long time); \u2022 the number of new cases (if many people develop a disease, its prevalence is higher than if few people do so). Decreased by: Shorter duration of the disease High case-fatality rate from disease Decrease in new cases (decrease in incidence) In-migration of healthy people Out-migration of cases Improved cure rate of cases\n\nSince prevalence can be influenced by many factors unrelated to the cause of the disease, prevalence studies do not usually provide strong evidence of causality. Measures of prevalence are, however, helpful in assessing the need for preventive action, healthcare and the planning of health services. Prevalence is a useful measure of the occurrence of conditions for which the onset of disease may be gradual, such as maturity-onset diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been measured in various populations using criteria proposed by WHO (see Table  2 .3); the wide range shows the importance of social and environmental factors in causing this disease, and indicates the varying need for diabetic health services in different populations."

Standardization can also be done for variables other than age.

This method yields the number of cases that would be expected if the age-specific rates in the standard population were true for the study population. Standardized rates are used, whenever relevant, for morbidity as well as mortality. The choice of a standard population is arbitrary, but can be problematic when comparing rates of low-income and high-income countries.\n\nDetails on methods of standardizing rates can be found in: Teaching health statistics: lesson and seminar outlines. 31 Period 30 Africa World Europe Asia 70 60 50 40 55 60 65 70 80 85 90 95 2000 North America Latin America and the Caribbean Oceania p p 80\n\nWhile each give different age-standardized rates (see Table  2 .8), they generally do not affect the overall ranking when comparing rates of different populations.  30 e age-standardization of rates eliminates the influence of different age distributions on the morbidity or mortality rates being compared. For example, there is great variation between countries in the reported crude mortality rates for heart disease as shown in Table  2 .9. Finland has a crude heart disease death rate approximately three times that of Brazil, but the standardized rate is the same. Similarly, the United\n\nStates of America has a crude rate more than twice that of Brazil, yet again, age-standardized rates are similar. Thus the difference between these countries is not as large as it appears from the crude rates.\n\nHigh-income countries have a much greater proportion of older people in their populations than low-and middle-income countries-the older people have higher rates of cardiovascular disease compared with younger people. All these death rates are influenced by the quality of the original data on the causes of death."

In this situation, data on morbidity (illness) are more useful than mortality rates.\n\nMorbidity data are often helpful in clarifying the reasons for particular trends in mortality. Changes in death rates could be due to changes in morbidity rates or in case-fatality. For example, the recent decline in cardiovascular disease mortality rates in many developed countries could be due to a fall in either incidence (suggesting improvements in primary prevention) or in case-fatality (suggesting improvements in treatment).

This is a more useful term for public health purposes as it reflects the amount, usually expressed as a percentage, by which the risk of a disease is reduced by elimination or control of a particular exposure. Using attributable risk, it is possible to estimate the number of people spared the consequences of exposure, by subtracting the rate of the outcome (usually incidence or mortality) among the unexposed from the rate among the exposed individuals. For example, if there were 6 deaths per 100 among smokers, and 1 death per 100 in non-smokers, the attributable risk would be 5 per 100. This assumes that causes other than the one under investigation have had equal effects on the exposed and unexposed groups.\n\nIn summary, there are various measures for studying populations. Chapter 3 refers to many of these measures in the context of study design."

Major experimental study designs include the following: randomized controlled trials using patients as subjects (clinical trials), field trials in which the participants are healthy people, and community trials in which the participants are the communities themselves.\n\nIn all epidemiological studies it is essential to have a clear definition of a case of the disease being investigated by delineating the symptoms, signs or other characteristics indicating that a person has the disease. A clear definition of an exposed person is also necessary. This definition must include all the characteristics that identify a person as being exposed to the factor in question.

They are usually based on mortality statistics and may examine patterns of death by age, sex or ethnicity during specified time periods or in various countries.\n\nA classic example of descriptive data is shown in Figure  3 .1, which charts the pattern of maternal mortality in Sweden since the middle of the eighteenth century, showing maternal death rates per 100 000 live births.  2  Such data can be of great value when identifying factors that have caused such a clear downward trend.

Figure  3 .2 is also based on routine death statistics and provides an example of the change in death rates of heart disease over time in six countries. It shows that death rates from heart disease have fallen by up to 70% in the last three decades in several countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Yet during the same time, the rates in other countries -such as Brazil and the Russian Federation -have remained the same or increased.  3 The next step in investigating this difference would require information about the comparability of the death certificates, changes in the incidence and case-fatality of the disease, and changes in the risk factors to which the relative populations have been exposed."

One example is the use of ecological data in the World Health Chart (see Box 4.2). Time series may reduce some of the socioeconomic confounding that is a potential problem in ecological studies. If the time period in a time series is very short, as it is in daily time series studies (Figure  3 .3), confounding is virtually zero as the people in the study serve as their own controls.

Ecological studies usually rely on data collected for other purposes; data on different exposures and on socioeconomic factors may not be available. In addition, since the unit of analysis is a group, the link between exposure and effect at the individual level can not be made. One attraction of ecological studies is that data can be used from populations with widely differing characteristics or extracted from different data sources.\n\nThe increasing death rate during the heat wave in France in 2003 (Figure  3 .3) correlated well with increasing temperature, although increasing daily air pollution also played a role. This increase of deaths occurred mainly among elderly people and the immediate cause of death was often recorded as heart or lung disease."

In a cross-sectional study the measurements of exposure and effect are made at the same time. It is not easy to assess the reasons for associations shown in cross-sectional studies. The key question to be asked is whether the exposure precedes or follows the effect. If the exposure data are known to represent exposure before any effect occurred, the data from a cross-sectional study can be treated like data generated from a cohort study.\n\nCross-sectional studies are relatively easy and inexpensive to conduct and are useful for investigating exposures that are fixed characteristics of individuals, such as ethnicity or blood group. In sudden outbreaks of disease, a cross-sectional study to measure several exposures can be the most convenient first step in investigating the cause.\n\nData from cross-sectional studies are helpful in assessing the health care needs of populations. Data from repeated cross-sectional surveys using independent random samples with standardized definitions and survey methods provide useful indications of trends.  7, 8 Each survey should have a clear purpose. Valid surveys need well-designed questionnaires, an appropriate sample of sufficient size, and a good response rate.\n\nMany countries conduct regular cross-sectional surveys on representative samples of their populations focusing on personal and demographic characteristics, illnesses and health-related habits. Frequency of disease and risk factors can then be examined in relation to age, sex and ethnicity.

A critical and challenging aspect of population-based case control studies is finding a cost-effective way to identify and enroll control subjects.  9 The most difficult task is to select controls so as to sample the exposure prevalence in the population that generated the cases. Furthermore, the choice of controls and cases must not be influenced by exposure status, which should be determined in the same manner for both. It is not necessary for cases and controls to be all-inclusive; in fact they can be restricted to any specified subgroup, such as elderly people, males or females.\n\nThe controls should represent people who would have been designated study cases if they had developed the disease. Ideally, case-control studies use new (incident) cases to avoid the difficulty of separating factors related to causation and survival (or recovery), although studies have often been conducted using prevalence data (for example, case-control studies of congenital malformations).

In the case-control design, the exposure status of the cases is usually determined after the development of the disease (retrospective data) and usually by direct questioning of the affected person or a relative or friend (Box 3.2). The informant's answers may be influenced by knowledge about the hypothesis under investigation or the disease experience itself.\n\nAn example of the use of a case-control study design is shown in Table  3 .2. Researchers in Papua New Guinea compared the history of meat consumption in people who had enteritis necroticans, with people who did not have the disease. Proportionately more people who had the disease (50 of 61 cases) reported prior meat consumption than those who were not affected (16 of 57).  11 xposure is sometimes determined by biochemical measurements (e.g. lead in blood or cadmium in urine), which may not accurately reflect the relevant past exposure. For example, lead in blood at age 6 years is not a good indicator of exposure at age 1 to 2 years, which is the age of greatest sensitivity to lead. This problem can be avoided if exposure can be estimated from an established recording system (e.g. stored results of routine blood testing or employment records) or if the case-control study is carried out prospectively so that exposure data are collected before the disease develops."

The odds ratio is very similar to the risk ratio, particularly if a disease is rare. For the odds ratio to be a good approximation, the cases and controls must be representative of the general population with respect to exposure.

Of 46 mothers whose babies had malformations, 41 had been given thalidomide between the fourth and ninth weeks of pregnancy, whereas none of the 300 control mothers, whose children were normal, had taken the drug during pregnancy.  10 Accurate timing of the drug intake was crucial for determining relevant exposure.\n\nTable 3.2.

As mentioned previously, the term \"prospective\" refers to the timing of data collection and not to the relationship between exposure and effect. Thus there can be both prospective and retrospective cohort studies.\n\nCohort studies provide the best information about the causation of disease and the most direct measurement of the risk of developing disease. Although conceptually simple, cohort studies are major undertakings and may require long periods of follow-up since disease may occur a long time after exposure. For example, the induction period for leukaemia or thyroid cancer caused by radiation (i.e. the time required for the specific cause to produce an outcome) is many years and it is necessary to follow up study participants for a long time. Many exposures investigated are long-term in nature and accurate information about them requires data collection over long periods. However, in the case of tobacco use, many people have relatively stable habits and information about past and current exposure can be collected at the time the cohort is defined.\n\nIn situations with sudden acute exposures, the causeeffect relationship for acute effects may be obvious, but cohort studies are also used to investigate late or chronic effects (Box 3.3).\n\nAs cohort studies start with exposed and unexposed people, the difficulty of measuring or finding existing data on individual exposures largely determines the feasibility of doing one of these studies. If the disease is rare in the exposed group as well as the unexposed group there may also be problems in obtaining a large enough study group."

In addition, 120 000 people still suffer pollution. The acute effects were easily studied with a cross-sectional design. More subtle chronic effects and those developing only after a long latency period are still being studied using cohort study designs. Population People without the disease Exposed Disease No disease Not exposed Disease No disease The expense of a cohort study can be reduced by using routine sources information about mortality or morbidity, such as disease registers or national registers of deaths as part of the follow-up. One example is the Nurses Health Study (Box 3.4).\n\nSince cohort studies take healthy people as their starting-point, it is possible to examine a range of outcomes (in contrast to what can be achieved in case-control studies). For example, the Framingham study -a cohort study that began in 1948 -has investigated the risk factors for a wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and musculoskeletal disorders.  14 imilar large-scale cohort studies have been started in China.

Researchers plan to follow this cohort on a regular basis.  15  special type of cohort study is the study of identical twins, where the confounding factor of genetic variation -between people exposed and not exposed to a particular factor -can be eliminated.

Researchers believed that the community approach was the best way to address the large compounded risk of mild elevations of multiple risk factors and the interrelation of several health behaviours. Although some components of the intervention proved effective when evaluated individually (for example, efficiency of the mass media and other community-wide programs), large, favourable changes in risk factor also occurred in the control sites. Part of the problem was related to design limitations. Internal validity was compromised by the fact that only a few intervention units could be studied in sufficient detail. Researchers also noted the need to improve educational interventions and expand the environmental and health policy components of health promotion.  19 pes of studies sessing the impact of errors that can not be eliminated.

      "text": "Random error is when a value of the sample measurement diverges -due to chance alone -from that of the true population value. Random error causes inaccurate measures of association. There are three major sources of random error: individual biological variation; sampling error; and measurement error.\n\nRandom error can never be completely eliminated since we can study only a sample of the population. Sampling error is usually caused by the fact that a small sample is not representative of all the population's variables. The best way to reduce sampling error is to increase the size of the study. Individual variation always occurs and no measurement is perfectly accurate. Measurement error can be reduced by stringent protocols, and by making individual measurements as precise as possible. Investigators need to understand the measurement methods being used in the study, and the errors that these methods can cause. Ideally, laboratories should be able to document the accuracy and precision of their measurements by systematic quality control procedures."

Sample size calculations can be done with standard formulae as provided in Chapter 4. The following information is needed before the calculation can be done: required level of statistical significance of the ability to detect a difference acceptable error, or chance of missing a real effect magnitude of the effect under investigation amount of disease in the population relative sizes of the groups being compared.\n\nIn reality, sample size is often determined by logistic and financial considerations, and a compromise always has to be made between sample size and costs. A practical guide to determining sample size in health studies has been published by WHO.  22 he precision of a study can also be improved by ensuring that the groups are of appropriate relative size. This is often an issue of concern in case-control studies when a decision is required on the number of controls to be chosen for each case. It is not possible to be definitive about the ideal ratio of controls to cases, since this depends on the relative costs of accumulating cases and controls. If cases are scarce and controls plentiful, it is appropriate to increase the ratio of controls to cases. For example, in the case-control study of the effects of thalidomide (Box 3.2), 46 affected children were compared with 300 normal children. In general, however, there may be little point in having more than four controls for each case. It is important to ensure that there is sufficient similarity between cases and controls when the data are to be analysed by, for example, age group or social class; if most cases and only a few controls were in the older age groups, the study would not be able to account for the confounding factor of age."

    {
      "title": "Selection bias",
      "text": "Selection bias occurs when there is a systematic difference between the characteristics of the people selected for a study and the characteristics of those who are not. An obvious source of selection bias occurs when participants select themselves for a study, either because they are unwell or because they are particularly worried about an exposure. It is well known, for example, that people who respond to an invitation to participate in a study on the effects of smoking differ in their smoking habits from non-responders; the latter are usually heavier smokers. In studies of children's health, where parental cooperation is required, selection bias may also occur. In a cohort study of newborn children,  23  successful 12-month follow-up varied according to income level of the parents. If individuals entering or remaining in a study have different characteristics from those who are not selected initially, or who drop out before completion, the result is a biased estimate of the association between exposure and outcome.\n\nAn important selection bias is introduced when the disease or factor under investigation itself makes people unavailable for study. For example, in a factory where workers are exposed to formaldehyde, those who suffer most from eye irritation are most likely to leave their jobs. The remaining workers are less affected and a prevalence study of the association between formaldehyde exposure and eye irritation that is done only in the workplace may be very misleading.\n\nIn such occupational epidemiology studies this important selection bias is called the healthy worker effect (Chapter 9). Workers have to be healthy enough to perform their duties; the severely ill and disabled are usually excluded from employment. Similarly, if a study is based on examinations done in a health centre and there is no follow-up of participants who do not turn up, biased results may be produced: unwell patients may be in bed either at home or in hospital. All epidemiological study designs need to account for selection bias."

    {
      "title": "Measurement bias",
      "text": "Measurement bias occurs when the individual measurements or classifications of disease or exposure are inaccurate -that is, they do not measure correctly what they are supposed to measure. There are many sources of measurement bias and their effects are of varying importance. For instance, biochemical or physiological measurements are never completely accurate and different laboratories often produce different results on the same specimen. If specimens from the exposed and control groups are analysed randomly by different laboratories, there is less chance for systematic measurement bias than in the situation where all specimens from the exposed group are analysed in one laboratory and all those from the control group are analysed in another.\n\nA form of measurement bias of particular importance in retrospective casecontrol studies is known as recall bias. This occurs when there is a differential recall of information by cases and controls; for instance, cases may be more likely to recall past exposure, especially if it is widely known to be associated with the disease under study -for example, lack of exercise and heart disease. Recall bias can either exaggerate the degree of effect associated with the exposure -as with people affected by heart disease being more likely to admit to a past lack of exercise -or underestimate it -if cases are more likely than controls to deny past exposure.\n\nIf measurement bias occurs equally in the groups being compared, it almost always results in an underestimate of the true strength of the relationship. Such non-differential bias may account for apparent discrepancies in the results of different epidemiological studies.\n\nIf the investigator, laboratory technician or the participant knows the exposure status, this knowledge can influence measurements and cause observer bias. To avoid this bias, measurements can be made in a blind or double-blind fashion. A blind study means that the investigators do not know how participants are classified.\n\nA double-blind study means that neither the investigators, nor the participants, know how the latter are classified."

      "title": "Confounding",
      "text": "Confounding is another major issue in epidemiological studies. In a study of the association between exposure to a cause (or risk factor) and the occurrence of disease, confounding can occur when another exposure exists in the study population and is associated both with the disease and the exposure being studied. A problem arises if this extraneous factor -itself a determinant or risk factor for the health outcome -is unequally distributed between the exposure subgroups. Confounding occurs when the effects of two exposures (risk factors) have not been separated and the analysis concludes that the effect is due to one variable rather than the other. To be a confounding factor, two conditions must be met (Figure  3 .10). Confounding variable (tobacco use) Two exposures associated with each other True association with the disease Confounded association Disease (heart disease) Exposure (coffee drinking)\n\nConfounding arises because non-random distribution of risk factors in the source population also occurs in the study population thus providing misleading estimates of effect (see Box 3.7). In this sense, it might appear to be a bias, but in fact it does not result from systematic error in research design.  25 ge and social class are often confounders in epidemiological studies. An association between high blood pressure and coronary heart disease may in truth represent concomitant changes in the two variables that occur with increasing age; the potential confounding effect of age has to be considered, and when this is done it is seen that high blood pressure indeed increases the risk of coronary heart disease.\n\nIn the example in Figure  3 .10, confounding may be the explanation for the relationship demonstrated between coffee drinking and the risk of coronary heart disease, since it is known that coffee consumption is associated with tobacco use: people who drink coffee are more likely to smoke than people who do not drink coffee."

Confounding can have a very important influence, and may even change the apparent direction of an association. A variable that appears to be protective may, after control of confounding, be found to be harmful. The most common concern about confounding is that it may create the appearance of a cause-effect relationship that does not actually exist. For a variable to be a confounder, it must, in its own right, be a determinant of the occurrence of disease (i.e. a risk factor) and associated with the exposure under investigation. Thus, in a study of radon exposure and lung cancer, smoking is not a confounder if the smoking habits are identical in the radon-exposed and control groups.\n\nIt is also well known that cigarette smoking is a cause of coronary heart disease. It is thus possible that the relationship between coffee drinking and coronary heart disease merely reflects the known causal association of tobacco use and heart disease. In this situation, smoking confounds the apparent relationship between coffee consumption and coronary heart disease because smoking is correlated with coffee drinking and is a risk factor even for those who do not drink coffee."

Matching has been used extensively in case-control studies but it can lead to problems in the selection of controls if the matching criteria are too strict or too numerous; this is called overmatching.\n\nMatching can be expensive and time-consuming, but is particularly useful if the danger exists of there being no overlap between cases and controls, such as in a situation where the cases are likely to be older than the controls."

Confounding can then be controlled by stratification, which involves the measurement of the strength of associations in well defined and homogeneous categories (strata) of the confounding variable. If age is a confounder, the association may be measured in, say, 10-year age groups; if sex or ethnicity is a confounder, the association is measured separately in men and women or in the different ethnic groups. Methods are available for summarizing the overall association by producing a weighted average of the estimates calculated in each separate stratum.\n\nAlthough stratification is conceptually simple and relatively easy to carry out, it is often limited by the size of the study and it can not help to control many factors simultaneously, as is often necessary. In this situation, multivariate statistical modeling is required to estimate the strength of the associations while controlling for several confounding variables simultaneously; a range of statistical techniques is available for these analyses (Chapter 4)."

This does not require that the study sample be representative of a reference population. For example, evidence that the effect of lowering blood cholesterol in men is also relevant to women requires a judgment about the external validity of studies in men.

The first step is to select a random sample, whereby each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample (see Chapter 3). There are numerous sampling strategies and texts to help guide this process.\n\nExample: calculating a sample mean 10 people are randomly selected from a population and their weights are measured in kilograms as 82.3, 67.3, 68.6, 57.7, 67.3, 60.5, 61.8, 54.5, 73.2 and 85.9 so that 1 / 67.9\n\nwhich is an estimate of \u03bc = population mean weight.\n\nOf course, another random sample selected from this same population and the weights measured for this new group could lead to a different sample mean; say, x = 68.2 kg, as an estimate of the same population mean, \u03bc. One of these sample means is not better than the other, but this does raise the question as to the value of an individual sample mean as an estimate of the population mean when it is so easy to take another sample and obtain a different value for x . To put this into context, the value is derived from the process used to obtain the estimate.\n\nIf this process were repeated a very large number of times, a very long list of sample means could be calculated (Box 4.4). How well a sample mean estimates the population mean can be assessed by examining the characteristics of this long list of sample means. If the mean of all these sample means, that is the mean of the means, is the same as the population mean, then the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean.

Note that the alternative is expressed as H 1 : \u03bc \u2260 80 kg rather than either g \u03bc > 80 or 0 \u03bc < 80. This implies that a two-tailed test is to be done rather than a one-tailed test as would be the case if either of the other two alternatives were used. In general, a two-tailed test should be used for basic epidemiologic applications as the conditions necessary for comfortable use of the one-tailed test in this context are rare.\n\n\u2022 The assumptions: In this case, the assumptions are that a random sample wa s s s selected from a normal distribution. If the sample size is larger than n = 30, a normal distribution is not essential.\n\n\u2022 The -level: Use : = 0.05 unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.

One interpretation is that the sample mean g x = 67.9 kg is so far away from \u03bc = 80 kg that it is difficult to believe that the g true value of the population mean could be 80 kg. That is, the observed outcome with x = 67.9, while certainly possible, is simply too unlikely or rare for the mean for a sample taken from a population with \u03bc = 80 kg.\n\nAn important question deals with the likelihood that the null hypothesis would be rejected if the difference was as large as, say 4.0 kg. That is, what is the likelihood that a difference as large as 4.0 kg would be \"detected\"? This likelihood is called statistical power. Of course, the higher the r power the better, provided costs are reasonable. Power is affected by the sample size (larger being better) and the variance of the individual observations (smaller being better). Further, changing from = 0.05 to 5 = 0.01 reduces the power. 1\n\nClearly, when hypotheses are tested, errors can be made. If the null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, then this error is called the -error, and the likelihood r of this error is established when the -level is set prior to conducting the test. Again, l in general, we use = 0.05 unless we have a compelling 5\n\nreason to do otherwise. On the other side, when the null hypothesis is accepted, an error can also be made and this error is called the \u00df-error. This error is discussed further in the section on sample size.

The only complication is dealing with the censoring, as discussed above. Censoring is a process for dealing with follow-up time, when the event of interest doesn't happen during the overall follow-up period. This is typically due to dropout or other reasons for loss to follow-up, but it may also be due to some of the participants \"surviving\" the complete follow-up time without the event occurring. The follow-up time for an individual participant is said to be censored at, say 15 months, if the person was event-free for 15 months and then was either lost to follow-up or the study ended at that point.\n\nOtherwise, this model is used much like logistic regression, except that it provides estimates for hazard ratios or relative risk rather than for odds ratios. That is, for the independent variable, x 1 = gender, with x 1 = 1 for males and x 1 = 0 for females, then the coefficient \u00df 1 is used in the equation:\n\nBasic biostatistics: concepts and tools\n\nKaplan and Meier solved this problem, which is why these curves carry their name.\n\nTheir solution was to plot the curves with survival time on the horizontal axis rather than calendar time. Then, using follow-up time as a reference, they assumed that the individual who was censored at 15 months survived until the next event, in followup time, occurred. That is, they allowed the individual to \"live\" a little longer, but only as long as the next person to \"die.\""

For example, cigarette smoking is one component of the sufficient cause of lung cancer. Smoking is not sufficient in itself to produce the disease: some people smoke for 50 years without developing lung cancer. Other factors, mostly unknown, are involved and genetic factors may play a role.

Similarly, there are different components in the causation of tuberculosis, but the infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a necessary cause (Figure  5 .1). However, a causal factor on its own is often neither necessary nor sufficient, such as tobacco use as a factor for cerebrovascular disease. The usual approach in epidemiology is to begin with a disease and search for its causes, although it is also possible to start with a potential cause (such as air pollution) and search for its effects. Epidemiology encompasses a whole set of relationships. For example, social class is associated with a range of health problems. Low social class, as measured by income, education, housing and occupation, leads to a general susceptibility to poor health, rather than to a specific effect.  2 A gamut of specific causes of disease could explain why poor people have poor health, among them excessive exposure to infectious agents due to overcrowding, lack of clean water and sanitation, insufficient and unsafe food, and dangerous working conditions.

For example, the predominant view on the cause of cholera in the 1830s involved \"miasma\" rather than contagion. Contagion was not supported by evidence until Snow's work was published; much later, Pasteur and his colleagues identified the causative agent. Lack of plausibility may simply reflect lack of scientific knowledge. Doubts about the therapeutic effects of acupuncture and homeopathy may be partly attributable to the absence of information about a plausible biological mechanism. A recent example of plausibility being the main reason for a conclusion about causality is variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).

These diseases are examples of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which are caused by an infectious agent called a prion. The epidemic in cattle had been caused by feed contaminated with infected carcasses of other cattle, and was finally controlled by banning the use of ruminant proteins as cattle feed.

Systematic review as part of the Cochrane Collaboration is sometimes, but not always, coupled with meta-analysis.  19 Figure  5 .7 illustrates the results of 113 case-control studies and two cohort studies on the relationship between oral clefts in babies and tobacco use among women who smoked during pregnancy. One important reason for the apparent inconsistency of the results is that several of the early studies were based on small samples. The estimated relative risk in each study is marked by a box; the horizontal lines indicate the 95% confidence intervals. For the aggregated data from all the trials, covering a large number of events, the 95% confidence interval is very narrow.

The risk of lung cancer in smokers, compared with nonsmokers, has been shown in various studies to be increased between fourfold and twentyfold. However, associations of such magnitude are rare in epidemiology.\n\nThe fact that an association is weak does not preclude it from being causal; the strength of an association depends on the relative prevalence of other possible causes. For example, weak associations have been found between diet and risk of coronary heart disease in observational studies; and although experimental studies on selected populations have been done, no conclusive results have been published. Despite this lack of evidence, diet is generally thought to be a major causative factor in the high rate of coronary heart disease in many industrialized countries.\n\nThe probable reason for the difficulty in identifying diet as a risk factor for coronary heart disease is that diets in populations are rather homogeneous and variation over time for one individual is greater than that between people. If everyone has more or less the same diet, it is not possible to identify diet as a risk factor. Consequently, ecological evidence gains importance.

When causal relationships have already been established, well-designed ecological studies, particularly time series studies, can be very useful to quantify effects.  27 owever, there are occasions when ecological studies provide good evidence for establishing causation. One such example relates to epidemics of asthma deaths. In 1968 the sale of inhaled bronchodilators without prescription in England and Wales was stopped because the increase in asthma deaths in the period 1959-66 had been shown to coincide with a rise in bronchodilator sales. After the availability of inhaled bronchodilators was restricted, the death rate fell. A similar pattern was observed following restrictions on the availability of the inhaled bronchodilator fenoterol in New Zealand in 1989.  28 dging the evidence Regrettably, there are no completely reliable criteria for determining whether an association is causal or not. Causal inference is usually tentative and judgements must be made on the basis of the available evidence: uncertainty always remains. Evidence is often conflicting and due weight must be given to the different types when decisions are made. In judging the different aspects of causation referred to above, the correct temporal relationship is essential; once that has been established, the greatest weight may be given to plausibility, consistency and the dose-response relationship. The likelihood of a causal association is heightened when many different types of evidence lead to the same conclusion.\n\nEvidence from well-designed studies is particularly important, especially if they are conducted in a variety of locations. The most important use of information about causation of diseases and injuries may be in the area of prevention, which we will discuss in the following chapters. When the causal pathways are established on the basis of quantitative information from epidemiological studies, the decisions about prevention may be uncontroversial. In situations where the causation is not so well established, but the impacts have great potential public health importance, the \"precautionary principle\" 29 may be applied to take preventive action as a safety measure; this is called \"precautionary prevention\"."

There have also been improvements in cardiovascular mortality rates in middle-income countries, such as Poland. These gains have been the result of a wide range of measures directed at both whole populations and individuals. The preventive potential for chronic diseases is enormous. (Box 6.1).

Yet even the healthiest person will succumb at some age, and the lifetime mortality risk for any population is 100%. However, most populations are affected by specific diseases which can be prevented. Studies of migrants show that they often develop the patterns of disease of host populations. For example, the rates of gastric cancer in people born in Hawaii to Japanese parents are lower than those of people born in Japan. After two generations in the USA, people of Japanese heritage have the same gastric cancer rate as the US population in general. The fact that it takes a generation or more for the rates to fall suggests the importance of an exposure -such as diet -in early life.\n\nGeographical variation in disease occurrence within and between countries also provides important clues to preventive potential (Figure  6 .3). In the United Kingdom age-standardized male lung cancer rates fell from 18 per 100 000 in 1950 Box 6.1. Chronic disease epidemiology: the basis of prevention Chronic diseases are the major cause of death in almost all countries and account for 36 million deaths each year (see Figure  7 .1). This translates to 61% of the world's deaths and 48% of the global burden of disease. 3 20% of chronic noncommunicable disease deaths occur in high-income countries, and 80% occur in low-and middle-income countries -where most of the world's population live.\n\nThe leading chronic diseases are:\n\n\u2022 cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease and stroke (17.5 million deaths);\n\n\u2022 cancer (7.5 million deaths);\n\n\u2022 chronic respiratory disease (4 million deaths); and\n\n\u2022 diabetes (1.1 million deaths).\n\nRegional estimates indicate that chronic diseases are more frequent causes of death than communicable diseases worldwide, with the exception of the African region. Injuries -accounting for almost one in ten deaths -feature prominently in all regions, caused mostly by traffic crashes, occupational injuries and interpersonal violence. The burden of injuries is increasing in most low-and middle-income countries.\n\nMental health problems are leading contributors to the burden of disease in many countries and contribute significantly to the incidence and severity of many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Visual impairment and blindness, hearing impairment and deafness, oral diseases and genetic disorders are other chronic conditions that account for a substantial portion of the global burden of disease.\n\nWithout greater attention to prevention, it has been estimated that by 2030 myocardial infarct, stroke and diabetes will account for four in ten deaths among adults (35-64 years) in low-and middle-income countries, compared with one in eight deaths in the same age group in the United States of America and other high-income countries.  4 Projections suggest that over the next 10 years deaths due to chronic noncommunicable diseases will increase by 17%. This means that of the projected 64 million people who will die in 2015, 41 million will die of a chronic disease. However, large-scale prevention is feasible, as the causes of the major chronic diseases are known and are the same in all regions and population sub groups.

In contrast, over the same period of time in France, male lung cancer rates increased. In France, the increase in tobacco use occurred some decades later than in the United Kingdom, and smoking rates started to decrease only after 1990.

Where this cause was largely absent -as in China and Japan -coronary heart disease remained a rare cause of mortality and morbidity, despite the high frequencies of other important risk factors such as cigarette smoking and high blood pressure. However, smoking-induced lung cancer is on the increase and strokes induced by high blood pressure are common in China and Japan. In some middle-income countries, cardiovascular disease is becoming important in the urban middle-and upper-income groups, who have already acquired high-risk behaviour. As socioeconomic development occurs, such risk factors can be expected to become Socioeconomic, cultural, political & environmental factors Including: -Globalization -Urbanization -Population ageing Common modifiable risk factors -Tobacco use -Unhealthy diet -Physical inactivity Non-modifiable risk factors -Age -Sex -Heredity Intermediate risk factors -Raised blood pressure -Raised blood glucose -Abnormal blood lipids -Overweight/obesity Main chronic diseases -Heart disease -Stroke -Cancer -Diabetes -Chronic respiratory diseases -Alcohol abuse\n\nEpidemiology and prevention: chronic noncommunicable diseases more widespread. The aim of primordial prevention (Box 6.3) is to avoid the emergence and establishment of the social, economic and cultural patterns of living that are known to contribute to an elevated risk of disease. The importance of primordial prevention is often realized too late. All countries need to avoid the spread of unhealthy lifestyles and consumption patterns. Primordial prevention of chronic disease should include national policies and programmes on nutrition. Such programmes need to involve the agricultural sector, the food industry and the food import/export sector. Countries also need programmes to promote regular physical activity. The example of tobacco use indicates that a high level of government commitment is required for effective primordial prevention. There is good evidence that tobacco consumption can be reduced by taxation and increased prices (Figure  6 .5). The epidemiological evidence showing the harmful effects of tobacco use ultimately led to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in February 2006, the first health treaty adopted by the Member States of the World Health Organization (see Chapter 10)."

The major advantage of the population strategy is that one does not have to identify the high-risk group but simply aim to reduce -by a small amountthe level of a given risk factor in the entire population. Its main disadvantage is that it offers little benefit to many individuals because their absolute risks of disease are quite low. For example, most people will wear a seat-belt while driving a car for their entire life without being involved in a crash. The widespread wearing of seat-belts has been very beneficial to the population as a whole, but little apparent benefit is accrued by those individuals who are never personally involved in a crash. This phenomenon has been called the prevention paradox.  18 he high incidence of cardiovascular disease in most industrialized countries is due to the high levels of risk factors in the population as a whole, not to the problems to the right. Only a small minority of the population have a serum cholesterol level above 8 mmol/l, i.e. a very high risk of coronary heart disease. Most of the deaths attributable to coronary heart disease occur in the middle range of the cholesterol level, where most of the population is. In this case, primary prevention depends on changes that reduce the average risk in the whole population, thus shifting the whole distribution to a lower level. Figure  6 .7 compares the distribution of total cholesterol in three populations with different means. There is little overlap between people with high cholesterol levels in population A and population C. People with high cholesterol in population A would be considered to have low levels in population C.\n\nThese data come from the WHO MONICA (MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease) Project, which comprised population surveys done at least twice in a decade in 38 geographically defined populations in 21 countries.  12, 20   e figure also illustrates the principle that any cut-off point for determining prevalence is arbitrary, but shifting the population mean by a small amount has a large impact.

However, if people with established disease are included in this highrisk group, the strategy will contribute more to the overall reduction in the burden of disease (Box 6.4). The main disadvantage of the high-risk-individual strategy is that it usually requires a screening programme to identify the high-risk group, something that is often difficult and costly. Table  6 .2 lists the advantages and disadvantages of the two strategies.\n\nCombining the population strategy and a high-risk strategy is useful in many situations. Table  6 .3 compares both approaches to the prevention of diabetes and obesity. The high-risk strategy is also more relevant when focused on individuals at high overall risk rather than those at high risk in terms of a single risk factor. For example, decisions Box 6.4. High-risk strategy: smoking cessation Smoking cessation programmes provide an excellent example of a high-risk strategy and are appropriate since most smokers wish to abandon the habit; thus individual smokers and the physicians concerned are usually strongly motivated. The benefits of intervention directed at high-risk individuals are likely to outweigh any adverse effects, such as the short-term effects of nicotine withdrawal. If the high-risk strategy is successful, it also benefits nonsmokers by reducing their passive smoking. Such programmes are more likely to be effective when complemented by population approaches to tobacco control.\n\nEpidemiology and prevention: chronic noncommunicable diseases about clinical treatment for individuals with high blood pressure or cholesterol need to account for other factors such as age, sex, tobacco use or diabetes.

Other studies have since supported the value of such screening programmes, which are now widely applied in many -but not all -countries.

Screening tests do not usually establish a diagnosis, but rather the presence or absence of an identified risk factor, and thus require individual follow-up and treatment. As the recipients of screening are usually people who have no illness it is important that the screening test itself is very unlikely to cause harm.  26 Screening can also be used to identify high exposure to risk factors. For instance, children's blood samples can be screened for lead in areas of high use of lead in paint."

The health effect that is prevented may be minor (nausea or headache), but screening may be a high priority if the effect reduces the patient's ability to work. Many health effects from exposure to environmental hazards are graded, and preventing a minor effect may also prevent more serious effects. Targeted screening can be legally required -for example, in miners or people working with lead or chromium -and used in the follow-up to environmental pollution incidents, such as methyl-mercury poisoning (Minamata disease) in Japan in the 1960s (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 9). Above all, the disease should be one that would prove serious if not diagnosed early; inborn metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria meet this criterion, as do some cancers, such as cancer of the cervix.\n\nIn addition, several issues need to be addressed before establishing a screening programme."

If children with phenylketonuria are identified at birth, they can be given a special diet that will allow them to develop normally. If they are not given the diet, they become mentally retarded and require special care throughout life.

We determine this balance by an arbitrary cut-off point between normal and abnormal. If we want to increase sensitivity and to include all true positives, we are obliged to increase the number of false positives, which means decreasing specificity. Reducing the strictness of the criteria for a positive test can increase sensitivity, but by doing this the test's specificity is reduced. Likewise, increasing the strictness of the criteria increases specificity but decreases sensitivity. We also need to account for predictive value when interpreting the results of screening tests. Decisions on the appropriate criteria for a screening test depend on the consequences of identifying false negatives and false positives. For a serious condition in newborn children, it might be preferable to have high sensitivity and to accept the increased cost of a high number of false positives (reduced specificity).

Infectious agents may be transmitted to humans either: directly, from other infected humans or animals, or indirectly, through vectors, airborne particles or vehicles.\n\nVectors are insects or other animals that carry the infectious agent from person to person. Vehicles are contaminated objects or elements of the environment (such as clothes, cutlery, water, milk, food, blood, plasma, parenteral solutions or surgical instruments). Contagious diseases are those that can be spread (contagious literally means \"by touch\") between humans without an intervening vector or vehicle. Malaria is therefore a communicable but not a contagious disease, while measles and syphilis are both communicable and contagious. Some pathogens cause disease not only through infection but through the toxic effect of chemical compounds that these produce.\n\nFor example, Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria that can infect humans directly, but staphylococcal food poisoning is caused by ingestion of food contaminated with a toxin that the bacteria produces."

When describing an epidemic, the time period, geographical region and particulars of the population in which the cases occur must be specified.\n\nThe number of cases needed to define an epidemic varies according to the agent, the size, type and susceptibility of population exposed, and the time and place of occurrence. The identification of an epidemic also depends on the usual frequency of the disease in the area among the specified population during the same season of the year. A very small number of cases of a disease not previously recognized in an area, but associated in time and place, may be sufficient to constitute an epidemic. For example, the first report on the syndrome that became known as AIDS concerned only four cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in young homosexual men.  3  Previ- ously this disease had been seen only in patients with compromised immune systems. The rapid development of the epidemic of Kaposi sarcoma, another manifestation of AIDS, in New York is shown in Figure  7 .3: 2 cases occurred in 1977 and 1978 and by 1982 there were 88 cases.  4 he dynamic of an epidemic is determined by the characteristics of its agent and its pattern of transmission, and by the susceptibility of its human hosts. The three main groups of pathogenic agents act very differently in this respect. A limited number of bacteria, viruses and parasites cause most epidemics, and a thorough understanding of their biology has improved specific prevention measures. Vaccines, the most effective means of preventing infectious diseases, have been developed so far only for some viral and bacterial diseases. If the attempt to make a malaria vaccine is successful, this will be the first vaccine for a parasitic disease. Vaccines work on both an individual basis, by preventing or attenuating clinical disease in a person exposed to the pathogen, and also on a population basis, by affecting herd immunity (Figure  7 .4).\n\nIn a point-source epidemic, susceptible individuals are exposed more or less simultaneously to one source of infection. This results in a very rapid increase in the number of cases, often in a few hours. The cholera epidemic (a bacterial disease) Cardiovascular diseases 10% Cancer 5% Injuries 13% Other chronic diseases, including mental disorders 28% Diabetes 1%  In A, all individuals were susceptible, and all were affected. In B, only one individual was immune, yet four were protected, even though three of them were susceptible.  5 B\n\nIn a contagious, or propagated, epidemic the disease is passed from person to person and the initial rise in the number of cases is slower. The number of susceptible individuals and the potential sources of infection are the critical factors in determining the spread of disease. For example, SARS was first recognized as a global threat in March 2003. It spread rapidly to 26 countries, affecting adult men and women, with a fifth of all cases occurring among health-care workers (see Chapter 1).

The viral haemorrhagic fevers include: Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo, yellow fever, West Nile and dengue. Other problematic viruses include poliomyelitis, the SARS coronavirus and influenza A. A small epidemic of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans followed an epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. Among the bacterial diseases, anthrax, cholera, typhoid, plague, borelliosis, brucellosis and Buruli ulcer are proving difficult to control. Malaria leads the parasitic diseases in terms of burden, but trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis and dracunculiasis are also defying eradication efforts. These threats to human health in the 21 st century require international coordination for effective surveillance and response (Box 7.2). While some of these emerging diseases appear to be genuinely new, others, such as viral haemorrhagic fever, may have existed for centuries yet were recognized only recently because ecological or other environmental changes have increased the risk of human infection, or the ability to detect such infection has improved. This is called ascertainment bias, and is difficult to quantify. Changes in hosts, agents and environmental conditions are thought to be responsible for epidemics like the ones of diphtheria, syphilis and gonorrhea in the early 1990s in the newly independent states of eastern Europe.\n\nInfluenza pandemics arise when a novel influenza virus emerges, infects humans and spreads efficiently among them. The virus of most recent concern is the H5NI strain of influenza A (Box 7.4), one of many viruses that usually infect poultry and migratory birds. Severe influenza pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968 caused the deaths of tens of millions of people; for example, between 40 million and 50 million people died in the 1918 pandemic."

However, this is not always necessary; it may be possible to control a disease with only a limited knowledge of its specific chain of infection.

The incubation period in humans is 2-8 days. The virus causes a high fever leading to pneumonia which does not respond to antibiotics. This virus theoretically has the potential of evolving to a form that can be spread easily between people.  15 The main strategy for addressing a potential human pandemic is to contain outbreaks in poultry as well as in humans, prevent the spread of the H5NI virus to new countries and reduce the opportunities for human infections.

The spectrum of this reaction ranges from no apparent signs or symptoms to severe clinical illness, with all possible variations between these two extremes. The incubation period-the time between entry of the infectious agent and the appearance of the first sign or symptom of the disease-varies from a few hours (staphylococcal food poisoning) to years (AIDS).\n\nThe consequences of infection are largely determined by the host's resistance. Such resistance is usually acquired through previous exposure to or immunization against the agent in question. Immunization (or vaccination) is the protection of susceptible individuals from communicable disease by the administration of a vaccine, which can be: a living modified infectious agent (as for measles) inactivated organisms (as for pertussis) an inactive toxin (as for tetanus) bacterial polysaccharides.\n\nAntibodies -which are formed as part of the natural immune response to pathogenscan be pooled from blood donations and given as post-exposure prophylaxis for a few diseases (such as rabies, diphtheria, varicella-zoster and hepatitis B) to people that have not been adequately immunized.

The public health action required in emergencies caused by epidemics of different diseases has been described in detail.  16 ontrol measures can be directed against the source and spread of infection and towards protecting people exposed to it. Usually all of these approaches are required. In some cases, however, removing the source of infection may be all that is necessary, as when a contaminated food is withdrawn from sale. An essential component of control measures is to inform health professionals and the public of the likely causes, the risk of contracting the disease and the essential control steps. This is particularly important if exposed people need to be protected through immunization, for example in containing an outbreak of measles (Box 7.5)\n\nOnce control measures have been implemented, surveillance must continue to ensure their acceptability and effectiveness. This may be relatively easy in short-term epidemics but difficult when dealing with longer-term epidemics. For example, epidemic meningococcal meningitis requires large-scale immunization programmes. Follow-up epidemiological and laboratory studies are often indicated, particularly to establish long-term cost-effectiveness.\n\nManagement and control efforts in the HIV epidemic have had some effect. Since the first cases were identified, a key approach to primary prevention has been promoting the use of condoms for prevention of HIV transmission. Likewise, needle exchange programs for intravenous drug users have been used successfully to limit the spread of HIV and hepatitis B virus. Education programs to make people aware of how HIV is transmitted and what they can do to prevent its spread are an essential part of primary prevention.\n\nThe HIV epidemic may have peaked in some African countries and in India. Incidence (new infections) of HIV apparently peaked in Kenya in the early to mid-1990s.  18 ecause of the latency between HIV infection and death, prevalence continued to rise as incidence fell, peaking around 1997 when mortality rose to match incidence. HIV prevalence (the rate of existing infections) has also declined in south India. This reversal in trends can be partly attributed to intervention efforts that aim to decrease the number of concurrent sexual partners and increase effective use of condoms."

Moreover, treatment is usually done under supervision, so there is a great deal of information about treatment outcomes. Some of this information remains as raw data; other important data are not compiled centrally.

The aim of clinical epidemiology is to aid decision-making about identified cases of disease. Clinical epidemiology -which includes the methods used by clinicians to audit the processes and outcomes of their work -is a basic medical science.\n\nBecause epidemiology deals with populations and clinical medicine deals with individuals, it has been suggested that clinical epidemiology is a contradiction in terms. However, clinical epidemiology is simply concerned with a defined patient population rather than the usual community-based population.\n\nThe central concerns of clinical epidemiology are:\n\ndefinitions of normality and abnormality accuracy of diagnostic tests natural history and prognosis of disease effectiveness of treatment and prevention in clinical practice."

Regrettably, this is rarely the case, except in genetic disorders determined by a single dominant gene. Measurements of health-related variables can be expressed as frequency distributions in the population of patients. Occasionally the frequency distributions for abnormal and normal measurements are quite different, but more often there is only one distribution and the so-called abnormal people are at the tail end of the normal distribution (see Chapter 4). There are three ways of distinguishing results in such a distribution: normal as common abnormal as associated with disease abnormal as treatable."

We assume that an arbitrary cut-off point on the frequency distribution (often two standard deviations above or below the mean) is the limit of normality and consider all values beyond this point abnormal. This is called an operational definition of abnormality. If the distribution is in fact Gaussian (normal in the statistical sense), we would identify 2.5% of the population as abnormal by using this cut-off. An alternative approach, which does not assume a statistically normal distribution, is to use percentiles: we can consider that the 95th percentile point is the dividing line between normal and abnormally high values, thus classifying 5% of the population as abnormal (see Chapter 4). However, there is no biological basis for using an arbitrary cut-off point as a definition of abnormality for most variables. For example, there is a continuous association between systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (Figure  8 .1).\n\nEven within the normal ranges, as determined statistically, there is an increased risk of disease compared with lower levels. Risk is a graded process; there is no cutoff point at which risk suddenly begins to increase.

Choosing a cut-off point that neatly separates cases from non-cases is clearly impossible (see Figure  6 .7).\n\nThere are always some healthy people on the abnormal side of the cut-off point, and some true cases on the normal side. These two types of classification error can be expressed quantitatively in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of a test, as discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nSensitivity is the proportion of truly diseased people who are categorized as abnormal by the test.

Unfortunately, many treatment decisions have to be made in the absence of such evidence.\n\nThe treatment of high blood pressure is a good example -early clinical trials provided firm evidence that treating very high diastolic blood pressure (\u2265 120mmHg) was beneficial. Subsequent trials have indicated that the benefits of treatment outweigh the problems at lower levels of diastolic pressure, perhaps as low as 90mmHg.\n\nHowever, such trials are usually not designed to account for other risk factors or the cost of treatment. More sophisticated cost-effectiveness studies may make it possible to factor the economic consequences of treatment into clinical decisions. We could then determine blood pressure levels at which treatment makes economic as well as medical sense for men and women in specific groups at risk. Treating a young woman with a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg, who is at low overall risk of cardiovascular disease, will be much less cost-effective than treating an older man with a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg, who has a much greater risk of cardiovascular disease. However, if the treatment of the young woman has no negative side-effects for her except the cost, she may choose to pay for the treatment herself.  2  What is considered to be worth treating changes with time; Figure  8 .2 shows the changing definition of treatable levels of blood pressure. As clinical trials gather new evidence, treatment recommendations tend to change. Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 1955 Pharmacological therapy introduced 70 Year 1965 1975 1985 75 80 85 90 95 100 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 Veterans' Administration trials Australian trial US trial (HDFP) MRC trial\n\nHowever, each time that a new cut-off point is proposed, we need to consider the logistic and cost implications. For example, if we take an evidence-based approach to treating people with mildly elevated blood pressure, we should be more concerned with assessing patients' absolute (or baseline) risk of cardiovascular disease, and place less emphasis on their actual blood pressure.  3 Such risk prediction can help clinicians communicate with patients (Box 8.1)."

Risk prediction charts can be used to account for multiple risk factors  4  . For example, a 5-year cardiovascular disease risk -of fatal or non-fatal events -is determined largely by a person's sex, age, diabetic status, smoking history, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. An individual's overall cardiovascular risk can be computed from a risk prediction chart. See  http://  www.nzgg.org.nz/guidelines/CVD_Risk_Chart.pdf  for an example.\n\nIn two of these combinations the test has given correct answers (true positive and true negative), and in the other two situations it has given wrong answers (false positive and false negative). We can only use these categories when there is an absolutely accurate method of determining the presence or absence of disease, against which we can determine the accuracy of other tests. Rarely is such a method available, particularly where chronic noncommunicable diseases are concerned. For this reason, and because wholly accurate tests are likely to be expensive and invasive, simpler and cheaper tests are used in routine clinical practice. Even then, we still need to know and account for the validity, accuracy and precision of these tests when interpreting the results.\n\nTo determine the practical utility of a given test, we need to know more about how it performs. A test's positive and negative predictive value are particularly important. The positive predictive value is the probability of disease in a patient with an abnormal test result, while the negative predictive value is the probability of a patient not having a disease when the test result is negative.\n\nPredictive value depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test and, most importantly, on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. Even with a high sensitivity and high specificity (Chapter 6), if the prevalence is low the positive predictive value of a test may be very low. The predictive values of a test in clinical practice depend critically on the prevalence of the abnormality in the patients being tested; this may well differ from the prevalence in a published study on the usefulness of the test.  5"

Clinical experience alone is inadequate for this purpose, since it is often based on a limited set of patients and inadequate followup. For example, patients who are seen by a doctor are not necessarily representative of all patients with a particular disease. Patients may be selected according to severity or other features of their disease, or by demographic, social or personal characteristics of the patients themselves. Furthermore, since many doctors do not systematically follow their patients, they have a limited, and often pessimistic, view of the prognosis of disease.

Specific treatments need be shown to do more good than harm among patients who actually use them: this is called efficacy. Treatments should also do more good than harm in all patients to whom they are offered: as not everyone will actually take what they have been prescribed, it is important to factor in the consequences of not having taken the treatment in question (Box 8.2).\n\nIn studies of efficacy it is advantageous to include only patients who are likely to be compliant. Compliance is the extent to which patients follow medical advice.\n\nPractical effectiveness is determined by studying outcomes in a group of people offered treatment, only some of whom will be compliant. The best method for measuring efficacy and effectiveness is by randomized controlled trial, as described in Chapter 3. However, there are many situations in which such trials cannot be done, and only a small proportion of current medical interventions have been assessed by such trials. The growing number of well-designed trials make it possible for clinical guidelines to be based on the best available evidence (Box 8.3). Costs are often incorporated into the development of such guidelines. The benefits of aspirin for patients with existing cardiovascular disease are well established, but the role of aspirin is less clear in primary prevention, especially in women.

However, a meta-analysis of six relevant randomized controlled trials, which involved 51 342 women (and 44 114 men) with a low risk of a cardiovascular event who were followed up over an average of 6.4 years, found that there was no significant effect on either coronary heart disease or cardiovascular mortality, although the risk of stroke was reduced by 17% (odds ratio:0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.97).

In addition, we exist in a social and cultural environment, which is of great importance for our mental and physical health. Most diseases are either caused or influenced by environmental factors. We need to understand the ways in which specific environmental factors can interfere with health to design effective prevention programmes. Environmental epidemiology provides a scientific basis for studying and interpreting the relationships between the environment and population health. Occupational epidemiology deals specifically with environmental factors in the workplace. Physical injuries are strongly dependent on factors in the living or working environment but are also strongly determined by behavioural factors. In common language the word \"accident\" is often applied to the events that precede an injury, but it can be misleading as the word accident implies a random event rather than a combination of predictable causal factors. In this chapter we shall use the term \"environment\" as a broad term for all factors external to the body that may cause disease or injury. The different environmental factors that influence health are shown in Table  9 .1.  1 he environmental and occupational health field includes a large number of specific and proximate causal factors using the concepts described for hierarchies of causes described in Chapter 5. The more distal risk factors can be analysed using the DPSEEA framework as in Figure  5 .5 for transport and health.

It should be remembered, however, that there are many ways in which environmental factors can influence each other's effects. Multi-causality and a clear hierarchy of causes (see Chapter 5) are often evident; this may explain differences between the results of observational epidemiological studies conducted in different places. How an environmental factor affects an individual also depends on other risk factor exposures and individual characteristics, such as:\n\nOccupational epidemiology is usually concerned with an adult population that is young or middle-aged, and often predominantly male. Furthermore, in occupational epidemiology most exposed persons are relatively healthy, at least when they start working.\n\nTable 9.1.

This is of great importance when the results of occupational epidemiology studies are used to establish safety standards for specific environmental hazards. For instance, the effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than in adults (Table  9 .2). Lead in blood is an accepted way of measuring exposure and the levels listed for the two different health outcomes are those that would most likely protect most of a population from outcomes. The level at which neurobehavioural function changes start occurring in children may be even lower than the 100 ug/l mentioned in the table.  4"

The concepts of exposure and dose are therefore particularly important in environmental and occupational epidemiology. Exposure has two dimensions: level and duration. For environmental factors that cause acute effects more or less immediately after exposure starts, the current exposure level determines whether effects occur (for instance, the \"London smog epidemic\" of deaths from lung and heart disease, as shown in Figure  9 .2, is one of the world's first major environmental disease outbreaks that was documented in detail).\n\nHowever, many environmental factors produce effects only after a long period of exposure. This is true of chemicals that accumulate in the body (for instance, 0 Deaths (per day) Days 5 750 500 250 0 10 15 0 SO 2 ppm Smoke mg/m 3 0.75 0.5 0.25 3.0 2.0 1.0 SO 2 smoke deaths Pollution concentration Box 9.2.

For these hazards, the past exposure levels and the exposure duration are more important than the current exposure level. The total exposure (or external dose) needs to be estimated. It is often approximated as the product of exposure duration and exposure level.\n\nIn epidemiological studies, all kinds of estimates of exposure and dose have been used to quantify the relationship between an environmental factor and the health status of a population. For example, in Figure  1 .1, the exposure is expressed in terms of exposure level only (number of cigarettes smoked per day). Table  5 .2 shows the combined effect of duration and exposure level on noise-induced hearing loss. The external dose can also be expressed as one combined measure, as with pack-years for cigarette smoking and fibre-years (or particle-years) for asbestos exposure in the workplace (Figure  9 .3). Sometimes a proxy measure of exposure is used, such as the traffic flow per hour in a particular place or the petrol consumption per year as indicators of air pollution exposure. These variables could also be considered as \"pressure\" indicators in the causal hierarchy (Chapter 5). Other examples would be the use of pesticides in an area or the number of children living in houses painted with lead-containing paint. 13 1 4 2000 3000 Relative risk Exposure (10 6 particles per cubic foot x years) 1000 3 2 F it t e d li n e"

The distributions of individual doses of environmental chemicals are often skewed and conform to a log-normal frequency distribution more closely than to a normal distribution. Ideally, the shape of the dose distribution should be tested in every epidemiological study where quantitative dose measurements are carried out. If the distributions are found to be log-normal, group comparisons should be carried out with geometric rather than arithmetic means and standard deviations.\n\nAnother way is to use quantiles or percentiles (see Chapter 4). For instance, in assessing whether the dose of lead in a group of children is of concern, the average may be of less interest than the proportion with individual doses above a certain threshold. If a blood lead level of 100\u03bcg/l is the threshold of concern for effects of lead on the brain, then information about the mean level in a group (e.g. 70 \u03bcg/l) gives no indication of how many children could be affected.

Differences in the average IQ between groups are often very small and the subgroups of special concern consist of children with particularly low IQs. However, a small drop in mean full-scale IQ from 107 to 102 in the classic study by Needleman et al.  16  as shown in Table  9 .4, can produce a large increase in the proportion of children with an IQ below 70 (from 0.6% to 2%), the threshold for mental retardation in children."

Whether the dose commitment refers to 100 people each with a dose of 0.5Sv or 10 000 people each with a dose of 5mSv, the result is one case of fatal cancer. This calculation is based on the fundamental assumptions that there is no threshold individual dose below which the cancer risk is zero and that the cancer risk increases linearly with dose. However, the dose variation within the group may be large and the people with the highest dose obviously have a higher individual cancer risk due to this environmental exposure."

      "title": "Dose-effect relationships",
      "text": "For many environmental factors, effects range from subtle physiological or biochemical changes to severe illness or death, as explained in Chapter 2. Usually, the higher the dose, the more severe or intense the effect. This relationship between dose and severity of effect in the individual is called the dose-effect relationship (Figure  9 .5), which can be established for an individual or a group (the average dose at which each effect occurs). At a low carbon monoxide (CO) dose (measured as carboxyhaemoglobin in blood) a slight headache would be the only effect, but as the dose increases, the effects of CO become more severe as this figure shows. Not all individuals react in the same way to a given environmental exposure, so the dose-effect relationship for an individual differs from the group value.\n\nThe dose-effect relationship provides valuable information for the planning of epidemiological studies. Some effects may be easier to measure than others, and some may be of particular significance for public health. Measurements of changes in the blood or urine, so-called biomarkers, may be used to study some early subtle effects as well as the exposure. In the case of cadmium, for instance, the level of low molecular weight proteins in the urine is a good biomarker of the earliest effects on the kidney.  15 The dose-effect relationship helps the investigator choose the appropriate effect to study.\n\nTable 9.4.

If a safety standard is set at a level where the less severe effects are prevented, the more severe effects are also likely to be prevented, because they occur at higher doses."

Theoretically the shape of the dose-response relationship should look like an S or like a cumulative normal distribution. Many examples of doseresponse relationships with this shape have been found in environmental and occupational epidemiology studies. At low doses almost nobody suffers the effect, and at a high level almost everybody does. This reflects the variation in individual sensitivity to the factor studied.\n\nThe dose-response relationship can, in some cases, be approximated to a straight-line relationship, particularly when only a narrow range of low responses is involved. This approach has been used, for instance, in the study of lung cancer risk and asbestos dose (Figure  9 .3) or tobacco smoking dose (Figure  1 .1). The doseresponse relationship can be modified by factors such as age. This has been found, for example, for hearing loss caused by loud noise,  17  one of the most common health effects in the workplace, where a strong dose-response relationship can be demonstrated (Table  5 .2).

These procedures have become legal requirements in many countries. The health component of these environmental assessments has been labelled environmental health impact assessment and is an important application of epidemiological analysis in environmental health. Such assessment is also used to predict potential health problems in the use of new chemicals or technologies. There are several steps to assist in an overall environmental risk assessment:\n\n\u2022 Identify which environmental health hazard may be created by the technology or project under study. Are there chemical hazards? If so, which specific chemicals are involved? Are there biological hazards? (see Table  9 .1). \u2022 Analyse the type of health effect that each hazard may cause (hazard assessment). The information can be collected in systematic reviews of the scientific literature (in the same manner as a Cochrane review of treatments for specific diseases, as outlined in (Chapter 3) for each hazard or by referring to international hazard assessments, such as the Environmental Health Criteria Series or the Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents published by WHO, the Monograph Series published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and, if necessary, complementing this information with epidemiological studies of people exposed to the hazards in question.\n\n\u2022 Measure or estimate the actual exposure levels for the people potentially affected, including the general population and the workforce. The human exposure assessment should take into account environmental monitoring, biological monitoring and relevant information about history of exposure and changes over time. \u2022 Combine the exposure data for subgroups of the exposed population with the dose-effect and dose-response relationships for each hazard to calculate the likely health risk in this population.\n\nEpidemiological studies can also be used to measure health risk directly. The risk could be presented as potential increase in relative risk of certain health effects or the calculated increase in the number of cases of certain diseases or symptoms (Box 9.3).\n\nA recent development in health impact assessments is to use burden of disease estimates in the assessments. Tools for this have been developed by WHO in the Environmental Burden of Disease document series.  21 The three key steps in risk management assessment are:\n\n\u2022 First, estimate the health risk to be evaluated in relation to a predetermined \"acceptable risk\" or in relation to other health risks in the same community. Maximum exposure limits, public health targets or other policy instruments for health protection are often used in this process. The fundamental question is: is it necessary to take preventive action because the estimated health risk is too high? \u2022 If it is decided that preventive action is needed, the next step in risk management is to reduce exposure. This may involve changing the technology to eliminate hazards, installing equipment to control pollution or moving proposed hazardous projects. \u2022 Finally, risk management also involves monitoring of exposure and health risks after the selected controls have been put into place. It is important to ensure that the intended protection is achieved and that any additional protective measures are taken without delay. In this phase of risk management, human exposure assessments and epidemiological surveys play an important role. One example of a health impact assessment that has had major impact on environmental health policy is the assessment of the impact of traffic-related air pollution in Europe.  19 ased on air monitoring data, estimates of the number of people exposed and doseresponse relationships from epidemiological studies, investigators calculated the likely number of deaths due to this type of air pollution (Table  9 .5). It was striking that the This study inspired a series of policies to control traffic-related air pollution in Europe.\n\nA similar analysis was done for New Zealand 20 with a lower ratio for air pollution deaths\n\nTable 9.5.

Air, water and soil pollution are generally related to sources with defined geographic locations. Mapping of environmental levels or exposures can therefore be useful tools in epidemiological studies.\n\nEnvironmental epidemiology studies often require approximations and modeling for quantification of exposures, because individual exposure measurements are very difficult to assemble. Air quality modeling combined with geographical information system (GIS) analysis has been used in several air pollution health effect studies. One example of exposure assessment is the number of days when nitrogen dioxide concentrations exceed different cut-off points, and the number of people exposed in different parts of a city based on census data."

WHO has developed a series of water quality guidelines,  25, 26  air quality guidelines  27  and health-based maximum occupational exposure limits 28 using this approach. In response to the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, guidelines were also developed for judging the radioactive contamination of food.  29 For many environmental factors, the available data are insufficient to permit a standard to be set with any accuracy, and informed guesses or practical experience become the basis of the safety standard.

Because many environmental and occupational hazard situations are related to economic activities where costconsciousness is high, preventive action in this area is often controversial. Epidemiology can provide a foundation for evidence-based health and environment policy.\n\nControversy surrounds environmental issues such as climate change -where only limited epidemiological evidence has accumulated -but action to prevent future health damage needs to be taken now.

To date, epidemiology has not fulfilled its potential in this respect, and there are only a few areas in which epidemiological research has been fully applied. However, the importance of epidemiology in policy-making is recognized (see Box 10.1).\n\nThe influence of epidemiology is often mediated by public opinion. Policy-makers in many countries respond to public opinion rather than leading it. The growth in media attention given to epidemiological research has increased public awareness of the subject. Epidemiology is often an important factor influencing public policy but is rarely the only influence.\n\nA major difficulty in applying epidemiology to public policy is the necessity for making judgements about the cause of a disease and decisions on what to do when the evidence is incomplete. Some epidemiologists believe their role should be limited to epidemiological research, while others consider they should be directly involved in the application of the results to public policy. This difference reflects personal, social and cultural preferences. If a health issue is controversial -and most are -epidemiologists who are involved in the public policy arena may be accused of Box 10.1. Success factors in policy formulation  2  Successful policy formulation necessitates: a high-level political mandate to develop a national policy framework; a core group of scientists who estimate health needs, advocate for action, and develop a national policy and plan; international collaboration providing political and technical support; wide consultation when drafting, reviewing, and re-drafting the policy until it is endorsed; awareness that the process of consultation may be as important as the content in generating support and ownership; development and implementation of a consistent communication strategy for all stages of the process; clarity of vision on a small set of outcome-oriented objectives.\n\none-sidedness. However, the alternative is potentially neglecting the public health implications of epidemiological research.\n\nWhen applying epidemiology to public policy in a given country, difficult decisions have to be made about the relevance of research done elsewhere. It is usually impossible -and probably unnecessary -for major studies to be repeated. However, local evidence is often required before local decision-makers accept the arguments for policy change or costly interventions. The local evidence produces a \"body count,\" which can create the impetus for preventive actions."

Changes in either parameter are reflected in a standard way which can be used to track changes over time (Chapter 2).\n\nAlmost all policies affect health. Policy decisions by a wide range of agenciesboth governmental and nongovernmental -have a significant impact on health. Concern for health and equity is needed in all areas of public policy, as: agricultural policies influence the availability, price and quality of meat and dairy products; advertising and fiscal policies influence the price and availability of cigarettes or healthy foods such as fruit; and, transport policies influence the extent of urban air pollution and the risk of This broad social policy approach contrasts with much health policy, which has been directed predominantly towards individuals or groups and has paid little attention to action at the population level.\n\nThe Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1985) -claims that health is influenced by a wide range of policy decisions.  4 The Charter made it clear that health policy is not simply the responsibility of health departments.

Evolution of national policy:coronary heart disease By the early 1950s, the public health significance of coronary heart disease was recognized, although little was known about the risk factors. However, the link between serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease was suspected on the basis of animal experiments, and pathologists had shown that cholesterol was a major component of atherosclerotic lesions in humans. International studies began to explore the role of dietary fat in the 1950s, and major cohort studies began. By the end of the 1950s observational evidence was accumulating on the importance of elevated serum cholesterol, hypertension and smoking as the major risk factors for coronary heart disease.\n\nThe observational studies were complemented in the 1960s by the first trials that tested the effect of attempts to alter dietary fat intake on rates of coronary heart disease. Many of these trials were flawed and none produced a convincing effect individually, although the trends were consistent. It was soon recognized that definitive trials of dietary factors and coronary heart disease were impracticable and attention turned to the effect of blood pressure-and cholesterol-lowering drugs.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, many official pronouncements were made, beginning in 1960 with the first statement of the American Heart Association. In 1985 the National Consensus Development Conference in the USA signalled an increased emphasis on the prevention of coronary heart disease, in particular through attempts to lower cholesterol levels in both highrisk people and the population at large. This programme included a national education campaign on high cholesterol levels, a laboratory standardization programme, and continued efforts to lower cholesterol levels through strategies aimed at both the population and high-risk groups.\n\nIn 2003, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a comprehensive national public health action plan for heart health promotion. The aim of this plan was to chart a course by which collaborating public health agencies, all interested partners and the public at large, would promote national goals for preventing heart disease and stroke over the next two decades.\n\nIt has taken over 50 years for comprehensive prevention and control policies for coronary heart disease and stroke to be introduced in the United States. However, the emphasis of public policy on coronary heart disease still lies, to a large extent, in attempts to influence individual behaviour, both for members of the health professions and for the public. decisions in the United States. This examples shows the steps in the evolution of public policy in parallel to the health-care planning process discussed later in this chapter.\n\nIn most countries, relatively little attention has been directed towards long-term community-based prevention programmes for heart diseases and even less to facilitating healthy dietary habits, physical activity, and discouraging smoking at the population level. However, coronary heart disease is the first major chronic noncommunicable disease to receive such close attention from both researchers and policy-makers. It is possible that more rapid action will be taken to control other major chronic noncommunicable diseases on the basis of the experience gained, as, for example, with the control of tobacco use. (Box 10.4)\n\nFor communicable diseases, action has usually been more swift because infectious epidemics are seen as a more immediate national threat, and a threat to the economy. SARS, which affected only 8000 people causing 1300 deaths, was estimated to cost 30-140 billion USD. Travel and trade were seriously affected by the fear of infection, and costly preventive programs were established in many countries. Resources were rapidly invested in the development of alert and response mechanisms, and the International Health Regulations (see Box 7.2) were revised accordingly. Epidemiologists, working with a wide range of partners, were crucial to the efforts in bringing this epidemic under control."

The same process should be adopted in broader interventions, such as the development of a national care programme for the elderly, or a new approach to the delivery of primary health care in rural areas.\n\nThe systematic use of epidemiological principles and methods for the planning and evaluation of health services is an important aspect of modern epidemiology. From assessing the value of specific treatments it is a short step to assessing the more general performance of health services. The ultimate -though perhaps unrealistic -goal is to develop a transparent process for setting priorities and allocating scarce health care resources.\n\nBecause of the limited resources available for health care in all countries, choices have to be made between alternative strategies for improving health (see Chapter 6). In the poorest countries, only a few dollars per person are available for public health services. Consequently, a large proportion of health service costs are met by Major global progress has been made with efforts to control tobacco -the most important preventable risk factor for chronic diseases -and provides a good example of the way in which countries can use collective epidemiological knowledge to affect change.

As of the end of 2006, 142 countries -representing 77% of the world's population -had ratified this Convention.\n\nEffective primordial prevention -which means stopping the promotion of cigarettes and preventing people from becoming smokers -requires strong government regulation and fiscal policies for tobacco control.  6 The Framework Convention was developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic. The tobacco epidemic is exacerbated by a variety of cross-border factors, including trade liberalization, direct foreign investment, global marketing, transnational tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and the international movement of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes. This Convention represents a major shift by developing a regulatory strategy to address addictive substances. In contrast to previous drug control treaties, the Convention addresses reduction of demand as well as reduction of supply. Successful implementation of the Framework Convention will help to save millions of lives.\n\nEpidemiology, health policy and planning individuals or their families, so-called \"out-of-pocket\" expenses.

It is important to identify -and ideally predict -the national or sub-national political climate and to capitalize on opportunities to advance health.\n\nThe priorities of individual political leaders can be dramatically shaped by private experiences. There are many examples of leaders who, after being personally touched by disease, have subsequently made that disease a national priority for action. These people can be important allies for change.\n\nEpidemiology, health policy and planning (see Chapter 2) -also need to be measured.

It provides the basis for the optimal use of resources and covers the relationship between costs and effectiveness of an intervention. This is an area that combines epidemiology and health economics.\n\nThere are two main approaches to assessing efficiency.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis seeks to determine the costs and effectiveness of an intervention or its alternatives to determine the relative degree to which they result in the desired health outcome. The preferred intervention, or alternative, is one which requires the least cost to produce a given level of effectiveness. In health, cost-effectiveness looks at the ratio of financial expenditure and effectiveness: dollars per life year gained, dollars per case prevented, dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained, and so on (Box 10.8).\n\nCost-benefit analysis considers the economic costs of a defined type of disease or injury and the costs of prevention. Included in the economic costs of the disease would be the cost of medical care and rehabilitation, the loss of earnings and the estimated social cost of a death. \"Willingness-to-pay\" can be used to determine what the social cost of a death is: for high-income countries, this analysis usually produces a value of life at a few million US dollars. In cost-benefit analyses, both the numerator and denominator are expressed in monetary terms. The benefit of an intervention is the avoided cost of the disease cases, and the cost of the intervention is the direct cost of implementing preventive actions. If the costbenefit analysis shows that economic benefits of the intervention (or the benefit of preventing an additional case) are greater than the costs of prevention, the intervention would be economically profitable. Interventions that cost more than the calculated economic benefit may still be considered attractive due to the improved population health status that they achieve.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis is easier to perform than cost-benefit analysis, since the measure of effectiveness does not need to be given a monetary value. Table  10 .1 summarizes the estimated costs for each extra disability-adjusted life year gained as a result of various procedures for preventing chronic diseases. These figures assume a constant cost of implementation."

Such trials have shown, for example, that the treatment of mild hypertension reduces rates of fatal and nonfatal stroke by about 40%. However -due to problems with compliance and patient selection -antihypertensive treatment is less effective in the community.

At 2-4 USD per life-year saved, this is seen as good value and good public policy. Oral rehydration therapy has been widely adopted, saving millions of lives.  9 lthough these estimates are based on approximate information and many assumptions, they are useful to policy-makers who have to set priorities.

A basic understanding of disease epidemiology requires knowledge of the items listed in Table  11 .1. Rare, emerging, or rapidly evolving diseases are often the subject of ongoing research to establish these very characteristics. You should seek to complement your epidemiological knowledge with what is known about the pathology, clinical treatment, pharmacology, rehabilitation and economic impact of a disease. More detailed knowledge of engineering or sanitation aspects of prevention, economic impact or changing patterns may be needed for particular areas of public health practice.\n\nRather than focus on a specific disease, you may choose to focus on a specific risk factor such as tobacco smoking or pesticide exposure. This would also involve studying the literature and doing research on the particular risk its route of exposure to humans, and the mechanisms by which it affects health (Table  11 .2)."

Finding, sorting through, and understanding relevant and valid information is a crucial skill that can only be acquired through a lot of practice. However, the effort spent learning to appraise papers is repaid when it comes to designing research, as the same questions apply.\n\nOne approach is to first categorize papers into five broad types -most epidemiological research papers are either on the natural history of disease; its geographic distribution; its causes; treatment; or diagnostic tests. The level of evidence that any particular study will be able to provide is linked to its design. In general, levels of evidence are considered to progress from expert opinion, through case-series, to cohort studies, randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews, but it is important to consider the quality and validity of any one example in addition to its relative position on the ladder.\n\nWhen reading a paper, you may wish to consider the following questions, in this order.\n\nTable 11.1.

The doctors and relatives of the patients were contacted and descriptions of mode of death and the pattern of drug administration were obtained. Statistical information on fatal asthma cases in New Zealand in the years 1974-78 was obtained from the New Zealand Department of Health. Necropsies had been performed on the 8 patients referred to the coroner.\n\nTaking into consideration the methods used, would you agree with the suggestion that a toxic drug interaction was leading to an increased risk of death?\n\nChapter 1\n\n1.1 The fact that there were over 40 times more cholera cases in one district than in the other does not reflect the risk of catching cholera in the two districts. It is not appropriate to compare the number of deaths in the two groups since the population supplied by the Southwark Company was over eight times larger than the population supplied by the Lambeth Company. Death rates (number of deaths divided by the population supplied) must be compared.\n\nIn fact the death rate in the population supplied by the Southwark Company was over five times greater than that in the Lambeth district. 1.2 The best evidence would come from intervention studies. The 1854 epidemic was controlled in a most dramatic manner when the handle of a water pump was removed. The epidemic died away rapidly, although the evidence suggests (and Snow knew) that the epidemic was already waning before this act. More convincing was the reduction in cholera rates in the population supplied by the Lambeth Company in the period 1849-54 (before the epidemic) after the Company had begun extracting water from a less contaminated part of the River Thames. 1.3 Doctors make a good study group because they comprise a well-defined occupational group with similar socioeconomic status, and are relatively easy to follow up. They are also likely to be interested in health matters and cooperative in this type of study. 1.4 It can be concluded that lung cancer death rates increase dramatically with the number of cigarettes smoked. From the data alone it is not possible to conclude that smoking causes lung cancer; some other factor associated with smoking might be causing the disease. However, in 1964, on the basis of this study and many others, the United States Surgeon General concluded that lung cancer was caused by cigarette smoking. 1.5 The distribution of the population is the first factor to consider. The concentration of cases in one area is interesting only if the population is spread throughout that area. Secondly, it needs to be known whether the search for cases has been as intensive in the areas without cases as in the area with cases. During the Minamata disease outbreak, an intensive search was made throughout the whole region and it was found that several large population centres had no cases. 1.6 The reported occurrence of rheumatic fever has declined dramatically in Denmark since the early 1900s. It could be a real decline although it would be important to try to rule out the influence of changes in diagnostic fashion and reporting practices. Since effective medical treatment for rheumatic fever became available only in the 1940s, most of the decline has been due to socioeconomic improvements, e.g. in housing and nutrition. It is also possible that the responsible organism has become less virulent. 1.7 Men who do not smoke and are not exposed to asbestos dust have the lowest lung cancer rates, followed in increasing order by men exposed to asbestos dust alone, men who smoke but are not exposed to asbestos dust, and finally men who both smoke and are exposed to asbestos dust. This is an example of interaction in which two factors work together to produce a very high rate of disease. From a public health perspective it is important to ensure that people exposed to asbestos dust do not smoke, and, of course, to reduce exposure to the dust.\n\nChapter 2\n\n2.1 The three measures are prevalence, incidence and cumulative incidence. Prevalence is the proportion of the population affected by a disease or condition at a given point in time and is approximately equal to the incidence multiplied by the duration of disease. Incidence measures the rate at which new events occur in a population; it can take into account variable time periods during which individuals are disease-free. Cumulative incidence measures the denominator (i.e. the population at risk) at only one point in time (usually at the beginning of a study) and thus measures the risk of individuals contracting a disease during a specified period. 2.2 Prevalence is a useful measure of the frequency of non-insulin-dependent diabetes because diabetes has a relatively low incidence and because a very large population and a long study period would be required in order to find sufficient new cases to measure incidence. The variation shown in Table 2.3 could reflect differences in measurement. The adequacy of the methods used in the various surveys would need to be assessed; survey response rates and laboratory methods would have to be looked at, among other things. It should be noted, however, that standard criteria are being applied on the basis of blood glucose levels after a standard glucose load. It is likely that much of the variation in diabetes prevalence is real and due, at least in part, to variations in diet, exercise and other elements of lifestyle. 2.3 The population attributable risk or attributable fraction (population) is calculated as: 30.2-17.7 30.2 0.414 = corresponding to 41.4%. 2.4 Risk difference and risk ratio. 2.5 Although the relative risk is only about 1.5, the population attributable risk is about 20% (i.e. about 20% of the cases of lung cancer in a typical population of a developed country can be attributed to passive smoking). This is because up to half the population is exposed to passive smoking. 2.6 Age standardization ensures that differences in death rates are not due simply to differences in age distribution in the populations. Standardizing crude rates takes the age distribution out of the picture and therefore allows a comparison of populations with different age structures by using a population with a standard age distribution 2.7 Either rate can be used and even the number of cancer deaths. It all depends on how the information will be interpreted. The number of cases tells you which part of the country would have the largest number of cancer cases needing treatment. The crude rate tells you where the number of case per capita is the highest, but a high crude rate may just indicate that there are many elderly people in that area. However, the age standardized rates tells us where the risk of cancer is highest, which would be the first step in designing epidemiological studies to identify preventable risk factors. 2.8 They reflect the fact that the average life expectancy in Cote d'Ivoire is low and there are not many people in the older age groups (and cancer risk increases with age). 2.9 Without having the age standardized rates for both countries, comparisons are not possible. The higher crude rates in Japan could have occurred because it has the highest life expectancy in the world and many more older people than in Cote d'Ivoire -ie they have populations with radically different age distributions. In fact, Japan has a an age standardized cancer rate of 119.2 per 100,000 compared with Cote d'Ivoire (which has a rate of 160.2 per 100,000 -see above). With age standardization, Cote d'Ivoire's rate increases and Japanese rates decrease. Chapter 3 3.1 The main epidemiological study designs are the cross-sectional survey, the case-control study, the cohort study and the randomized controlled trial. Their relative strengths and weaknesses are summarized in the text and in Tables 3.3 and 3.4. 3.2 The case-control study would start with cases of bowel cancer, preferably newly diagnosed ones, and a group of controls (without the disease) from the same source population (to avoid selection bias). The cases and controls would be asked about their usual diet in the past. Measurement bias could be a problem. It is difficult to remember past diet with great accuracy, and the development of the disease might influence recall. The analysis would compare the content of the diet in the cases and controls, controlling for possible confounding variables.\n\nIn a cohort study, detailed data on diet are collected in a large group of people free of bowel disease; the cohort is followed up for several years and all new cases of bowel cancer are identified. The risk of disease is then related to the fat content of the diet at the beginning and during the study. This study design presents many logistic problems but systematic bias is less of a problem. 3.3 Random error is the variation of an observed value from the true population value due to chance alone. It can be reduced by increasing the size of the study sample and improving the reliability of the measurement method. 3.4 Systematic error occurs when there is a tendency to produce results that differ systematically from the true values. The main sources of systematic error are selection bias and measurement bias. Selection bias occurs when the people who take part in a study are systematically different from those who do not. The possibility of selection bias can be reduced by a clear and explicit definition of the criteria for entry into the study, a knowledge of the natural history and management of the disease, and a high response rate. Measurement bias occurs when there is a systematic error in measurement or classification of the participants in a study. It can be reduced by good study design, involving, for example, standard criteria for the disease, detailed attention to the quality control of measurement methods, and the collection of data without knowledge of the disease status of the participant. 3.5 Relative risk (RR) is used in prospective studies (e.g. cohort) while Odds Ratio (OR) is calculated in a case-control (retrospective) study. In a casecontrol study, there are those who have the disease and those who do not (including those who are exposed and those who are not). The ratio of the probability of occurrence of an event to that of non occurrence is the odds of that event, and by computing the ratio of the odds of the event in exposed versus non exposed (the odds ratio, which is the ratio of two odds), it is estimated how much more likely is the event in exposed compared with non exposed. This odds ratio is indeed an approximation to the relative risk, and is particularly useful if the event is rare. Further details on how the odds ratio approximates and differs from the relative risk are beyond a course in basic epidemiology.\n\nA relative risk is almost never calculated in case-control studies. In calculating a RR, one is comparing the incidence of those exposed and incidence of those not exposed (probability of occurrence of a disease in the exposed and in the non-exposed). 3.6 See answer to question 3.5. In the case of a rare disease (for example, most cancers), RR and OR are very similar. This is because the odds ratio formula is: (sick exposed x non-sick not exposed) / (sick not exposed x non-sick exposed). 3.7 Maternal age is a confounder: it is correlated with birth order and is a risk factor even if birth order is low. In another sample where all mothers are below 30 years, no association with birth order would be found."

First, while the independent variables can be the same for all three, the dependent variables are quite different, with the dependent variable for linear regression being a continuous variable, for logistic regression being a representation for a dichotomous variable such as the presence or absence of some characteristic, and for survival models being the measure of a time interval from some specified point until a pre-specified event occurs. Coefficients for linear regression represent either differences between means or slopes, for logistic regression represent odds ratios and for survival models represent hazard rate ratios. 4.4 The narrower the better. This is true since the confidence interval concept is such that, for example, the sample mean, which is an estimate of the mean for the population from which the sample was taken, is in the middle of the confidence interval. Further, one would expect 95% of such intervals to contain the true value of the population mean and the shorter the interval the closer the sample mean is likely to be to the population mean. 4.5 In general, tables presenting data or results should \"stand alone\" in a manuscript or report. This means that the reader should be able to interpret the data presented without reference to the text or to other documents. The table title is essential for this purpose. Data tables typically are made up of a set of cells and the table title should state \"what, how classified, where and when\" in reference to the information in the cells. An example is \"Number and percent of participants, classified by age, race and gender, CARDIA Study, 2006. 4.6 For this situation, b 1 = mean males -mean females = 5.0 kg, adjusted for the other independent variables in the model. 4.7 For this situation, b 1 = 0.5 represents the slope for the relationship between age and body weight. It is interpreted as the increment in body weight per one year increment in age, which, in this case, means that body weight increases 0.5 kg per year of increase in age.\n\nChapter 5\n\n5.1 The process of determining whether an observed association is likely to be causal. 5.2 This means that some causal factors lead to exposures to other factors that are the direct cause of the disease. For instance, low income is associated with a low intake of fruit and vegetables in the United Kingdom (Figure  5 .9). Low intake of fruit and vegetables is in turn associated with a higher diastolic blood pressure. Income determines diet, which determines a health outcome; a hierarchy of causes. 5.3 Attributable fractions are as follows: Smoking among asbestos workers = (602-58)/602 = 0.904, or 90%; smoking among non-asbestos workers = (123-11)/123 = 0.910 or 91%; asbestos exposure among smokers = (602-123)/ 602 = 0.796, or 80%; asbestos exposure among non-smokers = (58-11)/56 = 0.810 or 81%. These fractions add up to more than 100% because they are each dependant on the other. Thus, eliminating smoking among asbestos workers reduces lung cancer rate by 90%, and then eliminating asbestos exposure reduces the remaining risk by 80%. The total reduction of risk is therefore 90% plus 80% x 0.1, which, when added up, gives a 98% reduction. When deciding on prevention programs, a judgement needs to be made of how large a proportion of each hazard exposure can be eliminated. Technological change can eliminate all asbestos exposure, while smoking cessation programs may only eliminate a fraction of the tobacco exposure. In order to calculate population attributable risks it is necessary also to know what proportion of the population is smoking and what proportion is exposed to asbestos at work. 5. 4 The criteria include: the temporal nature of the relation, plausibility, consistency, the strength of the association, the dose-response relationship, reversibility, and the study design. Of these criteria, only temporality is essential; ultimately, judgment is required. 5.5 On the basis of this evidence alone one could not be certain that the association was causal; a policy of withdrawing the drug could not, therefore, be recommended. The effects of bias (measurement, selection) and confounding in the study and the role of chance would need to be assessed. If bias and chance are unlikely to be the explanation, then the causal criteria can be applied. In fact, when all the evidence was considered in such a study in New Zealand, the investigators concluded that the association was likely to be causal.  28 .6 A temporal relationship is most important. Did the patients consume the oil before or after they fell ill? Prior evidence of the potential toxic effects of this chemical is also crucial. If there is no information on the chemical in the oil that is associated with the disease, it is impossible to assess plausibility or consistency. Therefore strength and dose-response relationship based on information on oil consumption could be the next matters for study. As it is urgent priority to find the likely cause, the most suitable approach would be to conduct a case-control study, together with chemical analysis of the oil and of biological monitoring samples. It would be prudent to intervene as soon as a temporal relationship has been clearly established and the strength of association appears great, particularly if there is no other likely cause.\n\n5.7 It is acceptable for acute effects that occur within hours or days of the exposure. It is using the exposed group as its own control. On hot days the population is exposed and on cooler days the same population serves as a control. If daily data are used, it is considered that the population size or character does not change during the study period and confounding should be limited. 5.8 Meta-analysis combines data from more than one study in order to achieve more stable and precise conclusions concerning causal associations. To use this method each study needs to have used the same exposure and health outcome variables and the basic population characteristics (age, sex, etc.) should also be the same in each study. 5.9 The risk of ischaemic heart disease is about twice as high in the lower fruit and vegetable consumption quintile as in the upper quintile (Figure  5 .8). The fruit and vegetable intake levels in Figure  5 .9 for the highest and lowest quintiles are approximately 300 and 150 grams per day, respectively. Combining these estimates indicates that lower income groups may have four times higher ischaemic heart disease risk in relation to fruit and vegetable consumption than the higher income groups. Clearly, public health actions and policies need to find ways to make fruit and vegetable intake more common in low income households. Figure  5 .9 indicates that at least in the United Kingdom food prices may be a key factor. Just like taxes are applied to unhealthy products, such as tobacco, it may be worth providing subsidies for fruit and vegetable production and distribution. School lunches can also be a target for improved diets in this respect.\n\nChapter 6\n\n6.1 The four levels of prevention are: primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary. A comprehensive programme for the prevention of stroke would include activities at each of these levels. Primordial prevention would involve stopping the rise of population levels of the major risk factors for common chronic diseases including stroke. Primary prevention includes both population prevention through public health legislation and environmental changes addressed at the whole population, as well as a \"high risk\" strategy targeting treatment at individuals at high overall risk of an acute stroke event.\n\nSecondary prevention programmes would involve the early treatment and rehabilitation. If people who have already had a heart attack or stroke are included in the high risk prevention strategy, in effect, this merges the high risk strategy with secondary prevention. Tertiary prevention involves rehabilitation of patients suffering from the longterm effects or sequelae of stroke. 6.2 This cannot be answered in general terms. Each potential prevention programme needs to be assessed in context. Each programme must be balanced by an appropriate mix of population and high-risk activities based on a number of factors including the levels of diabetes and obesity, the major risk factors, the affordability of clinical care, and issues of equity. The challenge is not to choose between one or the other approach, but to move investment towards populations approaches while improving the quality of the high-risk approaches that are in operation. 6.3 For a disease to be suitable for screening it must be serious, the natural history of the disease must be understood, there should be a long period between development of the first signs and appearance of overt disease, an effective treatment must be available and, usually, the prevalence of the disease must be high. 6.4 All study designs have been used to evaluate screening programmes. Randomized controlled trials are ideal, but cross-sectional, cohort and casecontrol studies are also used."

Demographic change, with an increased proportion of elderly people, is one explanation. It would be helpful to have age-specific mortality data for individual diseases to allow further examination of the trends. Two general explanations for a decrease in age-specific infectious disease mortality have been advanced. First, there has been a general reduction in host susceptibility through improved nutrition and sanitation. This is likely to be the most important factor, particularly in respect of the early improvement. Secondly, specific medical interventions may have played a part, particularly since the 1950s. 7.2 A record of weekly (or daily) cases of measles found by clinics and health practitioners in the district should be kept. The \"normal\" background level (perhaps two cases or fewer per week) and a threshold level for an incipient epidemic (perhaps twice or three times the background level) should be established. When the threshold is exceeded, preventive action should be taken. 7.3 The chain of infection for foodborne salmonella goes from faecal material (either from humans or animals, particularly chickens) to water or food which, when consumed, leads to infection. Alternatively, it goes from faecal material to hands and then to food (during food preparation), which again leads to infection. 7. 4 The revised International Health Regulations (2005) establishes a single code of procedures and practices for routine public health measures.\n\nThe IHR (2005) does not include an enforcement mechanism for the countries which fail to comply with its provisions.\n\nCountries will need to meet the human and financial requirements for developing, strengthening and maintaining the necessary public health capacities, and mobilizing the resources necessary for that purpose; adopting the necessary legal and administrative provisions designating a national IHR Focal Point assessment and notification of events occurring within their territory that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, and; implementing measures at certain international airports, ports and ground crossings, including routine inspection and control activities.\n\n7.5 The four levels of prevention are: primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary. A comprehensive programme for the prevention of tuberculosis would include activities at each of these levels. Primordial prevention can involve preventing the entry of infectious cases into a healthy population. People from endemic areas can be required to provide evidence that they are not infected before entering non-endemic areas. In addition, the factors that increase the risk of tuberculosis, such as overcrowding, poverty and poor nutrition can be addressed. Primary prevention includes immunization and case-finding, to avoid spread of the disease.\n\nSecondary prevention programmes involve the early and effective treatment of infected people. Tertiary prevention involves rehabilitation of patients suffering from the longterm effects or sequelae of tuberculosis and its treatment.\n\nChapter 8\n\n8.1 The term is strictly a contradiction in that epidemiology deals with populations whereas clinical medicine deals with individual patients. However, it is appropriate because clinical epidemiology studies populations of patients. 8.2 The limitation of this definition is that there are no biological grounds for using an arbitrary cut-off point as the basis for distinguishing normal from abnormal. For many diseases the risk increases with increasing levels of risk factors and much of the burden of disease falls on people in the normal range. 8.3 The sensitivity of the new test=8/10\u00d7100=80%; its specificity= 9000/10000\u00d7100=90%. The new test appears good; a decision on whether to use it in the general population requires information on its positive predictive value, which in this case is 8/1008=0.008. This very low value is related to the low prevalence of the disease. For this reason, it would not be appropriate to recommend general use of the test. 8.4 The positive predictive value of a screening test is the proportion of the people with positive results who actually have the disease. The major determinant of the positive predictive value is the prevalence of the pre-clinical disease in the screened population. If the population is at low risk for the disease, most of the positive results will be false. Predictive value also depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test. 8.5 Some of the potential problems with this metaanalysis include the following: Aspirin dose, duration of treatment, and lengths of follow up were unlikely to be uniform in the 6 selected studies. Even with pooling six large trials, individual outcome events were infrequent because of the low risk of the populations studied, thus reducing the power of the study to detect differences. Only analysis of data from participants from all the available trials would have allowed an examination of aspirin benefit in particular subgroups who may have benefited. Meta-analysis is retrospective research, subject to the methodological deficiencies of each included study. 8.6 On the basis of this study, it could be concluded that low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduction on cardiovascular events in both men and women but also associated with a significant risk of major bleeding. Recommendations would include the need to explain to an individual both the beneficial and harmful effects of aspirin before considering aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in low risk patients. This information should be conveyed in a clinically significant way -in terms of number-needed-totreat (and number-needed-to-harm) or absolute risk reduction rather than relative risk reduction.\n\n9.1 (a) Children, as they develop the effects at lower blood levels. (b) Changes in neurobehavioural function, as these develop at lower blood levels. 9.2 (a) An increasing relative risk of lung cancer.\n\n(b) Because it is known that the total amount (dose) of asbestos particles (fibres) inhaled (concentration\u00d7duration of exposure) is what determines the risk of asbestos-induced disease. 9.3 The answer will depend on the toxic substance chosen. The types of biological materials to consider are: blood, urine, hair, saliva, nail clippings, faeces, and possibly biopsy materials. 9.4 You should start by collecting case histories, holding discussions with local medical services and making visits to suspected industries in order to develop the hypothesis for study. Then a case-control study of lung cancer within the city should be done. 9.5 Information on deaths in previous years (without smog) and on the agespecific causes of death would be helpful. Evidence from animal experiments might serve to document the effects of the smog (in fact, the live animals on display at London's Smithfield Meat Market also suffered). The close time association of the smog and its pollutants with an increase in deaths is strong evidence for a causal relationship. 9.6 The healthy worker effect refers to the low background morbidity and mortality rates that are found in both exposed and unexposed groups in the workplace. The reason is that, in order to be active in an occupation, people need to be reasonably healthy. Ill and disabled people are selectively excluded from the study groups. If a control group is chosen from the general population, bias may be introduced because the group is inherently less healthy. 9.7 Situations where: a. well defined geographic sub-area and census or other population data exist; b. the exposure of interest can be measured or modeled in the same geographic sub-areas; c. data on exposures and effects for each geographic sub-area can be assembled for appropriate time periods. 9.8 Driving cars or motor cycles: seat belts, speed limits, alcohol limits, crash helmets. Housing and workplace design. Safety features of household products, e.g. electrical products, child safety lids on jars and medicine containers. Life jackets in boats, etc."

      "text": "11.1 This was a well-designed and well-conducted randomized controlled trial on the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular mortality. The study was conducted on male American physicians who, it turned out, were very healthy. Out of a total of 261 000 physicians, 22 000 took part. The healthy state of the physicians meant that the study had less statistical power than originally planned. Extrapolating the results to other populations is difficult because of the exclusions that limited the study population to physicians likely to comply and not to have adverse side-effects. These design features increased the likelihood of a high success rate. Confirmation of the benefits of aspirin is required from other studies. It is always necessary to balance benefits against risks (gastrointestinal side-effects, increased risk of bleeding, etc.). 11.2 Ecological evidence on asthma therapy is related to a suggested increase in asthma mortality. It would be difficult to agree with the conclusion. Information is presented only on people dying with asthma; no information is provided on asthmatics not dying. This study is a case series; there are no controls. Such a study, however, points to the desirability of further investigation. In this case a more formal examination of asthma mortality trends has identified a new epidemic of asthma deaths; a particular drug contributed substantially to the epidemic."
