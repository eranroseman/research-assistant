  "title": "A randomized controlled trial of gamification, financial incentives, or both to increase physical activity among patients with elevated risk for cardiovascular disease: rationale and design of the be active study",
  "abstract": "Background Higher levels of physical activity are associated with improvements in cardiovascular health, and consensus guidelines recommend that individuals with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) participate in regular physical activity. However, most adults do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Concepts from behavioral economics have been used to design scalable interventions that increase physical activity over short time periods, but the longer-term efficacy of these strategies is uncertain. Study Design and Objectives BE ACTIVE (NCT03911141) is a pragmatic, virtual, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 strategies informed by behavioral economic concepts to increase daily physical activity in patients with established ASCVD or 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5% who are seen in primary care and cardiology clinics affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Patients are contacted by email or text message, and complete enrollment and informed consent on the Penn Way to Health online platform. Patients are then provided with a wearable fitness tracker, establish a baseline daily step count, set a goal to increase daily step count by 33% to 50%, and are randomized 1:2:2:2 to control, gamification, financial incentives, or both gamification and financial incentives. Interventions continue for 12 months, with follow-up for an additional 6 months to evaluate the durability of behavior change. The trial has met its enrollment goal of 1050 participants, with a primary endpoint of change from baseline in daily steps over the 12-month intervention period. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in daily steps over the 6-month post-intervention follow-up period and change in moderate to vigorous physical activity over the intervention and follow-up periods. If the interventions prove effective, their effects on life expectancy will be compared with their costs in cost-effectiveness analysis. Conclusions BE ACTIVE is a virtual, pragmatic randomized clinical trial powered to demonstrate whether gamification, financial incentives, or both are superior to attention control in increasing physical activity. Its results will have important implications for strategies to promote physical activity in patients with or at risk for ASCVD, as well as for the design and implementation of pragmatic virtual clinical trials within health systems.

      "text": "Higher levels of regular physical activity are associated with improved control of cardiovascular risk factors and reduced risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5]  For this reason, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that each week adults obtain at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity.  6 However, more than half of adults in the United States do not achieve this amount of physical activity, and this proportion has not changed significantly over the past decade.  7 s with many health-related behaviors, increasing individuals' physical activity has been challenging for a number of reasons. Behavioral economics is a scientific field of inquiry that uses principles from economics and psychology to understand and influence how individuals make decisions. In classical experiments, behavioral economists showed that people commonly make certain decision errors, leading to the concept of \"bounded rationality.\"  8 For example, individuals are more motivated by immediate rather than delayed gratification, by losses rather than gains, and by the desire to avoid feelings of regret.  9 , 10 These insights can be leveraged to design interventions that effectively promote healthy behaviors. For example, rewards can be framed as losses when a goal is not achieved as opposed to gains following achievement of a goal and individuals can be informed of what they would have received had they accomplished their goals.\n\nIn prior studies, gamification and financial incentives based on behavioral economic concepts have each increased physical activity more than controls in patients with or at risk for ASCVD. However, interventions were delivered over 12 or 24 weeks, with post-intervention follow up periods of no longer than 12 weeks.  11 , 12 The degree to which these interventions durably increase physical activity over longer intervention and follow-up periods is unknown, as is the relative efficacy of gamification vs. financial incentives.\n\nWe therefore designed the Behavioral Economic Approaches to Increase Physical Activity Among Patients with Elevated Risk for Cardiovascular Disease (BE AC-TIVE) randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of gamification, financial incentives, or both, compared with control, to increase physical activity over a 12-month intervention period and 6-month follow-up period in 1050 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease ( Figure  1  )."

This email or text message introduces the study and provides a link to the study's webpage on Penn Way to Health,  14  a research and care delivery platform that automates the delivery of behavior change interventions. On the study webpage, participants create an account, confirm their eligibility, complete the informed consent process, and answer questions regarding demographics, medical history, health status, and health-related quality of life. Enrollment is passive, and patients complete the enrollment process on their own, outside of clinical encounters, with study staff available to answer any questions by phone.\n\nOnce eligible patients complete the baseline questionnaire, they are mailed a wrist-worn activity tracker (Fitbit Inspire 2) and instructions for how to connect the device to the Way to Health platform. Participants are told to wear the device for 2 weeks to get comfortable using it, but are not explicitly told that baseline physical activity data is collected during this time per iod. Dur ing the second week of this 2 week run-in phase, baseline activity measures (daily step counts, minutes of moderate physical activity) are estimated, as done previously.  11 , 15 he first week of data is ignored to diminish the potential upward bias of the estimate from higher activity during initial device use. To prevent potential mismeasurement, days with step values < 1000 are ignored, as previous studies have shown that these are unlikely to represent capture of actual activity during the entire day.  16 , 17 For participants with < 4 days with step count \u2265 1000 during the second week of the run-in period, the baseline period is extended until at least 4 valid days of data are collected. Baseline daily step count is calculated as the mean daily step count from the second week of the runin period; days where the participant had a step count < 1000 are excluded from both the numerator (steps) Summary of the design of the BE ACTIVE trial. Patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) are eligible for enrollment into BE ACTIVE. Patients complete informed consent and baseline questionnaires on the Penn Way to Health platform and are mailed a Fitbit wearable fitness tracker. They wear the fitness tracker for 2 weeks to establish a baseline step count, and patients with baseline step count > 7500 are excluded. The remaining patients set a goal to increase step count by 33%-50% above baseline and are then randomized to one of four arms: attention control, gamification, financial incentives, or gamification + financial incentives.\n\nand the denominator (days). Participants who do not complete the run-in phase or had baseline step counts > 7500 steps/day are not randomized into the trial and are asked to return their Fitbit device.\n\nOnce baseline measures are established, participants are contacted via text message or email, given their baseline step count, and asked to set a goal step increase of 33%, 40%, or 50%, or a custom goal at least 1500 steps greater than baseline. This approach was selected to give participants the option of setting their own goal, which we have shown is the most effective approach for goalsetting,  12  while nudging them to choose between different goals that were ambitious but achievable. They are then randomized 1:2:2:2 to 1 of 4 arms -attention control, gamification, financial incentives, or gamification + financial incentives -stratified by baseline step count ( < 4000 steps, 4000-7000 steps, > 7000 steps) using an electronic number generator through the Way to Health platform. Treatment assignment is necessarily open-label, but patients are not explicitly informed about the existence or details of other treatment arms.\n\nDuring the study period, patients are asked to complete questionnaires at 6, 12, and 18 months' follow-up. Participants receive $30 for enrolling in the study, $30 for completing the 6-month assessment, $40 for completing the 12-month assessment, and $50 for completing the 18month assessment.

The components are the following: (1) Precommitment: Each participant signs a contract agreeing to try their best to achieve their daily step goal, an approach shown to motivate behavior change.  18 (2) Points: At the start of each week, the participant receives 70 points (10 for each day of the week). Participants are endowed with points rather than given points after achieving a milestone to leverage loss aversion, a concept from prospect theory that indicates that individuals are more motivated by losses than gains.  9 Each day the participant is informed of their step count from the day prior. If the step goal was achieved, the participant retains his or her points; if the step goal was not achieved, they are informed that they had lost 10 points. Points are replenished at the start of each week to leverage the \"fresh start effect\" -the concept that individuals are more motivated for aspirational behavior around temporal landmarks like the start of a new week.  19 (3) Levels: At the end of the week, participants with 40 points or more advance 1 level; participants with less than 40 points drop down a level.

Goal gradients  52  People try harder when goals are within reach In the gamification arms, participants start in the middle level. If they perform poorly, they get a fresh start every 8 weeks, and are moved back to the middle level and platinum (highest). Each participant begins in the silver level to create a sense of achievable goals and use loss aversion to motivate ongoing efforts not to lose status.  20 Every 8 weeks, individuals in the blue and bronze levels are restarted back at silver, and offered a chance to adjust their step goal, as long as they remain within the range of a 33% to 50% increase from baseline. This allows for another \"fresh start,\" creates a new endowment, and avoids participants becoming discouraged if they set their goals too high at the start of the study.\n\n(4) Supportive sponsor: Each participant selects a family member or friend of their choice who receives a weekly email with the participant's progress, including accumulated points, level in the game, and average step count.\n\nThe supportive sponsor helps enhance social incentives to motivate the participant toward his or her goal. Prior to starting the study, supportive sponsors participate in a 3 way phone call with the participant and study staff to discuss the rules of the game and ways that they can help the participant reach their goals. Every 8 weeks, participants in the blue and bronze levels are contacted, along with their sponsor, to discuss ways the sponsor can better help participants achieve their goals moving forward.\n\n(5) Prize: At the end of the intervention period, participants in the platinum and gold levels receive a trophy (a nominal incentive of low monetary value) recognizing their achievement. The game lasts for the duration of the 12-month intervention. After 12 months, the participants in the gamification arm receive a daily text message noting their step count from the day prior (as in the attention control arm) for an additional 6-month follow-up period.\n\nIn the financial incentives arm, patients are informed each week that $14 has been placed in a virtual account for them. Each day, the participant is informed of their step count on the prior day. If the step goal was achieved, the balance remains. If the step goal was not achieved, the participant is informed that $2 has been taken away from their virtual account. This structure leverages the concepts of loss aversion and the fresh start effect. After 12 months, participants no longer have money placed into their account each week but continue to receive a daily text message noting their step count from the day prior (as in the attention control arm) for an additional 6-month follow-up period.\n\nIn the gamification + financial incentives arm, participants receive the interventions from both the gamification and financial incentives arms.\n\nIn all 3 intervention arms, participants have an 8-week ramp-up period during which goals are increased gradually from baseline to the target. For example, if the baseline number of steps per day is 5000, and the goal is 7400 (an increase of 2400 steps over 8 weeks), then in week 1, the goal is 5300; in week 2, 5600, and so on through the 8-week ramp-up period."

For analyses of daily steps and MVPA, data captured during the entire study period will be used; this approach increases power by using all participant data, and provides a more complete picture of daily step count over the entire study period.

In prior studies using similar statistical methods, results of such sensitivity analyses have matched the primary analyses.  12 , 27 We will assess rates of missingness by arm, and if there is evidence of differential missing-ness, we will consider alternative modeling approaches that account for informative missingness.  31 o further explore participant characteristics that might be predictive of the interventions' success or failure, we will collect several baseline surveys in all participants: Self-Efficacy for Exercise Behaviors,  32  MOS Social Support survey,  33  the DOSPERT Risk Preferences survey,  34  the Big 5 personality inventory,  35  and the Grit Scale.  36 Exploratory subgroup analyses will evaluate interactions between these characteristics and intervention effects, as well as between clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic variables and intervention effects."

We will use a simulation model to translate changes in these measures into changes in life expectancy and quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs) over participants' remaining lifetimes, the recommended time horizon.  37 In translating changes in steps per day to changes in life expectancy or QALYs, we will rely on a series of cohort studies and systematic reviews of these cohort studies that evaluated the change in life expectancy for each additional 1000 steps per day measured by pedometer or accelerometer. In these studies, each 1000-step increase was associated with a 12% to 15% lower all-cause mortality, up to approximately 8000 steps per day. ,  [38] [39] 9] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46]  We will use these studies to adjust mortality rates from the U.S. Life Tables, assuming that the life table mortality rates reflect average steps per day as reported in the literature,  16  to represent the baseline mor tality r isk of tr ial par ticipants and the change in their mor tality r isk by the end of the intervention.\n\nWe directly measured intervention costs from the health care sector perspective, including costs for the Way to Health platform, staff (using a time diary to separate intervention from research tasks),  47  wearable devices, data storage, and financial incentives (where applicable). As a supplemental analysis, we surveyed participants to capture their costs: time spent on the intervention and physical activity, and out-of-pocket costs related to the intervention, such as clothing or shoes for exercise. We will summarize the results of this analysis in the form of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that show the difference in costs between 2 arms of the trial (eg, gamification vs. control) divided by the difference in each outcome (ie, step count, minutes MVPA, life expectancy, QALYs). Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the key drivers behind the costeffectiveness ratios, including regression of daily physical activity rates toward baseline, intervention costs, and the strength of the association between daily step count and mortality. Future medical costs, currently recommended for the health care sector perspective but not yet routinely included in cost-effectiveness analyses, will be included in sensitivity analyses."

The interview guide is informed by the theoretical domains framework, which specifies the cognitive, affective, social, and environmental influences on behavior in relation to the implementation of interventions to improve health.  20 , 48 In these interviews, participants are asked to describe aspects of each intervention element that helped, or did not help, them achieve their physical activity goals. Interviews also elicit information about participants' perceptions of intervention elements, the burden of participation, and suggestions for improvement in design. Interviews are transcribed and index coded by members of the study team. In future analyses, we will explore variation in perceptions and experiences across respondents."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "The BE ACTIVE tr ial, a randomized tr ial of 3 automated low-cost interventions informed by insights from behavioral economics to improve physical activity in patients with or at risk for ASCVD identified by an elec-tronic health record algorithm and directly contacted for participation, will provide several important insights into clinical practice and clinical trial conduct. From the standpoint of clinical practice, should any of the interventions lead to a sustained increase in physical activity, widespread implementation could have profound population-level effects on cardiovascular risk and quality of life. There will be strong incentives for health insurance plans and corporations to offer programs based on a successful intervention to plan members and employees, and for health systems to offer similar programs to their patients as capitated models proliferate. From the standpoint of clinical research, BE ACTIVE is among the first examples of a large clinical trial conducted entirely within a single health system using an electronic health record algorithm to identify patients for participation, direct outreach to potential participants with passive enrollment, and self-directed informed consent. As such, it is a model for the type of low-cost clinical trials designed to answer patient-centered comparative effectiveness questions and will provide important lessons for similar trials in the future."
