  "title": "Effects of aerobic training and resistance training in reducing cardiovascular disease risk for patients with prediabetes: A multi-center randomized controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Aims: Aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) can reduce blood glucose and type 2 diabetes risk, and increase muscle mass for prediabetes patients. However, the impact of long-term AT and RT on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of AT and RT on CVD risk reduction in prediabetes patients. Materials and methods: 248 prediabetes patients were enrolled in this multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: RT (n = 82), aerobic training (AT (n = 83)), and control group (n = 83). Participants in RT and AT groups had moderate RT or AT 3 times a week (150 min/week) under supervision in 3 research centers for 24 months. Primary outcome was CVD risk measured by Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and The Chinese 10-year ischemic cardiovascular disease (ICVD) risk assessment tool. Secondary outcomes included in HOMA2-IR, HbA1c, blood pressure and serum lipid profile. Results: Both RT and AT groups experienced a significant reduction in HOMA2-IR, HbA1c, LDL-C, TC, SBP, and DBP at the end of 12 and 24 months. Compared to the control group, Both RT and AT groups had significant reduction of the Chinese 10-year ICVD risk (P < 0.05), but FRS CVD risk declined significantly only in the AT group (all P < 0.05). Although FRS CVD risk decreased more in the RT group than in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. After adjusting for age, gender, statin use, BMI, and WHR, in COX's proportional hazard model, RT (HR = 0.419, P = 0.037) and AT (HR = 0.310, P = 0.026) were protective factors for CVD risk in prediabetes patients. 24-month RT and AT decreased respectively 58.1% and 69.0% of CVD risk (10-year ICVD risk assessment) in prediabetes patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that 24-month moderate AT reduces the Chinese 10-year ICVD risk and FRS CVD risk in prediabetes patients. RT groups had significant reduction of CVD risk (10-year ICVD risk assessment) in prediabetes patients.",

      "text": "Prediabetes, also known as impaired glucose regulation (IGR), includes both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). It was important to notice that prediabetes have significant insulin resistance which can initiate the process of cardiovascular disease (CVD)  [1] . A British study  [2]  followed up the population without baseline CVD or known diabetes (n = 357,833) for 8.9 years and found that compared with the reference group, prediabetes was at higher CVD risk: hazard ratio (HR) 1.83. A meta-analysis  [3]  showed that prediabetes (IGT or IFG according to IFG-ADA or IFG-WHO criteria) was associated with an increased risk of CVD (relative risk 1.13, 1.26, and 1.30 for IFG-ADA, IFG-WHO, and IGT, respectively).\n\nExercise is an effective way to reduce the risk of CVD. Exercise paradigms to prevent CVD have historically been focused on aerobic activity. Our team reported that supervised resistance training (RT) reduced insulin resistance, HbA1c, SBP, LDL-C  [4]  and abdominal adipose, and augmented muscle mass  [5] . Two flow-up studies from the US reported that a risk reduction of 17% for CVD was observed among healthy men and women engaging in RT with a follow-up period of 18 and 14 years  [6, 7] . However, whether long-term RT can reduce the risk of CVD in patients with prediabetes is unclear.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of this multi-center RCT was to investigate the impact of 24-month resistance training on the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk on patients with prediabetes."

      "text": "This multi-center randomized controlled trail with relatively large sample size and long duration demonstrated that RT reduced the risk of CVD in participants with prediabetes. This association was not explained by other known CVD risk factors, including BMI.\n\nOur study found that AT but not RT reduced the risk of CVD based on FRS. It should be noted that diabetes status, a known coronary risk equivalent, was not taken into account in the Framingham Score rubric  [12] . Thus, the Chinese 10-year ICVD risk assessment tool was developed to include diabetes in determining CVD risk  [13] . By using it, we found that RT reduced CVD risk by 58.1%. This was similar to the results of the follow-up study in the U.S. through 14 years of follow-up, this study found that RT reduced the risk of CVD in healthy women by 17%  [7] . Another 18-year follow-up study of male health professionals found that RT reduced CVD risk by 17%  [6] . The magnitude of reduction in these two studies were smaller than that of our study. Three factors might account for this difference. First, Participants in our study were prediabetes with higher risk of CVD. Participants in these two studies were healthy men and women. Second, in our study, participants attended one of three centers to complete their study routines and the exercises were supervised by study personnel. In these two studies, exercises were recorded by self-report. Third, in our study, we used the FRS and the Chinese 10-year ICVD risk assessment tool to measure the CVD risk. In these two studies, Cases of cardiovascular disease were defined as confirmed cases of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, or cardiovascular disease death  [7] . Study physicians reviewed medical records to confirm cases of cardiovascular disease.\n\nPrevious studies examining biomarkers and risk factors may provide a mechanistic explanation of the independent benefit of RT. To begin with, our previous studies showed that RT reduced visceral fat and increased muscle mass  [5] , therefore decreased insulin resistance  [4] . Moreover, RT reduced inflammatory factors such as testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1, triiodothyronine and leptin  [14] . Furthermore, RT reduced intermuscular adipose tissue  [15]  and increased mitochondrial protein synthesis, mitochondrial oxidative function and thus accelerated the oxidation of glucose  [16] . In addition, RT increased muscle volume, skeletal muscle capillarization, the blood supply of muscle and thus increased glucose consumption  [17, 18] . Eventually, randomized controlled trials of RT either by itself or in combination with aerobic activity have shown RT can improve glycemic control among prediabetes  [5, 19] . It has been well established that RT is a useful strategy for the treatment of vascular disease and maintenance of vascular function in patients with T2DM  [20] . Our study demonstrated that 24-month moderate resistance training was effective in reducing the CVD risk in participants with prediabetes.\n\nIn our study, we found that after 24-month training no significant difference was found between experimental groups and controls group for HDL. Although systematic reviews  [21, 22]  have shown aerobic exercise increases HDL in subclinical and clinical populations, the effects of regular exercise on HDL function are variable and dependent upon several factors, including exercise dose and participant characteristics. Whereas exercise interventions may be less effective at improving HDL in older, diseased individuals compared with younger, healthier individuals  [23] . Participants in our study were elderly prediabetes patients with a mean age of 60.52 \u00b1 5.73 years. There may be a plausible explanation for the current finding.\n\nThere are several strengths in this study including large sample size and long study duration. Further, in this multi-center, randomized controlled trial, all interventions were supervised by trained study personnel. Furthermore, intention-to-treat principle was applied to the data analysis. Last but not the least, the type of physical activity chosen (dancing and elastic bands). Such inexpensive activity type can to be easily applicable to the general population, even in an \"at-home\" basis, and potentially help with the long-term adherence to a physical activity program.\n\nOur study has limitations. On the one hand, with 24-month duration of study, instead of the incidence of CVD, we used the FRS and the Chinese 10-year ICVD risk assessment tool to measure the CVD risk. On the other hand, a high loss-to-follow-up, with only 69.7% of subjects completing the 24-month study. Future work should consider how to improve retention, examine the role of resistance exercises of varying intensity on overall CVD risk and so on."
