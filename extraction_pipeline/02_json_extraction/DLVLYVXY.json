  "title": "Effect of Remote Monitoring on Discharge to Home, Return to Activity, and Rehospitalization After Hip and Knee Arthroplasty A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Hip and knee arthroplasty are the most common inpatient surgical procedures for Medicare beneficiaries in the US, with substantial variation in cost and quality. Whether remote monitoring incorporating insights from behavioral science might help improve outcomes and increase value of care remains unknown. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of activity monitoring and bidirectional text messaging on the rate of discharge to home and clinical outcomes in patients receiving hip or knee arthroplasty. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted between February 7, 2018, and April 15, 2019. The setting was 2 urban hospitals at an academic health system. Participants were patients aged 18 to 85 years scheduled to undergo hip or knee arthroplasty with a Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool score of 6 to 8. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomized evenly to receive usual care (n = 153) or remote monitoring (n = 147). Those in the intervention arm who agreed received a wearable activity monitor to track step count, messaging about postoperative goals and milestones, pain score tracking, and connection to clinicians as needed. Patients assigned to receive monitoring were further randomized evenly to remote monitoring alone or remote monitoring with gamification and social support. Remote monitoring was offered before surgery, began at hospital discharge, and continued for 45 days postdischarge. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was discharge status (home vs skilled nursing facility or inpatient rehabilitation). Prespecified secondary outcomes included change in average daily step count and rehospitalizations. RESULTS A total of 242 patients were analyzed (124 usual care, 118 intervention); median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 58-73 years); 78.1% were women, 45.5% were White, 43.4% were Black; and 81.4% in the intervention arm agreed to receive monitoring. There was no significant difference in the rate of discharge to home between the usual care arm (57.3%; 95% CI, 48.5%-65.9%) and the intervention arm (56.8%; 95% CI, 47.9%-65.7%) and no significant increase in step count in those receiving remote monitoring plus gamification and social support compared with remote monitoring alone. There was a statistically significant reduction in rehospitalization rate in the intervention arm (3.4%; 95% CI, 0.1%-6.7%) compared with the usual care arm (12.2%; 95% CI, 6.4%-18.0%) (P = .01). (continued) Key Points Question Can a remote monitoring intervention that incorporates principles of behavioral science improve outcomes and value of care among patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty? Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 242 patients, the remote monitoring program did not increase rate of discharge to home after hip and knee arthroplasty, and gamification and social support did not increase activity levels. However, a significant reduction in rehospitalizations among those assigned to the intervention was found. Meaning In this study, remote monitoring did not increase discharge to home, but goal setting and connection to the care team may have reduced rehospitalizations.",

      "text": "Hip and knee replacements are the most common inpatient surgical procedures for Medicare beneficiaries in the US, with substantial cost and variability in care during the hospitalization and through postacute care.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Most hospitals are participating in a bundled payment program for hip or knee replacement surgery, such as the comprehensive care for joint replacement model, with the goal of reducing unnecessary postacute care and rehospitalizations.  [4] [5] 5] [6]  Patients discharged from hospitals to facilities have higher costs and not necessarily improved outcomes, and payment policies have not resulted in substantially reduced rehospitalizations.  [7] [8] 9] [10]  Remote monitoring technologies such as activity monitoring and text messaging may help facilitate support for patients outside of traditional clinical settings, and could be used to help clinicians improve outcomes for this population in a scalable way.  [11] [12] 2] [13] [14]  There is also an opportunity to integrate monitoring programs with the electronic health record, to ensure that this support occurs within the workflow and does not overburden clinicians.\n\nRemote monitoring can also incorporate new insights from behavioral science to improve effectiveness and improve clinical care.  11, 15 Behavioral science has revealed that humans have predictable biases that might be harnessed to improve health promoting behavior.  16, 17 For example, framing discharge home as the safest option and providing recovery milestones might invoke social norms for clinicians, gamification and goal-setting could increase activity levels among patients postdischarge, and social support could improve patients' adherence to clinical recommendations.  [18] [19] 9] [20]  Preliminary data showed that offering a remote monitoring program prior to hospitalization may encourage patients to elect to go home, and it may make clinicians feel more comfortable sending patients home.\n\nIn this pragmatic (conducted in routine practice) trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of offering activity monitoring and bidirectional text messaging on discharge to home and clinical outcomes after total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) among patients with intermediate risk of discharge to a facility. We also evaluated whether gamification and social support increased activity levels for the patients receiving monitoring."

Those in the intervention arm were invited to participate in activity monitoring by mailed invitation, which described the benefits of going home safely after surgery. Research staff followed up with up to 4 phone calls to discuss enrollment in the remote monitoring (HomeConnect+; University of Pennsylvania) program, and patients were given information about the benefits of remote monitoring with an activity monitor and text messaging.\n\nThis outreach occurred prior to hospitalization for surgery (eFigure in Supplement 2). Patients enrolled in study arm 2b also received feedback with motivational messages using goal-setting and gamification, and were asked to identify a support partner to receive messaging. For patients in this arm, the average step count in week 2 was considered baseline, and participants were encouraged to increase their step count by 5% every week to progress in reward levels. The levels at which patient can be rewarded are bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. All patients started at bronze at baseline. With appropriate progress, they moved in order to silver, gold and platinum levels. Social support partners for patients enrolled in this arm received messages if the participant did not upload activity data or submit pain scores for at least 4 days, asking the partner to reach out to the patient with support or encouragement.

Among the 150 patients who were offered the intervention, we anticipated that approximately 70 patients would enroll in and receive remote monitoring, based on the pilot study.

We used the independent group t test to compare the difference in mean daily step count from baseline to the end of the intervention between arms 2a and 2b. For secondary outcomes, we used the t test to compare differences in number of days at home, TUG score, number of rehospitalizations, and emergency department visits. We used the \u03c7 2 test of proportions to compare differences in rehospitalization rate. All analyses were performed using Stata statistical software version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC)."

      "text": "In this pragmatic randomized clinical trial, we found that the activity monitoring and text messaging program did not increase the rate of discharge to home after hip and knee arthroplasty, but was associated with a reduction in rehospitalizations. Activity levels were modest after hospital discharge, and gamification with social support did not significantly increase step count.\n\nThere are a few reasons why offering the intervention was not sufficient to increase discharge to home, despite a small pilot study suggesting potential benefit. First, the patients included in this trial were patients at intermediate risk with a RAPT score between 6 and 8, so they may have had physical or social barriers to going home that remote monitoring could not address. While RAPT score accurately estimates discharge disposition for patients at high and low risk, the evidence is limited about patients at intermediate risk.  23 Second, the decision about discharge disposition involves patients, family members, and an interdisciplinary team of clinicians and staff. Our intervention was low touch and introduced in the outpatient setting to patients, while the decision to discharge home is largely associated with the inpatient clinical team through discussions with the patient. Third, there were already other efforts to increase discharge to home at the participating hospitals, such as home physical therapy and counseling. In this pragmatic trial, we evaluated only the monitoring program in addition to usual care. Fourth, 81.4% of the patients agreed to receive monitoring, and many did not consistently use the activity monitors. In our intention-to-treat analysis, we included all patients who were randomized regardless of motivation to participate.\n\nNotably, 78.1% of the patients in the trial were women, who may have had a differential response to the intervention. To our knowledge, this study is also 1 of the largest to evaluate activity levels among patients undergoing THA and TKA after discharge using wearable devices. We found that gamification and social support did not significantly improve step count, despite prior studies showing effectiveness.\n\nOur results may differ for several reasons. First, step counts and increases were modest in the 6 weeks after hospital discharge, so this population may not have had the functional capacity to achieve substantial increases in activity.  29 Second, many participants struggled with getting the activity monitors and smartphone application to sync with the device. Third, the gamification was mainly gain-framed, and there could have been more effect from stronger loss-framed gamification, competition, or larger step goals.  19, 30 Prospect theory suggests that people respond asymmetrically to loss and gain perspectives. 31"

It was pragmatic in including all patients with an eligible RAPT score, and the waiver of informed consent allowed an examination of the kind of unrestricted patient population this program would apply to in routine clinical practice, maximizing potential generalizability to other populations. The study population was diverse, situated in 2 urban hospitals, and included 43% Black patients, who have had higher rates of adverse outcomes after the procedure.  32 is study had limitations. Although it did not demonstrate effectiveness against the primary outcome, discharge to home, it showed effectiveness against a prespecified secondary outcome, rehospitalization. The intervention itself was multimodal and whether specific elements of this compound intervention might be responsible for the favorable result is not clear. Future studies could specifically evaluate usability of technology and its association with clinical outcomes and adherence.  33, 34"

Patients enrolled in arm 2b also received feedback with motivational messages using goal-setting and gamification, and identified a support partner to receive messaging. A message was sent via the electronic health record to each enrolled patient's clinical care team, consisting of the surgeon, a nurse, and a social worker, notifying them of their patient's inclusion in the remote monitoring program to encourage the patient to go home after surgery.Patients in the intervention arms received an activity monitor, and if needed, a smartphone for texting and syncing their monitor to the Way to Health platform. These devices were either mailed to the patient for self-setup or set up in person after surgery at the hospital, depending on the patient's comfort level with technology. Patients randomized and enrolled in arm 2b monitoring were also asked to identify a support partner for the duration of the program.Remote monitoring and texting activities began at hospital discharge and were automated using the Way to Health platform. The intervention was offered to patients remotely in their homes or a facility after discharge. Patients in both intervention arms 2a and 2b received milestone messaging for recovery 1 to 3 times each week; message content was based on standard clinical materials given to patients. The activity tracker recorded daily step count and automatically transmitted step data to Way to Health. Participants were asked to report their pain score on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain) each day for 2 weeks after discharge. If patients recorded a pain score greater than or equal to 7, they received messaging to contact the orthopedic surgery clinic if the pain was unmanageable (\"Your pain score is high. If it feels unmanageable, call the Ortho hotline at [xxx-xxx-xxxx]\"). If patients' average step count decreased and mean pain score increased from the week before, study staff notified the patient's clinical care team via an electronic health record message. Participants were called if their activity data had not synced for at least 3 days. All participants in the intervention arms received a follow-up survey through text link at the end of the program asking about their experience with the program as indicated in the trial protocol (Supplement 1)."

      "description": "Patients in the intervention arms who agreed received a physical activity monitor (Withings), daily pain score tracking through bidirectional text messaging, messaging about postsurgery milestones, nonadherence messaging, and access to clinicians as needed (eFigure in Supplement 2). Patients enrolled in arm 2b also received feedback with motivational messages using goal-setting and gamification, and identified a support partner to receive messaging. A message was sent via the electronic health record to each enrolled patient's clinical care team, consisting of the surgeon, a nurse, and a social worker, notifying them of their patient's inclusion in the remote monitoring program to encourage the patient to go home after surgery.Patients in the intervention arms received an activity monitor, and if needed, a smartphone for texting and syncing their monitor to the Way to Health platform. These devices were either mailed to the patient for self-setup or set up in person after surgery at the hospital, depending on the patient's comfort level with technology. Patients randomized and enrolled in arm 2b monitoring were also asked to identify a support partner for the duration of the program.Remote monitoring and texting activities began at hospital discharge and were automated using the Way to Health platform. The intervention was offered to patients remotely in their homes or a facility after discharge. Patients in both intervention arms 2a and 2b received milestone messaging for recovery 1 to 3 times each week; message content was based on standard clinical materials given to patients. The activity tracker recorded daily step count and automatically transmitted step data to Way to Health. Participants were asked to report their pain score on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain) each day for 2 weeks after discharge. If patients recorded a pain score greater than or equal to 7, they received messaging to contact the orthopedic surgery clinic if the pain was unmanageable (\"Your pain score is high. If it feels unmanageable, call the Ortho hotline at [xxx-xxx-xxxx]\"). If patients' average step count decreased and mean pain score increased from the week before, study staff notified the patient's clinical care team via an electronic health record message. Participants were called if their activity data had not synced for at least 3 days. All participants in the intervention arms received a follow-up survey through text link at the end of the program asking about their experience with the program as indicated in the trial protocol (Supplement 1)."
