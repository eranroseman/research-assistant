  "title": "Evaluating acceptability and feasibility of a mobile health intervention to improve self-efficacy in prescription opioid tapering in patients with chronic pain: protocol for a pilot randomised, single-blind, controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Introduction Opioid medications are no longer recommended as long-term therapy for chronic noncancer pain, and many patients are advised to reduce or discontinue opioid medications. Many patients report difficulties in tapering opioid medications, necessitating supporting interventions. This protocol describes a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of a mobile health intervention to improve the opioid tapering selfefficacy of patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Methods and analysis The trial will be a single-blind (clinician, data collector and statistician-blinded) pilot RCT with two parallel arms. Forty adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain who are voluntarily reducing their prescribed opioid medications under medical guidance will be recruited from two tertiary pain clinics (Start date 25 August 2021). Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Both groups will receive usual care, including multidisciplinary pain management. In addition to usual care, the intervention group will receive a short informational and testimonial video about opioid tapering and will receive two specifically text messages per day for 28 days. The intervention is codesigned with patients and clinicians to provide evidence-based informational, motivational and emotional support to patients with chronic pain to taper opioid medications. Feasibility of the intervention and a future definitive RCT will be evaluated by measuring patient acceptability, delivery of the intervention, rates and reasons of exclusions and drop-outs, completion rates and missing data in the study questionnaires, and obtaining estimates for sample size determination. Potential efficacy will be evaluated by comparing changes in opioid tapering self-efficacy between the two groups. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Northern Sydney Local Health District (Australia). Study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific and professional meetings. \n Trial registration number ACTRN12621000795897. \u25ba This article describes the protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial with the clinicians, investigators, outcome assessors and statistician being blind to the group allocation. \u25ba The mobile health intervention was co-designed with input and feedback from patients with chronic non-cancer pain who had experienced tapering opioid medications and with clinicians experienced with providing support to patients who are tapering opioid medications. \u25ba The feasibility and acceptability measures and the pilot trial design (randomised controlled) will offer insight on whether a future definitive trial can be done and if so how. \u25ba Repeated weekly measures of opioid tapering selfefficacy, pain intensity and interference, and mood will offer insight into the potential effects of the intervention on participants' outcome trajectories. \u25ba The pilot study sample is recruited from two tertiary care multidisciplinary pain clinics, limiting the generalisability of the results to patients in primary care.

      "text": "Open access evidence supporting the efficacy of non-pharmacological approaches in chronic pain management.  [7] [8] 8] [9]  Consequently, many people with chronic pain are now being advised to reduce or discontinue opioid medications.  9 10 any people with chronic pain report some difficulties in tapering opioid medications, although experiences vary considerably.  [11] [12] 2] [13]  In the short term, opioid dose reductions can lead to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms and can adversely affect mood and pain.  [13] [14] 4] [15]  However, these adverse effects of opioid tapering are less likely when opioid doses are reduced voluntarily, slowly and on a schedule that is negotiated with the patient.  9 16 In addition, the trajectory of patients' experiences during opioid tapering has been associated with access to a variety of supports, including access to pain education, routine monitoring, a strong patient-provider relationship, social support and strategies for managing pain and withdrawal symptoms.  [16] [17] 7] [18] [19]  However, access to these supports for opioid tapering is a pervasive challenge.  14    15 20 21 Digital health interventions using mobile phones (mobile health or mHealth interventions) are emerging as a solution to the global challenge of providing patients with access to support for health behaviour change.  [22] [23] ] [24]  They are relatively cost-effective, scalable, and can be readily adapted to the needs of diverse demographic groups and chronic health conditions.  22    25  A recent systematic review found that digital health interventions can help to improve pain interference and severity, psychological distress and health-related quality of life in people with chronic pain.  26 However, evidence for the effectiveness of digital interventions to support patients with chronic pain to successfully reduce or discontinue prescription opioid medications is limited.  27 agee et al surveyed patients with chronic pain who had recently commenced a voluntary opioid taper to explore their attitudes towards using a digital health intervention (text messaging and mobile App) to support them with opioid dose reduction.  28 This research revealed two key findings: First, the majority of participants felt that mobile phone-based interventions (specifically text messaging, SMS) would be useful as a means of providing support for opioid tapering.  13    28  Participants indicated that text messages about the nature of chronic pain, pain self-management strategies, withdrawal symptoms and the benefits of tapering would provide them with instrumental, informational, motivational and emotional support. Second, participants indicated that the content of text messages should be familiar, acting as a reminder of helpful concepts and coping strategies rather than being the primary source of information.  28 ideos may be an effective means of providing patients with information about chronic pain, pain selfmanagement strategies and opioid tapering.  29    30  Darnall et al found that women undergoing breast cancer surgery who received a 90 min pain education and pain coping skills video (in addition to a downloadable personalised plan and digital relaxation audio file) discontinued opioid pain medications on average 5 days earlier than women who received written web-based general health information.  31 More recently, Feng et al found that a brief video about opioid tapering including patient testimonials increased the opioid-tapering self-efficacy of people currently on long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain.  29 ased on the foregoing research, we codesigned a mobile (video and SMS-based) health intervention to provide support for patients with chronic pain who are tapering opioids under the guidance of a healthcare provider. This study describes the protocol of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of this mHealth intervention."

These aims will be followed mainly by comparing opioid tapering self-efficacy between the intervention and control groups over the study period (4 weeks).\n\nOther measures including pain intensity, pain interference, mood (depression and anxiety), satisfaction with care, pain catastrophising, pain self-efficacy, opioid dose and experience of withdrawal symptoms are measured to (1) better understand the context in which the intervention is being delivered, (2) obtain estimates for secondary outcome measures and potential mediators and moderators to be used in the future trial and (3) evaluate the feasibility of such assessments."

The initial intervention design was then revised in response to feedback from panels of consumers and clinical experts (see Section 2.5. Interventions). Finally, we received feedback on the intervention implementation and study procedures from a patient who was tapering their opioid medications."

Usual care in both clinics includes chronic pain assessment and management by a multidisciplinary team of specialist pain medicine physicians, clinical psychologists, physiotherapists and nurses. Approaches to pain management are multidisciplinary, typically involving a combination of medical (procedural, pharmacological), psychological (group or individual cognitive-behavioural therapy for pain), and physiotherapy (exercise programmes delivered individually or in a group). Participants in the current study are those who are tapering their opioid medication under the guidance of the pain specialist physician. The decision to taper and tapering schedules are negotiated between the patient and pain physician, often in consultation with the psychologist and physiotherapist. Hence, the rate of opioid tapering is patient-centred and is not standardised. The pain specialist physician is responsible for the monitoring and management of withdrawal symptoms and other possible adverse events of opioid tapering.\n\nThe recruitment and participant enrolment was commenced on 25 August 2021 and is expected to continue until 1 May 2022, with the date of last data collection expected to be 1 June 2022."

      "title": "Potential efficacy measures",
      "text": "The main outcome measure we will use to evaluate the potential efficacy and obtain estimates for a future definitive trial is opioid tapering self-efficacy. Based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and guides for constructing self-efficacy scales,  45  with input and feedback from clinicians and patients, we have designed a one-item measure of general self-efficacy to taper prescription opioid in the presence of chronic pain: 'How confident are you at the present time that you can reduce your dose of opioid medication?'. Participants rate their confidence by selecting a number from 0 (anchored as 'not at all confident') to 100 (anchored as 'completely confident'). The face validity of the questionnaire was evaluated by a panel of clinicians during the codesign process and cognitive debriefing was done by interviewing six patients with chronic non-cancer pain who had experienced opioid tapering. In both groups, opioid tapering self-efficacy will be measured at baseline before randomisation and then at the end of each week of the trial. The intervention group (but not control) will complete this measure after watching the video.\n\nOther measures to evaluate the potential efficacy and to obtain estimates include changes in pain intensity, pain interference and mood which are measured at baseline and at the end of each week. Short-form versions of previously validated questionnaires will be used to minimise the burden on participants. Pain intensity and interference will be measured by thethree-item Pain, Enjoyment of Life and General Activity scale (PEG).  46 Anxiety will be measured with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 2-item  47  and depression will be measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-2.  48 e will also measure changes in opioid dose, pain catastrophising, pain self-efficacy, the experience of withdrawal symptoms and satisfaction with care. For the change in opioid dose, participants will self-report their medication (drug names, doses, regimen) at baseline. Each week during the trial, participants will be asked whether they had any change in their opioid dose in the past week using an open-ended question and if yes, to explain. The total daily opioid use will then be converted to mg of oral morphine equivalents.  49 We are not expecting a statistically significant change in opioid dose in the short duration of this trial (4 weeks). Typically, in a tertiary pain setting, patients reduce their dose very slowly to avoid withdrawal symptoms (eg, 10% reduction in dose per month) and it is important for tapering plans to be flexible.  50 Therefore, we have included change in opioid dose as a secondary outcome measure for descriptive and exploratory purposes.\n\nSimilarly, to monitor withdrawal symptoms, participants will be asked weekly with an open question if they had experienced any withdrawal symptoms in the past week, and if yes, to explain. They also will be asked if they felt unwell in any other way in the past week and, if yes, to explain. Based on this information, the cumulative incidence of withdrawal symptoms will be measured. Participants will complete the six-item Concerns about Pain Scale (CAP-6),  51  a new measure of pain catastrophising developed using a modern psychometric methodology. They will also complete the 10-item Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) which assesses confidence in ability to do tasks and activities despite pain.  52 The CAP-6 and PSEQ will be administered at baseline before randomisation and then at the end of week 4 of the trial. Participants will rate their current level of satisfaction with care on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 'very dissatisfied' to 'very satisfied' at the end of week 4. 17"

Participants will rate their current level of readiness using a single item 6-point Likert scale, with responses ranging from 'not ready' to 'very Ready', adapted from the EMPOWER study.  17 Patient expectations regarding tapering will be measured by asking participants to report 'What would you expect to happen to the following (PEG and mood) as a result of reducing your opioid medications over the next 4 weeks?', with response options including 'better', 'no change', 'worse', 'not Sure'. Participant autonomy (perceived degree of choice) to begin an opioid taper was measured with one item: 'To what extent was it your decision to reduce your dose of opioid medications?' ('completely my decision', 'shared decision' or 'not at all my decision'). The Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire  55  and Oslo Social Support Scale 56 will be used for measuring doctorpatient relationship and perceived social support, respectively.

RA1 will send the REDCap link to the participant's email for consenting online and completing the baseline assessments. After completing the baseline assessments, RA1 will randomly allocate the participant to the study groups based on the randomisation table in the REDCap.\n\nThe randomisation table (using block randomisation based on the study site) will be generated at the beginning of the study by an independent member of the Clinical Trial Unit at the Pain Management & Research Centre (PMRC) using the Research Randomiser software.  60 The table will be imported into the REDCap before the trial starts. Only the independent member of the PMRC Clinical Trial Unit will hold a copy of and have access to the randomisation table (access to this table in REDCap will be limited for the research team members). RA1 has no access to the randomisation table and only can see the assigned group after allocation by REDCap. Only RA1, who has access to the REDCap records and is aware of the group allocation, will be responsible for uploading the participant's details into the text message system (for the intervention group) but will not be involved in weekly data collection to prevent bias.\n\nParticipants will be notified by email of their trial group allocation within 24 hours of completing baselines measures. Participants in the control arm will be informed that 'you have been randomly allocated to the weekly assessment group. This means we will send you some short questionnaires to complete each week via email. This will help us to understand your experience over the next 4 weeks.' Those in the intervention arm will be advised that 'you have been randomly allocated to receive daily SMS-delivered support for opioid tapering over the next four weeks. Please use the link below to watch a 10-minute video (please turn your audio on) for some helpful information, and one question for you to answer.' Blinding Participants will be informed that they will be randomly allocated to either the intervention arm or the control arm of the trial. Participants cannot be blinded to the study arms due to the nature of the intervention. Treating clinicians will be blinded to the study arms. To improve blinding integrity, participants will be asked to not discuss their participation in the study or their intervention allocation with the clinician supervising their opioid tapering.  61 The independent member of the PMRC clinical trial unit who generates the table of randomisation for the REDCap will not have access to the participants' identities. The study RA1 who is involved in enrolment and putting participants' information into the SMS system will not be blinded to the group allocation but will not be involved in data collection. Data collection will be done by participants and online. If necessary, for data collection by phone call, the study RA2 who will perform data collection will be blinded to the study arms. Participants will be asked to not provide information about the group allocation to the study data collector. The statistician will be blinded to the study arms. Only SINs will be used in the database. At the end of the study, a group variable will be added to the study database and each group will be labelled as A or B (but not intervention and control) before sending the database to the statistician for statistical analyses.

      "text": "This study describes the protocol for a pilot RCT for a digital health intervention to support prescription opioid tapering. Specifically, the mHealth intervention will consist of a video and 4 weeks of twice-daily text messages. The intervention is designed to be a relatively cost-effective and scalable mode of support for patients with chronic pain who are voluntarily reducing or discontinuing their prescription opioid medications under the guidance of a healthcare provider. The pilot RCT's primary objectives are to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the mHealth (video and SMS) intervention and the trial methodology (recruitment, measures and methods). As a secondary objective, an analysis of potential efficacy will be conducted primarily on opioid tapering self-efficacy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Potential benefits and limitations",
      "text": "This study protocol will inform the development of a future definitive (well-powered) RCT to test the efficacy of the piloted mHealth intervention to support people with chronic non-cancer pain who are tapering opioids. The protocol has been codesigned in collaboration with patients with chronic pain and clinicians specialising in chronic pain management. Future research conducted to trial strategies for supporting patients to taper opioids may find it helpful to use the methodology described in this protocol to inform their own design and collaboration with patients.\n\nAs a pilot RCT, the protocol we have described primarily aims to answer questions of feasibility and acceptability. For this reason, we have not powered the study to formally test the hypothesis of efficacy, nor have we powered the study to adequately understand sources of individual differences in intervention efficacy. We acknowledge that some of the measurement instruments (eg, the opioid tapering selfefficacy scale) in this trial have not been previously validated. Hence, we will need to evaluate the distribution of the data generated by these measures prior to conducting statistical analyses. We also acknowledge that there may be substantial access variation in opioid dose changes attempted by participants over the 4-week study period, and there is likely to be significant variation in participants' satisfaction, engagement with and adherence to the 'usual care'. The benefit of heterogeneity in participants' opioid tapering schedules and usual care is that it maximises our opportunity to capture potential feasibility risks. The pilot RCT is also designed to be practical. It would be impractical and indeed antithetical to the principle of patient-centred care to standardise 'usual care' or standardise opioid tapering schedules. We also acknowledge that weekly changes in opioid medication use is self-reported, which is prone to bias. This method of assessment reflects the reality of clinical care delivered in the current study setting (Australia), where patients' adherence to opioid prescribing and tapering advice is not enforced or closely supervised but relies on patient self-report. To minimise the risk of social desirability effects on opioid dose reporting, participants are reminded that their weekly assessments, including medication reporting, will be confidential and not reported back to their clinician.\n\nFinally, the pilot protocol informs the development of a definitive RCT including patients with chronic pain who are receiving care in multidisciplinary pain clinics. The majority of people with chronic pain who are tapering their opioid medications are likely to be guided by a primary care provider (general practitioner). Only a small proportion of people with chronic pain receive multidisciplinary care from a tertiary pain clinic. Hence, at this early stage of research and development, the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of the mHealth intervention described in this protocol for patients in primary care, or patients who are tapering in the community without close supervision from a primary care provider, will remain unknown."
