  "title": "mHealth app using machine learning to increase physical activity in diabetes and depression: clinical trial protocol for the DIAMANTE Study",
  "abstract": "Introduction Depression and diabetes are highly disabling diseases with a high prevalence and high rate of comorbidity, particularly in low-income ethnic minority patients. Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual's behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods and analysis In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a textmessaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18-75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) >5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up. Ethics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB: 17-22608). We plan to",

      "text": "Both depression and diabetes are highly prevalent, often co-occurring diseases that are among the major causes of global disability.  [1] [2] ] [3]  Comorbid diabetes and depression are associated with a worse prognosis of both diseases, including a higher rate of complications of diabetes, greater disability and an increased risk of mortality.  4 Vulnerable populations, including low-income, low health literacy and ethnic minority individuals experience higher prevalences and worse outcomes for both diabetes and depression.  5 6 There is a great need for the development of treatments that can target overlapping risk factors for diabetes and depression. A growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) is such a risk factor: it is linked to both mental health and diabetic outcomes  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  Mobile applications have been found effective in helping patients engage in healthy behaviours including PA. For instance, a recent meta-analysis of nine RCTs concluded that smartphone apps that focus on PA have"

Further, mobile technology can help overcome existing barriers in access to care for vulnerable populations, including lower availability of psychological treatment in primary care settings, language and literacy barriers, stigma, cost and inflexible employment schedules.  17 Latinos in the USA in particular show higher underutilisation rates of mental health treatment than non-Latino whites.  18 Deploying effective mobile applications can therefore decrease existing decrease disparities in health. However, in the USA, low-income minority patients frequently receive their care in safety net settings (services in the public sector for those unable to attain private health insurance), where novel mobile technologies are not often designed, developed or implemented.  19 his translational gap increases the probability that these interventions will ultimately fail when implemented in actual clinical settings that serve vulnerable populations.\n\nFurther, most mobile applications that target behavioural changes are not personalised,  20  which could contribute to lower effect sizes of these interventions for trials with longer study durations (eg, over 3 months).  12 martphone interventions allow for data collection by passive sensing technologies, which offer an opportunity for tailoring and personalising interventions to users' behaviours, preferences and needs. Personalisation can be achieved by computer tailoring: tailoring interventions to observed behaviour and characteristics of the participant. This can include feedback, goal setting or user targeting (ie, conveying that communication is designed specifically for the user).  21 However, more complex forms of personalisation might be needed to increase and maintain engagement with PA interventions,  22  a requirement for a digital intervention to be effective.\n\nOne promising approach is to use adaptive learning, which allows the prediction of which content might be effective for users, learning from its previous actions and participant data collected by mobile phones.  23 For instance, an adaptive learning algorithm might be more effective as it can match motivation needs for each participant. Some intervention studies have attempted cultural tailoring to large groups of people. However, most tailoring approaches occur at the group level whereas we are bringing the tailoring down to the individual level.  24 esearch on the efficacy of these adaptive treatments is still in its early stages."

These clinics serve a diverse, chronically ill population and, as in many public hospital settings, they employ multiple part-time providers, creating the risk for lack of continuity of care that mobile health programmes may be able to supplement. Given that patients at the San Francisco Health Network were not routinely going to clinics for in-person visits at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, we had to alter recruitment strategies (Ramos et al,  27 2021) . In order to meet our recruitment targets within the funding timeline, we added a new online recruitment sample to the trial. Specifically, we placed targeted ads on Craigslist, Facebook, and Google to market the study to English-and Spanish-speaking individuals with diabetes living throughout the U.S. These The measures above were taken from validated questionnaires. *The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Physical Activity Stages of Change-Questionnaire (RM 1-FM), Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease (SEMCD), System Usability Scale, Leiden Index Depression Sensitivity-Revised (LEIDS-R), Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form (BADS-SF) and Social Support Scale were modified to match the sociodemographic characteristics of our patient population (ie, rephrasing to decrease literacy levels). The Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Behavioural Avoidance/Inhibition Scale (BAS/BIS), Mobile Phone Affinity Scale, Neighbourhood Scale, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness 3-item scale, Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) scale and System Usability were not modified. We translated the RM 1-FM, the Neighbourhood Scale, UCLA Loneliness 3-item subscale and Mobile Phone Affinity Scale questionnaires into Spanish. For the PHQ-8, GAD-7, BADS-SF, BAS/BIS, SEMCD, IPAQ, LEIDS-R, CAHPS scale and System Usability Scale, we used validated translated versions used in previous studies. The Spanish translations of the BADS-SF, LEIDS-R, SEMCD and IPAQ were modified to match the sociodemographic characteristics of our patient population (ie, rephrasing to decrease literacy levels). Open access social media ads targeted major metropolitan areas of the US with high proportions of patients with diabetes and/or larger proportions of Spanish-speaking residents, to have some similarities with the San Francisco Health Network recruitment sample."

Messages were designed to fit into these three dimensions. Before the start of the RCT, English and Spanish speaking patients tested the messages in the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform.

We use algorithms for contextual multiarmed bandit (MAB) problems, as these have been employed in different domains (including mobile health) and show promise to maximise cumulative rewards in sequential decision tasks (here, which sequences of messages optimally promote PA).  34 A contextual MAB problem is an RL setting in which the algorithm chooses between different treatment options which all have different reward functions. The reward functions depend on contextual variables.\n\nWe use Thompson Sampling, a Bayesian method, which will allow us to continuously learn which feedback and motivational messages are effective for a user, based on contextual features like their previous PA, demographic and clinical characteristics (such as age, gender and PHQ-8 scores). Thompson sampling can effectively deal with small amounts of data and addresses the exploration/exploitation tradeoff.  35 As such, it frequently picks out from the most rewarding messages and occasionally explores the messages with uncertainty in their reward.\n\nMore specifically, each morning, the algorithm evaluates which messages will likely increase the PA for every participant in the upcoming day, and at which time period the messages should be delivered. The algorithm training data consist of the historical data of all participants (contextual variables), which include which messages were sent previously and within which time periods, and select clinical/demographic data (such as age, language and depression scores) to improve prediction abilities.\n\nDuring the trial, patients will receive messages for 6 months.

We will compare this intervention to uniform random messages, delivered with equal and unchanging probabilities, and a control group that only receives a weekly mood message."

      "text": "Though the numbers of mHealth pilot studies are increasing in vulnerable populations, many of these fail to follow through with an implementation component to the study design.  42 Here, we are using a blended design: while the intervention is in addition to current care, there are ways we are attempting to make it more a part of patients' clinical care. For instance, patients are mainly approached through primary care health providers, which recommend eligible patients whom they think are directly interested in a PA intervention. In addition, we will make patients' data available to providers: a summary of the step increase for that patient at the conclusion of the study and updated PHQ-8 and GAD scores entered into the record. Our study therefore is the first step to addressing this gap because of its integration in primary care clinics that serve low-income patients. Future work should focus more specifically on implementation of the app as part of routine clinical care."

Although there are many different ways to measure PA, daily step count seems to be a particularly relevant measure because of: (1) its relative ease to measure, and (2) the clinical importance of individuals' walking behaviour. Low number of daily step counts have been associated with all-cause mortality in some longitudinal studies  43  and results from pooled population studies show clear dose-response effects of PA to overall mortality.  44 In patients with type 2 diabetes, several studies have now shown that increasing step counts can significantly decrease HbA1c levels. For instance, a 10 000 steps per day walking prescription increased steps and decreased HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes. 45"

      "text": "Further, Manjoo et al found that each SD increase in daily steps was associated with a 0.21% decrease in HbA1c.  46 owever, negative findings have also been reported. For instance, a meta-analysis by Qiu et al found that stepcounter use was associated with increased steps per day (over 1800 more steps compared with a control group) among people with diabetes, but not with lowering of HbA1c.  47 n exploratory post hoc analyses, we will also be able to examine the more immediate effect of PA messages, for example, on hourly steps in addition to daily steps, which will help to improve future PA interventions (eg, deliver messages at the right times). For instance, it is possible that one could receive a message in the morning and make plans to walk in the afternoon or evening, or messages could have more of an immediate impact. This information is currently unknown."

If mHealth interventions are not personalised, their efficacy might be low, due to low engagement and high drop-out rates.  20 The use of machine learning to adapt interventions according to users' characteristics and behaviours is still in its early stages, but shows promise.  48 For instance, Yov-Tom et al using an adaptive learning algorithm found that adaptive feedback messages were more effective in increasing the amount and speed of PA and also reduced HbA1c in sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes.  33 Further, Zhou et al showed short-term efficacy of using adaptive weekly step goals determined by RL in healthy patients.  49 he current study, with a relatively large group of patients, will further increase our understanding of the potential of machine-learning-driven text-messaging interventions."

      "text": "First, the results of this study might be specific to this population of low-income ethnic minority patients and might therefore not be generalisable to other populations. However, the inclusion of vulnerable patients in a primary care setting increases the likelihood that this intervention will be effective for other underserved populations. Further, our study procedures do not allow a double-blind design, as researchers and patients need to be made aware of the nature and frequency of messages they are receiving. Additionally, as with all digital interventions, technical issues might arise leading to unreliable step-count data and reduced ability for the algorithm to predict the most effective messages. The researchers and technical personnel will frequently check our server for data collection troubleshooting. Patients will also be made aware when their data are not collected correctly."

      "title": "Strengths",
      "text": "Diabetes and depression are among the top 10 causes of disability in the USA.  50 Developing cost-effective and scalable models of care for patients with common chronic conditions has been postulated as of key importance in improving the performance of healthcare systems.  51 If mHealth apps that target diabetes and depression through their common risk-factor physical inactivity are effective, they can have a major public health impact. Further, because the learning algorithm that we apply in this study is automated and delivers adaptive messages based on patients' behaviours, it can potentially be applied in other patient populations with a wide range of conditions.\n\nTo conclude, the outcome of this trial will provide information on the effectiveness of a text-message-based smartphone app that uses machine learning to increase PA in low-income ethnic minority patients in primary care settings. The results will provide key information on the effectiveness of adaptive mobile applications, compared with more traditional static digital interventions. If effective, this application has the ability to decrease healthcare disparities by providing a type of personalised care to a diverse and traditionally hard to reach group of underserved patients."

      "text": "Aguilera A, Figueroa CA, HernandezRamos R, et al. mHealth app using machine learning to increase physical activity in diabetes and depression: clinical trial protocol for the DIAMANTE Study. BMJ Open 2020;10:e034723. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034723\n\nThis article has been corrected since it was published online. The recruitment of participants into randomized trials was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe authors have updated the original DIAMANTE clinical trial protocol to document three large changes in the recruitment and data analysis plans for this study:\n\n1. Given that patients at the San Francisco Health Network were not routinely going to clinics for in-person visits at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, we had to alter recruitment strategies (Ramos et al, 2021). In order to meet our recruitment targets within the funding timeline, we added a new online recruitment sample to the trial. Specifically, we placed targeted ads on Craigslist, Facebook, and Google to market the study to English-and Spanish-speaking individuals with diabetes living throughout the U.S. These social media ads targeted major metropolitan areas of the US with high proportions of patients with diabetes and/or larger proportions of Spanish-speaking residents, to have some similarities with the San Francisco Health Network recruitment sample. 2. Importantly, the inclusion criteria for the study were unchanged with this additional sampling. All participants recruited online screened positive for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8>5), as well as self-reported a diabetes diagnosis from a medical professional (Bang et al, 2009). In addition, all online participants completed full informed consent and verified smartphone ownership by downloading the DIAMANTE app prior to study enrollment. 3. With the addition of a new online recruitment pool geographically dispersed across the U.S., we were no longer able to capture clinical outcomes among all participants, specifically haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurement. Therefore, HbA1c was removed as a secondary outcome for the trial. Importantly, the primary outcome of step count collected via the smartphone app, as well as secondary mental health and usage/usability outcomes, were not affected. 4. Finally, given the potential differences in study samples from the San Francisco Health Network and the online social media recruitment pool, we added a new secondary analysis to examine the impact of the intervention stratified by these two recruitment sources. The primary analysis examining the impact of adaptive and random text messaging within the RCT arms was unaffected by the additional recruitment source."
