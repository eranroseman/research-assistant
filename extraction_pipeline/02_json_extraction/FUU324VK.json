  "title": "An ancillary genomics system to support the return of pharmacogenomic results",
  "abstract": "Existing approaches to managing genetic and genomic test results from external laboratories typically include filing of text reports within the electronic health record, making them unavailable in many cases for clinical decision support. Even when structured computable results are available, the lack of adopted standards requires considerations for processing the results into actionable knowledge, in addition to storage and management of the data. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an ancillary genomics system used to receive and process heterogeneous results from external laboratories, which returns a descriptive phenotype to the electronic health record in support of pharmacogenetic clinical decision support.",

      "title": "BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE",
      "text": "Many institutions have adopted genetic testing as part of clinical care, with some exploring how computable representations of genetic and genomic results in the electronic health record (EHR) can facilitate clinical decision support (CDS).  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  However, despite established standards for the computable representation of these results,  9  this level of integration has not seen wide adoption outside of the research setting.  10, 11 Genetic test results are generally returned as a plain-text representation of the interpretation report and transmitted using the Health Level 7 (HL7) v2 standard, or more commonly as PDFs that must be scanned from a fax or downloaded from an external laboratory portal.\n\nSeveral national initiatives, including the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network,  12, 13  the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research consortium,  14  the Implementing Ge-nomics in Practice network,  15  and the Displaying and Integrating Genetic Information Through the EHR Action Collaborative  16  have proposed models, as well as demonstrated successful strategies, for better integration of results. The eMERGE network proposed the concept of an omics ancillary system, which receives structured, computable results from a laboratory, stores the results in an optimized manner for specialized processing (similar to a picture archiving and communications system for imaging), and returns actionable information to the EHR.  17 dditionally, individual institutions have developed tools to manage genetic data  5, 18  ; however these are typically tied a single laboratory source, and do not facilitate transmission of structured genetic results to the EHR itself. As many healthcare institutions work with several different third-party laboratories to provide genetic testing services, the ability to manage structured results from different external sources is important, yet not well addressed.\n\nIn this article, we present the design and implementation of an ancillary genomics system (AGS) to manage genetic test results from 2 external laboratories and return them to the EHR in a computable manner to facilitate CDS."

We consented patients from Northwestern Medicine's internal medicine practice who provided blood samples that were genotyped at 1 of 2 CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-certified laboratories (Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins DNA Diagnostic Laboratory). Both patients and their primary care providers received genotype results for 4 genes (CYP2C19, SLCO1B1, CYP2C9, and VKORC1) and genotypeguided prescribing information for 3 drugs (clopidogrel, simvastatin, and warfarin).\n\nThe development of the AGS to manage the processing and return of results was conducted by a multidisciplinary team and included physicians, genetic counselors, informaticians, health information technology leadership, EHR analysts, and software developers. During biweekly meetings, the team discussed design objectives and provided feedback to the software development team during the development process."

The overall system architecture is shown in Figure  1 ."

    {
      "title": "Computed observations",
      "text": "To address design objective 3, we introduced the concept of the \"computed observation.\" The computed observation is a synthesis of the genetic test results and describes the predicted phenotype as opposed to requiring a provider to mentally translate this from the genotype. For example, instead of reporting the specific diplotypes for a gene (eg, CYP2C19 *2/*2), the computed observation describes the predicted metabolizer category for a medication (eg, \"Clopidogrel Poor Metabolizer\"). This not only makes CDS easier to implement, but also is intended to be more intuitively understandable by practicing clinicians."

      "title": "Laboratory data format",
      "text": "As part of the eMERGE-PGx study, each laboratory agreed to provide results as Microsoft Excel documents containing structured results and interpretive text. Each laboratory used unique formats for returning results: one provided results as pharmacogenetic star alleles for each of the 4 genes of interest (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, SLCO1B1, VKORC1), while the other provided 19 SNPs across 6 genes (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, SLCO1B1, VKORC1, TPMT, CYP3A5). A list of fields provided by each laboratory is provided in Supplementary Appendix A."

Attributes were represented as a hierarchy with parent-child relationships. An example of this is the top of the tree representing a generic attribute for results in the CYP2C19 gene, and more specific representations (eg, CYP2C19 SNP) are represented as descendant attributes (additional details in the Supplementary Material). The hierarchical nature simplified querying related concepts (eg, \"return all CYP2C19 results\"). The attribute hierarchy used was developed manually for the project in response to the types of results provided by each laboratory and is not derived from any standard ontology."

      "title": "Result analysis",

The processing flow is illustrated in Figure  2  and generally follows the sequence outlined in Table  1 . During these processing steps, the AGS tracked all data transformation and lookup steps applied to the data. Processing included several steps to normalize the results (described further in Supplymentary Appendix C). A lookup table mapped the normalized results to an actionable interpretation, based on guidelines developed by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium.  20 If no entry was found, the record was noted as having an \"Unknown\" interpretation, which flagged it for further review."

      "title": "Results review",
      "text": "The AGS portal provided a web-based interface through which genetic counselors involved with the study could review and release results. The AGS portal contained a worklist for managing the review process and was designed to provide a 2-step review where a genetic counselor would first review the generated result and interpretive text. Users had the ability to modify the generated report if additional supporting text was needed, and the system would confirm that the patient demographics in the AGS matched those in the EHR.\n\nOnce reviewed, the result was marked as \"Approved.\" Because of the large number of results returned in a single batch from the laboratories, and based on feedback from the physicians enrolled in the study, a second step was added to manage releasing approved results to the EHR in smaller quantities (10-25) at more consistent intervals (typically once or twice per week)."

Each participant had 3 observations generated (1 each for clopidogrel, simvastatin, and warfarin), for 2238 observations total. Observations were reviewed and returned to the EHR between June 6, 2014, and September 14, 2015. As of October 2018, there have been no changes in how results were interpreted that required results to be reprocessed.\n\nThe AGS received results for 448 participants from Mount Sinai, and 304 from Johns Hopkins DDL. There were 3 participants with results from both laboratories, with 100% concordance in the AGS interpretation of both sets."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this study, we demonstrated an ancillary genomics system capable of processing heterogeneous genomic results from external laboratories and representing them as computed observations, in accordance with our design objectives. Although not demonstrated in the course of this study, our AGS was designed to reinterpret results as new data or changes in interpretation are made available. The use of a portal to review and release results to the EHR allowed us to manage the number of results a provider received at one time. The format of the computed observations allowed us to also simplify the implementation of CDS rules in the EHR. A full description of our CDS implementation is outside of the scope of this article, but briefly a CDS rule for a particular drug metabolism status could be written as a single condition (eg, \"If observation \u00bc 'Clopidogrel Poor Metabolizer'\") as opposed to all possible permutations of laboratory values (eg, \"If observation \u00bc *2/*2 OR observation \u00bc *2/*3. . .\").\n\nOrganizations have different needs for managing genetic and genomic results, as is evident when reviewing existing implementations.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 5] [6] 18, 21, 22  With respect to the granularity of results, St. Jude's Children Hospital successfully integrated diplotypes from an external laboratory in their EHR,  1, 6  and demonstrated that this level of granularity is acceptable to providers. The NEXT program at the University of Washington represented results at the gene levelflagging if the gene had any known variants-which was found to be too coarse of a level of granularity for CDS.  7 The Mayo Clinic has successfully implemented PGx CDS at their institution,  3, 4  working with their internal laboratory to return data to their EHR, including populating problem and alert lists with phenotype results per gene, as opposed to a specific medication (eg, \"Metabolizer CYP2C19 Poor\"). Given the myriad approaches, additional research is needed to better understand physicians' perspectives on the opti- mal level of granularity. The architecture of our AGS allows us to modify the granularity of results for future studies.\n\nMount Sinai developed and implemented a system as part of their CLIPMERGE PGx program,  5  which receives results from their internal laboratory and acts as their CDS rules engine. The GeneInsight platform developed at Partner's HealthCare 18 supports a laboratory workflow to annotate results, generate interpretive reports that are transmitted to the EHR, and manages re-interpretation of results when the underlying knowledge base is updated.  23 GeneInsight offers a clinical portal for the review of results,  [24] [25] [26]  and is capable of returning structured results in addition to PDF reports. Each of these implementations follows an ancillary omics model,  17  with variations based on institutional preference (eg, the CLIP-MERGE decision to use the system to fire CDS rules), and workflow (eg, GeneInsight's management of laboratory processes). Institutions integrating genomic results into their EHR will have similar considerations to make when implementing a solution.\n\nWe note that the lack of an adopted standardized format for results increased the overall programmatic work, requiring us to import and translate results from each laboratory. Ongoing work within HL7  27, 28  and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health 29 are evaluating the use of standards for sequencing results, but broad implementation within laboratory systems will be critical to scale this approach. For the computed observations created by the AGS, while the work presented here used HL7 v2, the computed observations could be represented using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard.  30 This is a planned area of development, as more EHRs provide inbound Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces. Likewise, no computable knowledge bases exist to translate laboratory results into phenotypic representations. A shareable source of knowledge to perform this translation would aid future adoption by other institutions and system developers, and could be based upon translation tables provided by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (eg, simvastatin/ SLCO1B1  31  ).\n\nWithin our study, we note some limitations. The AGS was optimized for genetic counselors to review and release computed observations, as opposed to aiding in the interpretation of rare variants, and may not meet the needs of all institutions. In addition, although the AGS is capable of reprocessing results given new knowledge, the absence of changes during our PGx study precluded us from demonstrating this. This capability was tested during development. Furthermore, while it has been architected to be modular and transportable, to date it has only been implemented at our institution.\n\nFuture work currently underway includes better integration with sites such as ClinGen,  32  which offer supporting, context-aware information resources to aid in decision making; the inclusion of sequencing results, which include more than PGx findings; and the use of a structured XML format to represent individual sequencing results."
