  "title": "Effectiveness of a Multi-faceted mHealth Intervention on Adherence to Medication and Treatment Outcome Among Patients with Hypertension in a Lower-Middle-Income Country: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: The high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in Pakistan is predominantly attributed to poor drug adherence. Mobile phone innovations are cheap, ubiquitous, and culturally acceptable tools for behavioral change. As more than 137 million populations in Pakistan use mobile phones, a suitable mobile health (mHealth) module can be a suitable and effective tool to overcome poor drug adherence. Objective: This study sought to determine whether a novel mobile health intervention was useful in enhancing adherence to antihypertensive therapy and treatment outcomes among patients with hypertension in a developing country. \n Methods: A parallel, single-blinded, superiority randomized controlled trial of six months duration recruited 439 hypertensive patients at a public hospital in Pakistan, with poor adherence to antihypertensive therapy and access to smartphones. An innovative multifaceted, mHealth intervention, \"Multi-Aid-Package\", based on the Health Belief Model was developed for the intervention group. The novel module contained written, audio & visual reminders, infographics, video clips, educational content, and 24/7 individual support, while the control group only received standard care. The primary outcome was selfreported medication adherence measured using the Self-efficacy for Appropriate Medication Adherence Scale (SEAMS) and pillcounting. The secondary outcome was a systolic blood pressure (SBP) change. Both outcomes were evaluated at the baseline and 6 months. Technology acceptance feedback was also assessed at the end of the study. Results: Of 439 participants, 423 could complete the study. In the control group, 10 participants were lost to follow-up, while one withdrew his consent. In the intervention group, 6 participants were lost to follow-up. At six months post-intervention, the median SEAMS score was higher in the intervention group (32, IQR 11) compared to the controls (21, IQR 6), and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Within the intervention group, there was also an improvement of 12.5 points between baseline and 6 months (P<0.001). By using the pill-counting method, there was an increase in adherent patients between the intervention and the control groups (difference of 81 patients, P<0.001), as well as within groups (difference of 83 patients; baseline vs 6 months, P<0.001). As for the SBP, between groups, there was a statistically significant difference in SBP of 7mmHg (P<0.001) at 6 months, while within groups, there was a reduction by 4mmHg (P<0.001) within the intervention group, but there was an increase by 3mmHg (P=0.314) in the controls. Overall, the number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension was reduced by 46 patients in the intervention group (baseline vs 6 months), but the controls remained unchanged. The Multi-Aid-Package received a 94.8% acceptability score. \n Conclusions: The novel \"Multi-Aid-Package\" is an effective mHealth module in enhancing adherence to medication and treatment outcomes among patients with hypertension in a developing country.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Hypertension is a significant global health challenge and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality  [1] . In the twenty-first century, hypertension has become a growing global health issue. It is expected to increase from 918 million individuals in 2000 to 1.56 billion in 2025  [1] . Compared to highincome countries, the prevalence of hypertension among adults was more remarkable in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)  [2, 3] . Hypertension is responsible for approximately 9.4 million fatalities worldwide, making it a significant cause of death  [4] . These deaths are mostly preventable, as lowering SBP can lessen fatalities from all causes and cardiovascular disease  [5] .\n\nThe risk of mortality rates from cardiovascular events and stroke is lowered by twofold for each 20 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure or 10 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure between the ages of 40 and 69 years  [6] . The dosage of blood pressure medications administered and adherence to therapy are two important aspects that influence blood pressure control in patients receiving treatment with clinically corrected blood pressure levels. Patient compliance is a critical aspect of blood pressure management, and medication is worthless for those who refuse to take it  [7] . What is more worrying is the chronic nature of hypertension and the need to be compliant with the medications usually for more than one year. It has been noted that one year after starting antihypertensive medication, 50% of people still use it  [8, 9] . Unfortunately, in general, the percentage of treated hypertensive patients who achieve control levels are only between 20% and 50%  [10, 11] .\n\nIn Pakistan, hypertension is a crucial matter of public health where nearly 19% of youth and 33% of individuals over 45 have hypertension with the majority of the hypertensive population having poor blood pressure control  [12] . Poor medication adherence has been noted to contribute to poor blood pressure control in Pakistan  [13] . A recent research investigation found that 37.7% of patients failed to take their antihypertensive drugs as directed  [13] . This situation is of concern because as mentioned, medication adherence is a proven and cost-effective treatment for hypertension  [14]  apart from lifestyle modification and medical risk assessment. Furthermore, medications may lower the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction by 30% and 15% respectively among the hypertensive population  [15] . Lower levels of adherence are connected to poorer blood pressure control and unfavorable outcomes  [16] .\n\nSince a few years ago, there has been an upsurge in the use of mHealth programs to improve medication compliance  [17, 18] . Using mobile technology, such as cell phones, personal digital assistants, patient monitoring equipment, and other wireless devices, medical care is referred to as \"mHealth\"  [19] . mHealth is an ideal tool for LMICs due to its low cost and ease of usage. For mHealth, all that is required are mobile devices, cellular communication technologies, and an internet connection. According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, more than 137 million Pakistanis use mobile phones, corresponding to a cellular density of 77% of the population [20]. However, despite the growing popularity of mobile phones in LMICs, mHealth approaches in these countries remain limited.\n\nFurthermore, no specific association for the usefulness of mobile health in enhancing drug adherence in cardiovascular illnesses in LMICs has been shown to date  [21] . Several studies have suggested for further investigations to determine whether mHealth can enhance medication adherence in LMICs  [21, 22] , compared to traditional methods  [23] . WhatsApp facilitates the collection of 'real-time' data over both time and place. The WhatsApp software offers a plethora of health-related uses, including for optimizing communication and the delivery of health education  [24, 25] . A survey found that Pakistanis primarily use social media for communication and information exchange in the health sector, with WhatsApp and YouTube being the most widely used social media platforms for health-related topics  [26] . Several important observations, particularly those gleaned from the body of existing literature  [26] , guide our decision to use WhatsApp in implementing this cutting-edge intervention since it is an efficient way to provide interventions with respect to cost, time, and dissemination.\n\nUsing the Health Belief Model  [27]  and Self-Determination Theory  [28] , as a foundation a novel mHealth intervention module for the hypertensive population of low-and middle-income countries, particularly Pakistan, was created. The module was called the Multi-Aid-Package. It was a multifaceted intervention integrated with educational guidelines and a reminder component. The module addressed individual patients' perspectives and concerns and incited health-related beliefs toward better drug adherence. This trial's distinctive feature is its all-encompassing, multimodal strategy, which combines various previous interventions  [29] [30] [31]  into one single intervention. Second, animated images and videos were used in place of text in the current study. Therefore, as far as we are aware, this is the first study in Pakistan that we are aware of to generate and assess the efficacy of a comprehensive and multifaceted mHealth intervention.\n\nConsequently, this study sought to use mHealth-based multifaceted intervention utilizing WhattsAp to help patients who were not adhering to their medication and to assess the efficiency of the Multi-Aid-Package, in optimizing adherence to medication and SBP among patients with hypertension in the LMIC context. We hypothesized that this mHealth module intervention would improve medication adherence, lower systolic blood pressure, and eventually lower mortality and morbidity of hypertension."

The selection process was conducted by specially assigned registrars who screened the patients by utilizing the Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication Scale (SEAMS)  [35]  and by asking the patients the number of tablets consumed during a specified period  [36] . Despite the fact that these two approaches to measuring medication adherence are distinct, both adherence measures were used in this trial for inclusion/exclusion considerations. Only those who satisfied both criteria were recruited. Due to the selection criteria's restriction to using both approaches, any participant could be classified as nonadherent. These results indicated the patients' medication adherence status. Based on these assessments and other eligibility criteria, 439 participants were selected. Each participant provided informed consent. Each participant was given an identification number to ensure confidentiality and protect their identity. The information collected was socio-demographic, healthrelated profiles, baseline the SEAMS score, and pill-counting (representing medication adherence status). All the information collected was a thorough face-to-face interview conducted by trained research staff. In addition, each participant's baseline SBP reading was also recorded."

Based on prior studies, a cut-off value of 80% was employed to distinguish between adherence status and non-adherence status. Patients who scored less than 80% were categorized as non-adherents, while those who scored 80% and more were classified as adherents  [41] .\n\nThe secondary outcome was the participants' systolic blood pressure (SBP) change at six months. This outcome was assessed at the hospital by a nurse who was not aware of the allocation of the study participant. Blood pressure was measured using a calibrated upper-arm mercury sphygmomanometer (MODEL-605P YAMASU). Standard principles were used to measure the participant's blood pressure  [42] .\n\nAt the baseline, three and six months later, both the primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated. The three-month analysis was utilized as a bridge to evaluate the patterns of attrition rate, and the trends of change in outcomes. It was done as an interim analysis therefore, the three-month analysis was not reported. The six-month analysis was regarded as the final."

      "title": "Intervention",
      "text": "The intervention's main objective was to enhance adherence to antihypertensive therapy in the intervention group using a novel mHealth module. Multiple procedures were used in the intervention development. The first step was doing a thorough literature search on the theories and determinants of medication non-adherence. Additionally, hypotheses on patient acceptance of electronic/mobile devices were looked up in the accessible literature. The procedure for consulting with a group of specialists came next. Experts in epidemiology, behavioral intervention, health education, information and technology, and cardiology specializing in hypertension management used the Health Belief Model, Self-Determination Theory, and relevant clinical standards and recommendations in the development of this module.\n\nThe content of this module included seven items, a multifaceted approach with educational instructions, and reminders. The Multi-Aid-Package comprised written and voice reminders, as well as Graphics-based Reminders (GBR) and Graphics-based Messages (GBM), which were all disseminated daily and weekly to the participants in the intervention group via a mobile application (\"WhatsApp\").\n\nReminder text and voice messages for medication intake were in Urdu, as it was the most commonly used language among the study participants. Examples of the contents of such messages are \"Good morning, It's time for your medication\" and \"Good morning, this is a reminder for you to take your pills (see items 1& 3 in figure  1 ).\"\n\nGraphics-based Messages (GBM) were an animated series of messages developed with the help of a professional team of software developers (see item 4 in figure  1 ). Furthermore, an animated video was also created by information technology (IT) professionals with the help of clinical experts. The resulting animated video was divided into three sections: 1) awareness of hypertension, 2) the negative consequences of uncontrolled hypertension, and 3) medical and lifestyle changes for better health (see item 5 in figure  1 ). In this module, participants were also given the \"Hypertension at a Glance\" component, a portfolio of instructional and educational tools that provided details about the condition's causes, diagnosis, treatment, complications, and prognosis (see item 6 in figure  1 ).\n\nIn addition to the components mentioned earlier, the module also contained live support provided by a certified doctor 24 hours a day. The support included information on the medicine's dose, the frequency of dose, the administration method, effects of therapy on present sickness, adverse effects, and interactions with particular meals (see item 7 in figure  1 ). Live support and \"Hypertension at a Glance\" portfolio were provided on a demand or a need basis to the only participants who encountered problems from the first day of the intervention while the remaining components of the Multi-Aid-Package were disseminated following the timetable provided. The contents of the Multi-Aid-Package are summarized below (Figure  1 )."

      "text": "In addition, the Multi-Aid-Package was subject to a pilot test among 44 hypertensive patients to determine if they could understand the module's contents. As per usual hospital practice, only standard care was given to those in the control group. After being pilot tested, the intervention didn't change significantly. Only a few minor issues were seen, such as delivery issues, network issues, being outside of the coverage region, and unsuccessful file and video downloads. During the trial, this application's final version was made available. Implementation of Multi-Aid-Package The trial's design and execution adhered to the 2010 CONSORT criteria, which included a rigorous protocol for the provision of the intervention to the participants. It includes the validation of the Multi-Aid-Package intervention by pilot study and an orientation and training session on intervention was provided to the intervention participants. Contact numbers were also provided to the participants in case they experienced any inconvenience. Moreover, a strict protocol was followed to disseminate the various contents of a multifaceted intervention. The implementation of the Multi-Aid-Package was coordinated with the assistance of an information technology (IT) specialist and two trained research assistants. In essence, these individuals were tasked to oversee the dissemination of the various contents of the Multi-Aid-Package to the intervention group's participants via WhatsApp and to support the data collection. WhatsApp was used in this study because it contains a feature on its interface that can indicate to the sender if the receiver has seen the message. There is a sign (\uf0fc) on the message sent through this application, which color turns blue if the recipient has seen the message. This was the only way to check whether the participants had read the message or not. There was no other way to find out any further information. Secondly, the results of the outcomes illustrate whether the participants took their medication as prescribed. Training research staff members and pretesting the intervention were used to ensure quality control. Employing a pre-established curriculum for training by experts, two days of on-site instruction sessions on hypertension, questionnaire completion, and how to respond to typical queries related to medication adherence were given to all recruited research workers. Finally, the intervention module was rolled out to the selected participants in the current trial. The following figure shows the overall flow of the implementation of the study (Figure 2).\n\nNo financial or other benefits were provided to the participants except 6 months free of cost WhatsApp package to intervention participants. There were no other direct benefits provided to the participants of the study."

Self-efficacy for Appropriate Medication Adherence Scale (SEAMS) was a a validated and reliable questionnaire  [44] . The SEAMS, a 13-item assessment of drug self-efficacy in managing chronic conditions, was found appropriate for individuals with limited literacy  [44] . The SEAMS utilizes a threepoint answer scale, where 1 denotes a lack of confidence, 2 denotes a moderate level of confidence, and 3 denotes a high level of confidence. 13 to 39 points were the conceivable scores. Greater drug adherence was associated with higher scores, and vice versa.\n\nParticipants were questioned regarding the number of tablets they had been prescribed for a certain period, the number of tablets they had consumed, and the number of tablets they had forgotten to take for that certain period. Adherence rates were then calculated  [40] . Adherence status was coded as \"adherent\" or \"non-adherent.\" Adherence rate \u2265 80% was taken as \"adherent,\" while <80% was \"nonadherent.\" At the baseline, all the participants were nonadherent, therefore no further analysis could be done.\n\nThe secondary outcome SBP change was assessed by using a calibrated upper-arm mercury sphygmomanometer (MODEL-605P YAMASU). Standard principles were used to measure the participant's blood pressure  [42] .\n\nPost-intervention survey for the acceptability of the intervention was assessed by a five-item Likert scale, each item with seven options, was used to evaluate for usefulness, simplicity of use, and fulfillment of information."

      "text": "The comprehensive and unique multifaceted module comprised of seven potential components, including continuous reminders integrated with education and support components, Multi-Aid-Package, was designed for the intervention group, thereby revealing a significant increase in adherence to antihypertensive medication and substantial reduction in SBP in patients with hypertension. This study showed that the Multi-Aid Package elaborated a significant improvement in medication adherence among patients who were nonadherent to their antihypertensive medication at the beginning of the trial.\n\nSimilar results from an existing body of literature concur with the current trial's findings, where text messaging interventions revealed positive results compared to controls in hypertensive patients  [18, 30] . Some trials also showed significant results in hypertensive patients using advanced mobile phone apps  [51] [52] [53] . Overall, mHealth technology interventions revealed positive results in cardiovascular disease patients  [54] . In another trial, the text message intervention demonstrated substantial improvement in adherence to treatment from 49.0% to 62.3% in hypertensive patients  [55] . In previous literature, mHealth interventions have been reported to lower blood pressure and improve medication adherence with adequate acceptance and feasibility  [17, 24, [56] [57] [58] [59] . Patients also benefit significantly and over time from self-management and blood pressure control  [60] [61] [62] [63] . However, a few trials were unable to reveal any significant improvement in medication adherence post-intervention; one used a mobile app, while the other studies used a web-based talking intervention to enhance drug adherence to CVD  [17, 64] . Similarly, another trial utilizing mailing and automated calls  [65] , and other used video intervention in stroke patients  [66]  remained unable to reveal any substantial change. mHealth was also paramount in the treatment adherence of other chronic illnesses, such as tuberculosis, CVD, Diabetes and chronic liver diseases (CLDs)  [67] [68] [69] [70] .\n\nmultiple facets (text messages, apps, interactive messages, and calls) in one application, compared to only one or two facets per application in other interventions.\n\nPrevious trials employed different facets of mHealth, for instance, text messaging interventions utilized to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication  [30, 71] , interactive voice interventions  [72] , talking treatment intervention  [64] , advanced mobile apps  [51, 53] , and mail-outs  [65] . Some of these interventions demonstrated positive results, while others remained unable to reveal any improvement or insignificant improvement in adherence to antihypertensive treatment. The unique aspect of this current study was that the Multi-Aid-Package intervention comprised multi-facets in one intervention. The Multi-Aid-Package is superior because it contains seven different parts such as text messaging, videos, and graphics.\n\nThe Multi-Aid package is a comprehensive and effective tool for enhancing antihypertensive treatment adherence and subsequently managing SBP. Much pre-existing literature supports current findings. In most studies, intervention group participants reported being adherent more likely compared to the controls, where the intervention eventually altered health beliefs concerning drug adherence, but was unable to show any significant effect on systolic blood pressure. For example, a mobile phone app for hypertensive patients in an intervention group improved drug adherence but failed to significantly control systolic blood pressure compared to the control arm  [51] . Similarly, another 12-month trial found a minor change in SBP  [30]  compared to our study which revealed better results even with shorter duration. mHealth intervention was also influential in changing lifestyles  [71] . Although no significant or minute change in systolic blood pressure despite considerable improvement in adherence could have various explanations, the nearer to the factual evidence is a reasonably long time needed to see a change in clinical outcome. Although it was reported that becoming highly adherent to the therapy is essential. The literature also emphasized that to obtain more clinical benefits, patients must strictly adhere to their antihypertensive drugs  [73] .\n\nThere was no evidence of the efficiency of interventions in lowering DBP, although increased SBP is the primary aim of antihypertensive medication. Furthermore, according to epidemiological research, untreated hypertension, especially SBP, ought to be the main goal for hypertension treatment  [74] .\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to emphasize that using Multi-Aid-Package in the framework of clinical care in a resource limit setting can stand alone to support patients in managing their hypertension. Several studies have found that improving medication adherence has a higher impact on clinical outcomes linked to additional assistance, primarily through connections to healthcare professionals  [75] . Some effective interventions found that support via a mobile phone can be provided without further blood pressure monitoring  [76]  and with nonadherent patients not being contacted by any healthcare providers  [77] . In our study, there was no permanent connection between the patient, the healthcare provider, or the targeted blood pressure monitor. Conclusively, to our knowledge, this multifaceted approach is the first intervention in Pakistan to be built comprehensively and uniquely technology-based intervention that utilized only WhatsApp, which was cost, time, and resource-efficient. In contrast to prior mobile phone-based interventions, this multifaceted intervention had a more substantial impact on adherence and systolic blood pressure."

      "title": "Future Suggestions",
      "text": "Further exploration of the study by covering multiple cities, a large sample size, and a longer duration of follow-ups are required to validate the results. The current study's findings cannot be generalized to populations with different sociodemographic and medical profiles, so more diverse studies are required to generalize the findings to a wider population. There are recommendations for more sophisticated designs and efficient interventions to enhance adherence in cardiovascular diseases  [22] . To improve outcomes, we suggest implementing new educational interventions with more effective designs and sophisticated adherence measurement techniques (mobile apps or devices) at relatively low cost and implementing successful treatments in clinical settings. A recent study compared an innovative mHealth strategy to peer-counseling to improve adherence to medication in hypertensive patients  [54] . Future trials should include the type of antihypertensive medication being taken in their study. Finally, high-quality research is needed to explore mixed qualitative evidence with quantitative studies."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "Two methods were used to measure medication adherence to strengthen the method of measurement and to robust our findings. It was supported by a preexisting body of literature on the subject  [78] . Systolic blood pressure was also assessed as a secondary outcome to increase the credibility of adherence to medication in patients with hypertension. An interim analysis was performed to monitor the drop-out status, increasing the trial's strength. All the steps of the trial were in line with recent SPIRIT Guidelines  [79] . Multi-Aid-Package intervention would help minimize inequity and prevent discrimination among different sociodemographic groups. Technology acceptance feedback was also assessed at the study's end and received excellent feedback.\n\nThis trial has a few limitations. First, the study was a single-center study conducted in only one city due to time constraints, availability of limited funds, and response burden. Therefore, extension over the entire province or multiple towns might be impossible. The possible effect size in various sites may vary, which may potentially affect the findings and may constrain external validity. In addition, the current study continued for six months; consequently, the researchers might not be able to ascertain the effect of adherence to medication on treatment outcomes for a longer duration. The current study did not take into consideration the difference in gender between the groups, this might also be a good area for future research to look into. Finally, self-reporting was used to assess drug adherence. Social desirability bias could cause self-report questionnaires to overestimate genuine adherence  [80] . However, several technology-based or mHealth methods exist to follow and measure adherence, which could not be used in the study due to the non-availability of such devices, poor communication of patients, or fear of loss to follow-up.\n\nPlease refer to the eHealth Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials checklist for more information about this Multi-Aid Package trial  [81] ."

The findings revealed a statistically significant change in adherence to treatment score and pill-counting rates, and a reduction in SBP six months after the intervention began. The outcomes also demonstrated that users valued the module for its applicability, ease of use, and informational content for the management of hypertension. The Multi-Aid-Package should be considered an approach for boosting the adherence of hypertension patients to their medication in Pakistan and other similar LMICs."
