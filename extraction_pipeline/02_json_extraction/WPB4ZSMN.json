      "text": "Several cuffless BP devices are currently available using different technologies, offering the potential for continuous BP monitoring. The variation in standards and validation protocols limited the comparability of findings across studies and the identification of the most accurate device. Challenges such as validation using standard protocols and in real-life settings must be overcome before they can be recommended for uptake into clinical practice.\n\n-  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Introduction High blood pressure (BP) is the most common modifiable risk factor causing the largest burden of diseases globally,  1  including stroke, cardiovascular disease, and end-stage renal disease. In 2015, 1.13 billion adults had high BP leading to over 19% of all deaths.  1, 2 Among those diagnosed with high BP, more than 80% have uncontrolled BP leading to increased morbidity and mortality.  3 A recent global survey on .1.5 million adults reported that among those on treatment for high BP, .71% had uncontrolled BP (.130/80 mmHg).  4 High BP is also a leading risk factor for disability, accounting for 122.2 million disability-adjusted life years.  5 Over the past decades, population growth, increasing life expectancy, unhealthy lifestyle and an aging population have led to an increase in the global burden of high BP.  1  The actual burden is likely to be even higher as more than one-third of people worldwide with high BP remain undiagnosed.  6 n effective approach to reduce hypertension-related disease burden is early detection and initiation of treatment, including lifestyle modification, and ongoing monitoring.  7 Despite significant advancements in healthcare and the availability of low-cost, effective therapies, overall progress in BP control has been slow due to the large number of undiagnosed cases of high BP and lack of regular BP assessment over time. Conventional management strategies rely on physician-centric diagnosis and BP assessment in clinics, which has several limitations, including measurement errors, 'white-coat hypertension' and failing to measure the circadian and seasonal variations in BP.  8  Additionally, clinic BP measurements often fail to detect masked hypertension (i.e. high BP at home and outside the clinic but not in the clinic)-which is present in 20-40% of people and an essential marker for CVD risk  9  -leading to inadequate treatment and incomplete follow-up. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is essential for accurate detection of hypertension but is costly and subject to user discomfort.  10, 11 Home monitoring overcomes these limitations but only records periodic resting BP and requires manual input from individuals, which reduces feasibility.\n\nNew approaches are needed for continuous monitoring of BP that is simple and unobtrusive, acceptable to users and clinicians, and enables better tracking of treatment response, and hence a greater ability to manage and titrate treatments. Recent developments in sensor technologies offer the promise to monitor BP throughout daily life, over prolonged periods, and across many individuals.  12, 13 'Cuffless' technologies such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiogram (ECG), ballistocardiography, 14 microelectromechanical,  15  magneto-plethysmography,  16  bioimpedance,  17  ultrasound image processing,  18  and mobile phone sensors  19  can be used to estimate BP from pulse transit time (PTT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and pulse arrival time parameters.  20 These wearable cuffless BP devices could enable long-term monitoring to support enhanced BP management.  13 A review on wearable BP devices summarized developments, research trends, and prospects for clinical use  21  but did not review measurement validity. Recent work and position statements have highlighted the problems with inaccurate BP measurement and the lack of formal validation of devices according to established standards.  22, 23 Currently, there is a dearth of information about the features, validity and clinical application of wearable BP devices. Moreover, there is no consensus regarding BP measurement accuracy standards of cuffless devices. While different methods claim superiority, no systematic reviews have compared the validity of these devices. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the features and validity of wearable BP devices that have the potential for application in clinical settings."

      "title": "Data extraction and analysis",
      "text": "Before data extraction, a set of features considered essential or desirable in wearable BP devices was developed based on literature reviews and expert opinion. We extracted the following information: characteristics of the included studies (name of the device, author/year, sample size, country of the study, study population and recruitment strategies), characteristics of the wearable BP devices (anatomical location of the sensors, mechanism of BP measurement), reference device, validation protocol, BP data from test and reference devices, clinical application and additional features and prototype or commercial availability, and practical and functionality features of the wearable BP devices (ease of use, battery life, costs, alerts/reminders, data storage, data viewing, data transfer/sharing and related app). Where possible, additional information (e.g. device features and cost) were extracted from manufacturers' websites. Devices that were described in two or more publications were summarised as a single device. Features that could not be ascertained were considered absent. Differences in data extraction were resolved by consensus and in consultation with another researcher (C.K.C. and R.M.). While the IEEE guideline  25  recommends that for a cuffless device to be valid, the mean absolute difference (MAD) between test and reference device should be ,7 mmHg for both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), this was not possible due to lack of MAD data from the included studies. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we defined devices with a mean SBP and DBP biases of ,5 mmHg as valid as a consensus. Our definition of validity did not include assessment of device measurement precision, which is assessed by standard deviation of the mean difference (MD) and is a critical component of ISO protocol validation criteria.\n\nData were analysed using IBM SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corporation). Device characteristics and features are presented as means or medians for continuous data and as frequencies and proportions for categorical data. We classified the cuffless BP devices based on their additional clinical functions and types of sensors used to measure BP. The MD between SBP and DBP between the test and reference devices was calculated and compared for assessing the validity of cuffless BP devices. The mean biases for SBP and DBP were pooled across all included studies using MATLAB.  26 The meta package in R was used to perform random-effects model to pool effect sizes as we anticipated considerable between-study heterogeneity. We used the restricted maximum likelihood estimator  27  to calculate the heterogeneity variance \u03c4 2 . The Knapp-Hartung adjustments  28  was used to calculate the confidence interval around the pooled effect. We calculated pooled mean and standard deviation for secondary analyses using following equations:\n\nWhere, z \u2208 {SBP, DBP} and Z i is the reported measurement of average SBP or DBP for i th study, n is the total number of studies used in the pool analysis. Finally, mean z and SD z represent the pooled mean and standard deviation of SBP and DBP values. We then calculated the difference between the pooled mean bias and the mean bias of individual studies for both SBP and DBP measurements. Sensitivity analysis was performed by removing studies with high heterogeneity/differences in mean bias between test and reference device."

Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 consists of four key domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Each domain was assessed in terms of risk of bias (low, high, or unclear) and the first three in terms of concerns regarding applicability. Results were expressed as the frequency of each response.

      "text": "Our review identified a number of cuffless BP devices utilising different approaches for BP measurement, which were mostly prototypes and not available commercially. These devices used a range of different BP sensor technologies, but it remains unclear which sensors offer superior validity. While the clinical utility of cuffless BP devices is yet to be established, the ability to obtain accurate BP data with a device that captures this throughout daily living offers potential for cardiovascular risk assessment and management. Our findings may inspire further research and help pushing BP management in a new direction.\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to report the measurement accuracy of wearable cuffless BP devices. We found substantial variation in sensor technologies and validation  Table 2 Continued Author, year (device) Sensors used for BP measurement Device location (sensor position) Comparison (reference device) Validation protocol Clinical applications (additional features) Availability (prototype/ commercial) Previously validated in other population and hypertensives ankle-brachial index, central aortic systolic pressure, peripheral BP and the radial augmentation index Bilo G et al., PPG Finger Standard wrist BP device ESH-IP Night-time BP, Continuous BP Somnotouch-NIBP (Somnomedics GmbH, Germany) Somnotouch-NIBP 43 Commercially available Carek et al.

Yes (via bluetooth to mobile or tablet) Yes (Checkme)  46  Wearable BP devices: a systematic review and meta-analysis approaches of these devices that limited their direct comparison. A challenge to the validation of these devices is that many of the cuffles devices obtained long-term measures or multiple measures over a shorter period. Yet the majority of validation used static ESH or AAMI protocols, which may not be suited to the cuffless device.  48 . This inhibits their recommended for current clinical use. An alternative approach would be to compare wearable BP data with long-term measurements, such as in a hospital or the clinic with an intra-arterial recording or continuous finopemter.\n\nThe majority of wearable cuffless devices included in this review estimated BP from measurements of PTT, PPG, finometer and PPG + ECG. Our results suggest that devices that used PPG + ECG to estimate BP performed better than those that used only PPG, which is in line with a study by Nitzan showing that PTT calculated using ECG + PPG had a better correlation with SBP than the PTT derived from PPG alone.  49 However, obtaining ECG can be problematic as it requires electrodes to be connected to the wearable device making it less suitable for use during daily activities. PPG is a simple technology based on measurement of changes in light absorption with a light-emitting diode to illuminate the skin and a photodetector which can be integrated into portable devices.  50 he main usability of the wearable devices is to measure BP during activities of daily living and over-time to which is important for managing high BP. However, BP varies throughout the day and is affected by temperature, daily activities, including eating, physical activity or sedentary time and different exercise conditions.  51 It is not clear how the wearable devices in this review adjusted for these various conditions as detailed algorithms for BP measurements were not provided by the majority of the studies. Most of the included devices required BP to be measured at rest and not during exercise or continuously and measurements were affected by body movements and active noises, thereby limiting their use. Battery life is a critical feature for wearable devices, especially for long-term BP measurement, which could inform clinical decisions about medication use and titration by a better understanding of BP patterns and stability.\n\nWhile some PPG-based wearable cuffless devices appear to measure BP within 5 mmHg of reference device, there are opportunities for improvement. First, BP detection algorithms need to consider movement artefacts and individual physiological variations to represent true BP.  52  Although individual physiological variations can be taken into account via the calibration this has not been clearly mentioned in the included studies. Second, BP measurement algorithms should be based on large cohorts of participants from diverse populations.  50 Finally, there is need to report measurement precision.\n\nAlthough the primary function of devices in this review was to measure BP, several devices were capable of measuring other vital signs, including heart rate, ECG, oxygen saturation, physical activity and sleep. These additional functions can provide contextual data to guide interpretation of BP status. In addition, mobile connectivity offers opportunities to deliver context-aware BP-related alerts and reminders directly to participants, connect with clinicians and webbased care platforms for long-term BP management. These additional features could further improve management of high BP and represent significant advantages over traditional BP devices.  53 revious studies have reported that the wearable BP devices were easy to use and acceptable among users,  46  and healthcare providers found the utility of the devices for clinical use if the measurements were accurate.  45 Despite these positive findings, the use of wearable BP device in clinics has yet to be initiated. This review has some limitations. First, studies used a broad range of BP measurement protocols and reference devices due to a lack of consensus on wearable BP device validation. While we extracted data measuring BP at rest, methodological differences and uncertainty in reporting protocol adherence made it difficult to directly compare the accuracy between different types of sensor technologies (e.g. PPG vs. non-PPG, PPG vs. ECG), location (e.g. wrist, finger, chest), and devotion to IEEE standards. Second, our indicator definition of BP validity ,5 mmHg for SBP and DBP represents a significant data limitation. This specification was 'chosen' due to the lack of Wearable BP devices: a systematic review and meta-analysis more nuanced metrics for wearable BP device validation in international guidelines (IEEE standards for cuffless BP devices). Our definition of validity did not include assessment of device measurement precision, which is assessed by standard deviation of the MD and is a critical component of ISO protocol validation criteria. Therefore, the results of the study should be interpreted with caution.Third, only three studies provided detailed algorithms for BP measurements. The lack of details pertaining to the underlying sensing methods and algorithms-aspects which dictate calibration requirements are limitations of this study and barriers for widespread adoption of the technology. In addition, it is not clear how the calibration free devices accounted for individual physiological differences. Fourth, evaluation of the overall sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves were not possible because of the absence of specific cut-off points for BP differences between studies. Therefore, the pooled analysis does not represent effect size but rather how well an individual devices in general perform against other devices. Fifth, SD was not reported by 8 studies and 3 studies reported SD for SBP only, which is a significant limitation of the individual study methods and reporting. Finally, the majority of studies measured BP among young people in clinical and supervised settings, and their validity for use in activities of daily living and in older people remains unclear.\n\nAdvances in recent technologies have improved power efficiency and battery life in wearable devices leading to development of more efficient devices. In 2020, Samsung Galaxy device and health monitor app received clearance from South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety which has substantial utility for BP measurement. The Seismo watch measured BP using seismocardiography by placing the watch against the sternum to detect micro-vibration of the chest wall associated with the heartbeat.  44 Other wearable BP devices, for example, the Glabella used a pair of wearable spectacles  54  and Naptics used a wearable short to assess BP  55  . Long-term BP measurement could enhance diagnosis of hypertension among at-risk populations, help medication titration and enable appraisal of BP regulation in response to physiological factors. Thus, wearable devices could improve BP management by using machine learning and providing new treatment strategies.  [56] [57] 7] [58] [59] [60]  However, more usercentric designs in diverse population groups and robust trials are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for long-term BP measurement. There is a need for developing universal standards for wearable BP device validation, reporting, and interpretation. Future wearable BP device studies should provide the detailed of calibration methods, number of BP measurements, MD, standard deviations, measurement precision, and algorithms based on international standards.  61"
