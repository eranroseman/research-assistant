  "title": "Me, My Health, and My Watch: How Children with ADHD Understand Smartwatch Health Data",
  "abstract": "Children with ADHD can experience a wide variety of challenges related to self-regulation, which can lead to poor educational, health, and wellness outcomes. Technological interventions, such as mobile and wearable health systems, can support data collection and reflection about health status. However, little is known about how ADHD children interpret such data. We conducted a deployment study with 10 children, aged 10 to 15, for six weeks, during which they used a smartwatch in their homes. Results from observations and interviews during this study indicate that children with ADHD can interpret their own health data, particularly at the moment. However, as ADHD children develop more autonomy, smartwatch systems may require alternatives for data reflection that are interpretable and actionable for them. This work contributes to the scholarly discourse around health data visualization, particularly in considering implications for the design of health technologies for children with ADHD.",

      "title": "2.1. Self-Regulation, Self-Monitoring, and Personal Informatics",
      "text": "The development of self-regulation is foundational in the promotion of well-being at all life stages  [ 71 , 78 ] , and holds important implications for academic achievement in adolescence, as well as success in relationships and the workplace as people transition into adulthood  [ 71 , 78 ] . Self-regulation involves identifying, monitoring, evaluating, and modifying one's thoughts, behaviors, and emotions to enable goal-directed actions. Research suggests that early childhood and adolescence are critical periods for the development of self-regulation  [ 71 ] . In early childhood, self-regulation is developed through interaction with caregivers (e.g., parents), teachers, and behavioral specialists  [ 102 ] . Much like literacy skills, emotional and behavioral self-regulation skills can be taught with structure and training over time  [ 78 ] . Therefore, effective interventions may improve the selfregulation skills of children with ADHD  [ 71 ] .\n\nPersonal informatics systems are tools \"that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge\"  [ 63 ] . By engaging with these tools, users participate in the process of self-monitoring, the task of recording one's own behavior  [ 89 , 90 ] , which can be shared with peers  [ 35 , 90 ]  and family members  [ 83 , 84 ] , and reflected upon by clinicians and therapists  [ 89 ] . Whether collecting information to share with a group of people or keeping it individually, people who engage in self-monitoring may undergo a change in their behavior as a factor of taking notice of that behavior  [ 90 ] .\n\nPersonal informatics systems are not exclusively used for the purpose of changing behavior. Personal informatics research has found that people may adopt personal informatics systems for documenting activities, diagnostic purposes, incentives, or pure interest in the technology  [ 83 , 94 ] . Taken together, personal informatics research is contextualized by the motivation individuals have in tracking and using their data  [ 35 , 90 ] . Thus, there is a need to study the adoption of personal informatics systems within other specific domains. In this work, we report on the potential for children with ADHD asked to use smartwatches as part of a pilot study to introduction to prepare them for a future digital health intervention to support the development of self-regulation."

      "title": "2.2. Smartwatch Visualizations",
      "text": "Personal informatics systems often use visualization to enable users to make sense of their data  [ 52 ] . Choe et al.  [ 25 ]  identified several visualization techniques adults use to represent personal information, such as line or bar charts, tables, and grids. Some of these techniques are present in smartwatches that can track personal health-related data. However, due to the constraints of smaller displays, wearables more often summarize information and use fewer visualization techniques than phones  [ 2 ] . Furthermore, smartwatches have an always-available nature and often are used alongside other devices or in diverse multitasking situations  [ 23 ] . Thus, visualizations on smartwatches are necessarily glanceable  [ 19 ] . Such displays make use of high-symbolism or simple renditions  [ 70 ]  or condensing graphs  [ 79 ] . In addition, smartwatches need multiple views for representing tracked information  [ 3 ] . Amini et al.  [ 3 ]  explored smartwatch visualization requirements for adults to reflect on their collected health data, finding that people tend to concentrate on data being collected in the moment. Their findings also indicate that visualization design for smartwatches benefits from minimal use of text, use of icons, animations, and analogies (e.g., step count represented by laps around a stadium icon). However, Islam et al.  [ 53 ]  surveyed people's preferences for data representations on the primary screen of the smartwatch, finding that people often combine multiple icons, text, and charts. This finding indicates that no single modality is sufficient, and personalization should be a key consideration for the design of such health technologies. They conclude that supporting users with a dense visual configuration is still an open question. Thus, there exists a need to examine the impact of different data types and visual preferences among smartwatch users, especially considering children's needs.\n\nWearable technology, such as smartwatches, have commonly been studied to understand the potential for use by children. In one such study, M\u00fcller et al.  [ 76 ]  assessed the feasibility of wearable bracelets for children to impact physical activity levels. They concluded that wearable bracelets are feasible devices for physical activity level assessments but raised concerns about young children's ability to understand the activity measures on the smartwatch  [ 76 ] . Likewise, Ananthanarayan et al.  [ 5 ]  point out that children track and understand health data differently than adults and posit that health visualization should be specifically tailored for children. More research may be needed to understand to what extent these differences are experienced when viewing visualizations, particularly about health data.\n\nTraditionally, visualizations and interventions for children have been limited to their understanding in collaboration with their caregivers. As early as 1999, researchers in family medicine and other fields were calling for a different approach for data visualizations in health technologies  [ 40 ] . However, more recently, others have taken up this call, pushing for considering an ecological view of child interventions (e.g.,  [ 47 ] ) and formalizing this into the notion of family informatics  [ 84 ] . For example, Pina et al.  [ 85 ]  proposed DreamCatcher for families to track sleep and mood together using wrist-worn sleep trackers and an in-home display. In this article, they posit that current sleep-tracking tools are focused only on adults and not appropriate for family tracking collaboratively and describe how children can be active trackers and work together with parents. Similarly, Saksono et al.  [ 96 ]  evaluated the design of Stor y well, a system that combines wristband activity tracking among parents and children with social rewards in the form of storybooks, stories with graphical and narrative components that promote goal setting and reflection  [ 101 ] . Despite this progress, visualizations in the HCI and health literature have rarely been tailored specifically to ADHD children."

      "title": "2.3. Use of Personal Informatics Systems and Neurodiverse People",
      "text": "Most of the work on sensing technology designed for individuals with ADHD has focused on the assessment and diagnosis of ADHD symptoms  [ 26 , 44 , 65 ]  and motor skills  [ 55 , 77 , 81 , 86 , 93 ] . For example, using wrist actigraph data obtained from wearable devices, Kam et al.  [ 55 ]  developed a decision-tree algorithm that was able to classify whether the data belong to children diagnosed with ADHD or those without a diagnosis with 99.3% accuracy. Similarly, Mu\u00f1oz-Organero et al.  [ 77 ]  tested accelerometers on the dominant wrist and non-dominant ankle of 22 children (11 with ADHD, 6 of whom were also medicated) during school hours to recognize the differences between non-medicated ADHD children and their paired controls with an accuracy of between 87.5% and 93.75. These works demonstrated that wearable devices could be used in a clinical capacity to augment the diagnosis of ADHD in children. A full-scale clinical diagnosis typically takes an entire day, includes a battery of tests and engagement with care providers and experts, and provides much more detailed information than the simple classifications enabled by these approaches. Thus, such classifiers are generally recommended only as screening tools to support a full diagnosis. Additionally, questions remain about how such tools might be used to augment as part of interventions.\n\nMe, My Health, and My Watch 59:5\n\nSeveral studies have leveraged smartwatches and other devices (e.g., EEGs) to assist people with neurodevelopmental differences, such as autism and ADHD  [ 8 , 74 ] . For example, Koumpouros et al.  [ 61 ]  designed a combination of wearable and mobile systems tailored for autistic children that enabled parent-child interactions (e.g., communication, monitoring) and self-management features (e.g., scheduling, heart rate). In this study with 20 autistic children  [ 61 ] , their proposed smartwatch solution increased independent living and assisted everyday life for both children and caregivers.\n\nOther interventions for neurodiverse populations have leveraged smartwatches for selfregulation. For example, Taimun-watch  [ 103 ]  is a system for caregivers to collaborate with autistic adults by elaborating visual self-regulation strategies that are sent to a smartwatch. Two autistic adults used Taimum-watch and indicated its effectiveness for employing self-regulation strategies created by the caregivers. Similarly, Zheng et al. contributed to the design of WELI, a smartwatch and phone application, to assist the education of young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities  [ 111 ] . Based on a series of participatory design sessions and user studies, WELI was found to help people with IDD to become more independent and engaged with their education, leveraging the app's features for self-assessment, and maintaining focus and calm  [ 111 ] .\n\nOverall, the related research demonstrates that wearable personal informatics systems have the potential to be used as a form of assistive technology that supports ADHD children in developing self-regulation skills. In this article, we present findings that indicate how children react to and use the watch as part of the intervention."

In this article, we report our findings on the six-week pilot field deployment of a smartwatch application with ADHD children and families. Data were collected through a watch and phone, associated with an email address created only for the study. No identifiable information about the children was associated with their devices. During this study, we focused on how children with ADHD interacted with the available health data on a smartwatch and how they understood their health data. The study was conducted between May and June 2020, during the stay-at-home order and at-home learning due to COVID-19. The study was approved by the university's Institutional Review Board."

We recruited 12 participants, but two parents never responded to follow-up surveys nor e-mails; they were excluded from the study. All the child participants were boys between the ages of 10 and 15. ADHD diagnosis is more diagnosed in boys  [ 75 , 88 , 109 ] ; thus, the recruitment of a greater number of boys was expected. Consent was received from parents for participation in intervention, and assent was received from the children. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we made every attempt to conduct two interviews virtually via teleconference, but we were not able to conduct a second interview with two participants."

      "text": "As part of a long-term Action Research  [ 46 ]  project with a non-public school in the community, the research team, teachers, and other school staff collaboratively developed a smartwatch-based application called CoolCraig, to support children with ADHD in self-reporting their emotions throughout the day. The app prompted the children three times per day to answer, \"How are you feeling?\" To answer the survey, the smartwatch displayed four emojis related to the four background colors from the Zones of Regulation framework  [ 68 ] : green, blue, red, and yellow (Figure  1  ). No children reported color blindness, but the squares all held secondary visual cues (faces) and tertiary visual cues (consistent location on the watch face) and should be usable even in the case of color blindness (Figure  1  ). Surveys were scheduled at times that coincided with their daily academic schedule. Every time children answer or access the app, they can see the last three emojis selected. In addition to this custom application, all students had their academic calendar loaded into Google Calendar to provide reminders about upcoming events via smartwatch notifications. Finally, each child's smartwatch also included Weather, Heart Rate, Calculator, Breathing, NatBot (to track sleep), and Activity, among other default applications, but participants were not able to install additional applications.\n\nBecause this project was embedded in a school, we had expected to use the time in school as well as times when parents drop off their children at school or pick them up to engage with families and students as we have done in prior work  [ 27 , 31 ] . However, the study was conducted during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the study area was under regional \"stay at home orders,\" meaning all children were attending classes virtually and people were encouraged not to leave home. Thus, instead of using the school facilities, the fourth author delivered an iPhone 8 and Apple Watch Series 5 to the home of each study participant with the study application preinstalled. The devices were cleaned and dropped off in front of participants' homes  [ 100 ] .\n\nParticipants received a digital user guide containing information about synchronizing their smartwatch with their iPhone and practicing digital safety with their device. Participants were instructed to wear the watch during the typical school week, answer the emotion surveys, and regularly sync and charge their devices. Participants were also encouraged to wear the Apple Watch while sleeping or during the weekends but were not required to do so. Parents were given the password to their smartphones and encouraged to keep them secure. Children were left to use and explore the watches as they pleased."

The first interview was conducted during the second week of the study, and the second interview during the fourth week (view Table  1  ). In the first interview, children were asked about their use of the smartwatch, initial reactions, and favorite applications in a semistructured interview to understand their use and adoption of the smartwatch. Following the first interview, children were then left to continue using the watch according to their own preferences. In week four, children participated in a second interview session. Following initial trends observed by the first author and second author, the interviews were tailored to explore the understanding of the children about their health data, available smartwatch visualizations, and emotional regulation. During the second interview, children participated in a scenario-based interview  [ 11 ] , during\n\nTable 1.

They were then prompted to explain how to use the available apps on the phone to further support him. Finally, the children were asked to explain the visualizations and their understanding of the graphs to provide additional information for researchers to relay back to Craig. Following these interviews, the children used the watch for two more weeks. The research team then conducted final interviews with the caregivers of the children. Findings from parent interviews that focused on the parents' perceptions are published elsewhere  [ 29 ] . In this article, we focus on the ways in which the children themselves encountered and understood the use of the smartwatch.\n\nTo coordinate the virtual meetings, we requested a time when the parents and guardians were not distracted by work or other childcare duties and could engage with their children, who should also not be on video calls for school. Parents were allowed to attend the Zoom session with the children. At least one parent or guardian attended the first interview in every case, and four of them opted out of the second interview allowing their children to participate alone. Two parents were unable to schedule time for their child's second interview.\n\nDuring the interviews, we considered the potential distraction that ADHD children may experience during the session, therefore, we redirected their attention when they became distracted by asking them to explain what they were doing on the watch. This allowed us to slowly direct the conversation based on their interest. When they were walking around in their house and a parent was present, they helped us to redirect the attention like we would have done if we physically colocated with the children. When parents were not present during the interviews, we had two interviewers present, and they would swap who was asking questions to bring the child back on topic."

      "title": "3.4. Data Analysis",
      "text": "All interviews were conducted via Zoom video conference. Audio recordings were transcribed for analysis using a transcription service. We transcribed 18 interviews totaling approximately 558 minutes. Audio recordings extracted from videos were professionally transcribed. However, professional transcriptionists-no doubt particularly busy during this period-proved error prone. In particular, any time the children spoke too quickly or there were loud sounds in the background, substantial gaps appeared in the transcripts. We re-watched the videos to determine what was happening at those times, and much like the transcripts, we found it hard to hear the children as the video connection would lag at times or disconnect as the children were speaking. Children remained very active, often gesturing, or using sounds and similar words to articulate their points when they could not properly describe the topic. This animation resulted in moves away from the microphone, which were often not picked up then in the audio recordings. We relied on field notes and memories to fill in information about these interactions wherever possible.\n\nThree researchers coded the transcripts using an inductive approach to determine common themes. In the first phase of analysis, each researcher read three transcripts independently to identify common themes for a week. They came together collaboratively at the end of the week to discuss and label the themes to construct initial codes. In the second phase, the researchers conducted focused coding, whereby the major and minor themes and their properties were described, categorized, and organized into a codebook. We held regular meetings to discuss the codes and to reach consensus during the coding process for each transcript. This reflective process allowed for multiple perspectives and reduced personal or disciplinary biases."

      "text": "We provided the children the opportunity to explore the use of the devices and gauge their reaction to the system as part of their self-regulation training. The children wore the watches on weekdays during regular school hours. The results that we present here address our two research questions. First, how the children reacted to the use of personal informatics systems as part of their digital health intervention. Secondly, how they made sense of their available data. Our results demonstrate that children with ADHD have the capacity to adopt smartwatches to help them identify and manage their ADHD triggers; however, challenges exist within the design of smartwatches that make it harder for children with ADHD to continuously use the watch. Thus, taking into consideration, how personal informatics systems are used by ADHD children further contributes to the field by increasing our understanding of how technology can be adopted across certain contexts and among different communities of practice  [ 4 ] . This work specifically demonstrates that there is a need to address these challenges and barriers faced by ADHD children. As personal informatics systems continue to expand and reach non-normative communities across a wide variety of ages, we must seek explicitly to center their experiences and attempt adoption and use in light of their lived experiences."

    {
      "title": "4.1. Adoption of the Smartwatch",
      "text": "4.1.1 Acceptance and Desirability. Having never had a smartwatch, many of the children were excited to receive the new technology. In our study, five children reported owning a phone, only one a regular watch, and none a smartwatch (Table  1  ). Three children (P02, P05, P06) mentioned having family members with smartwatches. P06 shares, My dad has an Apple Watch ... and now seeing that P06 has one, my brother really wants one . At this age (10-15 years old), children are still highly dependent on their families, teachers, and other caregivers for direction and instruction, particularly around social norms. The desirability of such a device is not necessarily inherent, though certainly, advertisements are prevalent. Instead, children with family members with smartwatches showed interest in large part based on that familiarity and its desirability to a sibling or other family member. As children age, friendships increasingly displace familial relationships  [ 33 ] . However, children with ADHD often struggle to make friends  [ 73 ] , and they may have the desire to fit in and be accepted by their peers. Therefore, having a mainstream technology that is desirable to their peers may have some influence on their decision to use it. One child described knowing peers that have a smartwatch: Yeah, I think two of the other kids in seventh grade got it... I think it was actually three (P09). Notably, this child is not yet in seventh grade. He is describing older peers, potential role models, whom he may wish to impress or emulate. Additionally, this quote demonstrates an exclusivity related to having such technology; not only is the smartwatch Me, My Health, and My Watch 59:9\n\ndesirable, but it is also rare, with only two or three other people in his social network having one. Thus, by having one, the child is now a member of an exclusive social group, one that may potentially be for those who are older and therefore expected to be more sophisticated."

      "title": "4.1.2. Toward Greater",
      "text": "Autonomy. Upon receiving their smartwatch, the children were given very little instruction on how to use the watch or its applications. The children were only instructed to use the custom-built intervention app for the study and not taught about anything else, in part as an explicit inquiry method to understand what they might naturally use without guidance from the research team. Therefore, each child developed their own patterns of use surrounding the watch and discovered different features and applications.\n\nWhen asked about their first impression of the watch, children demonstrated enthusiasm to use it and to track information to support their interests. For example, P02 described his interest in the sleep app, It is really nice to have that actually, because I am trying to keep a more regulated sleep schedule. In this quote, P02 demonstrates foresight in imagining the watch as useful in helping him to achieve a specific goal and increasing his self-knowledge about his sleeping habits. Additionally, P02 demonstrated his ability to envision a future self in which he can be more consistent in his sleep. Regulated sleep is important for all children, particularly for those experiencing ADHD. Sleep influences their ability to focus and regulate their emotions  [ 91 , 108 ] . Thus, the presence of the watch may enable the child to take more control of their wellbeing by increasing their selfknowledge and ultimately changing their behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the children in the study demonstrated full awareness of their ADHD symptoms and triggers and described seeing the smartwatch tracking capabilities as a tool to help them identify and manage their triggers. Upon exploring the noise app, for example, P08 informed his behavioral specialist, present at the interview, We can get everybody to shut their traps foot_1  [using the app]. Here P08 demonstrates the desire to track information to influence his own ability to modify his environment. Environmental modification  [ 18 ]  is structuring a child's surroundings to support successfully managing their symptoms. This may include habits such as creating structures and routines, minimizing visual and auditory distractions, providing cues for the children to recognize, and more  [ 18 ] . This result may indicate that influence over their environment and having a say in the functioning of their environment may be a motivator for using an app. Technologies such as these offer the potential of greater environmental awareness and may provide children with information to help in-the-moment decisions and autonomy. I don't know if I told you. So, when there's noises and you want to see, and you use the hearing app. [...] but you're using the hearing app and there's somebody talking on the TV or yelling and using high volume. It would tell you how loud it is with DB (decibels). In this excerpt, P04 informs the interviewer that he is using the noise app. P04 has been known to exhibit sensitivities to sound; as such, he used the noise app for his everyday symptom management and to make himself more comfortable.\n\nIn our study, children were not instructed about all the available apps for the smartwatch. However, all the children explored apps within the watch (i.e., the heart rate monitor, activity tracker, and more) and determined which ones were most useful for them. Some apps were well known, such as the heart rate monitor and activity tracker. Thus, it was expected that the children would be drawn to them, and it was not surprising when they mentioned these two as being their favorite apps. Yet, some children mentioned liking other features of the watch. For example, P05 stated, I like that it let me know when I have to do stuff. . . . Like, it would notify me when I had my next class. Set routines and schedules are important for children with ADHD to help them to focus on one activity at a time, which makes their tasks more manageable  [ 69 , 101 ] . During the Covid-19 pandemic, children's schedules became less consistent as they were moved from school to home. The usual cues they would use to know to transition to different classes or activities were no longer present. These cues were sometimes replaced by parental nudging, which could be inconsistent or disrupt the family dynamic. A verbal reminder from a parent is a far different experience than a verbal nudge from a teacher or a timer, alarm, or other forms of notifications  [ 49 , 50 ] . Notifications from the watch could serve to exchange this parental reminder system with something more consistent and less likely to draw the kinds of emotional responses common in families  [ 50 ] . In fact, P05 later explained that the reminders were so helpful that he worked with his father to add other reminders like When I should play basketball to ensure he was reminded of things that were priorities for him and not just for his school. As expected, the children were especially drawn to the fitness and activity tracking capabilities of the watch, experiences that are addressed more in later sections.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the children were disappointed by the lack of games on their watches. However, they were undeterred and continued to use the watch to entertain themselves with other non-game apps. For example, several of them used the breathing app without other activities, such as P04: So when I'm bored, I just breathe. Kind of makes me calmer and makes me kind of think what to do, instead of just being bored and sitting there. Thinking about what to do. And when I'm tired or something, it just calms me. ADHD children experience more difficulty with getting distracted. A variety of supports can help them refocus, and in this example, P04 found the notification from the breathing app to be very calming yet also entertaining. This may be due to the interactive visualization presented in the app. The breathing app has a circle that enlarged and shrunk mimicking the inhaling and exhaling process of breathing. The use of apps to entertain and sometimes to self-regulate suggests that such off-the-shelf tools, as well as well-timed notifications, can facilitate breaks that support children in refocusing on their work and activity. Similarly, P03 and P04 mentioned fidgeting with the digital crown of the smartwatch, a tactile fidget, that could help calm some, or might be problematic and distracting for others. Children with ADHD often have fidgeting objects to help them to focus, by giving them something to do with their bodies while their minds concentrate on a task. P03 demonstrated this pattern during his interview by using a fidget cube to maintain concentration on the discussion.\n\nOverall, children with ADHD in our study independently developed specific needs and uses for the smartwatch on their own. This demonstrates that smartwatches may have the potential to be easily adopted and integrated into the lives of ADHD children and that they are willing and able to find their own unique uses for such tools even outside of an intervention. Additionally, our work indicates that ADHD children can and want to use such tools to help themselves without the substantial distraction that some may have predicted  [ 27 ] . Our findings also indicate that children can use such tools to imagine alternative selves, in which they may be more accepted because of their device or may feel better able to regulate their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. In conclusion, the children appeared to feel more empowered to make decisions on their own based on the information provided to them through their watches."

Despite having carefully selected the device of use in this study, we observed some challenges that arose with the device selection. In this section, we describe the challenges faced by children with ADHD when using the Apple Watch. We note that these challenges may be experienced by the general population of smartwatch users; however, these challenges and barriers are exacerbated in ADHD children, making it important to understand these challenges for truly inclusive design."

      "text": "Children with disabilities may experience physical discomfort when wearing a device developed for adults without tactile sensitivity, such as the Apple Watch. All the children in this study initially received the traditional silicon Sport Band with their devices. Two parents reported their child's discomfort with the watch. The research team informed them that they would order new more comfortable bands for the children for future studies, acknowledging the challenge but unfortunately not being able to address it rapidly enough within the scope of the study. Half of the children specifically and proactively described the watch as uncomfortable to wear throughout the day. P05 explained his discomfort with the watch, especially when sleeping, I kept [the smartwatch] loose a lot when I sleep. Because it still bothers me, and I don't sleep if something just bothers me. I kept it loose. Similarly, P04 described his diminished interaction with the watch, Well, lately I haven't been putting [the watch] on much, but the first few days I've been keeping it on, and also for the night. Then it's kind of got really sweaty on my hands since, also, because of this heat. And I also go to the gym, so it also makes my wrist sweat more and it's really uncomfortable because they always move it like every 30 seconds or so. So, it kind of bothers me a little, but otherwise, I would wear it. Despite these challenges, all the children wore the watch during school hours on the weekdays. The children reported wearing the watch less on the weekend, P02 explains, Weekends are my days off, and I don't really... it's just more comfortable to not wear [the watch]. P02 and P03 described being able to wear the watch throughout the night and choosing to do so because they were interested in understanding their sleeping behavior. These results indicate that many children with ADHD may be uncomfortable with such devices, particularly while sleeping. However, when prompted to wear the device by caregivers or when motivated by personal interest, the discomfort is likely tolerable. The discomfort with the watch may be due in part to the hypo/hypersensitivity experienced by many children with ADHD  [ 39 ] . As such, more research is needed to understand which materials and/or wearables are most appropriate for children with ADHD."

      "text": "Working memory is the ability to keep information at the top of the mind for a short period of time  [ 53 ] . Children with ADHD experience difficulty with sustaining attention and attending to details in some contexts  [ 9 ] . Prior studies have reported that ADHD children experience difficulty with maintaining attention when observing information, as demonstrated in reports of them skipping lines of text when reading  [ 9 ] . In this work, we observed study participants having difficulty recalling applications as they were discussed during the interview. However, by noting vivid descriptions of colors or icons, the children were able to recall certain apps. The children could find the following apps easily during 'interview: breathing, heart rate monitor, CoolCraig, and activity tracker. This may be due to frequent usage during the deployment as well as the contrast of these apps compared to the background of the watch screen. However, they exhibited difficulties in finding Napbot, the sleep monitoring app. For example, when asked about Napbot, P10 remarked, I don't think I've seen it . This may be a result of the lack of color contrast between the app and its background  [ 9 ]  (Figure  2  ). Prior research indicates that using colors may assist children with ADHD who exhibit symptoms of inattention  [ 9 ] . Some children were able to recall the app by calling to memory distinctive symbols. For example, P08 asked, That's the one with the moon and stars ? In an attempt to recall the app. Highly symbolic icons  [ 79 ]  (i.e., icons that match real-world examples in designs) can improve glanceability and may create a stronger link for memory recall and draw attention to less explored apps.\n\nOverall, symptoms related to ADHD may make smartwatch use more challenging. As such, when evaluating a device for a digital health intervention, children should have a trial period with the device before final selection. Their specific combination of symptoms should be accounted for and addressed to improve their experience with the intervention and, ultimately, the efficacy of the study. This is especially important when the child plays a valuable role in the data collection process of the study, as is recommended, when possible, to ensure a child-centered, engaged, and participative approach."

      "text": "Collection. In our study, children played an integral role in the data collection process. As a result of enrolling in this study, child participants consented to passive data collection through the watch (e.g., step count, heart rate). Data collection was not a new concept to the children nor their families. The school in which all the children in this study were enrolled has a strong set of norms around data collection, requiring teachers to document the children's behaviors and use these data to improve education and care, and they have piloted approaches in the past that allow children a stronger role in collecting such data about themselves. By nature of attending this school, their parents have already opted into a data-collecting ethos. The children were informed of data collection practices of their school and were generally motivated to participate as subjects of the data collection undertaken by their caregivers. In another study in this school, technology was used to support such motivation, particularly as a part of collective action  [ 69 , 97 ] . Yet, despite all this familiarity with data collection in these contexts, not all the children were comfortable with the prospect of device-driven data collection.\n\nOne child expressed different comfort levels with an automated tracking process depending on the device. When asked about his phone's ability to track physical activity, P01 responded, It doesn't really do any creepy stuff like that. The result may indicate that P01 may prefer to have more control of what data is collected and displayed on which device. Additionally, there may be a lack of understanding surrounding how data collection works on his devices. The collection of physical data on the smartwatch was not viewed as \"creepy\" by this child, going as far as to describe the collection of data on the smartwatch as pretty cool. The device used for data tracking may be just as important as the approach to data collection  [ 22 , 24 ] . Choe et al.  [ 24 ]  assert that self-tracking exclusively with automation can reduce awareness and engagement with self-tracked data. In our study, the children engaged with their automated self-tracked data; however, they were faced with many challenges, as explained further in the next section.\n\nAll children in the study engaged in the data collection process by completing their emotion surveys. Participants were prompted to track a limited set of emotions via timed notifications. Some children requested access to the survey on an untimed basis, Because I can't always answer [the survey] at that time where it pops up. (P02). In this example, P02 described wanting to engage with the data at times he prefers instead of the predetermined times set in collaboration with their teachers. This may indicate that when asked to track their health data, children may want more autonomy in the process than the adults are interested in providing  [ 27 ] . Additionally, although we tried to minimize the distraction and inconvenience endured from notifications  [ 16 , 22 , 27 , 56 ] , some children still experienced the notifications as distracting, I got reminders during my classes and it kind of kept going, 'Bing, bing,' while I was talking or paying attention and it got me distracted. (P04). In this example, P04 described the built-in breathing app that regularly notifies prompts for breathing exercises. The research team could not select specific times for the notification sent randomly by the app during the day. These results indicate that although manual data collection can engage children, their limited autonomy and tight schedules can create challenges in the moment, locations, and contexts for responding to requests for information. Overcoming this barrier to system-driven data collection remains a challenge within personal informatics.\n\nThe methods by which individuals engage with their data remain controversial in personal informatics research  [ 24 ] . For example, individuals may find manual data collection to be burdensome, while others may find system-driven data collection to be less engaging. In this study, we observe that although the children had a variety of methods for data collection, no one option was perceived consistently as better than the others. They all presented their own challenges. Our examination suggests that when engaging children in data collection, greater autonomy in choosing the times of the notifications is appealing to end users. Furthermore, when implementing an automated approach, there may exist a gap in understanding what the technology is doing compared to what the children believe it is doing. Therefore, the data collection should be explained to children in a manner that they can understand and that enables them to decide which method they prefer. This is especially significant for children with disabilities and other cognitive differences, like ADHD, as they can be infantilized and not given the same opportunities to become more independent as their typically developing peers. Thus, this kind of push may allow them to be more independent and allow for them to engage and understand their data more, but tensions remain in balancing flexibility and empowerment with the burden of configuring and manually collecting data.\n\nOverall, the children in this study were excited to play a role in their data collection. As part of the digital health intervention to teach children self-regulation skills, the ability to self-monitor their own behaviors and physical health was good practice. By giving children access to the data collection process, they can learn to identify, monitor, and eventually evaluate and modify their own behavior, emotion, and thoughts."

Meaning making is the process of personalizing the information, thus making it relevant and actionable.

As such, sleep apps have the potential to help users obtain awareness about their sleep patterns and take action to improve sleep habits  [ 85 , 91 , 101 ] . Many of the children were excited about the prospect of access to their sleep data, but they soon realized that the information given to them by the sleep app was not as they expected. Some children could not understand the data presented to them by the sleep app. During one interview, P03 explained the visualization for the Napbot, The yellow is the awake."

And there's other stuff. There's Noises on there that can help him go to sleep. The children's ability to make sense of their data did not affect their ability to take action. Researchers, parents, and others who develop and implement data-based interventions for children should remember that a complete and accurate understanding of health data and the physiology that underlies the data is neither necessary nor sufficient for taking meaningful action. Thus, children-including those with disabilities-should be included in making plans for responses to such data and interventions well before such a time as they can fully understand, in a cognitive sense, all the information collected about them."

      "text": "The children in this study attempted to connect concrete data with abstract concepts  [ 20 , 48 ]  without being prompted to do so by the research team. Data on calories and heart rate allowed children to draw conclusions about concepts like weight loss and fitness. Below we present an in-depth conversation about calories with P04:\n\none is the most useful to you? P04: I don't know, really. Interviewer: The distance, the time, the calories? P04: I guess I would have to say calories, I guess? Interviewer: Why? P04: Because sometimes you want to lose weight and you want to see how many calories you lose by something. So, you go in your high intensity training, and you see like, oh, you lost 245 calories during this. Interviewer: Right. And what does that mean? Does that mean you've lost that much weight? P04: No, you don't lose that much weight because there's no way you weigh more than 200 pounds. Interviewer: Right. P04: A full, intense training. But it's more like losing those calories also makes you lose weight. But no, I don't know how it works exactly. But it should tell you sometimes how much weight you lost or something, depending on those calories.\n\nIn this conversation, P04 attempted to explain calories and was able to articulate what calories are; however, ultimately, P04 admitted that he does not fully understand the implications of tracking calories. This may demonstrate that children are not familiar with the unit of measurement known as calories leading them to compare it to a more familiar unit of measure. Numeric data may require changeable scales for easy comparisons. Data that were represented in the form of numbers (e.g., calories and heart rate) did not provide a deeper understanding of abstract concepts for the children in this study as one might have expected and as appears to occur with many adults when using activity trackers  [ 3 , 19 ] . This limited understanding did not change, even after many weeks of daily activity tracking experience. For example, when pushed to explain calories, no child could clearly describe what they are or do. P03 stated, Well, I don't know a lot about what calories do... and P05 declared, It shows how in shape I am and how much calories I need to lose.\n\nThe child participants displayed a greater ability to make sense of their data when viewing graphs than raw numbers. They used graphs to articulate their knowledge of abstract concepts, going as far as to assess the quality and relevance of the information presented. In some cases, the children were even able to identify what it was about the visualization that made abstract concepts difficult to glean. For example, P04 presented an argument against using a picture to represent calories, It's hard to see how many calories they lost or how many pounds just by showing a picture, suggesting If it tells you your calories and then it would tell you how many pounds you lost because of how many calories you lost.\n\nThe children experienced similar challenges in conceptualizing heart rate, another numerically represented dataset. For example, P03 attempted to explain the significance of different heart rate values, I mean, you have to get it like 100 [beats per minute, bpm] is good or  96 [bpm]  is good. But over 200 is like. You'll pass out. Interestingly P06 and P04 shared similar sentiments about low heart rates stating, If it's too low, then he's going to die. (P06) and ...if your heartbeats  [are]  getting way too low, like you're going to die or something (P04). Children of this age are prone to exaggerated consequences and cognitive distortions, including catastrophizing, overgeneralizing, and all or nothing thinking  [ 99 ] , such as death from too low a heart rate. However, these strong statements are more likely to occur in children with ADHD, who may experience strong emotional and cognitive responses to stimuli like their health data  [ 62 ] . Despite their struggles with abstract thinking about health concepts or extreme statements about death, children were able to determine actionable steps to take prior to death. P01 suggested if your heart rate is going up, Probably take breaks when exercising and stated he, check[s] it a lot of times to check [his] heart rate, to see if  [he]  need to breathe or not. This result shows that children may trust the app's potential to verify their physical state and support their decision to try to relax. Ultimately, the heart rate monitor was viewed as a tool to assess their physical state and validate their emotions."

      "text": "Data. Understanding one's emotion is an integral part of selfregulation. As such, children were asked to monitor and manage their emotions. Some children believed that the heart rate monitor could be used to identify emotions such as anger, And if he's like really angry, it will be like that (taps watch rapidly to convey a fast heartbeat when angry) And he was medium angry, it will be like that. (Taps watch slower than before to convey medium anger) (P03). P06 connected his heart rate to strong emotion, anger: If it's in the 100s, you're fine, but if it goes higher than that, he may be a little mad. Meanwhile, P01 was able to connect the data to an even larger concept of stress, Maybe from all that stress, (Craig's) heart rate goes up. It is unknown where children learn the association between heart rate and emotions; however, they expected the data to validate their emotions, thus they deferred to the heart rate data as a more accurate indicator of their emotional state.\n\nThroughout the study, children reflected on their emotions through the smartwatch, but more remarkably, they exhibited self-awareness when they presented recommendations for improving the CoolCraig self-reported survey about emotions. P09 recommended having Like maybe a hyper emoji, or like a frustrated emoji. , and P02 recommended, So one thing that would be nice is just having a scale of one to 10 meters of how happy are you? Or how sad are you? Or how mad are you? [...] And then again, like a gray zone of just, 'I don't know. Things are fine, I guess.' Yeah. [...] I'm feeling content right now. That'd be the correct word, content. As children further develop their ability to identify simple emotions, there is a need for more descriptive labels that allow for more complex emotions. This further demonstrates their desire for the data to reflect their exact emotions."

Finally, (3) smartwatch usage may provide children with ADHD with opportunities to exercise autonomy. These implications suggest that overall, ADHD children have unique experiences and challenges that should be understood and considered when designing personal informatics systems for them. In this section, we highlight the need to continuously engage ADHD children in the use and study of personal informatics systems and research to support their development of self-regulation, in a manner that empowers them. Then, we discuss opportunities for more accessible visualizations when representing data to ADHD children in a manner that honors their understanding of various health data and concepts."

      "title": "5.1. Empowering ADHD Children Through the Use and Engagement of Personal",
      "text": "Informatics Systems and Research At times, personal informatics systems may disempower the users it aims to support  [ 4 ] , as such researchers should consider ways that personal informatics research and systems can better empower its users. People leverage personal informatics systems to collect personal data for selfreflection and learning self-knowledge  [ 47 ] . Within the human-computer interaction community, a large subsector of personal informatics research focus on how personal informatics systems can be used to improve or change ones behavior  [ 90 ] . As such, many conceptual models of their use exist, including: The Stage-Based Model  [ 63 ] , Lived Informatics Model  [ 35 ] , Tracker Goal Evolution Model  [ 80 ] , and the Model of Socially Sustained Self-Tracking  [ 64 ] . These models attempt to explain the goals individuals have when tracking their data  [ 35 , 63 ] , the changes in tracking that occur over time  [ 80 ] , and the impacts of the social environment on tracking behaviors  [ 64 ] . As such, many of these models begin with an individual identifying a need, selecting a device related to their goal(s), and using the tool to pursue that goal. Within this process, individuals may choose to change their tracking tool or altogether stop tracking and may still relapse and begin tracking again. In this case, the individual is the one that initiates the process of tracking and determines when it is concluded.\n\nCurrently, personal informatics geared toward small children follow a similar process, but one facilitated by a parent or caregiver has become known as family informatics  [ 82 -84 ] . In family informatics, parents and children collaboratively work with personal informatics systems to reach a goal. Though this partnership is predominantly parent-driven, children act as collaborators. However, as children age, there is a need to shift from a parent-driven form of collaboration to a child-driven collaboration  [ 102 ] , demonstrating a shift from the parent being the primary decision initiator and maker to the child. This is significant because, beyond the use of personal informatics systems for behavior change, personal informatics systems have the potential to increase self-awareness. Thus the theory of self for personal informatics  [ 90 ] , advocates for personal informatics systems that place the individual at the center of the change process. Therefore, individuals can look at their selves holistically and with data, as the technology aims to support people in observing themselves in novel ways. This approach to personal informatics may be of value when designing digital health interventions for ADHD children, as it aims to empower the children toward more independent thinking.\n\nIn fact, early engagement in one's behavioral management allows for a sense of personal responsibility and supports independent thinking and decision making. For example, increasingly, schools in the US support child-led parent-teacher conferences and even child-led Individual Education Plan foot_2  ( IEP ) sessions  [ 67 ] , which may serve as models for child-led personal informatics research. In these child-led IEP sessions, children are given the space to engage in an iterative cycle of \"reflection, celebration and adjustment\"  [ 67 ]  as they share their experiences with their parents, teachers and educators and they all collaboratively work to form the educational plan needed to help them succeed. In this practice, the child is more than a token participant, and instead, a crucial valued member of the team  [ 45 ] . Schools that used student-led IEP meeting models found that their students were more aware of their limitations and the resources available to them, and gained increased self-confidence, allowing them to be better self-advocates  [ 45 ] . As such, an adoption of this model of collaboration between the child, the researcher and caregivers may yield similar results and enable a more balanced experience for ADHD Children.\n\nOverall, small considerations can be made to further empower ADHD children in their engagement with personal informatics systems and research. Building self-regulation moves children toward adult behavior. A combination of challenges with self-regulation and ableism can often create situations in which parents, teachers, and others continue to do \"too much,\" effectively infantilizing ADHD children, even in their use of tools built for them. Thus, ADHD children should be engaged early in both research and product design, via mechanisms like co-design  [ 27 ]  or simply allowing ADHD children to select their preferred systems from those that already exist. In this way, the children can take a more self-directed journey toward data collection, understanding, and self-driven paths to healthy life habits as they transition through life. Even after a platform is chosen, to further reduce infantilization by caring adults (e.g., constant nagging to do something, determining what data should be most relevant for the child) when using systems, children should be able to self-select which data is valuable to them and choose when and if that data should be shared with their caregivers. Additionally, family moments, such as mealtime or other routine family gatherings  [ 43 ] , may be leveraged to facilitate child-led review and reflection of their data, collaborating with caregivers to make sense of and express their understanding of their health and behaviors. Finding and choosing appropriate systems is still a challenge experienced by personal informatics users  [ 36 ] . Personal informatics research for ADHD children can be empowering if the field views children as more than systems users but also as budding experts on their health who deserve choice and autonomy in the management of their health and data."

      "title": "5.2. Implications for the Design of Accessible Visualizations",
      "text": "Designers and researchers must create accessible visualizations to represent data for neurodiverse populations. In this section, we discuss a current data visualization practice that may support comprehension, then suggest other practices that may support children with ADHD in self-regulation through the practice of self-monitoring with access to health data through smartwatch data visualizations.\n\nPersonal informatics depends upon the idea that self-monitoring promotes self-knowledge, reflection, and ultimately action. To allow children with ADHD to be full participants in a personal informatics lifecycle, we must understand how they engage with their data and visualizations and what they think about such engagement. Much work exists about the importance of data visualizations in reflections  [ 35 , 37 , 41 , 49 , 55 ]  with a growing body of research around individuals' interactions with their data  [ 2 , 42 , 72 ] . For example, some look at their data at the moment and create detailed logs, while others might ignore data being collected for weeks at a time and still others glance at it quickly with no additional exploration or interaction  [ 2 , 19 , 42 , 72 , 79 ] . As such, glanceable features are important in personal informatics tools to aid in quick reflection.\n\nWhen designing for glances and minimal interactions, colors and icons become particularly important to draw attention or make quick interpretation possible. In this work, the children frequently used colors and icons to augment their understanding and served to provide consistency across apps. Despite potential challenges for color-blind children, colors tend to be a simple yet highly functional approach for supporting children in their learning and reflection outside of the personal informatics space. Anyone who has ever been in a classroom will see the large arrays of color displays for teaching a variety of concepts, reflecting on children's behavior, and more. Likewise, schools and homes tend to be filled with iconography to support a variety of concepts during early childhood. However, when considering neurodivergent children, colors and icons may need to be augmented with other cues, as in this research. More empirical data should be collected, and designs tested to understand and develop other practices for ensuring consistency in data visualization for integration and reflection processes.\n\nColor can be often overused and may not necessarily be as accessible for children with ADHD, who may experience some difficulty with color perception  [ 59 ] . A child who may experience impaired color vision may lack the ability to distinguish the difference between images that use colors. Additionally, the implementation of colors and icons requires context for meaning making, and the sheer volume of color cues in children's lives may lead to confusion about their mixed meanings. For example, in Western contexts, a display of emotions in a classroom may mark red as angry, whereas another display uses red for stop or pause, and yet for many children-particularly those of Eastern context-cultural meaning attached to red is happy or fortunate. Thus, given the extensive use of color in educational material for children in general, there is a need to expand and diversify the data visualization toolbox. Designers and developers, as well as parents and educators, should consider the context of such choices and use a variety of features like contrast and texture to supplement any color-based cues. Texture is a visual element used by many graphic designers, it can often be used to create a visual tone and influence the look or perceived view of a graphic image  [ 1 ] . The implementation of the following features may have the potential to improve the comprehension of children with ADHD when attempting to understand data visualization and themselves.\n\nInteractive visualizations should be implemented when considering accessible visualizations. The breathing app in this work was nearly universally appealing to the children, who reported the interactive nature to be particularly enjoyable. Children were easily able to understand the app's function and what the data represented. Although, it is important to note that the interactivity of the app may not be the sole reason that the children were able to understand the visualization. This phenomenon may be worth studying; researchers in the future can attempt to implement interactive features into other visualizations, such as the heart rate monitor for children in the future. Another accessible visualization that can be implemented is sonification, or auditory displays (i.e., the use of sound to communicate information)  [ 28 ] . Data visualizations can be represented through the auditory senses by including changes in volume, pitch, or frequency. The use of sonification may draw more than a glance from the children to keep their attention which is important, especially for those with ADHD and sustainable engagement overall  [ 28 , 30 ] .\n\nSystems that are otherwise excellent may run the risk of infantilizing people and limiting their ability to act on their own health information in the face of inaccessible or incomprehensible data visualizations. In these cases, rather than being able to understand and act on one's own data, people may be forced to depend on others who may be perceived as more knowledgeable. These disempowering design choices can have adverse effects on the very people the system is meant to support, particularly when visualization literacy, the ability to read, interpret and use established data visualizations, is low among the general adult and youth population  [ 38 ] . Designers and researchers must instead incorporate accessible and engaging data visualizations that can engage and empower ADHD children."

      "title": "6. LIMITATIONS AND FU T URE WORK",
      "text": "We experienced limitations among our participant pool. We conducted interviews with 10 children with ADHD, but two children were not able to participate in the second interview. Additionally, all participants were boys. Some skewing was expected as ADHD diagnosis is more prevalent in boys  [ 75 , 88 , 109 ] , but some participants not being boys would have been preferred and is a focus of our ongoing efforts. Additionally, the participants were recruited from one school in the United States, a non-public school providing special education as such the experience of the children with ADHD from this school may differ compared to the experience of other children in non-specialized schools or other specialized programs. Additionally, this study was conducted during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and all had experience using smartphones and other technology. The children attended a school that was aware of and engaged in the smartwatch study; thus, they were able to wear the watch during class. We relied on currently available apps that were designed for adults. Thus, this may be the reason that children had challenges with some of the apps. Finally, the prototype Cool-Craig app deployed in this study only provided one strategy to support self-regulation by asking children to monitor and report their moods themselves using the Zones of Regulation framework. Thus, although this study was not designed as an ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) study, our approach of asking children to document their daily life moods shares characteristics in common with EMA. Thus, in future EMA work with this population, researchers might consider our findings regarding visualization and understanding in ADHD children. Likewise, in future work focused on supporting ADHD children and their families, considerations from the vast literature surrounding EMA may be useful in understanding how the intervention might be understood  [ 12 , 14 , 34 , 98 , 105 , 110 ] , and in designing for optimal uses (e.g., increased response rates  [ 17 , 58 , 106 ] . In subsequent studies, we plan to implement additional features into the CoolCraig application, broaden our recruitment efforts outside the current non-public school, and incorporate some visualization recommendations into the app."

      "title": "7. CONCLUSION",
      "text": "Personal informatics research has primarily focused on adult individual tracking needs  [ 36 ] . This research adds to that substantial body of work by explicitly considering the ways in which children with ADHD engage with such tools. Children, with or without ADHD, need particular care when engaging with health data, have different developmental capabilities when considering engagement with devices and data, and require appropriate ethical considerations around data collection and use. At the same time, the addition of considerations for ADHD makes a personal health informatics approach appealing to improving self-regulation, engagement, autonomy, and independence. The barriers, challenges, and opportunities for leveraging personal informatics in the ADHD community leave open a rich research space in which to develop and test interventions, ideally in collaboration with children with ADHD themselves as well as experts, teachers, and parents.\n\nOur research examined how ADHD children engaged with smartwatch data over a six-week period. From these results, we report on the use and adoption, challenges, and barriers to smartwatch use, and how children made sense of their health data. The children were interviewed twice during the span of the deployment. Results reveal that ADHD smartwatch technology may be considered for developing digital health interventions for children, as they expressed an interest and a desire to use these tools for their personal goals in addition to goals established for them. However, some challenges with smartwatches, may be exacerbated amongst ADHD children who may experience more sensitivity with tactile sensitivity or inattention. Additionally, when attempting to make sense and meaning from their data, children were unable to fully rely on existing smartwatch visualizations to inform their actions, rather they often used the data or visualization from the watch to support their preconceived conclusions, especially as it related to the interaction between their health data and emotions.\n\nThis research indicates a need for accessible visualization when designing personal informatics data visualization for children with ADHD and highlights the importance of engagement of children and people with ADHD in personal informatics research. Ultimately, personal informatics systems and research should promote the discovery, unveiling, and knowledge of the self, through the process of tracking and sense-making."
