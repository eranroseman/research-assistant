With high transmis sibility, a case fatality rate greater than 1%, and no effective antiviral therapy or vaccine, the mainstay of pandemic management has been containment and mitigation.  1  However, despite relying on established public health principles, countries across the world have had varying degrees of success in managing the burden of COVID-19.\n\nDigital health technology can facilitate pandemic strategy and response in ways that are difficult to achieve manually (figure).  2 Countries such as South Korea have integrated digital technology into governmentcoordinated containment and mitigation processesincluding surveillance, testing, contact tracing, and strict quarantine-which could be associated with the early flattening of their incidence curves.  3 Although South Korea has incurred only 0\u20225 COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 people, 3,4 the USA, with three times as many intensive care unit beds per 100 000 people and ranked number one in pandemic preparedness before the COVID-19 pandemic, has sustained ten times as many deaths per capita.  3, 4 his Viewpoint provides a framework for the application of digital technologies in pandemic management and response, highlighting ways in which successful countries have adopted and integrated digital technologies for pandemic planning, surveillance, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and health care (table ). The panel provides a brief glossary explaining some of these concepts."

      "text": "Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have helped facilitate COVID-19 preparedness and the tracking of people, and so the spread of infection, in several countries. Tools such as migration maps, which use mobile phones, mobile payment applications, and social media to collect real-time data on the location of people, allowed Chinese authorities to track the movement of people who had visited the Wuhan market, the pandemic's epicentre.  5, 6 With these data, machine learning models were developed to forecast the regional transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and guide border checks and surveillance.  6, 7 s soon as China reported the outbreak, Taiwan initiated health checks for airline travellers from Wuhan, integrating data from immigration records with its centralised, real-time national health insurance database.  8 his integration allowed health-care facilities to access patients' travel histories and identify individuals for SARS-CoV-2 testing and tracking.  8 Taiwan's proximity to Wuhan, China, made the region particularly susceptible to COVID-19, but its efficient use of big data is credited for the low number of cases and deaths.  4, 8 wedish Health Services, a USA-based health-care organisation, has developed a platform for health-care workers to report real-time data on volumes of patients with COVID-19, personal protective equipment, staffing, ventilator usage, and other resource information.  9 This information has been shared across its hospitals to track the status of facilities, allocate health-care resources, and increase hospital bed capacity.  9 he need to track COVID-19 has fuelled the innovation of data dashboards that visually display disease burden. UpCode uses data provided by the Singapore Ministry of Health to depict infection trends across age, sex, and location, and to plot the recovery time of infected individuals.  10 The Johns Hopkins University (MD, USA) coronavirus dashboard and the web-based platform HealthMap provide up-to-date visuals of COVID-19 cases and deaths around the globe.  4 AI algorithms allow the effect of the climate to be incorporated into the projections.  11 I is not without limitations and requires training with COVID-19 datasets. Most of the AI predictive models so far have used Chinese samples, which might not be generalisable.  12 In addition to the absence of historical training data, social media and other online traffic have created noise in big-data sets, potentially producing overfitted or so-called lucky good fit models.

To date, Iceland has had the highest per-capita testing rate and among the lowest per-capita COVID-19 mortality rate.  16 her countries offering widespread testing include Germany and South Korea.  17, 18 n the USA, a private company has used digital thermometers to collect real-time data on clusters of febrile illness,  19  and a national study is capturing resting heart rate with a smartwatch application, which could be able to identify COVID-19 emerging outbreaks.  20 These initiatives are either enterprise-driven or investigational and are not integrated into policy and practice.\n\nSystematic screening technologies are expensive and require trained personnel, restricting their uptake in many countries.  21 The incubation period and the relatively high prevalence of asymptomatic infection compared with other infectious diseases limits the effectiveness of digital systems that screen vital signs or self-reporting of symptoms.  21, 22 Researchers at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimate that a majority of passengers from Chinese cities would not be detected by screening because of these factors.  23"

The application records these encounters and stores them in their respective mobile phones for 21 days.

With digital technology, quarantine can be implemented in individuals who have been exposed to or infected with the virus, with less strict restrictions imposed on other citizens.

China also uses AI-powered surveillance cameras, drone-borne cameras, and portable digital recorders to monitor and restrict the gathering of people in public.  7 n Australia, international travellers were quarantined in hotels on arrival, with travellers from Wuhan quarantined off the Australian mainland.

      "title": "Risks of digital technology",
      "text": "Digital health initiatives can amplify socioeconomic inequalities and contribute to health-care disparities. Digital technology typically involves the use of the internet and mobile phones. Although 4 billion people used the internet worldwide in 2019, usage was disproportionally higher in high-income areas than in low-income and middle-income areas (82% in Europe vs 28% in Africa).  34 ven within high-income countries, susceptible groups, such as those in low-income neighbourhoods or remote regions, might not have access to broadband signals, smartphones, or wearable technology such as smartwatches. To effectively implement digital technology globally, interventions should be tailored to the target regions; broadband access requires federal and private sector investment in technology and infrastructure.  35, 36 At a regional level, subsidised mobile phone plans, loaner devices, free Wi-Fi hotspots, and training programmes could provide temporary solutions to these disparities.  37, 38 n regions without infrastructure or sufficient funds to support cellular and data coverage, automated applications and devices that do not require continuous network access should be considered.  36 everal digital health interventions, particularly those that track individuals and enforce quaran tine, can infringe on privacy, while increasing risk among individuals with mental illness or restricted access to food or water. Government-implemented surveillance and control can instil fear and threaten civil liberties. To balance the need for contact tracing and privacy, European authorities have proposed that data be retained for only 14 days, the period of possible viral transmission, and that non-essential digital measures be lifted once the pandemic ends.  39 Some European countries are deploying an opt-in smartphone tracking application with anonymised data, no central database, and no GPS information.  40 The appropriate concerns about privacy and data security are potentially offset by facilitating a return to normal routine without a rebound in infections."
