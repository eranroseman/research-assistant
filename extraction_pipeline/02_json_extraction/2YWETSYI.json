  "title": "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Mobile Apps on Medication Adherence for Chronic Conditions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Medication adherence is crucial for managing chronic conditions. Mobile apps may have the potential, through a wide variety of features, to support and improve medication adherence. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile apps in promoting medication adherence for patients managing chronic conditions. Methods: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of mobile app interventions in improving medication adherence in patients with chronic conditions. Study design and app features were qualitatively described. Meta-analyses were performed on studies, grouped by medication adherence measurement scale, on the mean differences in medication adherence scores between intervention and control groups, using random effects models. If baseline medication adherence data were available, a difference in differences meta-analysis with a random effects model was also conducted. Bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results: This review included 14 RCTs published between 2014 and 2022, with sample sizes between 57 and 412 participants and the length of interventions ranging from 30 days to 12 months. A range of patient populations was evaluated, including those with Parkinson disease, coronary heart disease, psoriasis, and hypertension, with hypertension being the most common condition. All 14 studies reported that app interventions improved medication adherence, and 10 RCTs demonstrated statistically significant improvement in medication adherence. Three separate sets of meta-analyses, categorized by the medication adherence measurement scales, were conducted on the mean difference between medication adherence scores between the control and intervention groups: the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8; 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.80; P<.001, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P value for heterogeneity test=.94), 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4; 0.15, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.42; P=.28, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P value for heterogeneity test=.54) and a percentage medication adherence scale (18.85, 95% CI 2.17-35.53; P=.03, I 2 =63%, \u03c4 2 =94.89, P value for heterogeneity test=.10). Additionally, with available baseline adherence scores, difference in differences meta-analyses were conducted for studies using the MMAS-8 scale (0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.62; P=.001, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P value for heterogeneity test=.51) and for studies using the MMAS-4 scale (0.55, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93; P=.005, I 2 =33%, \u03c4 2 =0.03, P value for heterogeneity test=.22). The meta-analysis of the MMAS-8 scale, percentage medication adherence scale, and both difference-in-differences meta-analyses demonstrated that app-based interventions improved medication adherence. Conclusions: From the studies included in this review, mobile apps, designed for a wide variety of chronic conditions with a range of features, were shown to improve medication adherence and may be a tool to successfully manage chronic conditions.",

      "text": "The increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses has become a significant public health issue  [1, 2] . Globally, 1 in 3 adults lives with more than one chronic condition, and in high-income countries, the estimate is closer to 3 in 4 older adults. Significant health, patient, and economic impacts are associated with chronic diseases, and the prevalence of these diseases is increasing substantially  [3, 4] . While there are a range of types of and treatments for chronic diseases, a common challenge remains the management of complex medication regimens  [1] , which is needed to slow disease progression, prevent further disease, and reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes  [5] .\n\nMedications are an important part of the management of chronic diseases  [5] . However, the effectiveness of medications depends primarily upon adherence to them  [5] , defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the extent to which a person's behavior-taking medications, following a diet and/or executing lifestyle changes-corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider\"  [6] . While medication adherence is clinically essential for chronic disease management  [7] , the WHO estimates only 50% of chronically ill patients take medications as prescribed in high-income countries  [8] . The causes of medication nonadherence are complex and can include insufficient information about the illness and the use of medications, adverse medication effects, inability to pay for medication, and poor memory  [5, 8] . The clinical and economic costs of medication nonadherence are immense; for example, in the United States, poor medication adherence causes about 33% to 69% of all medication-related hospitalizations and results in an estimated $100 billion in health care costs per year  [9, 10] .\n\nWhile many interventions exist to support medication adherence for chronic conditions, such as motivational interviewing and pharmacist-led multidisciplinary education, these interventions are time and labor intensive  [11] . There is a need for more practical interventions to improve medication adherence of patients with chronic disease  [11] .\n\nMobile apps have the potential to meaningfully support and increase medication adherence  [9, 12] . With currently more than an estimated 97,000 mobile health (mHealth) apps available on various platforms, the fifth largest category of mHealth apps is aimed at medical condition management, including medication adherence  [13] . As of 2017 alone, there was an estimated 10,000 mHealth apps that provided medication reminders  [14] . Compared to other digital interventions that target medication adherence, such as electronic medicine boxes that register the date and time the box was opened so that a detailed record of when medications are taken is generated  [15] , apps, due to the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, are significantly accessible and low-cost medication adherence interventions  [9] .\n\nMedication adherence apps aim to consolidate the entirety of a user's medication-specific information in one place and provide essential education about the disease or care  [9] . Features of current medication adherence apps include reminders for medication consumption and refills, doses that can be logged, data logs to be accessed by patients or uploaded to care providers, and medication information such as adverse effects or dosages  [9] . According to Heldenbrand et al  [16] , these features can be broadly categorized into general features, adherence attributes, medication management, and connectivity. General features include free apps that are multilingual, compatible with multiple platforms, and are advertisement-free. Adherence attributes include tracking taken and missed doses, specific medication reminders that are customizable, and medical social networking. Medication management features include complex medication instructions, information databases of medication, and the ability to identify potential interactions. Connectivity features, including cloud data storage, ability to export and share data, and the ability to generate reminders without cellular or WiFi connectivity  [16] .\n\nWhile the number of apps directed at medication adherence is increasing, there is a need for more research on patient use of these mobile apps, specific app features, and their effect on medication adherence  [9, 12] . Previous systematic reviews on the impact of mobile apps on medication adherence have predominately covered medication adherence regardless of acute or chronic conditions or focused on one specific condition, such as asthma or cardiovascular disease. Some did not include accompanying meta-analyses, making it difficult to quantify the impact of apps  [11, 13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Additionally, since the number of medication adherence apps is rapidly increasing and advanced technical features are now possible, a review of the most up-to-date evidence is warranted. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving medication adherence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with chronic conditions."

      "title": "Search Strategy",
      "text": "MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) databases were searched from inception to September 2023. The search strategy was developed by identifying keywords from the research question and relevant studies. The key terms in the search strategy included mobile apps, smartphones, medication adherence, and medication therapy management. The search strategy was first developed for MEDLINE and then adapted for the other databases (all search strategies are presented in Multimedia Appendices 1-3).\n\nStudies of interest to this review were RCTs that investigated the effectiveness of stand-alone mobile apps in improving medication adherence for those with chronic conditions. The inclusion criteria used to select studies were:\n\n\u2022 Participants aged 18 and older with a chronic disease, defined as conditions that last for 3 months or longer, may progressively get worse and usually cannot be cured but controlled, such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, etc  [22] . \u2022 An intervention group that was randomized to receive a mobile app designed to promote medication adherence. \u2022 A control group that was randomized to receive usual or standard of care that did not involve any mobile app. \u2022 The outcome, medication adherence, had to be quantitatively reported for both intervention and control groups. Medication adherence could be reported through direct (measurement of level of drug, biological marker in the blood, etc) or indirect (pill counts, self-reporting, etc) measures. \u2022 Articles must be published in English.\n\nThe exclusion criteria used to reject studies were:\n\n\u2022 Participants had acute conditions such as myocardial infarction or stroke. \u2022 The intervention was not based on a mobile app and only involved SMS text messaging. \u2022 The intervention had components beyond the mobile app, such as counseling with health care professionals. \u2022 The control group received an app-based intervention.\n\n\u2022 The only outcome assessed was adherence to components other than medications, such as appointment attendance or laboratory work.\n\nA 2-stage screening process was used to select studies. All studies identified in the 3 databases were compiled in Covidence, a systematic review management web-based platform  [23] . Covidence identified and subsequently removed duplicate records. In the first stage of screening, 2 reviewers (VL and KT) independently reviewed the title and abstract of all studies and excluded studies based on the eligibility criteria. In the second stage of screening, 2 reviewers (VL and KT) independently read the full text of studies and selected studies to include in the review based on whether they met the eligibility criteria. To resolve disagreements or uncertainties regarding decisions about study inclusion or exclusion, the same 2 reviewers met to discuss and reach a consensus."

      "title": "Data Extraction and Data Synthesis",
      "text": "Data was extracted by one reviewer (VL) using the Cochrane data collection form for interventions. Data extracted included evidence that studies met eligibility criteria, study design and setting, participant characteristics (age, sex, medical illness, severity of illness), intervention and control group interventions, features of the mobile apps, how medication adherence was measured and medication adherence results.\n\nTo allow for fair comparisons, identified studies were grouped by the method used to measure medication adherence. Medication adherence scores were compiled and grouped by the following medication adherence measurement methods, 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8), percentage medication adherence, Hill Bone compliance scales, 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4), and self-made scale (Multimedia Appendix 4  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] ). Although each method measured medication adherence, each method was designed differently and produced a variety of adherence scores. Therefore, the meta-analysis was stratified by adherence measurement method as conducting a single meta-analysis, with all studies included, may not have resulted in a just comparison or have clinical interpretability.\n\nMeta-analyses were conducted in subgroups of studies that used the same method of measuring medication adherence. For each meta-analysis conducted, a random effects model was used, with the measure of effect being the mean difference between intervention and control groups in medication adherence scores at the end of the study period. Additionally, in studies that measured adherence at baseline and at the completion of the study period, a difference-in-differences meta-analysis was conducted. Individuals were the unit of analysis. Since all studies in the review were RCTs, it was assumed that the baseline medication adherence between control and intervention groups was similar. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test; the I 2 statistic to assess the percentage of total variation due to heterogeneity, with I 2 above 50% considered moderate to substantial heterogeneity; and \u03c4 2 statistic to assess the in-between study variance  [38] . The meta package in R (R Core Team) was used to conduct the analysis and create forest plots to display the results  [39] ."

The app also had an interactive food database of more than 500 foods commonly consumed by patients with hyperphosphatemia in Klang Valley, Malaysia, and had a personalized diet calculator that calculated the required phosphate binder dose, titrated to the phosphate content of foods chosen for meals by the patient. Torkabad et al  [36]  Hypertension DaroYab 2.1.0, a mobile app, allowed users to record name of the drug, medication dose, precautions, and time (date, day, hour) medication is to be taken, reminded participants by voice alarm and text message to take medication, and provided drug information on generic drugs, herbal medicines, and their side effects.\n\nOut of the 14 apps, 12 had explicit medication reminder functions  [24, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] 36, 37] . These apps sent medication reminder alerts at the appropriate time and according to the number of prescribed doses. Of the remaining 2 apps, one featured a smartphone-based relational agent that simulated face-to-face conversations and provided education regarding medication adherence  [26]  and the second app had educational video content, including on lifestyles and responsibilities of being a dialysis patient  [35] . Some apps involved users' caregivers by sending notifications to them about critical health information like blood pressure levels, sharing monitoring of medication adherence to prescriptions, or granting access to a patient's medication taking history, including receiving alerts when medication doses were missed  [25, 29, 32] .\n\nOf the 14 apps, 9 had medication-specific information available  [24, 26, [28] [29] [30] 32, [34] [35] [36] , for example, daily educational messages about hypertension  [28]  and animated education videos on hyperphosphatemia, dialysis, and phosphate binders  [35] . Six out of 14 apps had a component of education  [26, [28] [29] [30] [31] 35] , including information about atrial fibrillation  [26]  and Parkinson disease from Parkinson's UK and the Cure Parkinson's Trust.\n\nOut of the 14 apps, 3 used unique methods of user engagement  [26, 30, 35] . In one study, a smartphone-based relation agent, Tanya, was used that simulated in-person conversations with a health coach and provided information on atrial fibrillation, its symptoms, monitoring, and medication adherence  [26] . Another study used interactive storytelling where users were invited to choose what happens next to a fictional character experiencing similar health conditions as them. This approach was used to provide users with specific medication adherence tips  [30] . Finally, an app meant to support patients with hyperphosphatemia had a personalized diet calculator function  [35] . The interactive database used in this app enabled meal calculations for elements such as energy, protein, and the required phosphate binder dose for each meal."

      "text": "A total of 13 of 14 studies used continuous medication adherence measures. These medication adherence measures can be categorized into 5 categories: Hill Bone compliance scale  [28, 29] , percentage adherent  [24, 27, 30, 34] , MMAS-8  [25, 31, 36, 37] , MMAS-4  [32, 35] , and a self-made scale  [33]  (medication adherence scales, measurements, and results are presented in Multimedia Appendix 4).\n\nThe remaining study used dichotomous medication adherence measures. Participants were asked: \"Do you sometimes forget to take [name of prescribed anticoagulant medication]?\" and \"Over the past two weeks, were there days that you did not take [name of prescribed anticoagulant medication]?\" The number of participants who answered yes to either question at baseline and at follow-up was used to measure nonadherence between the control and intervention groups  [26] .\n\nThe Hill Bone compliance scale, MMAS-8 and MMAS-4, and self-made scale were self-reported measurements. The percentage adherence was calculated using methods such as pill counts  [24]  and electronic monitoring devices  [27, 34] ."

Overall, 10 trials showed statistically significant improvement in medication adherence  [25, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] 33, 34, 36, 37] . In the remaining 4 trials, 2 studies did not demonstrate a significant difference between comparison groups  [24, 35] , 1 study was unclear  [32] , and in 1 study, the first medication adherence measure was significant, but the second measure was not  [26] .\n\nStudies that assessed medication adherence with continuous measures and used the same scales were assessed in the following 3 separate meta-analyses. Mean differences in medication adherence scores at the end of the study period were conducted on studies using the MMAS-8  [25, 31, 37] , MMAS-4  [32, 35] , and percentage medication adherence  [27, 30]  scales (Figures  2 3 4 ).\n\nFigure  2 . Meta-analysis results of the effect of app interventions on medication adherence for studies that used the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. The gray boxes and black lines represent mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs, respectively. The gray diamond represents the combined MD estimate for all studies, its width signifying 95% CI bounds  [25, 31, 37] . For the MMAS-8 scale, the mean difference between intervention and control groups was 0.57 (95% CI 0.33-0.80; P<.001, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P value for heterogeneity tes =.94). For studies that measured adherence using the MMAS-4 scale, the mean difference between the control and intervention groups was 0.15 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.42; P=.28, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P value for heterogeneity test=.54). For studies using the percentage medication adherence scale, the mean difference in adherence was 18.85 (95% CI 2.17-35.53; P=.03, I 2 =63%, \u03c4 2 =94.89, P value for heterogeneity test=.10). Considering the heterogeneity measures, no statistical heterogeneity was observed in the MMAS-8 and MMAS-4 meta-analyses, therefore increasing the reliability of these meta-analyses results. However, for the percentage medication adherence meta-analysis, the heterogeneity measures indicate moderate to high statistical heterogeneity and suggest variability between the 2  [27, 30]  studies, perhaps due to study design or lack of standardization of adherence measurement tools, which should be considered when interpreting these findings.\n\nAdditionally, difference-in-differences meta-analyses were conducted, based on adherence scale, for studies that measured adherence before and after the intervention. One difference-in-differences meta-analysis was done for studies using the MMAS-8 scale  [24, 31, 37] , and the second metaanalysis was conducted for the studies using the MMAS-4 scale  [32, 35]  (Figures  5  and  6 ). Both meta-analyses demonstrated that the app intervention increased medication adherence. For studies using the MMAS-8 scale, the mean difference was 0.38 (95% CI 0.15-0.62; P=.001, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P value for heterogeneity test=.51), with no statistical heterogeneity observed. For studies using the MMAS-4 scale, the mean difference was 0.55 (95% CI 0.17-0.93; P=.005, I 2 =33%, \u03c4 2 =0.03, P value for heterogeneity test=.22), with low statistical heterogeneity. The overall low statistical heterogeneity increases reliability in the meta-analyses results and suggests mobile apps can effectively improve medication adherence, even when within-group differences are accounted for.\n\nFigure  5 .

      "text": "A systematic review of 14 RCTs was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile apps on medication adherence in managing chronic conditions  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . While the number and type of features of each app differed, 12 had explicit medication reminder functions  [24, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] 36, 37] . Overall, 9 of the 14 apps examined were specifically designed for a chronic condition  [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] 34, 35] , with 4 of them being designed for participants with hypertension  [25, [27] [28] [29] . The remaining 5 apps were general medication reminder apps applied to chronic conditions  [24, 32, 33, 36, 37] .\n\nOut of the 14 RCTs, 10 trials reported that app-based interventions significantly improved medication adherence  [25, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] 33, 34, 36, 37] . Meta-analyses on the mean difference in medication adherence scores between intervention and control groups for studies using the MMAS-8 scale, percentage medication adherence scale, and both sets of difference in differences meta-analyses indicated that app-based interventions can improve medication adherence  [25, 27, [30] [31] [32] 35, 37] , with varied statistical heterogeneity and significance. The heterogeneity among studies should be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of studies used for each meta-analysis  [41] .\n\nThe results of this review are consistent with previous studies in this field that investigated the use of mobile apps on medication adherence. Previous systematic reviews have shown apps to be effective in increasing medication adherence in specific chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease  [20]  and hypertension  [18, 42] , other chronic conditions  [11] , diabetes  [43] , and general conditions  [19, 21] .\n\nThe comparability with other systematic reviews suggests that this review contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting app-based medication adherence interventions.\n\nThis review can be compared with other types of interventions for medication adherence. Educational interventions are one of the most well-used methods to improve medication adherence with varying effectiveness. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies found verbal educational interventions improved medication adherence, with low to moderate quality evidence, in patients with hypertension  [44] . The average duration of follow-up was 6 months, and a small statistically significant overall effect on medication adherence was found (Cohen d=0.18, 95% CI 0.01-0.34; P<.04). Hypertension was the most prevalent condition in this review, and comparatively, our review found that apps had a greater effect on medication adherence, with less follow-up, and the average length of studies in this review was 3 months. For example, in the meta-analysis for studies using the MMAS-8 scale, the mean difference was 0.57 (95% CI 0.33-0.80, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P=.94) and the difference-in-difference analysis was 0.38 (95% CI 0.15-0.62, I 2 =0%, \u03c4 2 =0, P=.51).\n\nAnother systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 RCTs found education programs had no significant effect at 1 month post-intervention, but significantly improved medication adherence among patients with coronary artery disease at 2 to 6 months post-intervention with moderate evidence (standardized mean difference=1.13, 95% CI 0.33-1.94; P=.006)  [45] . While the effect size at the 2-to 6-month mark was larger than the results of our review, the followup period was longer than the average length in our review and limited to only one population of patients, whereas our review included several chronic conditions. Compared to these reviews on educational interventions, the results of this systematic review demonstrated that mobile app interventions have consistent and moderate improvements in medication adherence, across a diverse range of chronic conditions in a smaller time span. Additionally, in comparison to the resource-intensive nature of education interventions, mobile apps can be less costly, more accessible, and scalable tools that can be used alongside other medication adherence initiatives such as education programs."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "From the results of the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment, we can infer that the studies used in this review are of moderate quality. The bias assessment highlights blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome accessors and other biases, such as sample size, unvalidated medication adherence measures, and recruitment techniques as the main concerns.\n\nWhile this review purposely focused on all chronic conditions, the diversity of studies made it challenging to pool data together. For example, the age of participants in included studies ranges from 20.6 years to 72.1 years  [24, 26] . However, there are differences in mobile health app use by age. Younger populations, commonly defined as under 35 years old, are shown to use apps more frequently than older populations who are not as comfortable using apps  [46] . The differences in mobile app comfort and use between different age groups may mean apps impact medication adherence differentially by age, which is not captured by this review.\n\nAnother limitation was the wide variation in control interventions. Out of 14 studies, in 4 trials, the control group received no alternative interventions  [25, 30, 32, 33] , while the remaining 10 control groups received some form of alternative interventions, including different elements from physical examinations to nutrition counseling sessions  [24, [26] [27] [28] [29] 31, [34] [35] [36] [37] . These differences between the control arm of trials make it difficult to compare results across studies because the comparison groups are not the same. Furthermore, the length of intervention ranged from 30 days  [24, 26]  to 12 months  [27] . This range makes it difficult to comment on the optimal duration of app use to obtain increased medication adherence. However, since chronic conditions affect different populations and have various treatments, these differences were anticipated, thereby allowing for a review to summarize effectiveness of mobile apps in managing medication adherence for chronic conditions.\n\nSince there is no standardized way to measure medication adherence  [47] [48] [49] , a range of methods were used by studies included in this review, such as self-reporting with different measurement scales, pill counts, and electronic monitoring. This made it difficult to pool data together to perform one meta-analysis to obtain a single summary measure of medication adherence. Instead, multiple meta-analyses based on medication adherence measure type were conducted, and each demonstrated that mobile apps are effective in promoting medication adherence.\n\nFinally, 11 out of 14 studies used self-reporting medication adherence measures  [25, 26, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [35] [36] [37] . These measures have different questions, responses, and recall periods, can be subject to social desirability and memory biases, and tend to overestimate medication adherence compared with other assessment methods  [50] . Since most of the studies analyzed used self-reported measures, the accuracy of the medication adherence measures might be of concern. However, selfreported measures are the most commonly used instruments to measure medication adherence in the clinical and research settings and are preferred for their speed, efficiency, and low resource cost  [50, 51] ."

      "title": "Future Research",
      "text": "Future large-scale studies with standardized medication adherence measures are needed to understand the effectiveness of apps in improving medication adherence for chronic conditions.\n\nFuture systematic reviews could investigate the impact of specific app features. Since all studies concluded that mHealth apps improved medication adherence, it would be interesting to investigate which app features had the most impact and whether there was a difference between apps with more features compared to simple reminder ones. Similarly, the 14 RCTs had a range of length of intervention, from 30 days to 12 months. It could be investigated what the minimal time and frequency of app usage is to change medication adherence. Another interesting avenue for future research is to consider studies with mobile apps implemented in clinical practice and assess their impact on medication adherence.\n\nFinally, future systematic reviews could investigate the effectiveness of mHealth apps for medication adherence from a patient perspective. To address this, there are a growing number of studies investigating the patient perspective through qualitative methods, such as focus groups. For example, to investigate primary care patients' comfort sharing health information by mobile device, their awareness, and the use of patient portals, 918 patients completed a survey  [52] . It was found that patients were more comfortable sharing mHealth information with providers than having third parties store their information, with patients older than 55 years less comfortable sharing information with providers. Studies, like this one, that investigated patient perspectives on medication adherence apps and their effectiveness could be used in the review, with the summarized knowledge being used to develop more effective adherence apps or when evaluating app effectiveness."

The apps investigated in this review had a range of features, from simple reminder notifications to symptom trackers to a smartphone-based relation agent, demonstrating that a variety of app features can support medication adherence. There are limitations to this review, including range of effect sizes between studies, varied control arms, and self-reported medication adherence measures. More evidence, including larger scale trials with standardized methods of measuring medication adherence, is needed to strongly conclude that mobile apps can significantly increase medication adherence for chronic conditions."
