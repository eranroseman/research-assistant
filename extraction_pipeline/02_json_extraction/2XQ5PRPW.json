  "title": "Evaluating the feasibility, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of telemedicine interventions in managing COVID-19 within low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs): A systematic review",
  "abstract": "COVID-19 has tragically taken the lives of more than 6.5 million people globally, significantly challenging healthcare systems and service delivery, especially in low-and middleincome countries (LMICs). This systematic review aims to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine interventions for COVID-19 management; (2) assess the adoption of telemedicine interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) examine the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine implementation efforts and (4) analyze the sustainability of telemedicine interventions for COVID-19 disease management within LMIC service settings. We reviewed studies from selected public health and health science databases, focusing on those conducted in countries classified as low and middle-income by the World Bank, using telemedicine for confirmed COVID-19 cases, and adhering to Proctor's framework for implementation outcomes. Of the 766 articles identified and 642 screened, only 3 met all inclusion criteria. These studies showed reduced reliance on antibiotics, prescription drugs, and emergency department referrals among telemedicine patients. Statistical parity was observed in the length of stay, diagnostic test ordering rates, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnoses between telemedicine and in-person visits. Telemedicine interventions designed for post-COVID physical rehabilitation demonstrated safety, sustainability, and enhanced quality of life for patients without requiring specialized equipment, proving adaptable across contexts with appropriate technology. These interventions were also economically sustainable and cost-effective for healthcare systems as a whole. Proposed strategies to bridge implementation gaps include community-level assessments, strategic planning, multisectoral partnerships of local hospital administration and lawmakers, legal consultations, and healthcare informatics improvements. Increased \n PLOS DigitaL HeaLtH Telemedicine and COVID-19 investment in telemedicine research focusing on infectious disease management is crucial for the continued development and refinement of effective strategies tailored to resource-constrained regions.",

      "text": "The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019, commonly referred to as COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, has had a devastating global impact. Over 6.5 million lives have been lost, and more than 600 million individuals have been infected worldwide. The scale of this pandemic places it among the most catastrophic in modern history, echoing the severity of the 1918 Spanish Influenza  [1, 2] . Driven by its highly pathogenic nature and rapid transmission rate, COVID-19 poses substantial risks to human health. Extensive scientific research has identified SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent, leading to a severe respiratory syndrome. This infectious disease is characterized by its transmissibility range, the potential to induce chronic morbidity, adverse symptoms, and, tragically, fatalities-particularly among vulnerable populations and underserved communities, including those residing in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)  [3] [4] [5] .\n\nThe strategic employment of evidence-based interventions (EBI), particularly the rapid development and widespread distribution of vaccines, has played a pivotal role in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The multifaceted approach to research and the creation of vaccines encompassed a meticulous process of clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing at scale, and the implementation of extensive vaccination campaigns across diverse populations worldwide. Additionally, alongside vaccination efforts, public health measures, such as widespread testing, contact tracing, promotion of hygiene practices, and the implementation of social distancing protocols, significantly contributed to mitigating the spread and severity of the virus. This collective and multifaceted approach"

      "text": "Telemedicine and COVID-19 marks a landmark in the global effort to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, showcasing the power of scientific innovation, public health coordination, and international collaboration in tackling a global health crisis of unprecedented magnitude.\n\nWhile the global reduction of morbidity and mortality from the viral infection is a notable achievement, the advent of COVID-19 presented unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems and the provision of health services across all sectors. Its impact reverberated at various levels, inducing substantial shifts in individual behaviors, societal norms, and institutional operations  [6] . The most discernible effects were experienced within underserved communities, particularly in LMICs. These countries, characterized by a gross national income (GNI) per capita between $1,036 and $4,045  [7] , faced substantial economic disadvantages in implementing costly interventions to combat diseases within their resource-constrained settings  [8] .\n\nRecognizing the urgency to curb the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the continuity of safe healthcare services, many nations turned to telemedicine interventions  [9, 10] . The implementation of telemedicine, especially in low-resource settings, provides a medium to increase access to primary preventative services, decelerate the progression of conditions into chronic diseases, and increase opportunities for accurate evaluation and prognosis of existing conditions  [8] . Nevertheless, within LMICs, persistent economic and technological barriers continue to impede the feasibility of these interventions, consequently hindering their widespread adoption in these settings. Addressing these obstacles is essential to ensure equitable access to quality healthcare and technology, particularly in regions most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of such global health crises  [8] .\n\nTelemedicine offers a promising avenue to mitigate disease transmission and safeguard vulnerable populations' health while extending crucial care to patients in need  [6] . Harnessing advanced telecommunication strategies offers a way to mitigate geographical barriers to healthcare access that patients may experience while also protecting public health in the prevention of communicable diseases. Telemedicine is a platform that can connect patients with the necessary tools for health assessment, diagnosis, interventions, and consultations, transcending geographical barriers and enhancing access to healthcare services  [11] . Telemedicine research in the context of COVID-19 still carries a degree of uncertainty.\n\nDespite the novelty of COVID-19, there has been limited research published on how disease management affected crucial healthcare services as it pertains to the feasibility, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of telemedicine interventions  [8, 10, 12] . This ambiguity is particularly accentuated in the domain of COVID-19 treatment within LMICs, where challenges related to economic constraints, technological infrastructure, and healthcare resource availability further complicate the effective implementation and widespread adoption of telemedicine solutions. Addressing these uncertainties and challenges in LMICs is pivotal to ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare and fortifying healthcare systems against future health crises.\n\nTelemedicine is a solution that ideally addresses a myriad of challenges posed by factors such as COVID-19-related restrictions, disruptions in routine healthcare delivery, physician shortages, and socio-economic barriers, all of which have significantly impeded access to essential care  [13] . In LMICs, where prevailing healthcare challenges include limited accessibility to healthcare services and resource constraints, significant hurdles exist in effectively managing COVID-19  [14] . Introducing telemedicine interventions in this context may present challenges, but it is not an insurmountable endeavor.\n\nThe primary aim of this systematic review is to address the implementation outcomes of feasibility, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of telemedicine interventions in managing COVID-19 within LMICs. In addition, we will address the following service outcomes: equity, efficacy, safety, and patient-centricity to understand the effects of telemedicine"

This review lays the foundation for a vital research inquiry: How do the feasibility, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of telemedicine interventions for managing COVID-19 impact the accessibility of essential healthcare services in LMICs? The significance of this review lies in its dedicated exploration of the unique challenges presented by COVID-19 within LMICs and its mission to pinpoint existing gaps in healthcare delivery and access within these communities. There exists an urgent need for further research into telehealth interventions for disease management on a global scale, with a particular emphasis on prioritizing LMICs in this crucial endeavor. Understanding and addressing these challenges are key to ensuring equitable healthcare access and fortifying healthcare systems, particularly in regions most vulnerable to the repercussions of global health crises."

Mean age: 36.3 \u00b1 9.7 Gender distribution: 57.1% (n = 55) were female and 43.9% (n = 43) were male Study Group distribution: Telemedicine group (n = 48) and Non-telemedicine group (n = 50) Telemedicine [TM-ED] (experimental) and non-telemedicine [ED only] (control group) Aim: Compare telemedicine diagnosis with faceto-face evaluation in patients with suspected respiratory tract infection who spontaneously sought evaluation at an emergency department. Adoption: Diagnostic distribution by Telemedicine in TM-ED Group was 29 (67.4%) for upper airway infection and was statistically similar to the subsequent face-to-face assessment, 31 (72.1%), Moderate Kappa 0.386 [95% CI: 0.112-0.66]; p = 0.536. COVID-19 RT-PCR was ordered by TM in 26 (76.5%) versus 27 (79.4%) in face-to-face evaluation, High Kappa 0.715 [95%CI: 0.413-1]; p>0.999. Telemedicine trended towards less antibiotic prescription: 2 (5.9%) vs. 6 (17.6%), Moderate Kappa 0.452 [95%CI: 0.021 -0.873]; p = 0.125. Efficacy: In this study involving patients with acute respiratory symptoms who had sought evaluation at an ED, those who received TM evaluation were markedly more quickly evaluated (median of 5 minutes and 30 seconds of remote assistance). Safety: Another significant TM advantage in low-risk patients suspected of RTI is reduction of exposure to contagion at ED and the need for personal protective equipment. No clinical adverse events were reported associated with this study. Equity: There was no statistical difference between the TM-ED and face-to-face ED groups concerning diagnostic tests, ED length of stay, final ED grouped ICD-10 diagnosis, and prescription. The TM-ED Group had a similar patient profile and regular care practice to the ED Group. Patient -centricity: All patients provided written informed consent. Two patients withdrew consent. Four patients in the TM-ED Group were called for face-to-face evaluation before TM, and one had connection problems. These patients were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Telerehabilitation [TeleGr] (experimental) and non-telemedicine [CGr] (control group) Aim: Investigate the effectiveness of a telerehabilitation exercise program performed without requiring any special equipment on the physical condition of COVID-19 subjects from home. Feasibility: Lower SGRQ scores indicate better health. In our study, there was an improvement (43.76% decrease) in SGRQ activity, impact, and total scores before (31.47) and after (17.70) in TeleGr. There was less improvement (26.28% decrease) observed in the CGr scores. As a result, the telerehabilitation exercise program has been shown to improve the quality of life of COVID-19 cases and is an alternative method that can be suitable for situations, including pandemics."

Patient -centricity: In all exercises, the patients were asked to place the camera in a place, where the patient could be easily seen by the physiotherapist. Subjects' relatives were requested to be in the room during the exercise sessions. Exercise was interrupted in case of excessive fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, and the subjects' request to interrupt exercise.\n\n( communication between the practitioners and participants, regular evaluation, adherence to visit schedule, and follow-up, resulting in a strong study response rate of 65%. While the intervention is cost-friendly since it requires no special equipment, it is not cost-free; there is minimal financial burden associated with telerehabilitation benefits for both patients and hospital administrations, particularly in the context of follow-ups and ongoing care delivery  [20] .\n\nThe results of the feasibility assessment revealed significant overall improvements in the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) (p = 0.035), Timed \"Up and Go\" test (TUG) (p = 0.005), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) 5-times sit-up time (p = 0.039), and Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) activity (p = 0003), impact (p = 0.005), and total scores (p = 0.002) within the telerehabilitation intervention group (TeleGr) compared to only one significant improvement in the control group (CGr) in their pain score (p = 0.039) at the end of the program (Table  3 )  [19] . Furthermore, an indicator of quality of life, the SGRQ total score in the TeleGr group demonstrated a more notable decrease (43.76%) in health-related impairments of subjects' quality of life compared to the CGr group (17.70%) before and after treatment.\n\nJi et al. assessed the adoption, feasibility, and cost considerations of remote monitoring and teleconsultations for COVID-19 prevention in rural communities in China (Table  3 )  [21] . Remote monitoring was referred to as the use of wearable or mobile technology to track patients' health status, allowing providers to monitor a patient's disease progress closely and from anywhere. Teleconsultations were referred to as a way of connecting patients to medical specialists to discuss their care and treatment or receive guidance virtually, in their current location or hospital. Both are subsets of telemedicine and were used in tandem throughout the study. To facilitate the uptake and adoption of the telemedicine interventions, community health centers were equipped with workstations, monitoring equipment, and an internet management platform, enabling remote examinations, treatment guidance, and dynamic monitoring. A noteworthy outcome was the enhanced efficiency of consultations at the community hospital due to remote registration, which helped reduce cross-infection risks within the rural population. Patients completed a valid and reliable questionnaire to collect their demographic data and sentiments on the effectiveness of remote monitoring at the start and end of the program. Furthermore, after 6 months, the feasibility assessment revealed that the remote monitoring intervention significantly (p<0.001) improved patients' cognitive awareness (positive mean difference: 3.54 \u00b1 1.95), perceived benefits (positive mean difference: 20.30 \u00b1 3.41), self-efficacy (positive mean difference: 5.90 \u00b1 2.24), and behavioral outcomes (positive mean difference: 7.74 + 2.54) (Table  3 )  [21] .\n\nTelemedicine played a pivotal role in encouraging self-quarantine while ensuring access to appropriate care across various settings  [22] [23] [24] . This approach substantially reduced hospital foot traffic, eliminated the need for in-person patient registration, and effectively controlled and prevented COVID-19 outbreaks (Table  3 )  [21] . Additionally, the study demonstrated that teleconsultations decreased the labor demands on hospital personnel and fostered diverse interactions and connectivity between patients and providers across great distances. This approach positively impacted patient health status while also saving time and resources (Table  3 ).\n\nAlthough cost assessment data were limited, the study highlighted that remote monitoring and teleconsultations represented a cost-effective method, capitalizing on readily available technology and promoting the physical and psychological well-being of rural populations. The results underscored positive changes in the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of the participants in the study, which created downstream effects, including increased community health awareness, establishment of dynamic electronic health records, enhanced telemedicine services, health education, and promotion through the study. During COVID-19, in rural communities, telemedicine interventions improved community health and reduced medical barriers overall  [21] ."

These secondary service outcomes encompassed health service indicators, including reported efficacy, safety, equity, and patientcentricity for each trial. Definitions for these service outcomes are provided in Table  1 . Among all three articles, patient-centric efforts were most frequently discussed compared to other service outcomes, followed by equity, and safety.\n\nPehlivan et al. 's study, for instance, emphasized patient-centricity through timely and routine follow-ups by a pulmonologist, along with optimal medication distribution, patient education programs, and a flexible approach accommodating patient interruptions due to fatigue or other health events during the telerehabilitation intervention (see Table  3 )  [19] . Research equity was maintained by providing readily accessible programming for participants, and safety was evaluated through the ongoing monitoring of program effects.\n\nJi and colleagues articulated their patient-centered approach by engaging in the discretionary collection of health information from rural residents participating in remote monitoring and telemedicine consultations. This approach involved remote and off-site face-to-face health monitoring to enhance access to specialized medical services during COVID-19, coupled with upgrading technical supplies, treatment offices, and medical equipment in community health centers (Table  3 )  [21] . In ensuring that patients of all ages were equipped with assistance for utilizing devices intended to monitor symptoms based on need, Ji et al. increased health equity and reduced medical barriers commonly experienced in rural areas. They also found that real-time self-monitoring of symptoms completed by patients yielded increased visibility and identification of those believed to be at risk for having been infected by COVID-19. This, in turn, influenced the overall safety of participants by reducing the risk of cross-infection and outbreak.\n\nIn Accorsi et al. 's study, patient-centric efforts were characterized by the consolidated implementation of face-to-face procedures and data collection during emergency department stays (18.7%) to minimize travel inconveniences. Additionally, the routine care options received did not vary in quality across treatment groups for diagnostic tests (81.6% total), average ED length of stay (89.5 \u00b1 88.5 minutes), ICD-10 diagnosis for upper airway infection (70.4% total), and medical prescriptions (23.5% total); both groups had similar patient profiles (see Table  3 )  [18] . A reduction in exposure and spread of COVID-19 provided a protective advantage, increasing the safety of participants within the emergency department."

This approach also promoted cost-effective access to online health services and resources while preventing the spread of COVID-19 infections  [21] .

To aid in this evaluation, the implementation outcomes were measured through standardized methodology, data sources, and the observed intersections of our outcome measurements across these studies.\n\nStudy implementation outcomes were standardized relative to the study aims using the Proctor et al. framework. For example, within the implementation outcome of adopting telemedicine interventions, Accorsi et al. observed differences in tests and prescriptions ordered by providers based on patient symptoms when measuring diagnostic distribution. In contrast, Ji et al. reported increased consultation efficiency and reduced infections in rural populations following the adoption of telemedicine. For the outcome of feasibility, patient outcomes were measured through intervention assessments collected during and after implementation in both studies. These assessments gathered similar information from patients, including their daily symptoms, well-being, and general health. The implementation outcome of sustainability was uniquely evaluated by Pehlivan et al., based on the guiding framework, without requiring harmonization or standardized measures.\n\nThe Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was employed to critically appraise these three articles, encompassing screening questions, qualitative assessments, and quantitative evaluations (Table  2 ). Following independent reviews and the completion of the appraisal process, each article achieved a score of 9 out of 12, signifying that 75% of the quality criteria were met.\n\nAccorsi et al. yielded significant findings through their telemedicine intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, albeit with a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of their findings  [18] .

Notably, these studies were conducted in middle-income countries, revealing an absence of telemedicine adoption in low-income countries as defined by the World Bank  [7] . The common thread across all these articles was a focus on service delivery through telemedicine.\n\nAmong the three articles, it became evident that the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions was on par with face-to-face consultations. Particularly, rehabilitation delivered via telemedicine emerged as a cost-effective treatment approach compared to traditional in-person programs  [19] . As a high-quality intervention for varied approaches, telemedicine expands access to treatment and facilitates the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients  [18] , all while minimizing risk for both patients and healthcare providers  [21] . Furthermore, telemedicine stands out as a cost-effective approach, as it does not necessitate additional specialized equipment purchases by or for patients  [19, 21] . The lower expense and resource requirements for this versatile intervention make it suitable for use in some rural and underserved areas effectively reducing barriers to healthcare access  [26] .\n\nHowever, it is worth noting a potential drawback: telemedicine may inadvertently create barriers to accessing certain diagnostics and medications for patients  [27] . Across LICs, where the setting is primarily rural, the quality of the information and communications technologies (ICT) infrastructure might not adequately support remote monitoring and intervention  [28] . In situations where immediate attention or diagnostic evaluation based on symptoms is imperative, prioritizing an in-person visit may be more judicious, as it can streamline the process by eliminating the need for two separate appointments-one via telemedicine and another in-person.\n\nWe are hopeful that further research and increased publications documenting the progress of telemedicine implementation efforts within low-income countries will emerge post-COVID. Understanding how infrastructure influences the feasibility, adoption, costeffectiveness, and sustainability of telemedicine interventions is paramount. We advocate for efforts aimed at bolstering technological capabilities, increasing centralized community locations where telemedicine can be accessed, and developing secure platforms and mobile applications for patient use.\n\nWhile many countries have expanded laws to permit the adoption of telemedicine in healthcare settings by issuing guidance at the national level  [24, 28]  we urge for increased attention to existing regulatory frameworks and national guidance for utilizing secure digital health technologies in low-resource and remote settings. From a data privacy and security perspective, it is essential to comprehend how patient records are maintained and what resources are required to digitize these archives in a central repository accessible to necessary stakeholders. Ultimately, the potential benefits of present and future implementation of telemedicine significantly outweigh the barriers that need to be addressed  [29] ."

Similar concerns regarding generalizability were also voiced in Pehlivan et al. 's study  [19] . Furthermore, this study noted that many individuals faced challenges in utilizing technology and internet services, which could pose implementation issues for the telerehabilitation intervention among patients. In contrast, Ji et al. 's study stood out as the only one with a large sample size (n = 1500), making its population more likely to be generalizable  [21] .

      "text": "Telemedicine emerges as a highly effective intervention for addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19 in LMICs. However, several critical factors warrant consideration when implementing this intervention. Many LMICs grapple with resource limitations, highlighting the need for adequate internet and technology infrastructure to facilitate telemedicine. It is crucial to recognize that telemedicine may not be a feasible strategy in some resource-constrained environments. In instances where telemedicine interventions are viable, they hold the potential to significantly mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 and empower patients to better manage the disease. Through this systematic review, it became evident that both patients and caregivers place substantial value on the benefits, safety, quality of care, and engaged care when seeking treatments that promote patient health. Telemedicine is one option to meet patient needs in a timely manner. Empirical evidence from randomized controlled trials underscores the effectiveness of telemedicine when deployed to assist individuals impacted by COVID-19.\n\nAssessing technological capacity within communities should be a priority when implementing telemedicine interventions. In cases where patients lack internet access at home, thoughtful considerations should be given to supplying communities with the necessary computing resources and internet connectivity for teleconsultations and doctor-patient meetings. Local hospital administration can orchestrate such planning and implementation in collaboration with regional and national lawmakers, with due attention to the legal aspects of privacy guidelines and information dissemination between healthcare providers and patients.\n\nFuture research endeavors should be conducted in lower-income countries, encompassing larger sample sizes and a heightened focus on implementation research outcomes. The insights gleaned from these articles underscore the pressing need for additional research to comprehensively analyze telemedicine as an intervention for the management of COVID-19 in LMIC settings lacking robust technological resources."
