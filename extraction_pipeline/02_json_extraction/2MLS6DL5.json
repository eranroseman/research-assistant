  "abstract": "Purpose: Examine the development, implementation and evaluation of just-in-time adaptive interventions ( JITAIs) in behaviour change and evaluate the quality of intervention reporting. Methods: A scoping review of JITAIs incorporating mobile health (mHealth) technologies to improve health-related behaviours in adults. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO using terms related to JITAIs, mHealth, behaviour change and intervention methodology. Narrative analysis assessed theoretical foundations, real-time data capturing and processing methods, outcome evaluation and summarized JITAI efficacy. Quality of intervention reporting was assessed using the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist. Results: Sixty-two JITAIs across physical activity, sedentary behaviour, dietary behaviour, substance use, sexual behaviour, fluid intake, treatment adherence, social skills, gambling behaviour and self-management skills were included. The majority (71%) aimed to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and/or usability. Supporting evidence for JITAI development was identified in 46 studies, with 67% applying this to develop tailored intervention content. Over half (55%) relied solely on self-reported data for tailoring, and 13 studies used only passive monitoring data. While data processing methods were commonly reported, 44% did not specify their techniques. 89% of JITAI designs achieved full marks on the TIDieR checklist and provided sufficient details on JITAI components. Overall, JITAIs proved to be feasible, acceptable and user-friendly across behaviours and",

      "text": "Chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer can negatively impact a person's quality of life  (Megari, 2013) , often requiring extended treatment and long-term management. The course, severity and prognosis of chronic diseases are linked to health behaviours, including physical activity  (Rhodes et al., 2017 ), diet (de Ridder et al., 2017) , alcohol consumption  (Kuntsche et al., 2017)  and smoking  (West, 2017) . While improving health behaviours can help manage chronic diseases, behaviour change interventions often have small effect sizes and the improvement is usually temporary  (Conner & Norman, 2017) . This can be attributed to the complexity and individuality of health behaviours. Behaviour change is a dynamic process that requires a personalized approach, considering an individual's characteristics, needs and variability over time and in different contexts  (Heino et al., 2021) .\n\nMobile health (mHealth), which involves the use of mobile and wireless technologies like smartphones and wearables to support health care practices  (World Health Organization, 2011) , is increasingly being integrated into disease management (Academy of Medical Sciences (Royaume Uni), 2018). These devices can capture complex behaviour patterns and dynamic changes in real-time over extended periods directly from patients in situ. This provides rich, individual-specific information reflecting a person's behaviours, experiences and contexts that can be used to inform personalized support. As settings. Randomized trials showed tailored interventions were efficacious, though outcomes varied by behaviour. Conclusions: JITAIs offer a promising approach to developing personalized interventions, with their potential effects continuously growing. The recommended checklist emphasizes the importance of reporting transparency in establishing robust intervention designs."

      "text": "JITAIs IN BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: SCOPING REVIEW technology evolves, innovative methodological and intervention approaches are also emerging to facilitate personalized interventions. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), for example, entails repeated sampling of individuals' current behaviours and experiences in their natural environements  (Shiffman et al., 2008) . EMA is often used alongside ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) to provide realtime support within these everyday contexts  (Heron & Smyth, 2010) . While this combination enables real-time personalized support, the specifics of how tailoring is achieved are not clear.\n\nThe concept of tailoring seeks to enhance information relevance based on individual characteristics, thereby increasing attentiveness and responsiveness to the intervention content  (Dijkstra & De Vries, 1999; Kreuter & Wray, 2003) . The adaptive intervention approach operationalizes the tailoring concept by introducing design and evaluation principles, including tailoring variables, decision rules and appropriate statistical methods  (Collins et al., 2004) . The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) was subsequently created for developing adaptive interventions. SMART is a multistage randomized trial design that systematically evaluates different intervention sequences to establish decision rules-whether, how, when and based on what criteria to modify intervention elements such as type and dosage (e.g., duration, frequency or amount)  (Almirall et al., 2014) . More recently, micro-randomized trials (MRTs) have emerged as a means to further enhance the tailoring process by optimizing the timing of intervention delivery. It involves randomly assigning various intervention options to a person at multiple time points and assessing proximal outcomes after randomization  (Klasnja et al., 2015) . This helps determine the optimal decision rules dictating when and under what circumstances a particular intervention option should be delivered to maximize its efficacy, while also evaluating how effects vary over time.\n\nBuilding upon the crucial aspects of tailoring-content, dosage and timing-just-in-time adaptive interventions ( JITAIs) represent an innovative approach designed to provide the right support at the right time, adapting to an individual's changing status and contexts  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2018) . JITAIs are grounded in the idea that timing, identified through states of vulnerability and opportunity, plays a critical role in determining the most beneficial moments to deliver support  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2018) . These moments may occur when a person is most receptive, during periods of high risk or when support is most needed. JITAIs offer a structured approach, as shown in Figure  1 , with six components: (i) distal outcome (primary clinical outcome), (ii) proximal outcomes (short-term goals often acted as mediators), (iii) decision points (time points for deciding intervention delivery), (iv) tailoring variables (information used to determine when and how to intervene), (v) intervention options (various support types or delivery modes available at given decision points) and (vi) decision rules (systematic rules linking tailoring variables and intervention options for adaptation).\n\nThe potential of JITAIs is promising, with studies demonstrating changes in physical activity  (Hardeman et al., 2019)  and substance use  (Carpenter et al., 2020; Perski et al., 2022) . However, there F I G U R E 1 Example of a JITAI to improve heart health. It shows an example of using JITAIs to improve heart health (distal outcome) by increasing physical activity (proximal outcome). An intervention decision is made based on the user's sedentary levels, time of the day, location and calendar availability (tailoring variables), which are collected via wearable and smartphone. During waking hours (decision points), the user receives prompts (intervention options) when they have been sedentary for 50 minutes, are not in a moving vehicle and not busy (decision rules).\n\nare challenges in defining JITAIs, adopting behaviour change theories, and establishing efficacy and effectiveness. Firstly, a wide range of interventions are classified under the JITAI umbrella. This does not necessarily imply disagreement, but rather reflects different emphasizes on varied aspects of JITAIs. For instance, Naughton defined JITAIs as context-triggered systems that use sensors to monitor a person's context and offer support when a high-risk situation is detected  (Naughton, 2016) . Adopting Naughton's definition, Hardeman and colleagues defined JITAIs as systems that deliver tailored support based on real-time user data without relying on user initiation. The process of continually adapting support according to ongoing user data is referred to as 'dynamic tailoring'  (Hardeman et al., 2019) . Oikonomidi distinguished JITAIs by the use of algorithms to determine the timing of intervention delivery  (Oikonomidi et al., 2023) . The variety of JITAI definitions has highlighted important considerations of tailoring such as timing, context, real-time adaptation and automated delivery in personalized interventions, but it can also cause discrepancies and complexities in establishing efficacy and effectiveness across JITAIs.\n\nSecondly, while a pragmatic framework has been provided for organizing evidence in JITAIs development  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2015) , the mechanisms through which JITAIs work are study-specific. JITAIs do not strictly adhere to any theories, giving researchers the flexibility to draw on relevant evidence to inform their intervention development. This is a strength of the approach. However, adopting theories is challenging and further complicated by debates on whether existing behaviour change theories can effectively reflect the dynamic changes in an individual's behaviours, experiences and contexts  (Riley et al., 2011) . Finally, the efficacy and effectiveness of JITAIs are not clear. Although meta-analyses have shown significant effect sizes favouring JITAIs over waitlist control groups and alternative treatments  (Wang & Miller, 2020) , systematic reviews have suggested limited evidence for their effectiveness in physical activity  (Hardeman et al., 2019)  and substance use  (Perski et al., 2022) . It is worth noting that the selection of JITAIs in existing reviews varied due to different definitions and research purposes. The heterogeneity in identification and interpretation of what constitutes JITAIs means that these reviews were assessing different interventions under the same label of JITAIs, potentially affecting the judgement of overall effects and intervention quality. The lack of clarity in intervention reporting also results in challenges in assessing intervention quality. It was reported that critical information was often missing for replication  (Oikonomidi et al., 2023) , and details about intervention options and the infrastructure required to implement JITAIs were insufficient for appraisal  (Perski et al., 2022) .\n\nTo begin addressing these challenges and facilitate the development of personalized interventions, we conducted a scoping review to identify commonalities in the development, implementation and evaluation of JITAIs for behaviour change. This review sought to build upon existing literature to achieve a more unified understanding of JITAIs and their applications in mHealth, guided by  Nahum-Shani et al. (2018) ,  Hardeman et al. (2019)  and  Perski et al. (2022)  teams. Our investigation specifically targeted a subset of JITAIs that identify user needs in real-time as they occur, excluding pre-planned opportunities. This focus was chosen because it capitalized the continuity and immediacy inherent in mHealth technologies to provide real-time tailored support. The research questions included the following: (i) what behaviour change theories or other supporting evidence have been used to develop JITAIs? (ii) what data capturing and processing methods have been used in JITAIs? (iii) how have studies using JITAIs evaluated outcomes? Finally, we summarized the findings of randomized studies and assessed the quality of intervention reporting. Based on this, we have proposed a reporting checklist to highlight the defining characteristics of JITAIs and improve reporting transparency, aiding future research on personalized interventions."

Established treatments were also identified. For example, cognitive behavioural therapy was used in eight studies across dietary behaviour  ( Juarascio et al., 2022; Juarascio, Srivastava, et al., 2021) , alcohol use  (Blevins et al., 2021; Leonard et al., 2017) , sexual behaviour  (Shrier et al., 2020) , gambling behaviour  (Hawker et al., 2021) , social skills  (Fulford et al., 2021)  and self-management skills  (Gire et al., 2021) .

Among the identified evidence, 31 studies (67%) reported applying that evidence exclusively to developing intervention options. Other evidence-informed aspects included tailoring variables, decision rules, proximal outcomes, intervention apps, engagement strategies and goal identification."

      "title": "Real-time data capturing and processing",
      "text": "To identify user needs in real-time, JITAIs gather individual information as tailoring variables through three methods: self-reporting, passive monitoring or a combination of both called the hybrid approach (Appendix S4). We found that 34 JITAIs (55%) relied on self-reporting only, with 65% (22/34) reporting using EMA or experiential sampling method, a technique akin to EMA that captures subjective experiences as they occur in everyday life  (Csikszentmihalyi et al., 2014) . Of the remaining studies, 15 (24%) adopted a hybrid approach and 13 (21%) used only passive monitoring. Studies that exclusively employed passive monitoring included physical activity (n = 6)  (Ding et al., 2016; Klasnja et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2011; Mair et al., 2022; Van Dantzig et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021) , sedentary behaviour (n = 4)  (Finkelstein et al., 2015; Ismail & Al, 2022; Thomas & Bond, 2015; Van Dantzig et al., 2013) , substance use (n = 2)  (Gustafson et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2023)  and fluid consumption (n = 1)  (Conroy et al., 2020) .\n\nSelf-initiated reporting was common across studies (23%, 14/62), allowing users to trigger support as needed. Two studies required participants to actively report their daily dietary behaviour  ( Juarascio, Srivastava, et al., 2021)  and medications (Bartlett  Ellis et al., 2019)  to trigger JITAIs. All JITAIs that collected objective data utilized non-invasive mHealth devices in addition to smartphones. Activity tracker was the mostly commonly used  (Carlozzi et al., 2022; Conroy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2016; Finkelstein et al., 2015; Hiremath et al., 2019; Klasnja et al., 2019; Low et al., 2020; Mair et al., 2022; NeCamp et al., 2020; Pellegrini et al., 2015; Valle et al., 2020; Van Dantzig et al., 2013 , 2018; Wang et al., 2023) ; other devices included continuous glucose monitoring device  ( Juarascio et al., 2022) , electrodermal activity tracker  (Leonard et al., 2017) , wireless weight scale  (Valle et al., 2020) , sensors detecting wrist movement, electrocardiography and respiration  (Yang et al., 2023) , and connected water bottle  (Conroy et al., 2020) . Although these data capturing techniques primarily served to measure tailoring variables, some techniques also overlapped with those used in evaluating proximal outcomes.\n\nSeveral techniques were identified for JITAIs to process real-time information and make adaptive decisions. Over half of the included studies (56%, 35/62) provided the purpose, development or source of chosen processing techniques. Seven studies (17%) reported using machine learning algorithms for identifying real-time needs and timing to deliver tailored support. These JITAIs targeted physical activity  (Hiremath et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021) , alcohol use  (Walters et al., 2022) , dietary behaviour  (Forman, Goldstein, Crochiere, et al., 2019; Forman, Goldstein, Zhang, et al., 2019)  and self-management skills  (Burns et al., 2011; Gire et al., 2021) ."

      "title": "Outcome evaluations",
      "text": "The majority of JITAIs (71%) were conducted to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and/or usability, with a subset (n = 9) also reporting preliminary effects  (Ben-Zeev et al., 2014; Beres et al., 2021; Businelle et al., 2016; Forman, Goldstein, Zhang, et al., 2019; H\u00e9bert et al., 2020; Juarascio, Srivastava, et al., 2021; Shrier et al., 2014 Shrier et al., , 2018;; Walters et al., 2022) . Feasibility was commonly evaluated by objective measurements such as compliance, adherence, retention, app usage or intervention usage. Acceptability and usability were assessed by both subjective and objective measurements. Subjective responses for acceptability included perception, satisfaction, helpfulness, usefulness, ease of use or likeability, whereas objective responses included response rate and app usage. Usability was measured through objective behaviour and engagement metrics such as app usage, participation in the intervention, response rate and completion rate, while subjective responses included helpfulness, usefulness, satisfaction, easiness and pleasantness (Appendix S5).\n\nStandardized questionnaires were identified in 15 studies (24%) to quantify acceptability and usability. For assessing acceptability, the instruments included the client satisfaction questionnaire (n = 5)  (Hawker et al., 2021; Leonard et al., 2017; Sizemore et al., 2022; Wenze et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2023) , technology acceptance model scales (n = 4)  (Ben-Zeev et al., 2014; Forman, Goldstein, Crochiere, et al., 2019; Forman, Goldstein, Zhang, et al., 2019; Juarascio, Hunt, et al., 2021) , mobile application rating scale (n = 2)  (Hawker et al., 2021; Morgi\u00e8ve et al., 2022)  and user burden scale (n = 1)  (Conroy et al., 2020) . Usability assessments included the system usability scale (n = 7)  (Ben-Zeev et al., 2014; Conroy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2016; Levin, Haeger, & Cruz, 2019; O'Donnell et al., 2019; Sizemore et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023)  and mobile application rating scale (n = 1)  (Ismail & Al, 2022) . Due to the heterogeneity in metrics and assessment frequencies, direct comparisons of outcomes across studies were not conducted. However, there was a consensus that JITAIs were feasible, acceptable and user-friendly."

      "title": "Potential effects of JITAIs",
      "text": "Of the nine studies reporting preliminary effects alongside feasibility and acceptability, two employed pilot RCTs  (Beres et al., 2021; H\u00e9bert et al., 2020) . The findings showed that JITAIs appeared to have a positive effect, though results varied across behaviours. For example, Beres's study  (Beres et al., 2021) , which targeted smoking, risky sexual behaviour, and fruit, vegetable and alcohol consumption, reported decreases in alcohol intake and risky sexual behaviour in both groups over time. However, increased vegetable consumption during the same period was observed only in the tailored message group. This group also showed a significantly greater increase in vegetable consumption compared to the selftracking group, while no significant changes were noted in the remaining behaviours. In contrast, H\u00e9bert's study  (H\u00e9bert et al., 2020)  on smoking cessation found no significant differences in smoking abstinence across tailored, non-tailored and usual care groups.\n\nA total of 16 studies (20%) investigated effectiveness and efficacy of JITAIs in substance use  (Gonzalez & Dulin, 2015; Gustafson et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2020) , physical activity  (Klasnja et al., 2019; Rabbi, Aung, et al., 2015; Van Dantzig et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2023) , sedentary behaviour  (Finkelstein et al., 2015; Ismail & Al, 2022; Thomas & Bond, 2015) , sexual behaviour (Santa  Maria et al., 2021) , dietary behaviour  (Forman, Goldstein, Crochiere, et al., 2019; Rabbi, Aung, et al., 2015) , treatment adherence  (Ingersoll et al., 2015) , social skills  (Fulford et al., 2021)  and self-management skills  (Levin, Haeger, & Cruz, 2019; Levin, Navarro, et al., 2019) . Out of these, there were five RCTs  (Forman, Goldstein, Crochiere, et al., 2019; Gustafson et al., 2014; Levin, Haeger, & Cruz, 2019; Levin, Navarro, et al., 2019; Van Dantzig et al., 2018)  and two pilot RCTs  (Ingersoll et al., 2015; Santa Maria et al., 2021) . The overall findings suggested that JITAIs were more effective than their comparison groups. For instance, personalized messages demonstrated greater treatment adherence compared to usual care  (Ingersoll et al., 2015) , as well as significant reductions in drug use and stress, and a lower urge for risky sexual behaviour, when compared to random messages (Santa  Maria et al., 2021) . Similar findings were reported with significant reductions in risky drinking days when real-time alerts for risky locations were used alongside usual treatment, as opposed to usual treatment alone  (Gustafson et al., 2014) . Also, tailored skill coaching using ACT led to significant improvements in psychological distress and functioning relative to non-tailored coaching  (Levin, Haeger, & Cruz, 2019; Levin, Navarro, et al., 2019) , and a tailored risk prevention programme achieved greater weight loss than a standard digital programme  (Forman, Goldstein, Crochiere, et al., 2019) . Despite these successes, a tailored coaching system designed for physical activity observed an increase in average daily steps, but this increase was not significantly different from that of the general advice group  (Van Dantzig et al., 2018) .\n\nRegarding proximal effects, two MRTs were conducted on physical activity and sleep  (Klasnja et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023) . Findings of gamification showed that, under the same personalized feedback mechanism, the competition teams significantly increased their daily step counts compared to teams without competition. However, this did not affect daily sleep duration. Additionally, providing activity suggestions was found to increase average step counts, though the effect diminished over time, while anti-sedentary suggestions showed no detectable effect  (Klasnja et al., 2019) . Appendix S6 details the intervention and control groups."

      "title": "Quality of intervention reporting",
      "text": "From the included studies, 55 unique JITAI designs were identified. We found all JITAI designs reported on all 12 items in the TIDieR checklist. Further assessment on the clarity of intervention components showed that the majority (89%, 49/55) provided sufficient details on all JITAI components. However, we were unable to identify clear details in six JITAI designs in terms of their tailoring variables (n = 1), intervention options (n = 3) and decision rules (n = 3). Overall, 89% achieved full marks on the TIDieR checklist and provided adequate information on JITAI components (Table  2 ).\n\nBased on the JITAIs approach and our analysis, we adapted the TIDieR checklist to facilitate transparency in reporting JITAIs or personalized interventions alike, aiding future researchers to identify and evaluate essential information. Our adapted checklist (Table  3 ) expanded items 2, 6, 7 and 9. Intervention rationale (item 2) included four sub-items, consisting of research purposes, research design, target behaviours and target population. Delivery mode (item 6) had three more sub-items, covering data capturing, processing methods and outcome measures. Delivery setting (item 7) included three sub-items related to research ethics, data protection methods and data sharing policies. Tailoring (item 9) was expanded to include six JITAI components, namely decision points, tailoring variables, intervention options, decision rules, proximal outcomes and distal outcome  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2018 ). An example using the checklist was provided in Appendix S9."

Although prior reviews have undertaken similar investigations in physical activity  (Hardeman et al., 2019) , substance use  (Perski et al., 2022)  and disease management  (Oikonomidi et al., 2023) , their focus was limited to a specific behaviour or context, with studies primarily using RCTs, and only examining four JITAI components-tailoring variables, decision points, decision rules and intervention options  (Nahum-Shani et al., 2018) . Our findings provided a broader perspective drawn from different health-related behaviours. Some were congruent with prior analyses in aspects such as theoretical foundations, data capturing methods, and intervention reporting, while others presented more nuanced details in outcome evaluation and data processing.\n\nIntegrating theory into the intervention development is considered an important step but can be challenging due to unclear guidelines and overlapping constructs  (Michie, 2005; Michie & Prestwich, 2010) . A previous review on physical activity  (Hardeman et al., 2019)  reported that only five JITAIs were based on theories, but it also observed four BCTs, including goal setting, prompts/cues, feedback on behaviour and action planning. Our review took a more inclusive approach to identifying any supporting evidence. Despite nearly 74% of JITAIs reporting relevant evidence, we found that the majority of that evidence was limited to informing intervention options (67%).

See the Terms and Conditions ( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions ) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License a practical challenge is identifying scientific models capable of supporting the dynamics of multicomponent interventions like JITAIs. Existing JITAIs typically selected and integrated their evidence on a component-by-component basis, without considering the interplay among components and the impact of within-person and time-varying effects. Another equally critical challenge is theory translation. For example, Rabbi's team described their experience of converting operant conditioning theory into intervention strategies (e.g., motivational messages) aimed at enhancing adherence to daily selfreporting (Rabbi et al., 2020). They emphasized that theory translation is an iterative process requiring feedback from target users. This is to ensure that the translated elements induce the desired actions and align with user values. mHealth technologies, which are capable of tracking real-time changes and providing dynamic feedback, can support research to identify which theoretical constructs work and how they work within individuals over time. Such understanding can help explain JITAIs mechanisms and improve the development of effective personalized interventions.\n\nIdentifying optimal timing to assess individual needs and determining relevant factors for tailoring are critical for effective data collection in JITAIs. This requires using the appropriate methods and tools to capture the necessary information at the right time without overwhelming the users. Our review found that over half of JITAIs were solely dependent on self-reported data, indicating a strong reliance on subjective assessments within the current JITAIs landscape. This mirrors a previous review where over 75% of their included JITAIs required active monitoring from either patients, health professionals or both  (Oikonomidi et al., 2023) . Subjective assessments offer the advantage of a richer user-centred perspective and potentially foster awareness of unwanted behaviours or triggers. However, they can be limited by user burdens and recall biases. In contrast, passive monitoring reduces the need for active user input, but it may not fully capture the nuances of personal experiences that lead to particular behaviours. A prior review suggested that the choice between active versus passive assessments should consider whether the target users would benefit and how to ethically collect high-quality data without infringing on user privacy or causing undue burden  (Perski et al., 2022) . Further research is needed in examining the balance between active and passive user engagement in relation to assessing real-time needs, thereby improving the quality of data collection and user involvement.\n\nReal-time data processing enables JITAIs to execute decision rules that determine the appropriate timing to offer the right support. No prior reviews have fully explored how decision rules were operated. We assessed decision rules and data processing methods with a primary focus on whether readers could clearly understand the underlying logic and practical applications. Still, 44% of studies did not provide descriptions of their data processing techniques. It should be noted that the complexities involved in describing more advanced computations, such as machine learning models, may challenge replicability. An observation was made in another review where 43% of decision rules were unreplicable  (Oikonomidi et al., 2023) . This issue highlighted a gap in the current JITAI literature regarding reporting completeness. In addition, a review on smoking cessation observed that JITAIs predominantly used static if-then rules without accounting for time variance and user availability or receptivity  (Perski et al., 2022) . Particularly, user receptivity was found to have significant associations with factors such as age, personality, device type, day/time, phone battery, phone interaction and location  (K\u00fcnzler et al., 2019) . Another study suggested that using machine learning models could lead up to a 40%\n\nCategories Items Guidance Checkbox How well: was the adherence assessed, and if so, what methods were used to evaluate it and how well did it perform?

Our review identified seven studies using machine learning methods, with one explicitly using a reinforcement learning model  (Wang et al., 2021) . The application of reinforcement learning may improve JITAIs effectiveness as it adapts to changes in users' behaviours and environments, while also using group-level data to speed the learning process and result in improved performance  (Liao et al., 2019) . In future research, incorporating advanced computations and addressing user receptivity may improve the balance between involvement and burden. This could also reduce the chances of delivering an intervention without enough evidence of its effectiveness. Finally, our analysis observed that JITAIs appeared to be efficacious in control settings, but we recognized that the field is still evolving and requires large-scale validation for its clinical efficacy and effectiveness. Similar to the past review  (Perski et al., 2022) , the main challenge of analysing these studies was the heterogeneity of outcome metrics, measurement units and assessment frequencies. Despite the positive perception towards personalized functionality, it was difficult to infer exactly how tailoring mechanisms contribute to these positive results and which one performs better than others. Developing a standardized set of metrics to evaluate multi-component interventions like JITAIs may improve crossstudy comparisons and distinguish single-component effects. While we agree with existing reviews that the JITAI landscape holds considerable room for advancement, our quality assessment of intervention reporting indicated a growing maturity in the transparency of intervention design. To build on this progress, our proposed JITAIs reporting checklist focuses on enhancing aspects such as tailoring, realtime data capturing and processing, and data governance. These elements are critical for improving the evaluation processes in future research on personalized interventions."

      "text": "The strengths of this scoping review include an in-depth examination of JITAI components and their implementation across a wide range of health-related behaviours, an evaluation of intervention reporting quality, and having developed an intervention reporting checklist to improve transparency. However, limitations need to be addressed. First, our search strategy and selection criteria were designed to focus on the relevance and immediacy of intervention delivery in the mHealth context. While it enabled us to include a broad range of health-related behaviours, it is possible that relevant publications have emerged outside our strategy and after the conclusion of our review period. This may limit the breadth and currency of our analysis. Additionally, the assessment of intervention reporting clarity was influenced by whether studies identified their interventions as JITAIs. Those that did not were less likely to provide JITAI-specific information. Our proposed checklist was developed to enhance reporting practices among researchers of personalized interventions and encourage the adoption of JITAIs as a guiding framework."
