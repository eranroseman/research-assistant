  "title": "Assessing a digital technology-supported community child health programme in India using the Social Return on Investment framework",
  "abstract": "An estimated 5.0 million children aged under 5 years died in 2020, with 82% of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Over one-third of Mumbai's population has limited access to healthcare, and child health outcomes are particularly grave among the urban poor. We describe the implementation of a digital technology-based child health programme in Mumbai and evaluate its holistic impact. Using an artificial intelligence (AI)powered mobile health platform, we developed a programme for community-based management of child health. Leveraging an existing workforce, community health workers (CHW), the programme was designed to strengthen triage and referral, improve access to healthcare in the community, and reduce dependence on hospitals. A Social Return on Investment (SROI) framework is used to evaluate holistic impact. The programme increased the proportion of illness episodes treated in the community from 4% to 76%, subsequently reducing hospitalisations and out-of-pocket expenditure on private healthcare providers. For the total investment of Indian Rupee (INR) 2,632,271, the social return was INR 34,435,827, delivering an SROI ratio of 13. The annual cost of the programme per child was INR 625. Upskilling an existing workforce such as CHWs, with the help of AI-driven decisionsupport tools, has the potential to extend capacity for critical health services into community settings. This study provides a blueprint for evaluating the holistic impact of health technologies using evidence-based tools like SROI. These findings have applicability across income settings, offering clear rationale for the promotion of technology-supported interventions that strengthen healthcare delivery.",

      "text": "Globally, an estimated 5.0 million children under 5 years of age died in 2020, with 82% of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia  [1] . Mumbai, the commercial capital of India, is known as a mega-city that attracts migrants from across the country. The high cost of living forces migrants to find shelter in slums around the city and its margins  [2] . A slums is defined by the United Nations Programme on Human Settlements as, \"a contiguous settlement where the inhabitants are characterised as having inadequate housing and basic services.\" [3] As such, slums fulfil the bare minimum requirement of providing a roof over the head but struggle to meet necessities such as access to healthcare, adequate nutrition, clean drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene  [4] . More than one-third of Mumbai's population has limited access to medical care, and child health outcomes are particularly grave among the urban poor  [5] .\n\nThere are many non-profit organisations working in the Mumbai slums, but the need is vast, and resources are often insufficient to provide for all. Healthcare is fragmented, and consultations with a private doctor or hospitalisation come at a considerable cost. The high cost of prescribed medications adds another layer of financial burden. With most community members being daily-wage earners, a day of illness means loss of critical income. The M East Ward, with a population of over 800,000 (2011 census)  [6] , has been identified as one of the most deprived areas of Mumbai according to most health indicators, and approximately 85% of its inhabitants live in slums  [7] . This ward also has the highest healthcare expenditure compared to other wards  [7] . More than 50% of this expenditure is covered out-of-pocket, often via private providers  [7] . With a sparsity of studies documenting healthcare-seeking behaviour, disease prevalence, and health outcomes in the community, the healthcare needs of many are currently invisible.\n\nA multidisciplinary collaboration between a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), an academic institution, and a health technology provider was established to develop a programme for community-based management of child health in slums and evaluate its impact through an evidence-based framework for health economic assessment. This programme focused on leveraging an existing workforce, community health workers (CHWs), whose activities were augmented through an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mobile health platform to strengthen triage and referral for children under 6 years of age, residing in M East Ward. The programme was designed to both increase early access to healthcare in the community and reduce dependence on hospitals as the provider of last resort-a healthcare delivery model which is critical for the sustainability of health systems through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\nSocial Return on Investment (SROI) is an outcome-based framework that helps organisations measure and account for holistic value  [8] . The framework was developed in the early 1990s by the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund and matured by the New Economics Foundation as a tool that helps organisations understand and quantify the social, environmental, and economic value they are creating  [9] . The SROI framework helps illustrate the relationship between inputs (resources), outputs (results of the change process), outcomes (effects that occur immediately), and impacts (long-term effects of the change process per year)  [10] . It has been demonstrated that the SROI framework can be used across healthcare settings, both prospectively and retrospectively  [11, 12] . We describe the implementation of a digital technologybased community child health platform and evaluate its holistic impact in an urban slum setting, using the SROI framework."

The project was conducted as a collaboration between three organisations: Apnalaya, a non-profit organisation working in the slums of M East Ward (implementation partner); Chetana's Institutes of Management and Research, Mumbai (academic research and evaluation partner); and Feebris Ltd., London (technology partner). A hub-and-spoke delivery model was at the core of the programme, where the anchor establishment (hub) was a community paediatrician to whom patients needing escalation of care were referred by CHWs (spokes), who were the first line of contact for the sick children."

The check-up could be conducted entirely offline, allowing CHWs to reach households with no/poor internet connectivity. Data were uploaded to a web portal and made available for clinical review once the CHWs reached an area with sufficient connectivity.

Digital health check-up structure\n\n\u2022 Patient registration: The CHWs collected basic data on demographic characteristics and medical history to set-up each child's health record.\n\n\u2022 Symptom questionnaire: The CHWs asked a series of health-related questions, such as general danger signs, respiratory complaints, diarrhoea, and vomiting, to the accompanying adult, based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines  [13] .\n\n\u2022 Vital parameter measurements: The CHWs took a series of measurements with medical sensors, including temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and auscultation of the chest using a digital stethoscope.\n\n\u2022 Triage decision: An automatic evaluation of all symptoms against the IMCI guidelines was conducted to triage risk level (via colour-coded visualisation) and provide the CHW with a simple recommendation: a) no action; b) follow-up visit the next day; or c) referral to community doctor.\n\nDiagnosis, referral, and treatment\n\n\u2022 Clinician review: All check-ups conducted in the community could be reviewed by the community paediatrician via a digital portal that acted as an electronic medical record, capturing all health information over time. The community paediatrician was able to assess the individual vital signs as well as listen to the auscultated lung sounds of the patient via the portal. Where further tests were necessary, he could refer children to a laboratory (for blood tests/X-rays) and the CHW accompanied the parent and child to ensure continuity of care. Depending on severity, the community paediatrician either diagnosed and treated children locally or referred them further to a tertiary-level government hospital.\n\n\u2022 Provision of treatment: Where appropriate, the community paediatrician prescribed treatment and arranged a follow-up visit. \u2022 Hospital referral: Severe cases that could not be managed within the community were referred to a tertiary-level government hospital.\n\n\u2022 Evaluation of impact: the impact evaluation activities were divided into four main stages:\n\n1. Baseline evaluation: At the beginning of the project, a survey was conducted with 3179 households to capture data on the existing health profile of the community.\n\n2.

      "text": "Evidence on the use and impact of digital technology-supported health interventions in lowand middle-income country (LMIC) settings is sparse, especially in urban slums like M East Ward. This paper offers an evidence-based approach to evaluate the impact of a digital health intervention designed to improve access to healthcare for children, factoring in the fragmented nature of healthcare provision in this setting. The key objectives of the programme were to increase early access to healthcare in the community and reduce the dependence on hospitals as provider of last resort.\n\nAs seen from the baseline survey, accessing healthcare can be challenging for people residing in the community, often involving multiple visits with CHWs, private doctors, and trips to the hospital. Each episode of illness is therefore often related to significant out-of-pocket expenditure for the family, costing a major part of the household income. By embedding a digital health platform into the workflow of CHWs and a community paediatrician, this project provided insights into the potential of augmenting an existing workforce to improve access to healthcare. The changes in the patient journey, evidenced through a baseline and follow-up comparison demonstrated that, a significant number of illness episodes could be resolved within the community and consultations with private doctors could be reduced, resulting in monetary savings. The community-based intervention was also recorded to reduce hospitalisations; this is likely to be due to early diagnosis and intervention, reducing exacerbations. In addition to these health-economic benefits, the intervention was seen to reassure parents who reported trust in the programme and reduced concern for their child's health during an illness episode.\n\nThere are several methods typically used to calculate social value, including cost-effective analysis (CEA), cost-utility analysis (a sub-type of CEA), and cost-benefit analysis, but these have been found to suffer from imprecision/inaccuracy when it comes to complex settings and interventions  [16] . In this study, the SROI framework proved to be suitable for identifying and\n\nTable 4. Inputs reported for the full 10 months of the programme. Value (INR) Six CHWs 900,000 Community doctor 428,571 Healthcare costs (lab tests, transport for referrals, medical support for poor patients) 453,000 Programme administration costs (programme manager, local research organiser, administrator) 683,700 Technology costs (including CHW training and equipment maintenance) * 167,000 Total inputs and investments 2,632,271 CHW = community health worker.

Moreover, the essence of the SROI method is its emphasis on developing a theory of change to understand the direction of the inputs and the outcomes of any project. The SROI analysis showed that the total investment for the project yielded a 13-fold (ratio 13:1) social return for each INR invested, with an annual cost per child of INR 625. A systematic review of studies using SROI methodology to assess the value of public health interventions found ratios ranging from 1.5:1 to 65:1  [10] . We aimed for a conservative approach, neither overestimating the potential social return nor underestimating the required expenses to achieve it. When computing total benefits, we excluded benefits to human resources, as these were difficult to quantify over the duration of the programme. However, the CHWs provided feedback on a continuous basis which was used to inform changes to the technology and service delivery and improve parents' experience of the same.\n\nTable 5.

Studies have shown that CHWs have the potential to boost healthcare access and support delivery of primary health services in LMIC settings  [18, 19] . A trial of a CHW-led digital health intervention for cardiovascular disease in India reported local variation in effectiveness, mediated by community trust, acceptability of CHWs' new roles, and their connection to community members and qualified healthcare providers  [20] . Equipped with clinical decision-support tools like the one used in this study, CHWs can be upskilled to triage risk level and refer at-risk cases within the community, improving efficiency and strengthening the health system.\n\nThis study had several limitations. Some community members did not benefit from the services offered by the programme for reasons including migration, cultural biases, and preference for traditional health practices. Due to time and funding limitations, we were unable to assess the impact of seasonality or disease trends related to the disruption in service delivery during the COVID-19 lockdown. A control group was used to inform any deadweight and attribution effects for the SROI analysis, rather than acting as a direct comparator. The continuation of services and the employment of healthcare staff following project completion would depend on the availability of NGO funds or the adoption of this intervention by the government health system. Finally, the technology costs did not include a software licence, as the software was provided free of charge. Nevertheless, this evaluation can be used by funders to decide what software costs are reasonable to achieve a high ROI."

      "text": "In this study investigating the benefits of an AI-guided digital health intervention for vulnerable children living in urban slums, we found that the programme dramatically improved the CHWs' ability to detect health issues in the community and facilitate appropriate referral. This study provides an initial blueprint for evaluating the holistic impact of digital health technologies using evidence-based tools like SROI. The findings have applicability across income settings, offering clear rationale in favour of strengthening community-first detection and management of disease to improve health outcomes and alleviate pressure on hospital infrastructure. To realise the goal of universal health coverage, it is essential that healthcare and technology communicate seamlessly."
