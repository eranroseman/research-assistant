  "title": "Effectiveness of an SMS-based maternal mHealth intervention to improve clinical outcomes of HIV-positive pregnant women",
  "abstract": "We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the effectiveness of an mHealth messaging intervention aiming to improve maternal health and HIV outcomes. Maternal health SMSs were sent to 235 HIV-infected pregnant women twice per week in pregnancy and continued until the infant's first birthday. The messages were timed to the stage of the pregnancy/infant age and covered maternal health and HIV-support information. Outcomes, measured as antenatal care (ANC) visits, birth outcomes and infant HIV testing, were compared to a control group of 586 HIV-infected pregnant women who received no SMS intervention. Results showed that intervention participants attended more ANC visits (5.16 vs. 3.95, p < 0.01) and were more likely to attend at least the recommended four ANC visits (relative risk (RR): 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.72). Birth outcomes of intervention participants improved as they had an increased chance of a normal vaginal delivery (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.19) and a lower risk of delivering a low-birth weight infant (<2500 g) (RR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-1.07). In the intervention group, there was a trend towards higher attendance to infant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing within six weeks after birth (81.3% vs. 75.4%, p = 0.06) and a lower mean infant age in weeks at HIV PCR testing (9.5 weeks vs. 11.1 weeks, p = 0.14). These results add to the growing evidence that mHealth interventions can have a positive impact on health outcomes and should be scaled nationally following comprehensive evaluation.",

      "text": "HIV continues to be a significant burden on health systems throughout sub-Saharan Africa  (Kaplan et al., 2015) . In South Africa, which has the largest burden of HIV, the National Department of Health (DoH) has made strides towards achieving universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) access for HIV-positive patients, including pregnant women. The national Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV programme has been effective in reducing, but not eliminating, vertical transmission of HIV. Vertical HIV transmission from mother to child has decreased from 9.6% in 2008 to 1.6% in 2014  (Statistics South Africa, 2015)  due mostly to the increased availability of ART. However, in 2013, HIV-related illness was responsible for approximately 42% of South African maternal deaths  (Pattinson, n.d.) . Despite a successful PMTCT programme, a 2009 UNICEF report highlighted barriers to maternal engagement with health services which included healthcare infrastructure, shortage of staff, poor-quality counselling, and lack of communication  (Frizelle & Solomon, 2009)  resulting in many pregnant women in South Africa, regardless of their HIV serostatus, presenting late and/ or dropping out of maternal care  (Solarin & Black, 2013) . Retention of pregnant women in maternal health services is important for identification of high-risk obstetric cases, identifying HIV-infected women, initiating ART and monitoring ART effectiveness  (Clouse et al., 2013) . There is a need for innovative and patient-centred solutions that increase patient retention-in-care, and facilitate patient empowerment.\n\nGlobally, health systems are expected to provide highquality services to diverse populations. Services that are cost-effective, reliable and sustainable are in high demand. Promotion of health information using mobile phones (mHealth) is one proposed solution but requires further rigorous evaluation  (Dean, Makin, Kydd, Biriotti, & Forsyth, 2012; World Health Organisation [WHO], 2011) . Currently, data on the effects of mHealth on HIV-related patient outcomes are encouraging, but limited  (Dean et al., 2012; Lester et al., 2010; Pop-Eleches et al., 2011; Schwartz et al., 2015) . Furthermore, Africa lags behind other WHO regions in the implementation of mHealth programmes, and most mHealth projects have been small-scale pilots  (WHO, 2011) . Previous projects have studied the use of mHealth to improve maternal health outcomes and HIV support/PMTCT  (Chib et al., 2008; Jordan, Ray, Pamela, & Douglas Evans, 2011; Kimani, 2010; Ngabo et al., 2012; Tamrat, Tigest, & Stan, 2011) . However, many questions around effectiveness remain.\n\nThe Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) South Africa short message system (SMS) programme offered free, twice-weekly, informative and supportive SMSs to pregnant women in Johannesburg, South Africa from 2012 to 2015  (den Hartigh, 2013) . The messages were timed to the week of each woman's pregnancy, and continued for one year postpartum. MAMA provided a service that was arguably the first time that pregnant women and new mothers in South Africa could consistently receive accurate information by SMS adapted to their needs. The aim of MAMA South Africa was to enable women to improve self-monitoring of their own and their infant's health, and to provide them with knowledge of their rights within the healthcare system.\n\nThe current study assessed whether the MAMA maternal mHealth intervention was an effective strategy for improving retention-in-antenatal care (ANC), increasing postnatal infant HIV testing and improving birth outcomes for HIV-positive women, and their infants, attending public health facilities in a poor area of Johannesburg, South Africa."

      "title": "Methods",
      "text": "This was a non-blinded, non-randomised retrospective intervention study which included participants receiving free ANC and postnatal care (PNC) services at one of four public health facilities in Hillbrow, a district of Johannesburg, South Africa. Hillbrow faces many challenges as \"[u]nemployment, alcohol abuse, sex work, poverty, and gender violence are common, with a significant proportion of the community not from South Africa\"  (Faal et al., 2011, p. e55) .\n\nAll participants were HIV-positive women who attended their first ANC visit between 1 April 2013 and 18 August 2014. Intervention participants were recruited to the study during their first or second ANC visit. Maternal and infant care was provided by local government ANC staff and included HIV care and management support with ART, provision of vitamin and mineral supplements, recommendations to attend at least four ANC visits before delivery and to an on-site polymerase chain reaction (PCR) HIV test for their infant at their first scheduled vaccination visit, at six weeks postpartum. Time of HIV diagnosis was not included as a study variable.\n\nThe primary outcome was uptake of HIV PCR testing within six weeks postpartum. Secondary outcomes included the total number of ANC visits attended; the likelihood of attending, at least, four ANC visits; the proportion of normal vaginal deliveries; and proportion of newborns with low birth weight.\n\nEligible participants had to be over the age of 18 years, be HIV-positive during pregnancy, had access to a cell phone and delivered in one of the facilities described above.\n\nThe intervention consisted of MAMA SMSs (see description below), offered for free to ANC patients that provided one-way, twice-weekly, maternal health information sent throughout pregnancy and for one year after birth. The message content was created by BabyCentre UK and customised by MAMA South Africa with support from local maternal health specialists. Messages were offered in two message sets; one set included general maternal health messages (e.g. healthy eating, reminders of ANC/PNC appointments, psychosocial support, delivery planning), while the other set contained the same general health messages plus HIV/ PMTCT-related messaging (including PCR testing reminders and importance of adherence to ART, see Table  1  for selected examples). The option of two message sets was offered to allow HIV-positive women access to message content explicit on HIV without having to disclose their HIV status. Interested women signed up to the SMS intervention between their 6th and 39th week of pregnancy, thereby receiving between 2 and 38 messages prior to their delivery. An additional 104 messages were sent post-delivery with 12 messages sent between birth and the infant's scheduled six-week PCR test. One of the pre-PCR test messages included a recommendation for the infant to be brought in for an HIV test at six weeks of age. The control group received the clinical standard of care and were not offered maternal health SMSs.\n\nStudy data were collected from five sources. Three were electronic and two paper-based. The three electronic databases included: (1) an SMS recruitment database containing basic demographic data; (2) a maternal register database from the delivery sites, containing maternal health data on women who had attended ANC and/or delivered there, and (3) an SMS research database, consisting of extensive interview data from selected mothers (intervention and control) 12 months postpartum. Paper-based records included: (1) ANC visit record cards and (2) a PCR registration book from the delivery site(s) containing infant PCR testing dates and results; only the first PCR testing date was used in this study. Both the SMS research database and ANC card databases were created and maintained by the study team using REDCap electronic research database  (Harris et al., 2009) . All paper records were digitised prior to merging. Cases from all databases were matched and merged into one database before analysis, resulting in identification of 1533 unique individuals. Due to the use of multiple data sets, not all participants had data available all outcomes investigated. Of 1533 possible participants, 821 individuals were eligible for inclusion: 235 in the intervention and 586 in the control groups. For the main outcome, 192 (81.7%) intervention and 447 (76.3%) control participants had valid data.\n\nChi-squared tests were conducted on binary variables, Student's t-tests were used for continuous variables, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to adjust for pre-existing differences when population differences were found, and multivariate relative risk (RR) was calculated to identify the probability of the outcome occurring between the two groups. All data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS (IBM Corp., 2013) and statistical significance at p < 0.05 was considered.\n\nThe study was conducted under certificate number M140984 from the Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg."

      "text": "Socio-demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups were similar (Table  2 ). A slight difference in mean parity of the study groups was noted, with higher average parity in the control group, 1.58 vs. 1.16 (p = 0.001). Intervention participants attended their first ANC visits earlier than control participants (at 22.05 weeks vs. 28.41 weeks, respectively, p < 0.001). A majority of participants (71.2%, data available for 313 participants) attended their first ANC visit after 20 weeks of pregnancy, despite South Africa DoH guidelines recommending first ANC visits occur before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Most intervention users (158/235, 67.5%) opted to receive the PMTCT SMS message content.\n\nIntervention participants had an average of 5.16 antenatal visits prior to delivery, compared with 3.95 visits for control participants (Table  3 ; information available for 73 and 94 participants, respectively), which was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Using ANCOVA to adjust for the difference in the timing of first ANC visit resulted in an adjusted average of 4.8 vs. 4.3 ANC visits for the intervention group and control group, respectively (p = 0.019). Among intervention participants, there was a lower RR of dropping out of ANC after attending only one visit, compared to the control group (RR: 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04-0.78). There was a 40% increase in the likelihood of attending the recommended four ANC visits among individuals within the intervention group (RR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.15-1.72, Table  3 ). Intervention group birth outcomes showed a slightly higher likelihood of having a normal vaginal delivery (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.19) and a lower RR for Caesarean section (RR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.15-0.28) compared to the control group. Overall mean birth weight was similar in both study groups, with newborns in the intervention group weighing an average of 3.1 kg (\u03c3: 0.323) compared to 3.0 kg (\u03c3: 0.472) for control group newborns. However, the RR of delivering a low-birth weight baby (<2500 g) was lowered in the intervention group (RR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-1.07).\n\nIntervention participants were more likely to attend their first PCR test at six weeks after birth (81.3% vs. 75.4%, p = 0.064) and attend their first PCR test earlier (\u03bb: 9.5 weeks vs. 11.1 weeks, p = 0.138), neither of which was statistically different (Table  3 ). Both groups had a standard deviation of over 10 weeks for PCR testing (\u03c3: 10.605 and \u03c3: 13.634, respectively), as a handful of tests occurred after six months. Of the 639 PCR tests, three infants were found to be HIV-positive (0.5%), all of which were in the control group (p = 0.255). Missing PCR data are likely due to patients receiving PCR at other facilities, rather than non-attendance."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The results of this study show that a maternal health text messaging intervention increased the average number of ANC visits, improved the likelihood of attending, at least, four ANC visits, and increased vaginal birth rates (Table  3 ).\n\nThe attendance to more ANC visits and the increased attendance at the six-week PCR testing among intervention participants could be explained by the support provided by the message intervention. These results are in line with previous research showing that mobile phone-based maternal health interventions tend to increase patient engagement with maternal health and PMTCT care. In Tanzania,  Lund et al. (2014)  showed how the Wired Mothers SMS programme more than doubled the likelihood of attendance to four ANC visits, compared to the standard of care. A pilot study in South Africa by  Schwartz et al. (2015)  reported that a combined SMS and voice call service increased infant HIV PCR testing at 10 weeks from 63.3% to 90% compared with testing before the intervention. The improvement in on-time PCR testing rates in the current study was smaller than Schwartz found, potentially due to the different PCR testing dates used in their study.\n\nThe intervention group was found to have improved infant birth outcome measures by way of fewer lowbirth weight infants in addition to fewer Caesarean sections. Caesarean sections are only conducted for obstetric complications at public health facilities in South Africa, even for HIV-positive women. The lower rate of Caesarean sections seen in intervention participants is likely an indicator of healthier pregnancies (Betran, Torloni, Zhang, G\u00fclmezoglu, & the WHO Working Group on Caesarean Section, 2015). The MAMA SMSs included recommendations around healthy eating, self-monitoring and preparation for delivery. This could have led to the reduced Caesarean section rate seen when compared to the control group that had lower ANC attendance and less information during pregnancy. This lower engagement with the healthcare system may have led to increased obstetric complications (haemorrhage, smallfor-age babies and infections) which were potentially not picked up in time to be monitored and treated before a Caesarean section was required. This higher risk of needing a Caesarean section potentially exposed the control group to additional risks (surgical haemorrhage, surgical infections, etc.) which could have been avoided in a proportion of this group.\n\nPrevious research on the impact of mHealth on birth outcomes is limited, with most published work around birth focusing on increasing deliveries at health facilities with skilled birth attendants  (Chib, van Velthoven, & Car, 2015; Tamrat et al., 2011) , and not on the method of delivery or birth weight.\n\nAs HIV research progresses, guidelines around maternal health and HIV care and treatment are updated. New guideline implementation is usually a complex process. Since the start of the South African PMTCT programme, the guidelines have changed six times  (Barron et al., 2013; Nkomo et al., 2015) . Each change requires re-training of facility-based healthcare workers, often resulting in delay and confusion among both healthcare workers and patients. In contrast, an mHealth intervention using SMS messages can be rapidly updated to reflect the most recent PMTCTrelated guidelines. This would ensure that the patient was empowered to request the latest standard of care at the facility. A large-scale or national SMS-based communication system such as MAMA South Africa would allow for immediate and dynamic customisation of message content as international protocols and national guidelines change.\n\nThis work adds to the growing body of knowledge, suggesting that providing maternal health information and reminders to pregnant women and new mothers can result in beneficial individual and health system outcomes. These results also support the introduction of large-scale mHealth interventions across countries with strained, resource-limited health systems. mHealth interventions can provide immediate and personalised health information to pregnant women and new mothers, empowering them at a time when they are likely to make changes for the sake of their children and have been shown to have a positive health impact (Aranda-Jan, Neo, & Svetla, 2014;  Betjeman, Soghoian, & Foran, 2013; Bloomfield et al., 2014; Deshmukh & Mechael, 2013; Gurman, Rubin, & Roess, 2012; Lund et al., 2014; Watterson, Julia, & Isheeta, 2015) . At the same time, mHealth interventions should be customised for the local situation, not add additional workload to already strained health systems, and as much as possible, be integrated into the existing health system at a large scale  (Labrique, Vasudevan, Chang, & Mehl, 2013) . A national maternal mHealth programme could be used as a template for departments of health to expand mHealth support programmes to include chronic disease (e.g. HIV, TB)  (Catalani, Philbrick, Fraser, Mechael, & Israelski, 2013; Faal et al., 2011; Lester et al., 2010; Nglazi, Bekker, Wood, Hussey, & Wiysonge, 2013; Pop-Eleches et al., 2011) , sexually transmitted infections  (Lunny et al., 2014)  and for key populations (e.g. sex workers, men who have sex with men, adolescents, etc.)  (Catalani et al., 2013) . In mid-2014, the South African DoH launched MomConnect, a national maternal health SMS programme based on MAMA South Africa and with knowledge of the preliminary results of this study. If successful, MomConnect could be expanded as part of a national mHealth system to provide mHealth messaging on multiple health topics.\n\nLimitations of this study include participants not being randomly assigned to study arms and that the control group was recruited using retrospective data only after the intervention was complete. Nonetheless, control participants were matched to the intervention group by the delivery facility and month of delivery to minimise bias linked to the health system/guideline changes. Percentage of individuals who did not agree to enrol to the intervention, which could have biased the results, was not collected for the entire study period. However, data collected during the second half of the study indicate that 90% of women accepted the intervention. The study team has no reason to believe that acceptability would be different during other time periods. The target sample size of 504 individuals per group was not reached which may be the reason for the lack of statistically significant differences in attendance to infant PCR testing by six weeks. Even with the smaller sample size, several statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in key areas of interest were found. Differences between groups were controlled for using ANCOVA. Some of the control participants had missing data. However, the study team has no reason to believe that the missing data would be systematically different. To the extent that missing data may represent dropout from services, the missing observations have diluted study findings. Much of the data within this study use real-world, and thus, imperfect, data sets. While a more controlled study could get around this issue, this research allowed analysis of a real-world intervention  (Robson & McCartan, 2015)  without the constraints and limitations of prospective randomised controlled studies. Conducted in an implementation research vein  (Peters, Adam, Alonge, Agyepong, & Tran, 2014) , this study provides important data showing the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention targeting HIV-positive pregnant women and their newborns, as it works to bridge the so-called know-do gap  (Bennett & Jessani, 2011) ."
