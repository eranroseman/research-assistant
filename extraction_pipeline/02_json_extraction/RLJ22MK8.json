      "title": "Part 3: the behavioural outcomes",
      "text": "These outcomes are the behaviours that are supported when using the gamified system and are specific for the system (e.g. measured health benefits in a health monitoring app). To positively change behavioural outcomes, health apps can use behaviour change techniques (e.g. feedback and monitoring, reward and threat, goals and planning) and individual techniques (e.g. self-monitoring of behaviour, non-specific reward, social support, non-specific incentive, and focus on past success).  6 When the behaviours are related to health, the outcomes will affect the users' health e.g. medication over/misuse and pain management.\n\nGamification has been shown to produce varied effects in previous studies related to health and well-being.  11, 17 Positive behavioural outcomes displayed in previous studies include increased physical and mental health.  17 A review study showed that applying gamification impacts engagement and health behaviours with an increased effect sizes from medium to large.  18 For example, physical activities was increased up to 15% using a gamified app called HealthyTogether.  19 However, many studies show inconclusive evidence, suggesting that gamification needs to be designed and applied skilfully to lead to desired effects.  17 Positive effect of applying gamification is also influenced by the context including the application area (e.g., learning, health, commerce, and the users).  11 urthermore, in general consumers have a positive attitudes towards wearables and gamified health applications.  20 o apply gamification skilfully in digital health interventions, the following five gamification principles can be used in development and testing (Central illustration)  21  :\n\nCentral illustration Gamification principles and elements for digital health interventions (1) Meaningful purpose: goals that are aligned with user's motivations and interests. (2) Meaningful choice: users have agency over how they achieve their goals. (3) Supporting player archetypes: individual user and player characteristics are used for the mechanics in the app. (4) Feedback: how user's actions affect progress is clearly communicated for the user. (5) Visibility: the amount of progress made and how much more is needed is displayed to the users.\n\nFurthermore, specific game elements (e.g. points, badges, rewards) can be used to impact health behaviour.  16 There are five gamification principles for health used to separate game elements based on their purpose (e.g., motivating the purpose, increasing user choice).  21 Gamification principles are used to design the game elements and relate them to the underlying motivation of the user.  21 The gamification principles feedback and visibility include six common game elements that can impact health behaviour: leaderboards, levels, digital rewards (points, badges, rewards), real-world prizes, competitions, and social or peer pressure (Central illustration).  16"

      "text": "A systematic review investigating gamification elements in 1680 toprated available mobile applications to change health behaviour showed that only a few of these apps used game elements.  6 amified mobile applications for patients with cardiovascular disease can be effective and acceptable for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and self-management.  5 A 12-month randomized controlled trial including heart failure patients investigating effects of a gamified app-based behavioural change intervention showed that medication adherence can be increased and longer-term improvements can be produced in some clinical outcomes.  4 Gamified applications can also increase physical activity motivation and improve knowledge about heart failure.  5 We found three games tailored for patients with cardiovascular disease:\n\n(1) 'Heart Game' 7 is designed to be used after discharge and when the patient start rehabilitation. The game aimed to motivate users in to take an active part in their rehabilitation and is designed to enable patients to play with someone close to them such as a partner. This game used all the game elements, except real-world prizes. Although the game showed potential to motivate patients in their rehabilitation, a challenge was in avoiding a sense of defeat while still adjusting the level of difficulty to the individual patient. (2) 'Heart Health'  22  is based on casino slot game developed to improve self-management behaviours and knowledge for community-dwelling older adults with heart failure. The game provides heart failure self-management education regarding introduction to heart failure, medication, diet, physical activities, and daily symptom checks. The patients can earn betting chips when their response is correct to increase their motivation and engagement with the content. The game also encourages the patient's behaviour regarding medication, diet, physical activities, and daily symptom checks using daily reminder tips and questions. The game evaluation showed that the knowledge was improved significantly, and the self-reported behaviour was improved but not significantly. (3) 'MyHeartMate' 23 is a mobile game focuses on promoting physical activity and encourages the patients to take their medications as prescribed and engage with their doctors, eat a healthy diet, manage their weight and lipid levels, manage stress, and quit smoking if applicable. The game includes leadership boards, levels, and digital rewards. Although the game includes a leaderboard, it does not include the possibility to competition or social and peer pressure. After receiving feedback from patients during the development of the game, the game was made open available for family and friends. The rewards in the game are digital so no real-world prizes are included in the game. Patients are currently recruited in a trial aiming to include 394 patients with cardiovascular disease (trial registration number: ACTRN12617000869370).\n\nThere are other games developed for specific self-care behaviours. A meta-analysis  24  showed that gamification was effective to increase self-efficacy, readiness, knowledge, and process of advance care planning behaviours. Gamification has also shown the potential to improve medication adherence,  4, 25  patient engagement with their exercise training  26  and cardiac rehabilitation, and enhance motivation and adherence to cardiac rehabilitation.  27, 28"

      "title": "Measuring gamification",
      "text": "Besides evaluating the frequency of using gamified systems and behavioural outcomes, it is common to assess gamification in terms of the self-reported psychological outcomes of flow, presence, engagement, gaming satisfaction, participants' experience, and gameful experience (Table  1 ).\n\nFlow, presence, and engagement are three common phenomena measured in games. Flow is a state of being fully focused and engaged in an activity.  43, 44 Flow occurs when the task's demands and the performer's abilities are balanced since the task is optimally challenging and the individual performs at the height of their skills. Finding the activity intrinsically motivating, the autotelic experience, is a condition for reaching the flow state.  11 In gamification, having clear goals and feedback are important to create the autotelic experience. Presences is about having a consciousness state and an experience of being inside the game and to become engaged when playing games is an important determinant of the playing experience.  31, 32 low, presence, and engagement can be measured using the following scientifically validated instruments:\n\n(1) Dispositional Flow Scale  29, 30  assesses the tendency of experiencing flow and is widely applied in studying flow in various physical activities, education, arts, digital gaming, and gamification. This scale is a valid and reliable measure relevant for assessing outcomes related to flow.  20 The Dispositional Flow Scale is based on the nine dimensions that give the optimal flow experience according to the conceptual flow model with nine components proposed by Csikszentmihalyi  43, 44  : challenge-skill balance, action-awareness merging, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, total concentration, sense of control,  The long version contains 36 items where each of the nine flow dimensions contains four items and the short version contains nine items (one item per dimension).  26 Each item in the scale is assessed with four items on a Likert scale (ranged from 1 = never to 5 = always). (2) The Temple Presence Inventory  31, 32  evaluates eight dimensions of presence and engagement focusing on the involvement on the virtual environment by evaluating the level of immersion, involvement, sensory experience, realism, and the link to the plot. The inventory contains 42 items in eight factors: spatial presence (seven items), social presence-actor (seven items), passive social presence (four items), active social presence (three items), presence as engagement (six items), presence as social richness (seven items), presence as social realism (three items), and presence as perceptual realism (five items).  29 The inventory is a multidimensional measure of presence and tests have established its reliability, validity, and sensitivity.  22 3) The Game Engagement Questionnaire  33  measures engagement in playing video games to assess the potential impact of the games, particularly violent games.  45 The questionnaire contains 19 items related to measure psychological absorption (five items), flow (nine items), presence (four items), immersion (one item). The game engagement questionnaire is developed using classical and Rasch analyses that support its validity and reliability with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85.  33, 45 tisfaction and motivation in gaming are closely related. Gaming satisfaction can be assessed with two scaled:\n\n(i) Player Experience of Need Satisfaction 14 is based on the motivation theory, self-determination theory  13  and measures its three universal needs: in-game competence (three items assess if the experience is challenging but not overwhelmingly difficult and the enhanced efficacy of the challenge), in-game autonomy (three items assess the participant's feeling of freedom and perceived opportunities to do interesting activities) and relatedness (three items assess the feeling of relatedness to others). It also measures presence (nine items assess the sense of the players' emotional, physical, and narrative immersion in the game) and intuitive controls (three items assesses the user's experience of in-game controls). Respondents assess each item using a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = do not agree to 7 = strongly agree). This measurement is developed using a rational theoretical approach, and the validation of it shows that its purported structure is partially supported.  46 ii) Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale  34, 35  measures video game satisfaction with nine subscales and 55 items: usability/ playability (11 items), narratives (seven items), play engrossment"

The scale score is calculated by first calculating the average of the items in each subscale and then summing the subscale averages. The scale can be used to assess various gaming experience for a variety of game genres with players (e.g., newbie/novice, hardcore/expert). The scale is developed and validated based on assessments of over 450 unique video games and has internal consistency and convergent, content, and discriminant validity.  31 There is a shorter version of the scale consists of 18 items (two items for each subscale) and can provide a brief, practical, yet comprehensive measure of the user's satisfaction.  32 The Cronbach's alpha for the scale with 55 items is 0.785, and for the short scale with 18 items is 0.772 so both versions are reliable.  32 The items in both long and short scales are rated with a 7-point Likert scale (ranged from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). The short version can be used to assess game perceptions over time or for comparisons among different games. It takes a few minutes to complete the short version.\n\nParticipants' experience from using gamified programmes, systems, and applications can be measured with three scales:\n\n(i) User Experience Questionnaire 36 enables a easy to apply and immediate measurement of user experience of end users. The questionnaire is developed empirically and is a reliable and valid measure for user experience.  36 It can take 3-5 min for a participant to read the instruction and to complete the questionnaire. The questionnaire contains six scales with 26 items:\n\n\u2022 Attractiveness assesses the user's overall impression of the sys- tem, programme, or application and consists of six items: annoying/enjoyable, good/bad, unlikeable/pleasing, unpleasant/pleasant, attractive/unattractive, friendly/unfriendly.\n\n\u2022 Perspicuity assesses how easy it is to get familiar with the system, programme, or application and consists of four items: not understandable/understandable, easy to learn/difficult to learn, complicated/easy, clear/confusing.\n\n\u2022 Efficiency assesses the effort required from the users to solve their tasks and consists of four items: fast/slow, inefficient/efficient, impractical/practical, organized/cluttered.\n\n\u2022 Dependability assesses the user's control of the interaction and consists of four items: unpredictable/predictable, obstructive/ supportive, secure/not secure, meets expectations/does not meet expectations.\n\n\u2022 Stimulation assesses the user's motivation and excitement to use the system, programme, or application and consists of four items: valuable/inferior, boring/exiting, not interesting/interesting, motivating/demotivating.\n\n\u2022 Novelty assesses innovation of the system, programme, or appli- cation and consists of four items: creative/dull, inventive/conventional, usual/leading edge, conservative/innovative.\n\n(ii) System Usability Scale  [37] [38] [39]  is a post-test questionnaire that assesses perceived usability of a system and is the most widely used questionnaire to measure subjective usability and perceived ease of use. This scale can be used to assess system that with and without gamification. Usability is a quality that asses how easy the system is used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness (can the system support users to achieve their objectives?), efficiency (how quick can the user perform their tasks?), and satisfaction (how pleasant is the system to use?) in a specified context of use.  47 The system usability scale is developed empirically. The scale is a widely used, valid, and reliable measuring tool consists of two factors and 10 items: usability (eight items) and learnability (two items).  [37] [38] ] [39]  The respondents scores one of 5-point Likert scale numbered from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The respondent's scores are then ranged from 0 to 4 and calculated in three steps:\n\n\u2022 For each odd-numbered item (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) which is a positively worded item subtract 1 from their value.\n\n\u2022 For each even-numbered item  (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10)  which is a nega- tively worded item subtract 5 from their value.\n\n\u2022 Sum the respondent's scores from all items to get a total score on a scale of 0-40.\n\n\u2022 Multiply the sum of the scores by 2.5 to convert to a single score on a scale of 0-100.\n\nThe average system usability scale score is 68 and a score .68 would be considered above average and ,68 is below average which give insight into the overall usability of the system.\n\n(iii) Player Experience Inventory 40 measures player experience and investigates how game design choices are linked to emotional responses on two levels: functional consequences e.g. the user's immediate experiences when using the game and psychosocial consequences i.e. the user's emotional experiences. The inventory shows how game design choices impact player actions and shape emotional responses. The inventory contains of 10 constructs (five for functional consequences and five for psychological consequences) and each construct is measured by three items (30 items in total):\n\n\u2022 Five constructs assessing the functional consequences (15 items): ease of control, goals and rules, challenge, progress feedback, and audiovisual appeal\n\n\u2022 Five constructs assessing the psychological consequences (15 items): meaning, curiosity, mastery, immersion, and autonomy.\n\nThe items in the inventory are measured via a 7-point Likert, from -3 to +3 scale over 0, accompanied by the labels (strongly disagree to strongly agree). The inventory was developed in seven studies focused on scale conception, scale construction, and scale validation including testing and expert evaluation resulting in a reliable and rigorously validated scale.  40 ameful experience emerges from the interaction with the system's game aspects that effects the users' experience. Gameful experience can be measured with two scales (i) Gameful Experience Scale 41 measures gameful experiences in gamification based on six factors: enjoyment, absorption, creative thinking, activation, absence of negative affect, and dominance. The scale is a literature-based, validated with a sample of 129, and reliable measure to evaluate the experience in various gamified systems.  41 he 5-point Likert scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly disagree) contains 27 items and divided into six dimensions of gameful experience: dominance (four items assess users' feeling of control while playing), creative thinking (four items assess the users' sense of exploration), enjoyment (six items assess the users' positive emotions), activation (four items assess the user's stimulation), absorption (six items assess the user's cognitive engagement and feeling of disconnection from the real-world), and absence of negative affect (three items assess the users' involvement).\n\n(ii) Gameful Experience Questionnaire 42 is used to model and measure user's gameful experience in gamified systems. The instrument is developed using a mixed-methods approach and has been validated on two gamified services. Further studies are needed to establish the generalizability of the instrument.  42 The scale contains seven dimensions and 55 items in total: accomplishment (eight items asses the drive to progress and willingness to complete), challenge (eight items asses the user's ability), competition (seven items asses the feeling of competitiveness), guided (seven items asses the feeling of being guided by the system), immersion (nine items assess the person's experience of being absorbed in what he or she is doing), playfulness (nine items assess imagination and creativity), and social experience (eight items assess the user's experiences caused by presence of other people). The scale is reliable and the Cronbach's alpha was .0.7 for all seven dimensions."

Social connectivity can increase the use of the technology but the level of commitment effects the engagement.  5 The importance of not being alone in the behaviour change activity and the social support from other participants and family member need to be considered thoroughly.  7, 48 Patients in a telerehabilitation programme that dealt with rehabilitation as a team felt obligation to act when their peers are acting or ask them to act.  48 Cooperative challenges in The Heart Game were an effective motivator for the heart patients.  6 rivacy of the patient needs to be considered so the patient can decide which information to be shared with who.  45 It is also important to focus on investigating the patient's engagement in using technology over time since the engagement in using the gamified digital solution can be high at the beginning and decreases over time.  49 pplying challenges is common in gamified technologies and the heart patient's sense of defeat needs to be avoided while the level of difficulty is adjusted to the patient's need.  7 Furthermore, heart patients suffer of physical and mental instability immediately after heart surgery which must be considered and adapted for the patient's ability to avoid increased stress for the patient caused by the gamified technology.  7 Therefore, the applied gamification elements, such as physical challenges and competitions, need to be developed with great care for the cardiovascular patients. When developing gamified technology for cardiovascular patients nurses need to be involved in the development process when designing and evaluating the technology.  5 User input is also very important contribution in the design of the intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention and identify what works and why.  48"

We recommend considering applying gamification in digital healthcare interventions for patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular patients nurses and users need to be involved in the process of developing gamified solutions for the cardiovascular patients. When gamification is applied it is important that it is tailored to the context where gamification is implemented and its users. There are several scientifically validated tools to assess the impact of gamification that measure different phenomena relevant to gamification. These tools can also be used during the design and implementation of the gamified digital technology."
