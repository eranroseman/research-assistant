  "title": "A Mega-Study of Text-Message Nudges Encouraging Patients to Get Vaccinated at their Pharmacy",
  "abstract": "We partnered with Walmart to test 22 nudges designed to boost vaccination rates in their pharmacies. Nudges were delivered via text message to over 650,000 Walmart pharmacy patients in the fall of 2020 and encouraged patients to visit Walmart for a flu vaccine. We demonstrate that behaviorally informed messages increase pharmacy vaccination rates by an average of 6.7% over a roughly three-month follow-up period. The most effective messages in our field experiment matched the tone of typical pharmacy communications and reminded patients that a flu shot was waiting for them. These insights suggest that carefully crafted messages informed by the results of this study could nudge the adoption of other vaccines for other infectious diseases, including COVID-19.",

      "text": "Each year, millions of Americans fail to receive life-saving vaccines. In this paper, we examine whether simple, behaviorally-informed text messages can increase vaccination rates in pharmacies.\n\nWe conducted a field experiment in fall 2020 in partnership with Walmart, a large multinational retail corporation with over 4,700 pharmacy locations across the United States. The experiment tested the efficacy of different messaging strategies encouraging pharmacy patients to receive a flu vaccine. Walmart pharmacy patients were included in this study if they had (1) received a flu shot at a Walmart pharmacy during the prior (2019-2020) flu season, (2) consented to receive SMS communications from their pharmacy, and (3) not already received their 2020-2021 flu shot at a Walmart pharmacy.\n\nWe tested 22 different text messaging interventions designed by a total of 24 behavioral scientists who worked together in small teams to develop different communication strategies for boosting vaccination. Some messages were interactive (i.e., requesting replies), while others were simply informational. Some interventions included just one message, while others included follow-up texts sent up to three days later. The first messages in each intervention were sent by Walmart pharmacy on September 25, 2020, and all messages encouraged patients to get a flu shot. All intervention messages are described in detail in the Appendix of this paper.\n\nThe study design and analyses were pre-registered on AsPredicted (1: https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=g39h9p , 2:  https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=e2qh3d ). foot_0 Patients were randomly assigned to one of 22 experimental conditions or to a usual care control condition in which they did not receive any text-based reminders to get a flu vaccine. Our study included 689,693 patients who were randomly assigned to the study's 22 experimental conditions (Nmin = 27,365; Nmean = 29,986; Nmax = 34,623) or a usual care control condition (N = 27,523).  2, 3 is research was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Pennsylvania. The IRB granted a waiver of consent for this research. No identifying information about study participants was shared with the researchers."

      "text": "Our outcome of interest was whether patients in our study received flu shots at a Walmart pharmacy on or before December 31, 2020 (and after the launch of our study on September 25). Following our pre-registered analysis plan, we analyzed whether our interventions affected this outcome using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The predictors in our regression were 22 indicators for assignment to each of our study's experimental conditions (with an indicator omitted for assignment to the usual care control condition). Our pre-registered OLS regression included the following control variables: (1) patient age, (2) indicators for patient race/ethnicity, and (3) an indicator for patient gender.\n\nIn the usual care control condition, 29.4% of patients received a flu shot at a Walmart pharmacy during the time period of interest (between September 25 and December 31, 2020). As shown in Figure  1  and Table  1 , all interventions significantly increased vaccinations compared to the usual care control condition (two-sided unadjusted p-values < 0.05). Across the 22 experimental conditions, the mean treatment effect was a 2.0 percentage point increase in flu vaccinations relative to the control condition (a 6.7% lift, p < 0.01).\n\nIn Table  1  and Figure  1 , we report unadjusted robust standard errors, two-sided p-values, and confidence intervals. Using the Storey-Tibshirani method of computing the false discovery rate (Storey & Tibshirani, 2003), we estimate that results identified as significant at the 5% level have less than a 0.7% chance of being a true null.\n\nThe top-performing intervention (depicted in Figure  2 ) produced a 2.9 percentage point increase in flu vaccinations relative to the usual care control condition (a 9.9% lift; p < 0.01) and only involved two text messages.  4 The first text message noted \"It's flu season & you can get a flu shot at Walmart.\" The second message arrived 72 hours (3 days) later and reminded patients \"a flu shot is waiting for you at Walmart.\"\n\nWe conducted exploratory analyses to identify attributes of text messages that explained their efficacy. The most effective interventions (a) were unsurprising insofar as they were the sort of communication customers expect to receive from a pharmacy (\u03b2 = 0.54, p = 0.0003) and (b) were framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already waiting for them (\u03b2 = 0.52, p = 0.0005). 5 These patterns were consistent with those found in another recent field experiment examining what text messaging interventions most effectively nudged patients at two large health systems to receive flu vaccinations during primary care appointments in the fall of 2020 (Milkman et al.,  2021).\n\nThe interventions tested in this experiment could easily be adapted to nudge people to adopt other life-saving vaccines, including a COVID-19 vaccine."
