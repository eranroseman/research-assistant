  "title": "Cost effectiveness review of text messaging, smartphone application, and website interventions targeting T2DM or hypertension",
  "abstract": "Digital health interventions have been shown to be clinically-effective for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension prevention and treatment. This study synthesizes and compares the cost-effectiveness of text-messaging, smartphone application, and websites by searching CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, Medline and PsycInfo for full economic or cost-minimisation studies of digital health interventions in adults with or at risk of T2DM and/or hypertension. Costs and health effects are synthesised narratively. Study quality appraisal using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) list results in recommendations for future health economic evaluations of digital health interventions. Of 3056 records identified, 14 studies are included (7 studies applied text-messaging, 4 employed smartphone applications, and 5 used websites). Ten studies are cost-utility analyses: incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) vary from dominant to \u20ac75,233/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), with a median of \u20ac3840/QALY (interquartile range \u20ac16,179). One study finds no QALY difference. None of the three digital health intervention modes is associated with substantially better cost-effectiveness. Interventions are consistently cost-effective in populations with (pre)T2DM but not in populations with hypertension. Mean quality score is 63.0% (standard deviation 13.7%). Substandard application of time horizon, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis next to transparency concerns (regarding competing alternatives, perspective, and costing) downgrades quality of evidence. In conclusion, smartphone application, text-messaging, and website-based interventions are cost-effective without substantial differences between the different delivery modes. Future health economic studies should increase transparency, conduct sufficient sensitivity analyses, and appraise the ICUR more critically in light of a reasoned willingness-to-pay threshold.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "An estimated 537 million people, of which 44.7% undiagnosed, are nowadays living with diabetes mellitus worldwide. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), formerly known as non-insulindependent or adult-onset diabetes, accounts for 90% of the population with diabetes  1  . Additional estimates indicate 541 million people having impaired glucose tolerance and 319 million having impaired fasting glucose levels, otherwise defined as prediabetes  1  , and are as such at increased risk to progress to T2DM  2  .\n\nT2DM often occur together with hypertension  3  , another major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Regarding its prevalence, hypertension affects around 1.28 billion or onethird of all adults between 30 and 79 globally, with 46% of them being unaware of the condition ( https://www.who.int/  news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension ). Prevalence is slightly decreasing in high-income countries but it is still on the rise in low-and middle-income countries  4  . An additional quarter to half of the global adult population is presumed to have pre-hypertension, defined as high normal office systolic and diastolic BP  5  .\n\nBoth diabetes and hypertension impose a substantial burden on healthcare budgets with 11.5 and 10% of global health expenditures spent on diabetes  1  and high BP  4  , respectively. It is encouraging that preventive measures targeting modifiable lifestyle risk factors could result in substantial health and economic gains  1, 6  . Lifestyle interventions focusing on diet modifications and increased physical activity have been proven effective in reducing HbA1c-levels and BP values  7  , and despite some discrepant results and varying study quality, these lifestyle interventions were found to be cost-effective as well  [8] [9] [10]  . Lifestyle interventions are thus valid strategies but the cost-effectiveness of various programmes and their drivers still need to be better documented. Staff labour cost is such an important driver, accounting for the larger part of lifestyle intervention costs and could thus be a potential target for improving cost-effectiveness  11  , for instance with the use of digital health interventions.\n\nThere is increasing evidence of digital health interventions as a practical, low labour and low cost delivery mode  12  that can foster clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such lifestyle measures. The potential is great since 92% of the global population uses a mobile phone  13  . The clinical effectiveness of digital health in diabetes and hypertension management has been confirmed  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  but limited cost-effectiveness data have been referred to as one of the major barriers for widespread implementation  21  . Yet, Iribarren et al.  22  reported that 75% of full economic studies (i.e., a comparison of both costs and health consequences of two or more alternatives) in a broad range of conditions found cost-effective or cost-saving results for mobile health solutions. Specifically, for T2DM, previous systematic reviews focused mainly on partial economic evaluations (i.e., single programme description of both costs and health consequences, or cost description/analysis of one or more alternatives)  23, 24  . Nevertheless, the few full economic evaluations showed favourable results for digital health intervention modes such as phone/video calls, Short Message Service (SMS), and telemonitoring  23  .\n\nThe current study aims to systematically review full health economic evaluations of digital health interventions targeting the prevention and treatment of T2DM and/or hypertension in adults with (pre)diabetes and/or (pre)hypertension: smartphone applications, text-messaging, and websites are the subject of investigation  19, 20  . This systematic review extends previously published systematic reviews that were mainly based on partial economic evaluations. Although such evaluations can provide some trends in this field, it is critically important in rapidly evolving research fields, such as digital health, to synthesize and report on more comprehensive economic evaluations  25  . The current systematic review focuses on three specific digital technology modes and discusses the health economic evidence for each mode separately. Finally, this review puts emphasis on the methodological quality appraisal, with a focus on making informed recommendations to improve methodological quality."

The within-trial analysis of Derakshandeh-Rishehri et al.  30  applied a patient perspective but this is disputable. One study used a decision tree-based model with a time horizon of 6 months and a patient perspective  38  . Five studies used a Markov model to estimate long-term (i.e., 10 years to lifetime) costs and effects based on clinical trial inputs, and whereby three applied a public healthcare system perspective  29, 32, 34, 36  and one a healthcare payer perspective  26  . Finally, there was one Markov-model study which did not directly stem from one particular implementation study (i.e., all input parameters were literature driven) and which applied a 20-year horizon  37  . All studies with a time horizon of more than 1 year applied discount rates for both future costs and health outcomes between 3 and 5%  26, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37  ."

      "text": "Among the studies expressing results in QALYs, the ICURs varied between dominant (i.e., less costly and better health outcomes) and \u20ac75,233/QALY, with a median of \u20ac3840/QALY (interquartile range \u20ac16,179). One study did not find a QALY difference (Fig.  2 ). None of the three digital health intervention modes was associated with substantially better cost-effectiveness results than the others. Four out of fourteen studies (one on text messaging, two on mainly smartphone applications, and one on websitebased education) reported cost-saving results  26, 29, 34, 39  . Smartphone applications were appraised by the studies' authors as cost-effective  37, 38  or dominant  29, 39  compared to usual care. However, the cost-effective results in Tsuji et al.  37  were associated with considerable uncertainty and should be confirmed by future trial data, as effectiveness data were simulated and the prediction model had been built on major assumptions. Li et al.  39  did not report uncertainty analyses. Furthermore, the smartphone application in Zhang et al.  38  was reported as not cost-effective compared to a self-management intervention: QALY gain was higher but at a considerable cost: a self-management strategy appeared to be the preferred strategy from a health economic perspective (Fig.  2 ).\n\nText-messaging alone, or in combination with other intervention aspects (such as teleconsultation, telemonitoring, case management), was found to be cost-effective  27, [31] [32] [33] 35, 36  or even cost-saving  34  . Altho gh QALY gains were limited (ranging from a 0.01 increment per target person after 6 months in Islam et al.  33  to a 0.22 increment per target person taking a lifetime horizon in Gilmer et al.  32  ), the ICUR appeared to be robust in probabilistic sensitivity analysis  27, 31, 32, 36  . This can be related to the low intervention costs since Islam et al.  33  demonstrated that programme costs could at least be doubled while remaining cost-effective. Wong et al.  34  even calculated that programme costs could be 50 times greater before the break-even point would be reached. Moreover, Li et al.  27  argued that the health economic results of text-messaging can be even further improved by upscaling so that the cost per person decreases. Importantly, the ICUR in Gilmer et al.  32  turned cost-effective only after 10-20 years, which was inconsistent with other studies that demonstrated costeffectiveness in the short term  27, 31, 33  .\n\nWebsite-based interventions appeared to be costeffective  27, 28, 30  , dominant  29  , or cost-saving  26  , even though only a natural effect (i.e., a reduction in systolic blood pressure; the incremental number of QALYs was not significant) was found in the study by McManus et al.  28  .

Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were limited in most studies, which restricts the identification of cost-effectiveness drivers. First, Augustovski et al.  31  reported on patient baseline characteristics: the intervention appeared to have greater value for money in populations of younger age, subjects with higher cardiovascular risk, higher body mass index, and women. The gender difference has been reported by Cunningham et al.  29  as well.\n\nSecondly, intervention aspects influenced the ICER/ICUR as well. A less intensive so less costly intervention following lower treatment adherence was reported by Augustovski et al.  31  , thus being indicative of better cost-effectiveness although the observed differences were not statistically significant. Meanwhile drop-out rates did not impact the ICER/ICUR in Wong et al.  34  . Costs were important drivers of cost-effectiveness in other studies as well  33, 38  .\n\nThird, modelling assumptions was the third and most investigated pillar of what drives cost-effectiveness results. The value for money improved with longer time horizons  26, 32  , and the impact of transition probabilities, utility values, and discount rate on the ICUR were mixed  34, 37, 38  .\n\nWhether digital health interventions targeting (pre)T2DM versus hypertension populations resulted in different cost-effectiveness outcomes, is difficult to assess because only three studies targeted populations with hypertension. However, it seems that digital health interventions targeting (pre)T2DM populations showed consistently positive cost-effective results  26, 27, 29, 30, [32] [33] [34] [35] 37, 39  , while cost-effectiveness results in hypertension populations were more mixed  28, 31, 36, 38  .\n\nWhereas six studies evaluated one particular digital health mode, there were two studies that combined two of the digital health modes under investigation  27, 29  , two studies where the digital health mode was part of a broader digital intervention including telemonitoring  26, 35  , and four studies (three interventions) where the digital health mode was part of a broader health system intervention including digital and non-digital components  28, 31, 32, 36  . Website-interventions, text messaging, and smartphone applications were complemented by, or were seen as a complement of, other intervention components in four out of five, four out of six, and one out of four times, respectively. Gilmer et al.  32  and Zhang et al.  36  evaluated two of the broader health system interventions and found relatively higher health effects (0.22 and 0.13 QALYs, respectively) compared to stand-alone interventions. Note that these two studies applied a long-term perspective, contrary to McManus et al.  28  who evaluated a broad health system intervention and who found only a systolic blood pressure reduction on the short-term but no QALY improvement."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This review aimed to synthesize the available health economic evidence of digital health interventions in populations with or at risk of T2DM and/or hypertension. Digital health interventions were restricted to smartphone applications, text-messaging, and website-based interventions. The three digital health intervention modes were found to be cost-effective or cost-saving compared to care as usual and, most of the time, to enhanced care as usual too. Median ICUR of cost-utility studies was low with \u20ac3840/QALY.\n\nRecent meta-analyses from our team have shown the three digital health interventions to be equally effective in reducing BP in adults with hypertension, while text-messaging and smartphone application interventions were associated with increased improvements in glycaemic control compared to website-based interventions in adults with T2DM  19, 20  . However, increased effects did not always offset additional costs: when comparing the three digital intervention modes with (enhanced) care as usual, our analysis did not show a strong preference in terms of costeffectiveness for one particular mode.\n\nDigital health interventions seem to be consistently costeffective in populations with (pre)T2DM but not in populations with hypertension. One possible explanation could be that the cost-effectiveness of implementing a digital health mode depends on the perceived severity of a condition and hence the urge to act upon. Hypertension is so widespread that some might perceive it merely as a risk factor instead of a disease  40  , so patients and professionals could be less motivated to do something about it. For example, New Zealand does not have hypertension guidelines but bases its care recommendations on a cardiovascular risk score  41  . Moreover, a global consensus definition of hypertension is lacking (see for example the definitions of different leading organisations:  https://tinyurl.com/whohyp , https://tinyurl.com/  cdchyp ,  https://tinyurl.com/mayhyp , https://tinyurl.com/  nhshypdef ). Smartphone applications, websites and textmessaging may have a significant clinical impact on BP, but there are possibly other approaches or other health objectives that better justify the money invested. This remains to be tested as the health economic evidence of smartphone apps, text-messaging, Fig.  2  Incremental cost-utility results (ICUR) estimates of included studies. Note that McManus et al.  28  did not calculate an ICUR as QALY difference was insignificant. ICUR estimates in Cunningham et al.  29  and Wong et al.  34  were dominant. CG control group. *: asterisk denotes studies targeting populations with hypertension; studies without an asterisk include people with (pre)diabetes. Among other process evaluation constructs, adherence and reach are two important ones with a major impact on digital health interventions' cost-effectiveness  42  . Patients who adhere with a smartphone application showed, for instance, better medication adherence  43  . However, high drop-out rates of 40% (95% CI 16-63%) in RCT's testing smartphone applications have been demonstrated as well  44  . It has been suggested that attrition could, for instance, be reduced by using user feedback to enhance user experience, by enabling the possibility for users to contact health professionals (a so-called hybrid model), by focusing on self-management skills, by increasing health literacy, and by combining smartphone applications with internet or telehealth solutions  44  .\n\nDifferentiating between primarily digital health interventions and primarily health system interventions with a digital component is warranted. Our results suggest that health system interventions might have the potential to gain more health effects on the long-term compared to a stand-alone digital health mode intervention, although current evidence is limited and mixed. However, Augustovski et al.  31  suggested better costeffectiveness when the intervention was less intense. Although their statement should be interpreted cautiously because of overlapping confidence intervals between the different intervention intensities, these observations might be in line with the results of a meta-analysis on drop-out rates of exercise interventions that demonstrated a higher likelihood of drop-out in more intensive interventions  45  . Therefore, future interventions should carefully consider which features needs to be combined, knowing that more intervention features could improve effectiveness but a too intense intervention may also increase complexity of use thus having a detrimental impact on both drop-out and costeffectiveness. Participant input via co-design may be of a help from the evidence gathering to the real-world testing stage  46  .\n\nGiven that there are hundreds of millions of people with or at risk of T2DM and hypertension, it is important to keep an eye on the scalability and budget impact of a new programme  42  . Whereas clinical effectiveness on the individual level can be optimised by adding possible intervention components to tailor care, less elaborated programmes may have a higher reach resulting in more population benefit within a closed budget. This could be of particular importance to digitally less-developed countries where digital interventions might be relatively more expensive. Scrutinizing the optimal intervention dose in different health systems including digitally less-developed countries is therefore paramount. Our results indicate for instance that text-messaging is appraised as cost-effective across studies, either in combination with other intervention features or not. Self-monitoring can also be a very powerful strategy to improve cost-effectiveness as well. It might therefore be an option to integrate such functionalities in smartphone applications.\n\nOur quality appraisal demonstrated important methodological shortcomings. Based on these, our four key lessons for future health economic evaluations of digital health interventions are:\n\n1. Health economic results can only be appraised correctly with an elaborate research question and sufficient context. The competing alternatives under investigationcare as usual in particularshould be detailed. The study's perspective should be justified and the applied time horizon should capture relevant long-term costs and effects of preventive measures  9, 11  . In this regard, it is important to stress the cost-effectiveness results of digital therapeutics despite the sometimes quite short time horizons applied. 2. Transparency is pivotal when reporting applied costs: which costs have been included exactly (which refers to the perspective) and how these were measured and valued should be stated."

      "text": "often come with data uncertainty and assumptions. Oneway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are at least needed to address these uncertainties, preferably in different subgroups. Following key lesson 1 on applying an appropriate long time horizon, it is pivotal to scrutinize the impact of the intervention effect's sustainability on the health economic outcome, especially given the high attrition and dropout rates in for instance app-based interventions  44  . 4. An ICUR does not have an intrinsic value and should always be evaluated in light of a willingness-to-pay threshold. Most included studies applied a threshold value of one to three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, as recommended by the World Health Organisation  47, 48  , but critics argued that a more conservative threshold of \u00b150% the GDP per capita would better capture opportunity costs  48, 49  . Note that, given such a conservative threshold, most cost-effectiveness estimates of digital health interventions remain cost-effective. Furthermore, some studies applied natural units (e.g., cost per percentage HbA1c reduction). For instance, Derakhshandeh-Rishehr et al.  30  , Faleh Al-Mutairi et al.  35  and McManus et al.  28  reported an increase in health effect at an increased cost and stated the result was cost-effective although no willingness-to-pay threshold or valid argumentation for the applied willingness-to-pay threshold was reported, respectively.\n\nThese key lessons should be considered in future research. Such studies should also strive to address evidence gaps in the field. Head-to-head studies are definitely needed to determine the digital health mode with the best value for money in different subgroups operating within a particular health system. The uncertainty associated with long-term health economic evaluations can be reduced by designing trials with longer clinical follow-up periods so the sustainability of the intervention effect can be modelled more precisely. Moreover, budget impact estimates are truly relevant for policy makers given the high prevalence of T2DM and hypertension, while uptake and attrition rates should also be taken into consideration as they can also have a significant effect on the costs.\n\nThe most important strengths of this review are the complementarity with previously published meta-analyses  19, 20  scrutinizing the effectiveness of the three digital health intervention modes, and the thorough quality appraisal resulting in several key lessons for health economic research.\n\nHowever, this systematic review also has limitations. First, the adult filter is not consistent between the five searched databases. In Medline, the adult filter is >19 years of age, whereas for EMBASE and PsycINFO it is >18. However, the proportion of the population with T2DM or hypertension at that age is small  50, 51  . Second, studies on people with or at risk of T2DM or hypertension were included but the small number of studies impeded appropriate subgroup analyses. What may work in one population may not work in another. Third, only English articles were included and this may limit our conclusions, especially since T2DM and hypertension prevalence are high in large non-English-speaking countries such as India  52  and China  53  . However, included studies from the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Middle-East reflected a geographically and demographically diverse population. Fourth, digital health solutions in five website-based or text-messaging studies have been augmented with other intervention features such as healthcare professional education, telemonitoring and/or (tele) consultations. It is therefore not clear whether the intervention effect arises due to these additional intervention features or due to the digital intervention component. Fifth, the number of full health economic papers remain scarce, especially compared to the accumulating amount of clinical effectiveness evidence, and the results of Tsuji et al.  37  are based on disputable assumptions. Because of the low number of included papers, additional analyses of the impact of study quality on results were not conducted. Sixth, no head-to-head health economic studies of the three digital intervention modes were found. Seventh, health economic studies might be subject to multiple sources of publication bias including a publication bias in first health outcome publications and next economic publications. Funnel plotting to investigate possible publication bias was not an option in this study but Moschonis et al.  19  and Siopis et al.  20  demonstrated respectively a small and non-existing publication bias in our health outcome reviews. It is of course still possible that a publication bias favoring cost-effective or cost-saving results remains in economic publications, especially given the suboptimal reporting of sensitivity analyses  54  .\n\nIn conclusion, health economic evidence suggests that smartphone application, text-messaging, and website-based interventions are cost-effective and, in some cases, even cost-saving. It shows how challenging, but at the same time how possible, it can be to improve the health of the population while saving money.\n\nWhile previous research demonstrated that the three digital health intervention modes were equally clinically-effective in adults with hypertension, and that text-messaging and smartphone application interventions worked significantly better than website-based interventions in adults with T2DM, no costeffectiveness evidence was found supporting one particular digital health intervention mode over another. Moreover, textmessaging, smartphone application, and website-based interventions appeared to be consistently cost-effective in populations with (pre)T2DM, but not in populations with hypertension.\n\nBased on the available evidence, policy makers and clinicians should make decisions on the most appropriate digital health interventions based on available budgets and well-defined health objectives. The high penetration rate of digital applications in diverse populations is a strength but it is pivotal to keep process evaluation constructs in mind. Key lessons for future health economic studies on how to design studies and report on the results are given. It is important to pay special focus on the context, report the costs included and how these were measured and valued, conduct sufficient sensitivity analyses, and appraise the cost-effectiveness result more critically in light of a reasoned willingness-to-pay threshold. Head-to-head studies are missing while this would enhance understanding and practice substantially. It is strongly recommended to consistently include a costeffectiveness work package alongside clinical trials  55  ."
