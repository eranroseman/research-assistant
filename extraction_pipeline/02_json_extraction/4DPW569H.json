  "title": "Effectiveness of mobile application interventions for stroke survivors: systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background Although smartphone usage is ubiquitous, and a vast amount of mobile applications have been developed for chronic diseases, mobile applications amongst stroke survivors remain unclear. Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of mobile applications on medication adherence, functional outcomes, cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life and knowledge on stroke in stroke survivors. Methods A review of the literature was conducted using key search terms in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases until 16 March 2023 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trial (CCTs) of mobile application interventions among stroke survivors. Two reviewers independently screened the literature in accordance with the eligibility criteria and collected data from the articles included. Outcomes included medication adherence,functional outcomes,cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life,and knowledge of stroke. \n Results Twenty-three studies involving 2983 participants across nine countries were included in this review. Sixteen trials involved health care professionals in app use, and seven trials reported measures to ensure app-based intervention adherence. Mobile applications targeting stroke survivors primarily encompassed three areas: rehabilitation, education and self-care. The participants in the studies primarily included young and middle-aged stroke survivors. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that mobile application intervention significantly improved trunk control ability (mean differences [MD] 3.00, 95% CI [1.80 to 4.20]; P < 0.00001), Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity (MD 9.81,  95% CI [8.72 to 10.90]; P < 0.00001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD -0.33, 95% CI [-0.54 to -0.11]; P = 0.003) and glycosylated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c )<7 levels (MD 1.95, 95% CI [1.17 to 3.25]; P = 0.01). However, the mobile application intervention did not differ significantly in medication adherence, 10-min walk test (10 MWT), Barthel index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, smoking, health-related quality of life and knowledge of stroke. \n Conclusion Our study suggested that mobile application interventions may have a potential benefit to stroke survivors, but clinical effectiveness should be established. More studies using rigorous designs are warranted to understand their usefulness. Future research should also involve more older adult stroke survivors.",

      "text": "Based on the most recent Global Burden of Disease 2019 stroke burden estimates globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death and a major cause of disability  [1] . In 2019, 12.2 million (95% UI 11\u20220-13\u20226) incident strokes and 101 million (93\u20222-111) prevalent strokes were reported. Globally, stroke was responsible for 143 million disability-adjusted life-years and 6.55 million deaths  [1] . In China, the annual number of new stroke cases is approximately 3.94 million  [2] . Stroke cost the 32 European countries under analysis \u20ac60 billion, with health care accounting for \u20ac27 billion (45%), representing 1.7% of health expenditure in 2017  [3] . The estimated global cost of stroke is over US$891 billion, representing 1.12% of the global GDP  [4] . Stroke remains a disease of immense public health significance in the twenty-first century despite the advances in primary and secondary prevention as well as acute stroke treatment and neurorehabilitation  [5] . Furthermore, stroke has caused a huge public health burden, which is set to increase in the future because of the ageing population and increased prevalence of modifiable stroke risk factors  [6] .\n\nThe growing burden of stroke worldwide strongly suggests that current primary stroke and cardiovascular disease prevention strategies are either not universally adopted or not sufficiently effective  [4] . Literature has demonstrated that the importance of long term rehabilitation for people with stroke is increasingly evident, howerer multi-factorial barriers resultes in lacking of long term rehabilitation services  [7] . Therefore, the implementation of new approaches that are effective in reaching a wider population and promoting long-term stroke management in an economically viable way is essential to mitigate the disease burden of stroke. Recent advances in mobile (smartphone) technologies and their worldwide use (about 1.4 billion users) provide unique opportunities to elicit behaviour change for disease management  [8] . Delivering care outside traditional brick-and-mortar settings has been fuelled by rapid innovation and economic growth in mobile technology development, consumer adoption as well as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic  [9, 10] . Mobile applications are easily accessible, convenient and easily adopted, and they can promote social distancing. The increasing availability, convenience and ease of use of apps promote the growth of smartphone applications that can be used for intervention amongst stroke survivors.\n\nOver the past decade, several trials of mobile health (mhealth) interventions for stroke survivors have been published  [11, 12] . Despite the strong uptake of mhealth technology targeted at stroke survivors, whether this strategy improves patient-related outcomes remains unclear. Major knowledge gaps exist about their utility and efficacy. To our knowledge, only two narrative systematic reviews have been conducted in the area of mobile applications used amongst stroke survivors  [13, 14] . However, one narrative systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of mobile applications in the rehabilitation of stroke survivors  [13] . The other narrative systematic review has explored the role of mHealth apps supporting the self-management of health and function amongst survivors  [14] . On the contrary, recent systematic review and meta-analysis have studied the efficacy of telerehabilitation in poststroke patients  [15]  and impact of mhealth and telehealth technology on medication adherence of patients with stroke  [16] . However, these reviews included any mobile technology-based intervention, such as personal digital assistants, without focusing on mobile applications. Published evidence for the beneficial effects of mobile applications amongst stroke survivors is lacking. No existing systematic review or meta-analysis examining the effect of mobile applications interventions amongst stroke survivors has been conducted. Such a review is necessary to inform the development of scalable and effective activity interventions amongst this population. Given the increased interest of the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association on the use of mHealth technologies to improve patient outcomes  [17, 18] , a new systematic review with an explicit focus on mobile application interventions for patients with stroke is warranted.\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the effectiveness of mobile applications on medication adherence, functional outcomes, cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life and knowledge on stroke amongst stroke survivors."

Discrepancies were resolved through discussion by the two researchers, and decisions were independently assessed by a third investigator. Quality evaluation of RCTs was conducted independently by two researchers using the Cochrane collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias  [21] , which covers six domains of bias: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias. The risk of bias was determined as high, low or unclear with their corresponding causes. The quality evaluation of controlled clinical trials was conducted using the Risk of Bias Tool in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I)  [22] , which covers bias caused by confounding factors, intervention classification, participant selection, deviations from intended intervention, missing data, outcome measurement and selection of reported results. The categories for risk of bias judgements include 'low risk' , 'moderate risk' , \"serious risk\" and \"critical risk\" of bias. The risk of bias graphs was generated using RevMan 5.4."

In brief, Hedge's g value of < 0.2 indicates a mild effect, and ~ 0.5 and > 0.8 indicate moderate and strong effect, respectively. The heterogeneity of results was assessed using the I 2 statistical test. The random-effect model or fixed-effect model was determined on the basis of the results of the heterogeneity I 2 test, with I 2 \u2264 50% for the fixed-effect model and I 2 > 50% for the random-effects model  [21] .

Given the nature of mobile application interventions, blinding of study participants and health care personnel is not feasible, which inevitably causes performance bias. In total, 16 trials  [6, 11, 12, 23-33, 35, 36]  had a low risk of incomplete outcome data, whereas only seven trials  [11, 25, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33]  had a low risk of selective outcome reporting.

With regard to self-care, the majority of apps have a self-monitoring function or medication reminder, health information, assessment, feedback, health service and social support. As for rehabilitation, apps can detect a variety of physical activities and transmit rehabilitation-related data to the server computer, which are shared with the therapist. Most of these apps need other devices to achieve these functions.

      "text": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, evidence was synthesised from 18 RCTs and five CCTs (n = 2983 patients) that assessed the effectiveness of mobile application interventions in patients with stroke. Mobile applications targeting stroke survivors primarily encompassed three areas: rehabilitation, education and selfcare. Regarding the involvement of HCPs and measures to ensure app-based intervention adherence, most of the trials involved HCPs in app use, but a few trials provided details about measures to ensure app adherence during intervention. The participants in the studies included young and middle-aged adults. The results showed that on average, mobile application intervention had a statistically significant improvement in trunk control ability, FMA-UE, LDL-C and HbA 1c < 7, but little to no effect was observed on medication adherence, 10 MWT, Barthel index, SBP, DBP, HDL-C, BMI, smoking, Qol and knowledge of stroke compared with the control group. The evidence was modest; however, this finding, should be cautiously interpreted because of the app features, content diversity, clinical and methodological heterogeneity amongst studies and small sample sizes.\n\nThe total effect indicated that the trunk control ability of the mobile application intervention group was better than that of the control group. Using mobile applications, a visual feedback training environment can be built to help trunk control and gait of patients with stroke, which helps the user focus on the task  [27, 28] . However, in generalising the effects of mobile applications on trunk performance in patients with stroke, further studies with a larger number of subjects, greater homogeneity with regard to the device used and equal total training times for the mobile application group and control group must be conducted  [27, 28] .\n\nStatistical analysis carried out in the present review revealed favourable results of mobile application intervention on FMA-UE amongst stroke survivors, which is consistent with previous studies  [40] . These effects may be due to the advantages inherent to mobile application interventions, including timely feedback, overcoming the barriers of distance, travel time and personalisation, which enables patients to receive continuous rehabilitation in a feasible and convenient manner. Hao et al.  [44]  highlights that the continuation of rehabilitation promotes the recovery of functional deficits, resulting in optimal outcomes amongst stroke survivors. This meta-analysis showed that the use of mobile application interventions was associated with significant improvements in HbA 1c < 7. The findings of the current study are consistent with those of Liu et al.  [45]  who observed the use of mobile app-assisted selfcare interventions, which led to an SMD of -0.44 and an absolute MD of -0.49% with regard to HbA 1c level  [45] . Using mobile application, patients' engagement in the behaviour of monitoring blood glucose was further developed, which helped control HbA 1c . [45] In addition, some app creators incorporate a feedback module into the design of the application, and feedback will improve lifestyle choices, thereby decreasing HbA1c  [46] .\n\nIntegrated results showed that mobile application interventions could effectively improve LDL-C amongst stroke survivors. This finding is consistent with that of Xu et al.  [42] , that is, mobile health can reduce the LDL-C level significantly. These results are due to mobile applications, which can facilitate the remote management of health issues and data, patient-care provider communication, provision of personalised self-care recommendations and decision-making. Moreover, evidence regarding the effects of mobile application interventions on the LDL-C level warrants further examination.

      "text": "Previous systematic reviews have assessed the effectiveness of mobile applications in medication adherence  [47] , lifestyle modification in type 2 diabetes  [48] , perinatal depression and anxiety  [49]  and nutritional outcomes in adults with chronic diseases. Many reviews have reported that mobile applications are effective tools, and that their use results in positive effects. To the best of our knowledge, four other systematic reviews have been published on this topic amongst stroke survivors  [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, two previous reviews did not conduct a systematic review that accompanying meta-analysis  [16, 17] . Furthermore, one of them was limited to the efficacy of rehabilitation amongst stroke survivors  [13] ; the other addressed the role of mHealth apps supporting selfmanagement of health and function amongst survivors  [14] . In addition, although two other recent systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at assessing the effects of mobile applications in patients with stroke  [15, 16] , a mobile technology-based intervention was included (e.g. personal digital assistants), and it does not focus solely on mobile application. Therefore, the present systematic review is unique, and it goes beyond the findings of previous reviews that focused only on mobile application, including evidence from newly published studies."

      "text": "Generalisability and applicability of our results may be more or less affected when considering the following factors. Firstly, similar to other study  [50] , older people were underrepresented in the included trials, although stroke highly affected older adults, which may reduce the usefulness of the information provided by trials on efficacy. In addition, the magnitude of all included studies was performed in Asian countries, and the results of this study may not be generalised to a wider population. Secondly, almost half of the included trials involved the use of simple mHealth apps. Further research must be conducted to determine feasibility, efficacy and acceptance of the wearable devices interlock with the mobile application. Wearables are widely used, and they have shown promising results in the field of healthcare because of their ability of deformability and compliance  [51] . Furthermore, multimodal Biofeedback rehabilitation may represent a good alternative for post-stroke patients and be a suitable adjunct to physical therapy  [52] . A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature comparing traditional rehabilitation therapy and traditional plus VR rehabilitation therapy found that immersive virtual reality rehabilitation treatment may further improve rehabilitation outcomes and counld become a new option for rehabilitation after stroke in the future  [53] . Augmented Reality (AR) technology for rehabilitation after stroke is in its infancy and warrants further investigation  [54] . Considering the sample size, app content, duration of the interventions, care settings and intervention characteristics, the included studies were diverse clinically and methodologically. However, the mechanism by which these clinical, methodological and contextual differences might affect the results remains unclear, although no statistically significant heterogeneity is observed amongst the included studies. Given the complex nature of mobile application interventions, their efficacy was directly associated with a range of contextual factors  [55] ."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study has its own limitations that are worth considering. Firstly, language biases might exist because these searches were conducted in English, which may limit the cross-cultural generalisability of our findings. Secondly, relying primarily on randomised controlled studies is difficult because of the nature of the available evidence. However, the inclusion of quasi-experimental studies allows us to address outcomes from mobile application interventions that have not been sufficiently studied in randomised controlled trials and justified. In general, the inclusion of quasi-experimental studies is justified when more rigorous trials are lacking  [56] . Thirdly, scopus database has not been reviewed and we indeed should have reviewed scopus database in future studies. However, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases. The keyword search with Pub-Med offers optimal update frequency and includes online early articles; other databases can rate articles by number of citations, as an index of importance. For citation analysis, Scopus offers about 20% more coverage than Web of Science, whereas Google Scholar offers results of inconsistent accuracy. PubMed remains an optimal tool in biomedical electronic research. Scopus covers a wider journal range, of help both in keyword searching and citation analysis, but it is currently limited to recent articles (published after 1995) compared with Web of Science. Google Scholar  [57] . In addition, given the small amount of studies, subgroup analyses were not examined, and publication bias was not explored. Finally, differences in the number of participants, methods, intervention contents, frequency, measurements and follow-up time resulted in heterogeneity."

      "text": "Mobile apps may be a promising tool to complement routine clinical care amongst stroke survivors. However, the implementation of mobile applications amongst stroke survivors is still in its infancy. Additional research that examines the effects of interventions is necessary. In addition, clarifying whether the present limited efficacy holds true and identifying in which circumstances their potential could be increased are potentially relevant fields that should be investigated systematically. Furthermore, given the increase in aging population, further studies that will involve older stroke survivors, who are the largest potential user population, must be conducted. Older adults must use digital health tools and mobile health applications to help them in independent living and self-management of (chronic) illnesses  [58] . Smart phone ownership amongst adults aged 65 and older has increased substantially. As of 2017, around four in 10 (42%) adults aged 65 years and older were using a smartphone  [59] . Based on the European Union commission's 2012-2020 eHealth Action Plan, current mHealth landscape lacks user-friendly tools and services for older patients  [58] . Therefore, understanding the needs of older stroke survivors is important to design, develop and evaluate the mobile application intervention amongst this population. Finally, Weisel et al.  [55]  highlighted that engagement is linked to the efficacy of apps, and adherence to app should be further investigated."

However, patients assigned to the mobile application group and the conventional care group did not difer signifcantly in medication adherence, 10-min walk test (10 MWT), Barthel index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, smoking, health-related quality of life and knowledge of stroke. In addition, generalisable evidence to unreservedly recommend the use of mobile applications amongst stroke survivors as a substitute to conventional management is still lacking because of the clinical and methodological heterogeneity amongst studies, small sample sizes and disparity in app features, content and follow-up. Given the growing popularity of mobile applications worldwide and in order for mHealth approaches to be widely embraced, more studies using rigorous designs, with long-term follow-up and representative samples of older adults are warranted to understand the sustainability of mobile application intervention effects."
