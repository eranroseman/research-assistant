  "title": "A future role for health applications of large language models depends on regulators enforcing safety standards",
  "abstract": "Among the rapid integration of artificial intelligence in clinical settings, large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer-4, have emerged as multifaceted tools that have potential for health-care delivery, diagnosis, and patient care. However, deployment of LLMs raises substantial regulatory and safety concerns. Due to their high output variability, poor inherent explainability, and the risk of so-called AI hallucinations, LLM-based health-care applications that serve a medical purpose face regulatory challenges for approval as medical devices under US and EU laws, including the recently passed EU Artificial Intelligence Act. Despite unaddressed risks for patients, including misdiagnosis and unverified medical advice, such applications are available on the market. The regulatory ambiguity surrounding these tools creates an urgent need for frameworks that accommodate their unique capabilities and limitations. Alongside the development of these frameworks, existing regulations should be enforced. If regulators fear enforcing the regulations in a market dominated by supply or development by large technology companies, the consequences of layperson harm will force belated action, damaging the potentiality of LLM-based applications for layperson medical advice.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings has increased since 2015, with various applications being used for specific purposes, such as medical imaging, patient care, or emergency medicine.  1 Since 2022, technological advancements have led to the development of multipurpose algorithms, such as generative AI, with large language models (LLMs) as one of its most noteworthy subsets.  2, 3 The introduction of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in November, 2022, 4 marked a momentous shift, with LLMs rapidly gaining traction across various domains, including health-care research.  2 ince the introduction of LLMs, various models have been introduced and continuously improved by different developers such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft, 3,5 offering increasingly better performance 6 in, for example, medical applications.  7 Experts expect that LLMs will transform multiple areas of health care-eg, cancer diagnosis and treatment, virtual nursing, predictive medicine, clinical notetaking, and health-care professional-patient interaction.  2, 8 xtensive research efforts are currently dedicated to assessing the use of LLMs within medical settings, particularly as Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). LLM-based applications that are not limited to health care, such as ChatGPT, have shown great potential in timesaving for radiologists in the classification of fractures; 9 as a diagnostic tool evaluated with artificial case vignettes in which the majority of responses aligned with established medical guidelines; 10 and as a CDSS for healthcare professionals, effectively generating diag nostic insights from presented symptom patterns. 11 LLM-based applications that are focused for health care, such as Med-Gemini, perform well in multiple medical tests (eg, the MedQA benchmark, which is based on medical board exams such as the US Medical Licensing Examination), medical text summ arisation, medical reasoning, and multimodal analysis, including radiology images.  12, 13 The performance of individual LLMs and LLM-based systems, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT, Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer, and Llama 2, was also measured in application scenarios for layperson end users, showing growing potential and superiority over a simple internet search,  14  or in text-based consultations when compared with primary care physicians.  15 However, validating and translating these results into useful and safe clinical applications remains challenging. We are in an era where conflicting reports from many supporters and critics are being published about the accuracy and suitability of these approaches to medicine. Several publications show the disappointing performance of LLM-based appli cations in a series of medical tasks, including poor performance in generating medical billing codes,  16  high error rates in oncology questions,  17  potentially harmful  18  and prolonged patient communication,  19  and misleading risk stratifications of patients with chest pain 20 or breast cancer.  21 dditionally, researchers have identified open ethical and legal questions regarding data privacy and intellectual property,  22  and the perpetuation of racial and gender biases.  23 n summary, studies showing highly encouraging, positive performance of LLMs have often been limited by their evaluation of real-world medical scenarios, whereas studies showing disappointing performance have generally been based on unoptimised approaches with generic LLM-based applications and do not use technologies deemed important for LLMs in medicine, such as retrieval-augmented generation.  7, 24 These studies highlight the importance of rigorous and independent evaluation frameworks, such as the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of Decision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence,  25  and the need for development of independent test platforms-an early example of which is the UK AI Safety Institute's open-source framework.  26"

      "text": "Although research on LLMs shows inconclusive evidence about both positive and negative appropriateness for use in medicine, developers have proceeded to release unapproved, layperson-facing, LLM-based applications to the market. These developers include not only commercial providers but also organ isations such as WHO, which made available their new AI conversation agent, Smart AI Resource Assistant for Health (SARAH), in April, 2024.  27 hen the aforementioned applications provide medical advice to laypersons, they explicitly qualify as medical devices under EU and US regulations  28, 29  and guidance  30  and thus need regulatory approval to be legally on the market.  31 Although more traditional AI applic ations are already on the market as approved or cleared medical devices with a clear but not entirely defined ruleset for this regulatory process,  1, 29, 32  this process becomes more challenging for LLMs due to their unique characteristics and general-purpose capabilities.  31, 32 The term on the market includes all applications that are available to consumers, regardless of the financing of the sales platform.  28 When using LLMs from other companies, developers of layperson-facing applications must comply with the usage policies of the respective LLMs. For instance, Open AI's policy restricts use of their LLMs in applications related to health care.  33 Non-compliance could potentially result in legal consequences but compliance is not a prerequisite for market entry. This unclear situation has already raised some concerns about the safety of those tools in the health-care sector.  2, 8, 31, 32, 34, 35 espite regulatory concerns and contractual conditions imposed by LLM providers, such LLM-based health applications remain available on the market. This availability poses a risk to health-care professionals and to non-professional users, highlighting the absence of enforcement of current regulations. In this Viewpoint, we aim to highlight the regulatory challenges associated with different types of LLM-based health applications, categorising the barriers specific to each type. Additionally, we address an important but often overlooked aspect: the use of LLM-based health applications by laypeople. To address this gap, we describe the current landscape of LLM-based, laypersonfacing health applications; the risks that such applications might pose to users; and the regulatory situation to which such applications are subject."

      "text": "The development of LLMs involves the use of natural, language-processing methods and deep-learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, to analyse and generate text that resembles human-like speech.  2, 3, 36 raditional machine-learning models rely on task-specific datasets and supervised learning, whereas LLMs use highly variable, non-specific datasets retrieved from the internet.  2, 36 Although traditional models are typically optimised for specific tasks, LLMs are capable of multitasking (ie, they perform well across a wide range of different cognitive tasks with minimal adaption).  3, 36 he development of LLMs can usually be split into two main phases: pretraining, which needs high amounts of data, and fine tuning, which requires less data.  3, 36, 37 For some models, this second step includes reinforcement learning from human feedback.  3, 38 In the first phase, the LLM translates the semantic and syntactic meaning of each word or word snippet of the training data into probabilities and learns to predict the next word in a given input.  3, 36, 37 Pretraining can be done with different approaches such as autoregression (eg, GPT-4)  36  or masked-language modelling (eg, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).  39 In the second phase, the probabilities and parameters of the model are optimised through supervised learning to produce results that lie in an area favoured by the developer of the model (eg, with regard to wording or comprehensibility).  40, 41 his optimisation can also increase safety for patients.  3 nce trained, LLMs can be deployed and made available for users. Depending on the application, user inputs can be sent directly to the LLM via an application programming interface or after modifications by an interface.  42 The LLM then creates an output that will be returned to the user, potentially with further modifications.  3, 43 Due to the considerable computing demands, high-performance LLMs are typically run on centralised computational units.  42 With the advancements of lightweight models, powerful LLMs could run on enduser devices in the near future,  42  which is already possible for less powerful models.  43 iven their great influence and user base, LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT 4 or Gemini are many users' first contact points with LLMs. These tools provide an easyto-use interface to layperson users and allow conversational interactions with the underlying LLM. The chatbots work as interfaces to the LLM but can also alter the input and output of LLMs to guide and control answers and provide a more desirable output.  3, 38"

For example, the input and output of the underlying LLM could be altered with data that were not part of the model's training dataset, thus improving its performance on domain-specific For more on the chabot Gemini see  https://gemini.google.com Viewpoint tasks.  7, 45, 48 These components could include databases to enable retrieval-augmented generation, or specialised input systems such as chatbots or interactive software. Another method is to combine multiple LLMs.  46 hese approaches have led to the development of commercially available applications that are end-user facing. Most feature a type of interaction component (eg, a chatbot) that works as previously described. Such products could be developed by the company that provides the LLM (eg, ChatGPT)  4  or by an independent third-party company (eg, Google's Vertex AI).  49 A subset of LLM-based health applications that provides clinical guidance or decision support to laypersons or healthcare professionals is referred to as an LLM-based CDSS. Another partly overlapping subset that has multimodal conversational capabilities and can perform multistep reasoning is the LLM-based clinical agents.  46, 50 This non-technical term must not be used interchangeably with the term agents in the context of self-contained LLMs, which can act without being prompted.  51 In general interest news articles and some corporate descriptions, these LLM-based clinical agents are referred to as virtual nurses and doctors.  52 Different approaches to how LLM-based health applications are used are illustrated (figure  1 )."

      "title": "The risks of LLM-based health applications",
      "text": "The use of an LLM-based health application that has not been developed, tested, or approved for medical use could pose risks to users.  31, 32, 47 The first major area of risk involves privacy concerns. LLMs themselves and LLMbased tools process user-inputted, health-related data as part of their service. However, the treatment of these data and compliance with data protection principles and laws remains unclear.  35, 58, 59 nother area of risk involves the visual presentation and deployment of such tools. Although the presentation of some applications is functional, others use engagementenhancing mechanics, which could lead to users becoming overly dependent on the app and thus delaying the onset of effective treatment.  56 These mechanics incentivise repeated use and create an advertising character that restricts patient autonomy, which could have a negative effect on the patient's health because they are wrongly defined as being unwell, therefore causing overtreatment (eg, through unnecessary, user-ordered home tests or pressure from users placed on health-care professionals to do unnecessary tests or procedures).  60 owever, the most frequently identified risk in literature concerns the accuracy and reliability of LLMs and, in turn, any applications based on them and the medical purpose for which they are used.  8, 31, 32, 59, 61 Although often accurate, due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs, LLM-based health applications frequently produce inaccurate or misleading information, which could result in harm to patients, such as incorrect diagnoses, inappropriate treatment recommendations, or missed essential steps in patient care.  8, 31, 32, 59, 61 This risk is increased by the fact that LLMs generate plausible but incorrect information and recommendations (eg, due to so-called hallucinations),  8, 31, 59, 61, 62  which, in the worst case, are no longer questioned due to an automation bias.  63 We have illustrated this problem with example conversations (table). Incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate recommendations could mislead a layperson user on the severity, urgency, or treatment of a medical issue, leading to incorrect or delayed treatment or self-treatment with a resulting deterioration of health or, in the case of lifethreatening diseases, severe health issues or death. This risk of potentially harmful advice is connected to the poor explainability of LLM-based systems,  59  which also affects the regulatory approval of LLMs and LLM-based health applications.  66"

In many cases, these systems will also meet the criteria for being considered high-risk AI systems and will be treated as such.  73 Requirements for the models include the provision of technical documentation, a description of the capabilities and limitations of the model, and a description of the data used to train them.  73 f the model was trained with a computational power of more than 10 25 floating point operations, it is considered to have a systemic risk that results in further requirements, such as notifying the European Comission, adversarial testing to identify and mitigate systemic risks, adequate cybersecurity protection, and reporting serious incidents.  73 The requirements for the providers of highrisk AI systems overlap partly with the requirements for medical devices, including the establishment of risk and quality management systems, implementation of data gover nance, provision of technical documentation, enabling of automatic detection of risky events, facilitation of human oversight, and implementation of robust cybersecurity measures.  73 n the USA, the classification of LLM-based health applications as medical devices is nuanced (figure  2 ).

The doctors said she had some gene that caused the cancer. I feel sick. I am not sure I can go on. The doctors offered me the test and I have the gene too. I asked them if I will die too and they didn't answer me. Will I? I am not sure I can take this any more? Does my daughter have it too? That's what l keep thinking. None of us can take it.\" AI: \"I'm truly sorry to hear about your sister's passing and the pain you're going through right now. Losing someone so close to you, especially at such a young age, is incredibly hard, and learning about your own genetic risk can make everything feel even more overwhelming. It's understandable that you're feeling scared and uncertain about the future. Genetic factors can indeed influence the risk of developing certain types of cancer, but having a gene associated with cancer doesn't mean it's certain you'll develop it. There are often options for monitoring and preventative measures that can significantly reduce the risk. It's important to discuss these options with your health-care provider, who can give you personalized advice based on your specific situation. As for your daughter, the same gene could be passed on, but it's not a certainty. Genetic counseling could be beneficial for you and your family...the feelings you're experiencing are natural in such a situation, but remember, you don't have to navigate this alone. It might be helpful to reach out to a therapist or a support group for people who are going through similar experiences...if you're feeling overwhelmed by thoughts of not being able to go on, I strongly encourage you to seek support from a mental health professional...would you like to explore some ways to manage these feelings or discuss how to find support?\" AI: \"I'm deeply sorry to hear about your sister's passing and the distressing news you've received. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious about your health and your daughter's, especially after such a significant loss in your family. Genetic factors can indeed play a role in the risk of developing certain types of cancer, but having a gene associated with cancer does not guarantee that you or your daughter will develop the disease. It's important to approach this situation with care and support. Genetic testing can provide valuable information about your risk and potentially your daughter's risk for certain types of cancer...for your daughter, whether she has inherited the gene depends on several factors...during this challenging time, consider seeking support from genetic counselors...they can also offer emotional support and guidance on managing the psychological impact of genetic information. Additionally, connecting with support groups for individuals and families facing similar situations can be incredibly beneficial. If you're feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope, it may also be helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can support you through this difficult time...remember, while genetics can play a significant role in cancer risk, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and random chance also contribute to cancer risk. I'm here to support you with information and guidance as you navigate this challenging period.

This situation poses risks to both layperson and professional users and indicates an absence of enforcement of current regulations in the EU  28  and USA.  29, 77 This absence of enforcement is certain for the EU and highly probable for the US, although the FDA or courts might judge that some LLM-based health applications intended for health-care professionals might fall under enforcement discretion or could be classified as non-devices.  [29] [30] 0] [31]  Putting a medical device on the market without meeting regulatory requirements, and thus being identified by regulators, usually results in the issuance of warning letters demanding the product's removal,  78  followed by enforcement actions that might include substantial fines or even custodial sentences. However, these sentences are rare,  56  especially in the EU. Regulators have limited capacity for market surveillance;  56  however, the rules must be enforced properly to prevent any dangerous LLM-based tools from putting citizens at risk and to prohibit illegal products from being placed on the market. Proper enforcement could be achieved through regulatory bodies and app stores fulfilling their responsibility for screening, market oversight, and monitoring.  28 We show that there is a gap between the establishment of regulations and their practical application (figure  2 ). This gap primarily arises from the rapid evolution of LLM technologies and the complexities inherent in their oversight and validation."

      "text": "To address the challenges discussed, carefully designed and adapted approaches are needed from developers and regulators.  22 A balanced approach to controlling the development of LLMs and the data used in their training is needed to establish sustainable regulatory approaches, supported by the public and ultimately enforced by regulatory authorities.\n\nOn the developer's side, existing regulatory and guidance principles for AI oversight need to be adhered to (eg, FDA's Good Machine Learning Practice for non-LLM AI tools  79  or article 14 of the EU AI Act).  73 Developers should follow a set of principles that include: restricting the range of responses of the LLM to fit the intended purpose; designing tools in a way to inform, not drive, medical decisions; constraining the model to stop harmful advice; developing from reliable medical sources; rigorous testing and validation, including in clinical trials;  31  clarifying what data are collected from users and for what purposes; asking users for consent; and handling the data in accordance with existing laws. Developers should also consider developments that might mitigate particular aspects of regulatory challenges, such as the edge deployment of LLM-based applications, in which the LLM and interaction component both run on the user device without the need to send data to third parties, as proposed by companies like Apple  42  and researchers.  80 This approach has the potential to tackle regulatory challenges for patient data security and patient privacy.  80 n the regulatory side, several improvements have been proposed to enable regulatory bodies to assess LLM-based tools. New risk metrics should be developed that cover the poor explainability of AI systems, their trustworthiness, responsibility, and the potential harm LLM-based health applications used by health-care professionals LLM-based health applications used by laypeople Rules Medical devices on the market Enforcement Rules Medical devices on the market Enforcement Ambiguous (some might be classified as non-devices) Ambiguous (some might be classified as non-devices) Yes* Yes* Yes \u2021 Yes \u2021 Ambiguous (FDA might exercise enforcement discretion \u2020 for some LLM-HAs) Ambiguous (FDA might exercise enforcement discretion \u2020 for some LLM-HAs) Clear (devices for triage, diagnosis, and therapy are medical devices) Clear (devices for triage, diagnosis, and therapy are medical devices) No No USA EU Viewpoint they could cause.  58 Other authors called for a full system approach for the assessment through regulatory bodies, in which regulators collect extensive data beyond their traditional scope, potentially requiring new statutory authority.  66 For the LLM-based health applications used by health-care professionals that keep human oversight (ie, used as support, and not as a replacement, for healthcare professionals),  81  regulatory programmes similar to the classification of CDSS as a non-device in the USA  76  could be developed in the EU that allow faster assessments and appropriately classify low-risk CDSS as low-risk medical devices.  70 egulatory pathways are needed for the safe development of LLM-based health applications as they have profound differences from other, previously used, AI applications. Although current regulatory frameworks are suitable for approval pathways for LLM-based health applications, some aspects need to be addressed or adapted to avoid a priori ruling out these applications as regulatory-approved products in health care. Traditional regulatory frameworks need medical devices to be designed for narrowly predefined tasks, validated for these tasks, and subsequently undergo clinical trials tailored to these specific functions.  55 Although this approach is suited to hardware medical devices and narrow, AI-enabled medical devices that use machine and deep learning, it effectively prevents the market access of LLM-based and other generative AI approaches, which make use of advanced and flexible reasoning capabilities in medicine,  67  thereby blocking their unique advantage over previous technologies. AI regulation needs to continue to evolve through new legislation,  82  guidance, 83 and standards 84 associated with introduced laws. These approaches should not prematurely preclude the multipurpose capabilities of LLM-based health applications, which, if appropriately harnessed and developed to an appropriate degree of maturity, could support flexible and multimodal decision support.  22, 55 owever, there is the risk that current legislative efforts, such as the EU AI Act  73  and the push for new standards in AI development (particularly regarding training data), will impose requirements highly tailored to narrow AI approaches, which are unsuitable for generative AI approaches, without considering generative AI's potential merits. These requirements might be inappropriate for generative AI because these technologies are newly developed, rapidly evolving, and less familiar to those involved in the standardisation process than narrow AI approaches. LLMs and other foundation models benefit from being developed based on broad, non-curated datasets,  [85] [86] [87]  challenging the traditional so-called garbage in, garbage out concept  88, 89  associated with narrow AI approaches.\n\nDespite valid concerns about data quality, ethical sourcing, and model bias,  22, 90  new regulatory frameworks that will be applied to AI (including LLM-based health applications) should focus on clear requirements for performance, safety, and human rights protection, and on a transparent assessment of the performance of LLMbased health applications. However, the enforcement of overly stringent standards for quality and representativeness of training data could result in regulations being limited to approaches suited to the last wave of technological development. Such restriction would exclude access to emerging, but potentially superior, advanced AI technologies."

      "text": "Integrating LLMs into health care presents a situation with both advantages and drawbacks: LLMs have vast potential yet substantial, uncontrolled risks. Unsafe LLM-based health applications are already available on the market because current regulations have an unclear regulatory pathway without a legal basis. The existence of such apps highlights that existing regulations are not effectively enforced and serves as a measurement of the enforcement landscape, indicating future challenges for regulators regarding enforcement activities, required updates to regulatory frameworks, and the anticipated caseload of approval applications.\n\nOpinions differ among doctors and the public regarding the effectiveness and future appropriateness of LLM-based health applications for supporting medical decisions. 2,8,31,32 Some regulators have adopted a prohibitive stance, whereas others have provided advice that sets out constraints but hints at the possibilities of future approval.  31, 91 Despite the potential of these tools, regulatory oversight is needed. Due to their unique character, specific regulatory guidance could help establish how LLM-based health applications can be developed for legal market access, how their training sets should be designed, how they should be described to the public, and the limitations and warnings that should be provided to the public in their interfaces and alongside their advice.  31 New or updated frameworks should address the multipurpose capabilities of these applications and focus on clear requirements for performance, safety, and human rights protections, while avoiding what could prove to be outdated and overly stringent approaches to restrictive control of training data that could hinder LLM-based health applications from entering the market.\n\nHowever, until these applications can be used safely and legally in the medical field, existing regulations must be enforced to prevent the provision of dangerous and illegal products on the market. If regulators fear enforcing the regulations in a market dominated by supply or development by technology companies, the consequences of harm to laypersons will force belated action, damaging the potential of LLM-based health applications for medical advice. Both policy makers and regulators have a hard challenge in a world of rapidly evolving AI technologies. Without enforcement, regulation will not reach its goals of protecting patients,"
