  "title": "Impact of a telerehabilitation programme combined with continuous positive airway pressure on symptoms and cardiometabolic risk factors in obstructive sleep apnea patients",
  "abstract": "Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common sleep-breathing disorder associated with adverse health outcomes including excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired quality of life and is well-established as a cardiovascular risk factor. Continuous positive airway pressure is the reference treatment, but its cardiovascular and metabolic benefits are still debated. Combined interventions aiming at improving patient's lifestyle behaviours are recommended in guidelines management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome but adherence decreases over time and access to rehabilitation programmes is limited. Telerehabilitation is a promising approach to address these issues, but data are scarce on obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. \n Methods: The aim of this study is to assess the potential benefits of a telerehabilitation programme implemented at continuous positive airway pressure initiation, compared to continuous positive airway pressure alone and usual care, on symptoms and cardiometabolic risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This study is a 6-months multicentre randomized, parallel controlled trial during which 180 obese patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be included. We will use a sequential hierarchical criterion for major endpoints including sleepiness, quality of life, nocturnal systolic blood pressure and inflammation biological parameters. Discussion: m-Rehab obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the first multicentre randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a telerehabilitation lifestyle programme in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. We hypothesize that a telerehabilitation lifestyle intervention associated with continuous positive airway pressure for 6 months will be more efficient",

      "text": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome(OSAS) is one of the most frequent sleep disorder associated with many disabilities including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS),  1  impaired quality of life, 2 metabolic and cardiovascular complications.  3  There is a bidirectional relationship between OSAS and obesity. Obesity is the prominent risk factor for OSAS  4  and OSAS by itself can contribute to weight gain.  5 OSAS and obesity exert a synergistic deleterious effect on the cardiovascular system through various mechanisms including low-grade systemic inflammation.  6, 7 he first line treatment for OSAS is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which normalizes the apneahypopnea index (AHI), improves sleep quality, daytime sleepiness and quality of life.  8 The effect of CPAP on blood pressure (BP) is limited with an average decrease of 2-2.5 mmHg of 24-h systolic or diastolic BP.  9  Overall, the cardiovascular benefit of CPAP treatment in OSAS remains still debated since randomized controlled trials (RCT) failed to demonstrate a protective effect of CPAP in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.  10, 11 hese disappointing results could be partly explained by adherence to CPAP treatment which is often insufficient  12  while an average compliance greater than 4 h per night is necessary to achieve efficacy on BP  13  and for the reduction of some cardiovascular events.  14, 15 Telemonitoring and eHealth interventions could improve adherence to CPAP.  [16] [17] 7] [18]  The use of multimodal telemonitoring platforms at CPAP initiation improves sleepiness  19  and may enhance body weight reduction  20  without increasing the number of steps per day or decreasing the BP.  19, 20 ltogether, these data support the need for well-conducted lifestyle interventions combined to CPAP and supported by telemedicine for integrated care in OSA.\n\nThe improvement in cardiovascular health in OSAS should not be limited to target CPAP adherence  10  and the development of global strategies is necessary for the appropriate management of OSAS and associated comorbidities.  21 Exercise training reduces the severity of OSAS and improves daytime sleepiness  22, 23  while weight loss interventions improve BP, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and inflammation in obese patients with severe OSAS.  24, 25 he technological advances of recent years, particularly in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT) have brought new tools dedicated to the integrated management of chronic diseases. We previously demonstrated in an RCT that telerehabilitation (TR) in 50 obese patients was feasible, providing good patient satisfaction, and improved quality of life.  26 o the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the impact of a holistic TR intervention combining physical activity, nutrition and patient engagement and educational tools in a population suffering from OSAS and obesity. We, therefore, propose to demonstrate the impact of a TR solution combined with CPAP on sleepiness, quality of life, nocturnal systolic BP and inflammation biological markers.\n\nHerein, we describe the rationale and the design of the multicentre, parallel m-Rehab OSAS RCT trial."

A score of >10 defines the presence of EDS.  27 Changes between inclusion and 6 months between the two groups will be assess as well as the number of patients with a decrease in the score of \u22652 points. 2. Quality of life: FOSQ: This specific sleep questionnaire evaluates the effect of excessive sleep and daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living. The FOSQ contains 30 elements and is divided into 5 scales: Activity level, alertness, intimate and sexual relations, productivity general and social outcomes. A change of two or more points in the FOSQ score is considered to indicate clinically significant improvement in daily functioning.  28 . Nocturnal systolic BP: ABPM will be performed with MOBIL-O-GRAPH device, Germany. BP is measured every 15 min, daytime and every half hour at night. Each recording will be validated according to the following quality criteria: Size of the cuff adapted to the diameter of the arm, recording time of 24 h and including at least 48 valid measurements. In the event of nonvalidation, it will be proposed to the patient to redo. The following parameters will be collected: Systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean BP (in mmHg) and frequency heart rate (in beats per minute), over 24 h, day (8 am -11 pm), night (11 pm-7 am), in position sitting/ lying and standing during the activity period (10 am -8 pm). Additional measurement trains will be analysed. Night-time drops in systolic BP, diastolic BP and heart rate will be calculated. 4. Blood samples: Blood samples will be taken after an overnight fast on inclusion and during the final assessment. It includes hs-CRP (mg/L), creatinine (\u03bcmol/L), total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides (g/L and mmol/L), fasting blood sugar (g/L and mmol/L), glycosylated haemoglobin or HbAc1 (%), and insulinemia (mUI/L).\n\nThe determination of hs-CRP will be performed by immunoturbidimetry on a Roche Cobas 8000."

Comprehensive lifestyle interventions  25  are recommended in obese OSAS. Multimodal-telemonitoring could enhance weight loss  20  and reduce sleepiness  19  but is insufficient to increase the level of physical activity and reduce BP. Structured multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes  42, 43  might be maximized by new ICT tools to develop more widely available TR. TR has been studied in several chronic conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,  44  cardiac diseases  45  or obesity  26  but, to the best of our knowledge, our study called \"m-Rehab OSAS\" is the first trial to study TR in patients with combined OSAS and obesity. Interventions combining CPAP and TR programmes are promising approaches to improve prognosis and quality of life of obese OSAS but need to be rigorously evaluated in terms of feasibility and impact. In addition, addressing the problem of compliance to CPAP as soon as possible upon initiation is challenging for physicians due to lack of time, lack of patient knowledge on sleep disorders and management, and finally due to the predominance of initial barriers centred on technical aspects (maskleaks, noise, etc).  46, 47 ast but not least, the COVID pandemic has demonstrated the critical need for telemonitoring and remote programmes.  48 e feel our proposal, if demonstrated efficient, could provide a powerful tool in that context."

      "title": "A TR solution guided by care managers",
      "text": "We have designed a set of digital solutions including a website for professionals and patients and an application on a smartphone for patients. We called it \"m-Rehab\" to summarize the concept of \"mobile telerehabilitation\", in the same way as m-health or e-health: providing a rehabilitation course to patients via ICTs, allowing access to information to gain mobility anywhere, close to patient's living place. Our first experience in TR for obese patients, revealed the need for an individual human home care intervention to complete the programme.  26 Therefore, we have conceived a human-centred management by introducing remote coordination via a \"care manager.\"  49 Many organizational homecare services or telemonitoring interventions have been studied in chronic diseases,  50, 51  and case management seems to be effective on outcomes.  49 We believe that such a remote service in TR will play a facilitating role to develop individualized action plans for increasing physical activity levels, improving nutritional behaviours and CPAP adherence. Such an organization has the potential for solving problems or remove barriers allowing patients to adopt more favourable health behaviours. The m-Rehab 6-month programme includes several interventions aimed at reaching patient-oriented outcomes via a rehabilitation model: increase patient health education, particularly for sleep and nutritional disorders, promote regular physical activity, and improve nutritional behaviours. Feed-back from connected medical devices (connected watch, scale, tensiometer) or from the CPAP device, will only be here to help the patient track each of these dimensions and to think about what he/she can/wants to do. m-Rehab course is not conceived as a \"45-min 3 times per week exercise training program\" or an \"active weight loss diet program\". The m-Rehab digital solution and human care management aims to provide a behavioural and educative-oriented approach that can encourage the patient to engage beneficial health changes. A robust methodology for a multicentre study\n\nWe have designed a RCT with hierarchical multiple evaluation criterion, a reference method in therapeutics evaluation in human disease. The effects of a new, original intervention have to be evaluated by a basic comparison with the usual care in a given disease. In our model, the blind modality is not conceivable because of two main challenges. The first was to consider patient deception when randomized in the control usual care arm of the study. This could cause higher volunteer dropouts in the control group or encourage them to adopt an alternative digital solution of exercise training, for example. To avoid these risks, we will propose the use of the digital solution during 6 months at the end of the 6-month control period, shortly after the randomization process. Second, is the lack of blindness in such a study design which could represent a bias in the evaluation procedures. To avoid this, the questionnaires used in the present study will only be self-administered for both groups via an online platform (MHLink) that is different from the TR digital solution. In addition, several primary outcomes of the study will be independent of the operator (24-h ABPM, hs-CRP dosage), therefore not based on any operator or patient influence. Finally, we have chosen a hierarchical testing strategy  52  based on 4 different dimensions including sleepiness, quality of life, BP and biological markers of lowgrade inflammation. It is quite challenging to reach statistical significance in this type of interventional TR trial. However, we believe that to be convincing TR should take into account the multiple dimensions of TR in chronic disease."

      "text": "With the explosion of the obesity epidemic in industrialized countries, the prevalence of OSAS has increased in recent years.\n\nThe benefits of CPAP are limited by poor adherence and limited effects on cardiovascular risk, making the development of a combination between CPAP and lifestyle interventions mandatory. The m-Rehab OSAS study is a rigorously designed multicentre RCT evaluating the effects of a multidimensional TR programme aimed at engaging patients with obesity and severe OSAS in a physically active lifestyle, and healthy diet behaviours, using an original and human-centred digital solution. The potential success of this programme will open a new area in patient daily and holistic care.
