      "text": "Anxiety disorders have been increasing among 18-to 25-year-old individuals more rapidly than in any other adult age range, with recent past-month prevalence estimates reaching 15%.  1, 2 A US Surgeon General advisory  3  emphasizes that although the rate of change accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatric diagnoses among young people were already increasing before the pandemic.\n\nAnxiety disorders are associated with poor quality of life, difficulty working, disruption in social relationships and academic achievement, and financial burden.  [4] [5] 6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  These disorders can be treated effectively by psychotherapeutic interventions, and a majority of patients, particularly young adults, express a preference for psychotherapy over psychotropic medication.  11 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered a gold standard for treatment of anxiety  12  on the basis of abundant evidence of efficacy.  13, 14 However, despite the existence of efficacious interventions, more than 25% of young adults perceive an unmet need for mental health treatment,  15, 16  in part because of challenges in accessing such treatment. Reluctance to discuss mental health problems, financial constraints, geographic distance from mental health services, and limited clinician training in CBT approaches all represent barriers to accessing care.  3, [16] [17] [18]  Digital interventions, such as smartphone applications, allow treatment at home, are more affordable than paying for ongoing traditional mental health care, and do not rely on the ability to access a trained, local therapist. The increased prevalence of anxiety has not been met by an increased supply of mental health professionals, and digital access to evidence-based, self-guided CBT represents a scalable alternative. Self-guided CBT apps have demonstrated efficacy in adults with depression,  [19] [20] [21]  but few studies have investigated their efficacy in individuals with anxiety disorders.  22, 23 lf-guided mental health apps have been stymied by 2 limitations. First, most self-guided apps provide an incomplete representation of the psychotherapies on which they are based. In particular, they do not emphasize behavioral strategies (eg, exposure to anxiety-provoking situations),  24, 25  a key therapeutic component of interventions for anxiety.  26, 27 Second, low user engagement diminishes their potential impact.  28, 29 Engagement may be improved by involving social support in the intervention  29  or by incorporating behavioral economics and gamification.  30, 31 e Maya app is a digital CBT intervention targeting anxiety in young adults that addresses the limitations of existing apps. The app teaches a comprehensive array of CBT skills that target common features of anxiety, with a focus on behavioral skills often omitted from other apps. The app uses a visually appealing user interface and incorporates engagement strategies drawn from behavioral economics.  [30] [31] 1] [32] [33] [34]  Material is presented in an interactive format to encourage active participation, which leads to better learning and greater engagement than passive viewing of information.  35 In addition to these features, the app can be used in conjunction with a text-based, gamified incentive system to further encourage engagement."

      "text": "Mobile App-Based Intervention for Young Adults With Anxiety Disorders The primary aim of the current study was to compare the effects of 3 incentive strategies on the efficacy of the app in improving anxiety in adults aged 18 to 25 years with anxiety disorders. Given the powerful impact of social feedback in adolescence and early adulthood,  [36] [37] [38]  our primary hypothesis was that anxiety would decrease more for participants incentivized by receipt of reward points combined with social support than for participants incentivized by either gain or loss of reward points alone.  29, 39, 40 The secondary aims of the study were to evaluate engagement and selfreported satisfaction with the app and to compare these results among the incentive conditions."

      "text": "This randomized clinical trial examined improvement of anxiety during the intervention accompanied by 1 of 3 incentive conditions to promote engagement. In the absence of sufficient preliminary data to support a formal power calculation, an intended sample size of 120 was determined based on prior investigations of similar design (ie, randomized clinical trials of self-guided smartphone app interventions for anxiety or depression).  22, [41] [42] 2] [43]  However, the full sample was not recruited due to disruption of research procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were individuals aged 18 to 25 years with anxiety disorders, who were assigned to use the app for 6 weeks and were randomized to a loss-framed, gain-framed, or gain-social support incentivization. Anxiety was assessed at baseline, week 3 (midpoint), week 6 (end of intervention), and week 12 (follow-up).\n\nChange in anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A]  44  ) at week 6 (end of intervention) was the primary end point. Approval for the trial protocol (Supplement 1) was obtained from the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Review Board before study initiation. Written consent was obtained remotely using an electronic version of the informed consent form that followed federal, state, and local regulations, as applicable. This report follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline for randomized clinical trials."

Eligible participants had a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis, determined by a score of 4 or higher on the clinical severity rating of the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5)  45  and were fluent in English. Race and ethnicity were self-reported by participants from categories defined by investigators to provide information about the representativeness of the sample. Participants were excluded if they were already participating in CBT, had changed psychotropic medication dosage in the past 12 weeks, or endorsed suicidal ideation with intent and/or plan (Figure  1 )."

The current publicly available version of the app includes the same core skills as the version used for the current study but includes language with a greater focus on wellness and resilience, has fewer required exercises, and allows for greater user choice of activities. Participants were assigned to complete 12 sessions of the intervention during 6 weeks (2 sessions per week).\n\nModules included psychoeducational videos and quizzes, cognitive restructuring exercises, exposure exercises, mindfulness, and additional CBT skills (eFigure in Supplement 2).

Participants received virtual \"medals\" (bronze, silver, gold, or platinum) for obtaining specified levels of points. If a participant in the gain-social support condition declined to designate a friend or family member, a research assistant not involved in collection of study data was designated as the social support person. The content and format of the app sessions did not differ among the incentive conditions. Incentives were delivered separately from the app via text messages sent through Way to Health, 46 a research platform developed by the University of Pennsylvania Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics. 47-49 Text messages included reminders, gamification incentives (points and badges), and, where relevant, updates to the social support person with suggested messages of support (eg, \"[Participant] has completed the third week of the program! Let me tell you about some achievements. [Participant] earned 1800 points for completing sessions on time. Encourage [Participant] to keep this up.\")."

Outcome measures and qualitative feedback questionnaires about the app were collected at weeks 3 (midpoint), 6 (end of intervention), and 12 (follow-up).

To evaluate the effect of the intervention on primary (HAM-A) and secondary (ASI and LSAS) measures of anxiety, we used linear mixed-effects models with subject intercept as a random effect. All participants with baseline data were included following an intent-to-treat approach. Linear mixed-effects models used the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method, which accounts for missing values without removing entire participants from the analysis. We tested the main effect of time (baseline [week 0], midpoint [week 3], end point [week 6], and follow-up [week 12]) as a fixed effect, incentive condition (gain-social support, gain-framed, and loss-framed) as a fixed effect, and a time \u00d7 incentive condition interaction.\n\nTo compare participant engagement (sessions completed) among the incentive conditions, because of the imbalance in sample size across conditions, we used a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. To evaluate participant satisfaction with the intervention, we computed a linear mixed-effects model with a random effect of participants, fixed effects of time (week 1, midpoint, end point, and follow-up) and incentive condition (gain-social support, gain-framed, and loss-framed), a time \u00d7 incentive condition interaction, and the total uMARS App Quality score as the outcome. For descriptive purposes, we calculated the percentage of the sample who rated the app quality as a 4 or greater on the uMARS, based on the published threshold for app satisfaction.\n\nPost hoc 2-tailed, paired t test analyses of change in assessment scores from baseline to midpoint, end point, and follow-up used the Holm method to correct for multiple comparisons.\n\nEffect sizes are reported in terms of Cohen d, in which d = 0.2 represents a small effect, d = 0.5 represents a medium effect, and d = 0.8 represents a large effect.  56 A P value threshold of .05 was used to determine significance.

      "text": "Contrary to our primary hypothesis, we did not find evidence of a difference in efficacy among the 3 incentive conditions. However, after 6 weeks of use of the app, there was a clinically and statistically significant decrease in anxiety symptoms across conditions. This decrease in anxiety persisted at the week 12 follow-up. Study retention, app engagement, and participant satisfaction with the app were high across incentive conditions and did not differ by condition. All but 1 participant remained in the study during the intervention period, and a majority completed all intervention sessions. At least 68% of participants assigned a mean app quality rating greater than 4 of 5 at each time point.\n\nThe small size of comparator groups may have limited our ability to detect group differences by incentive condition. The absence of a group difference may also reflect a ceiling effect on the engagement and efficacy of the app. In addition to the incentive strategies used in conjunction with the app, the app itself includes numerous features intended to enhance both engagement and 20 15 10 5 0 HAM-A total score Overall anxiety (HAM-A) A Baseline Week 3 Week 6 Week 12 40 30 20 10 0 ASI total score Anxiety sensitivity (ASI) B Baseline Week 3 Week 6 Week 12 80 60 40 20 0 LSAS total score Social anxiety (LSAS) C Baseline Week 3 Week 6 Week 12 20 15 10 5 0 HAM-D total score Depression (HAM-D) D Baseline Week 3 Week 6 Week 12 Loss framed Gain framed Social support Error bars represent SEs.

Moreover, all 3 incentive conditions involved either a gain-framed or a loss-framed component, both of which are efficacious in changing health-related behaviors.  40 fect sizes of the decrease in anxiety across conditions were moderate to large, suggesting a clinically significant association between use of the intervention and improvement of anxiety that was greater than those typically observed in digital mental health interventions  31, 57, 58  and on par with pharmacologic trials.  [59] [60] 0] [61]  Secondary analyses indicated that anxiety remained lower than baseline at a week 12 follow-up assessment (6 weeks after the end of the intervention) and did not differ between the end of the intervention and follow-up, suggesting potential persistence of benefit. This finding is consistent with prior work that found sustained effects of traditional therapist-led CBT after treatment termination.  62, 63 milar to overall anxiety, both anxiety sensitivity (fear of fear) and social anxiety decreased from baseline to the end of the intervention, and improvement persisted at follow-up. Our findings suggest that, as intended, the intervention may target specific anxiety symptom clusters in addition to overall anxiety. It remains to be determined whether individuals with clinical profiles characterized by anxiety sensitivity, social anxiety, or other symptoms would respond equally well to a more streamlined app that includes only the most relevant modules.\n\nWe measured high levels of engagement and participant satisfaction with the app across incentive conditions, supporting the feasibility of the app for young adults with anxiety. There was a 98% retention rate compared with the 50% retention reported for other randomized clinical trials of mental health apps, 64 and 64% of participants completed all required sessions compared with the 35% reported in the literature.  65 The app could be scaled up for wider use because it does not require significant financial resources on the part of the user or a clinician. It is free to download and uses incentive systems based on points rather than monetary incentives. Additional discussion points are given in the eDiscussion in Supplement 2."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study had several limitations. Because the full sample could not be recruited as intended and we did not use block randomization, participants were not allocated evenly to the 3 incentive groups.\n\nThe unbalanced allocation and reduced sample size decrease our capacity to detect group differences.  66 Another limitation was the absence of a control condition in which participants did not receive the app or received the app alone without additional incentives. We elected not to include such a control group to allow for the inclusion of 3 incentive conditions within the constraints of the available resources. However, this study design does not allow us to estimate the extent to which symptom changes reflect regression to the mean or placebo-like effects. That said, although untreated individuals show spontaneous improvement of anxiety, the effect size of this improvement is typically small.  67 It is therefore unlikely that the moderate to large reductions of anxiety observed in the current study were spurious. Finally, the sample was predominantly female, college educated, and of Asian or White race and non-Hispanic ethnicity, limiting conclusions about generalizability to more diverse groups."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of a comprehensive, scalable, selfguided mobile CBT intervention for young adults with anxiety, which did not differ significantly by incentive condition. The Maya app includes design features, an engaging user interface, and broad coverage of CBT techniques that address the limitations of existing digital mental health apps. In the context of a mental health crisis in young adults and numerous barriers to traditional mental health services, digital interventions represent a promising step toward wider dissemination of high-quality, evidence-based interventions. Such interventions have the potential to help with shortages of mental health professionals and long wait times and to address geographic and socioeconomic disparities in access to care. Treatment programs that incorporate apps may be a viable strategy to address the persistent lack of access to adequate mental health care 3 that exists even in resourcerich settings. 64.
