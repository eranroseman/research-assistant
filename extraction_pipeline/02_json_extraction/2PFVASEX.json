      "title": "4.1.. Data privacy and security",
      "text": "Federated learning is an emerging research topic that addresses the challenges of preserving data privacy and security in the context of machine learning, including AI chatbots. It allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their raw data. Instead, the model is trained locally on each participant's device or server using their respective data, and only the updated model parameters are shared with a central server or coordinator.\n\nThe concept of federated learning has gained attention due to its potential to overcome privacy concerns associated with sharing sensitive healthcare data  (13) . With federated learning, healthcare organizations, researchers, and other stakeholders can collectively develop robust machine learning models while keeping patient data decentralized and secure.\n\nOne notable algorithm in the field of federated learning is the Hybrid Federated Dual Coordinate Ascent (HyFDCA), proposed in 2022  (14) . HyFDCA focuses on solving convex optimization problems within the hybrid federated learning setting. It employs a primal-dual setting, where privacy measures are implemented to ensure the confidentiality of client data. By using HyFDCA, participants in federated learning settings can collaboratively optimize a common objective function while protecting the privacy and security of their local data. This algorithm introduces privacy steps to guarantee that client data remains private and confidential throughout the federated learning process.\n\nAs federated learning continues to evolve, researchers and practitioners are actively exploring various techniques and algorithms to address the complexities of healthcare data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance  (15) . These efforts aim to strike a balance between leveraging the power of AI chatbots for improved healthcare outcomes while safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive patient information."

      "title": "4.2.. Algorithm bias and fairness",
      "text": "As AI chatbots increasingly permeate healthcare, they bring to light critical concerns about algorithmic bias and fairness  (16) . AI, particularly Machine Learning, fundamentally learns patterns from the data they are trained on Goodfellow et al.  (17) . If the training data lacks diversity or contains inherent bias, the resultant chatbot models may mirror these biases  (18) . Such a scenario can potentially amplify healthcare disparities, as it may lead to certain demographics being underserved or wrongly diagnosed  (19) .\n\nGiven the potential for adverse outcomes, it becomes imperative to ensure that the development and deployment of AI chatbot models in healthcare adhere to principles of fairness and equity  (16) . Achieving this can promote equitable healthcare access and outcomes for all population groups, regardless of their demographic characteristics  (20) .\n\nNonetheless, the problem of algorithmic bias is not solely restricted to the nature of the training data. Several other factors can introduce and perpetuate bias in AI chatbot models. One of  these is biased feature selection, where selecting features used to train the model can lead to biased outcomes, particularly if these features with sensitive attributes such as race or gender  (21) . Another factor is the distribution of classes in the training data. If certain classes are overrepresented or underrepresented, the resultant chatbot model may be skewed towards predicting the overrepresented classes, thereby leading to unfair outcomes for the underrepresented classes  (22) .\n\nMoreover, model overfitting, where a model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to unseen data, can also exacerbate bias  (21) . This is particularly concerning in healthcare, where the chatbot's predictions may influence critical decisions such as diagnosis or treatment  (23) .\n\nConsequently, addressing the issue of bias and ensuring fairness in healthcare AI chatbots necessitates a comprehensive approach. This includes being cognizant of the potential for bias in the data and the model development process, as well as actively implementing strategies to mitigate such bias  (24) . Furthermore, ongoing monitoring of deployed chatbot models is also required to detect and correct any emergent bias. Only through such multi-faceted efforts can we hope to leverage the potential of AI chatbots in healthcare while ensuring that their benefits are equitably distributed  (16) ."

      "title": "4.3.. Explainability and trust",
      "text": "In the realm of AI-driven communication, a fundamental challenge revolves around elucidating the models' decisionmaking processes, a challenge often denoted as the \"black box\" problem  (25) . The complex nature of these systems frequently shrouds the rationale behind their decisions, presenting a substantial barrier to cultivating trust in their application.\n\nThe AI community has made commendable progress in confronting these challenges. Explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a pivotal approach to unravel the intricacies of AI models, enhancing not only their performance but also furnishing users with insights into the reasoning behind their outputs  (26) . Techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)  (27)  and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)  (28)  have played a crucial role in illuminating the decision-making processes, thereby rendering the \"black box\" more interpretable.\n\nTrust AI assumes a critical role in navigating complexities, particularly in AI-powered chatbots. Serving as a link between theoretical analytical expressions and the numerical models derived through Machine Learning, Trust AI addresses the challenge of explainability. The nuanced nature of humanmachine interactions demands a delicate balance between analytical rigor and user-friendly outcomes. A recent study adopted a user's mental model  (29) . However, there is still a long way to go in enhancing Trust AI. We need the multifaceted Trust AI approach to augment transparency and interpretability, fostering trust in AI-driven communication systems.\n\nThe challenge of explainability in AI-powered communication intertwines with establishing trust, amplified in dynamic chatbot interactions. Advances in XAI methodologies, ethical frameworks, and interpretable models represent indispensable strides in demystifying the \"black box\" within chatbot systems. Ongoing efforts are paramount to instill confidence in AI-driven communication, especially involving chatbots."
