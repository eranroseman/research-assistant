  "title": "Feasible but Not Yet Efficacious: A Scoping Review of Wearable Activity Monitors in Interventions Targeting Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Sleep",
  "abstract": "Purpose of Review-The present review aimed to explore the range and characteristics of interventions that utilize WAM and descriptively summarize the efficacy of these interventions. Recent Findings-A total of 65 articles (61 studies) were included in this review. Most of the WAM-based interventions (n=58) were designed to improve physical activity (PA). Interventions targeting sedentary behavior (SB) were much less common (n=12), and even less frequent were WAM-based sleep interventions (n=3). Most studies tested the feasibility of WAM-based interventions; hence, efficacy of these interventions in improving PA, SB, and/or sleep could not be conclusively determined. Nonetheless, WAM-based interventions showed considerable potential in increasing PA and decreasing SB. Summary-WAM-based PA interventions exhibited preliminary efficacy in increasing PA. Although not as many interventions were focused on SB, current interventions also showed potential in decreasing sedentary time. Meanwhile, more evidence is needed to determine the utility of WAM in improving sleep. Major challenges with including WAM as part of interventions are reduced engagement in using the devices over time and the rapid changes in technology resulting in devices becoming obsolete soon after completion of an efficacy trial.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The market for wearable activity monitors (WAM), devices worn to track physical activity (PA), sleep, and other movement-based behaviors  [1] , has seen exponential growth over recent years. According to the International Data Corporation, 34.2 million units were sold during the second quarter of 2019 alone  [2] . Similarly, a nationwide survey of US adults reported that 12.5% of its respondents were current users of WAM  [3] . Advances in sensor technology and improvements in the algorithms used to analyze sensor data have made WAM more accurate  [4] . The popularity of these wearable devices, coupled with their increasing capabilities, lend themselves well to clinical research.\n\nSeveral systematic reviews have examined the validity and reliability of WAM in terms of measuring PA and sleep  [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] . Overall, WAM were accurate and reliable at counting steps and measuring activity duration  [1, 5, 6] . In terms of sleep, WAM were highly correlated with polysomnography in measuring total sleep time  [7] . In addition to validation studies, feasibility studies have shown that WAM were generally well-accepted by the intended users  [9, 10] .\n\nGiven the improvements in the validity and reliability of WAM and their acceptability across a wide range of users, it is not surprising that the use of WAM in clinical trials is increasing  [1] . However, the majority of these studies utilized WAM as a more convenient and costeffective alternative to research-grade instruments to collect data  [4] . The effect of WAM as the intervention or as a supplement to the intervention are largely unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to examine the effect of WAM as the main intervention or as a supplement to the intervention on PA, sedentary behavior (SB), and/or sleep. Specifically, this review (1) explores the range (e.g., study population, target condition) and characteristics of interventions that utilized WAM, and (2) descriptively summarizes the preliminary efficacy of these interventions."

      "title": "Intervention Characteristics",
      "text": "Table  2  summarizes the various intervention strategies used in the reviewed studies. All but one study intervention  [25]  used at least two behavioral strategies, with self-monitoring being the most commonly used strategy (n=60). Self-monitoring was implemented using the WAM's display (if available) and/or the WAM's companion app or website. Two studies had a website specially designed for participants to monitor their activity and receive feedback  [25, 26] . Similarly, 2 studies developed an app for self-monitoring and delivering feedback  [27, 28]  and one study provided participants with paper exercise diaries in addition to the WAM's companion app  [29] . Only one study did not provide their participants access to the WAM's companion app or website to prevent any potential confounding with the intervention  [17, 30] .\n\nOther commonly used intervention strategies were goal setting (n=54), providing education and/or health coaching (n=41), giving rewards/incentives (n=20), and providing social support. Goals were classified as adaptive (personalized to the participant's current level and/or adjusted to the participant's change in level over time) or static (unchanging, e.g. 10,000 steps/day). Only rewards that were meant to encourage the participants to meet PA/SB/sleep goals were considered. Process incentives (e.g., incentives given for completing the assessments, study completion incentives) were not considered. The majority of the interventions used gain-framed incentives, which is providing the reward after specific goals are achieved (n=18). Conversely, the loss-framed approach was only used in two interventions  [31, 32] . Social support was provided in the form of encouraging feedback, motivational messages, and identification of barriers and solutions provided by a study team member through email (n=3), text messages (n=8), phone (n=7), and/or in person (n=1). Some interventions also used social support from an in-person (n=8) or online (n=9) community/partner. Another source of social motivation was provided in the form of friendly within-group competition. Interventions that utilized the principles of gamification mainly used the motivational potential of competition to bring about the desired behavioral change  [31, [33] [34] [35] [36] ."

Additionally, only objectively-measured findings were abstracted except in a few studies (n=4) that measured their outcomes using only self-report measures  [37] [38] [39] [40] . Among the studies that used objective instruments, 27 used a different accelerometer (research-grade) from the one used in the intervention. A common strategy among studies that used the same WAM to measure their outcomes was to blind the participants during the baseline measurement (i.e., masking the display or not giving the participants access to their WAM accounts)."

      "text": "Steps.: Out of the 44 studies with interventions that targeted step counts, 31 involved a control group and 13 did not include one. Of the studies with a control group, 25 resulted in a greater increase in steps (14 of which had a statistically significant difference at a p-value of < .05) when compared to the control condition(s). However, 3 studies reported decreased steps at post-intervention-2 in which the pre-to post-intervention decrease in steps was less for the intervention group (p\u2265.05)  [12, 41]  and one in which the intervention group decreased steps while the control group increased steps (p<.05)  [42] . Among the studies with a control group, 3 compared only the post-intervention step counts with the intervention groups showing greater step counts compared to the control groups (one of which had a statistically difference at a p-value of < .05). Among the studies without a control group, 9 reported increased steps (4 of which had statistically significant difference at a p-value of < .05) and 3 reported a non-significant decrease in steps  [43] [44] [45] . Lastly, one study that did not have a control group performed a sub-group analysis, wherein the step counts for those who self-selected their group versus those who were assigned to a group were compared  [19] . Those who self-selected their group had significantly greater step counts compared to those who were assigned to a group (p< .05) [19] .\n\nModerate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time.: Twenty-three interventions targeted time spent in MVPA; 16 of these 23 interventions included a control group. Of the studies with a control group, 13 resulted in a greater increase in MVPA time in at least one of the intervention groups compared to the control group (9 of which had statistically significant difference at a p-value of < .05). One study reported a non-statistically significant greater increase in MVPA time in the control group compared to the intervention group  [46] . However, 2 studies reported decreased MVPA time at post-intervention-one in which the pre-to post-intervention decrease in MVPA time was less for the intervention group (p\u2265.05)  [28]  and one in which the decrease was greater for the intervention group (p\u2265.05)  [12] . Among the 7 studies that did not have a control group, 5 reported an increase in MVPA time at post-intervention (one of which had statistically significant increase at a p-value of < .05 [47] ) and 2 showed a non-significant decrease in MVPA time  [45, 48] .\n\nTotal PA time.: Eleven interventions targeted time spent in PA; 8 of these 11 interventions included a control group. Of the 8 studies with a control group, 7 resulted in a greater increase in total PA time in the intervention group compared to the control group (5 of which had statistically significant difference at a p-value of < .05). On the other hand, one study reported a non-significant decrease in total PA time for the intervention group relative to control  [42] . Among the 3 studies without a control group, one reported a significant increase in total PA time  [23] , another had a non-significant increase [49], and one reported a non-significant decrease in total PA time  [50] ."

      "text": "The overwhelming majority of the WAM-based interventions focused on increasing PA, which was commonly operationalized using step count, MVPA time, and/or total PA time. Interventions designed to decrease SB were much less common, and even less frequent were interventions designed to improve sleep. Of the 44 studies that targeted step count, 18 resulted in statistically significant increases in steps post-intervention. Of the 23 studies that targeted MVPA time, 10 saw statistically significant increases in MVPA time postintervention. Similarly, 6 of the 11 studies that targeted total PA time resulted in significant increases in total PA time. Among the studies that targeted sedentary behavior, 2 of 12 studies resulted in significant decreases in sedentary time and 1 of 2 studies resulted in a significant decrease in sitting time. Among the studies that focused on sleep, 1 of 3 resulted in a significant increase in sleep duration; however, none of the studies significantly improved sleep efficiency. It should be noted that most of the studies examined the feasibility of WAM-based interventions and/or explored its preliminary efficacy; hence, the efficacy of the WAM-based interventions could not be conclusively determined. Nonetheless, WAM-based interventions exhibited considerable potential in increasing PA and decreasing SB across a diverse range of populations. This is especially true for multicomponent interventions that incorporated behavior change strategies, not only to encourage adoption of the desired behavior, but also to increase adherence to the intervention.\n\nA quantitative synthesis of device adherence could not be performed due to the heterogenous metrics used to determine device adherence. However, what was apparent is that a number of studies had issues with device adherence. Unfortunately, participants discontinued use of the WAM quite often, typically after a few months when the novelty of the WAM dissipated  [57] . Novelty effect-defined as the individual's initial response to the technology rather than the pattern of use over time when habituation settles in [57]-was observed in several of the studies. After observing a significant initial increase in physical activity, a steady decline was noted in several studies. To minimize the potential bias from the novelty effect, one study included a run-in week to allow the participants to become accustomed to the WAM, and then excluded data collected during that week  [31] . While this brief period provided a time to become comfortable with the device, it is not clear that one week is sufficient to remove the novelty effect. Further study needs to be done to examine what strategies can be implemented to provide more sustained use and engagement of these consumer friendly WAM. A recent editorial reported on this dilemma and suggested a novel approach to address this recurring issue  [58] .\n\nAnother common issue faced in the WAM-based interventions was the rapid turnover of the direct-to-consumer WAM. Since most of the WAM included in this review have already been discontinued, it is apparent that traditional research designs cannot keep up with the typical WAM lifecycle. This calls for more innovative designs and shorter study cycles to establish any efficacy of the WAM  [59, 60] .\n\nWhile this scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, it is not without limitations. First, the electronic search was limited to three databases, which could have introduced selection bias risk. To minimize this risk, a manual search was conducted to complement the electronic search and the electronic search strategy was formulated with the assistance of an experienced reference librarian. Additionally, critical appraisal of the risk of bias in the included studies was not undertaken. While optional for scoping reviews, formal assessment of bias increases the rigor of scoping reviews. However, there are also strengths to our review. First, we included studies that targeted very diverse population groups across the age span and range of disease or health conditions, and we reviewed studies that tested an array of wearable devices.\n\nIn conclusion, the efficacy of WAM-based interventions still needs to be established using rigorous study designs and adequate sample sizes. Further, WAM-based interventions targeting sleep are limited compared to interventions designed to improve PA and/or address SB. Nonetheless, based on the included studies, WAM-based interventions are feasible and acceptable for various populations, and show promising potential in increasing PA and reducing SB. 48.
