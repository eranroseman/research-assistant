  "title": "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Gamification on Physical Activity: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials",
  "abstract": "Background: Gamification refers to the use of game elements in nongame contexts. The use of gamification to change behaviors and promote physical activity (PA) is a promising avenue for tackling the global physical inactivity pandemic and the current prevalence of chronic diseases. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of gamified interventions with the existence of mixed results in the literature. \n Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamified interventions and their health care potential by testing the generalizability and sustainability of their influence on PA and sedentary behavior. Methods: A total of 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for randomized controlled trials published in English from 2010 to 2020. Eligibility criteria were based on the components of the participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes framework. Studies were included when they used gamified interventions in daily life with an active or inactive control group and when they assessed a PA or sedentary behavior outcome. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model approach. Sensitivity analyses, influence analyses, and publication bias analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our results. \n Results: The main meta-analysis performed on 16 studies and 2407 participants revealed a small to medium summary effect of gamified interventions on PA behavior (Hedges g=0.42, 95% CI 0.14-0.69). No statistical difference among different subgroups (adults vs adolescents and healthy participants vs adults with chronic diseases) and no interaction effects with moderators such as age, gender, or BMI were found, suggesting good generalizability of gamified interventions to different user populations. The effect was statistically significant when gamified interventions were compared with inactive control groups, such as waiting lists (Hedges g=0.58, 95% CI 0.08-1.07), and active control groups that included a nongamified PA intervention (Hedges g=0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.41). This suggests that gamified interventions are not only efficient in changing behavior but also more effective compared with other behavioral interventions. The long-term effect (measured with follow-up averaging 14 weeks after the end of the intervention) was weaker, with a very small to small effect (Hedges g=0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.23). \n Conclusions: This meta-analysis confirms that gamified interventions are promising for promoting PA in various populations. Additional analyses revealed that this effect persists after the follow-up period, suggesting that it is not just a novelty effect caused by the playful nature of gamification, and that gamified products appear effective compared with equivalent nongamified PA interventions. Future rigorous trials are required to confirm these findings.",

      "text": "Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior (SB) are among the leading risk factors for global mortality  [1] . Each year, physical inactivity is responsible for >5 million deaths worldwide  [2] . In contrast, regular physical activity (PA) prevents the risk of developing chronic diseases  [3, 4] , limits their progression  [5, 6] , and reduces early mortality  [7] . In parallel, there is a dose-response relationship between total sedentary time per day and overall mortality  [7] . Meta-analyses demonstrate that the risk of mortality in adults increases steadily with a sedentary lifestyle of >3 hours per day and more significantly when this time exceeds 7 hours per day  [8] . However, recent studies have suggested that high levels of PA could attenuate or even eliminate the deleterious effects of SB on overall mortality  [9] .\n\nIn this context, it is urgent to develop interventions that can effectively change PA. Therefore, digital health interventions constitute a new opportunity to take care of patients by involving them in their treatment in a dynamic and interactive way. Gamification is a promising avenue to capitalize on the efficacy of digital interventions. Gamification is defined as the use of game design elements in nongame contexts  [10] . By integrating game mechanisms in interventions that are initially devoid of them, the purpose of gamification is to integrate into daily life the ingredients that make games enjoyable to motivate participants to engage in PA  [11] . The use of motivational affordances created by gamification can influence psychological (eg, motivation, attitude, and enjoyment) and physical outcomes (eg, physical capacities)  [12]  and therefore appears as a potentially powerful technique for behavior change.\n\nBy gamifying PA, participants are encouraged to move and walk to play, which tends to make their activities more enjoyable and playful  [13] . Unlike serious games, which refer to the use of a full-fledged video game for educational or health purposes (ie, a video game in its entirety as opposed to selected elements or individual features of a game)  [10]  and require a dedicated time, a location, and implementation  [14] , gamification techniques are relatively open to varying situational modes of engagement  [10]  and concern instead global PA in all aspects of daily life (eg, walking, running, or gardening). Gamification is made possible by mobile technologies and wearable devices that can track and collect daily activities in a continuous and web-based manner. This allows for intervening directly on the lifestyle of individuals without adding material or time constraints for the participants. However, several literature reviews  [13, 15, 16]  have reported inconsistent results concerning the use of gamification in behavioral interventions, with some studies demonstrating positive effects and other studies providing more mixed effects. These reviews also emphasized the lack of high-quality studies and highlighted the need for more rigorous trials to isolate the impact of gamification (ie, randomized controlled trials  [RCTs] ). Importantly, Koivisto and Hamari  [15]  suggested that the effects of gamification could be smaller when using rigorous experimentation. In sum, these reviews indicate that there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of gamified interventions. Nevertheless, no meta-analysis has been conducted yet. Quantifying the effect size of gamified interventions and identifying moderators of this effect would provide important information about the effectiveness of such interventions. Moreover, a meta-analysis appears as timely, as there are now enough RCTs to conduct such an analysis."

      "text": "This study is the first to quantify the effects of gamified interventions on PA. Beyond the effect during or just after the intervention, we also seek to evaluate the long-term effects to determine the health relevance of these interventions. Indeed, we reasoned that to be considered effective, gamification must sustain its impacts over the long term and offer more than a short-term novelty effect  [11] . The generalizability of gamification to different user populations is also a major issue because it would determine whether gamification can be introduced in health care settings with patients or it is more suited in prevention for healthy audiences.\n\nThe objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to answer these research gaps by  (1)  evaluating the effect of gamified interventions on PA and SB, (2) assessing the long-term or sustained effects of gamified programs, and (3) evaluating the generalizability of gamification across different populations."

These outcomes were continuous data either objectively measured (through accelerometers, pedometers, and smartphones) or subjectively measured by self-reported questionnaires. Data measured objectively were always prioritized in the analyses over self-reported questionnaires, which are more susceptible to bias with a potential overestimation of PA  [37] .\n\nIn addition, studies were excluded if they came from a review, commentary, or conference abstract; if they included data previously published in another study; if they were not randomized and controlled; if they were not written in English; and if they were published before 2010."

A judgment of the potential risk of bias was made from the extracted information and rated as high risk, low risk, or unclear if the related information was not available. These evaluations of bias are reported in the review and included in the analysis, and a measure of agreement with the \u03ba statistic was calculated.\n\nAfter the full assessment, we decided not to present the item blinding of participants and personnel in the review because it was similar for all studies, which were rated as high risk, blinding being unfeasible for this kind of intervention."

      "title": "Data Synthesis and Statistical Analyses",
      "text": "First, data were synthesized in a qualitative review assessing the key elements of the studies and highlighting intervention differences. This qualitative review integrates all studies that met the eligibility criteria, including those for which we were unable to extract the data.\n\nFor the quantitative analysis, means and SDs of continuous PA or SB outcomes from individual studies were compiled when available or estimated using the method by Hozo et al  [39]  when median and IQR were reported. When the necessary data were not available in the original article, we first requested them from the authors. If data could not be obtained, we extracted them from the graphs when available. If this was not possible, we excluded the study from the quantitative analysis.\n\nA global meta-analysis was conducted to obtain a summary effect. In addition, when sufficient data were available (ie, 4 studies or more reporting an outcome), we conducted different meta-analyses for each specific outcome (steps, MVPA, and time in SB) and for the follow-up effect. To address the nonindependence of data caused by study effect, random-effects models  [40]  were preferred to the usual statistical tests. In addition, the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method was used to reduce the production of false positives inherent to the DerSimonian-Laird method  [41]  and to obtain more robust estimates of variance. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using standardized mean difference (SMD) to account for different measurement instruments or mean difference (MD) when the measurements were close enough. We computed Hedges g  [42]  for effect sizes, which is similar to Cohen d but corrects for small sample bias, which are recurrent in the studies included. Thus, a Hedges g of 0.2 represents a small effect; 0.5, a moderate effect; and 0.8, a large effect  [43] . We computed SMDs for outcome scores after the intervention (presented in the review) and change-from-baseline outcomes. Scores on postintervention effect sizes refer to treatment group results compared with the control group results after interventions. Change-from-baseline score effect sizes were calculated as a comparison between the treatment group pre-post effect size and control group pre-post effect size.\n\nFor studies that included multiple outcomes, we kept in the main analysis the primary outcome targeted in the initial article.\n\nIf none of the PA outcomes reported by a study were the primary ones, we selected the one that was the most relevant from the perspective of the intervention and the original experiment. In designs with multiple time measurements, the assessment that was the most proximal to the end of the intervention was conserved. A time assessment had to be performed >2 weeks after the end of the intervention to be included in the follow-up analysis. When studies included multiple intervention groups with gamification features, they were combined into one group following the formulae recommended by the Cochrane Handbook  [38] . Studies including multiple control groups could be integrated into different subgroup analyses if they compared their gamified intervention to both an active and an inactive control group.\n\nStatistical heterogeneity was tested using forest plots and the I 2 statistic, which is the most common metric for measuring the magnitude of between-study heterogeneity and is easily interpretable (0%-40% might not be important, 30%-60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50%-90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, and 75%-100% may represent considerable heterogeneity)  [44] . We conducted different influential analyses to address between-study heterogeneity.\n\nWe first explored the presence of outliers, defined as studies with CIs that do not overlap with the CI of the summary effect.\n\nWe also performed leave-one-out analyses, which recalculated the summary effect several times, with 1 study omitted each time. Finally, we performed a Baujat plot  [45] , which is a diagnostic plot to detect sources of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis by comparing the contribution of each trial in the pooled effect with the overall Cochran Q test for heterogeneity.\n\nWe applied different methods to detect publication bias (funnel plot, Egger regression test  [46] , and Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill procedure  [47] ). In addition, another approach to determine the evidential value of studies included in the analysis is to check the statistical power of individual studies. Therefore, we performed a sunset funnel plot  [48] , which is a funnel plot variant that visualizes the statistical power of each study included in the meta-analysis based on the summary effect size.\n\nThus, sensitivity analyses were conducted to address studies with a high risk of bias or a strong heterogeneity in the sample or studies identified as outliers. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore possible sources of heterogeneity and test for population differences. Therefore, we conducted tests for subgroup differences using a random-effects model. In addition, moderation analyses were performed to explore the impact of potential explanatory variables and moderators on the effect size with meta-regressions when sufficient data were available (ie, at least 10 studies for each explanatory variable  [38] ). The results were expressed as regression coefficient estimates, 95% CIs, and P values.\n\nFor crossover trials, we first checked whether carry-over or period effects were problematic in the original texts of studies.\n\nFor cluster randomized trials, we checked if the influence of the different clusters was not too important, analyzing the values of the intraclass correlation coefficient in the studies. Then, in the absence of sufficient information in the published articles, we addressed these studies as traditional parallel trials. Nevertheless, this procedure increased the probability of a unit of analysis error. Therefore, we performed sensitivity analyses without clusters and crossover trials to test the robustness of our results.\n\nA summary of the analytical procedure is available in Multimedia Appendix 1 (Figure  S1 ). Analyses were performed on R (The R Project for Statistical Computing) using the dmetar package  [49] . Risk of bias summary and risk of bias graphs were made via the robvis R package  [50] ."

The \u03ba value of agreement for the screening phase was 0.64 between the 2 authors, reflecting good agreement  [53] . Table 1 provides an overview of the characteristics of the included studies. The 16 studies included in the quantitative analysis involved 2407 participants aged 9-73 years (mean 35.7 years, SD 17.2 years), with sample sizes ranging from 20 to 602. Overall, 67% (12/18) of studies included adult participants [22,24-30,32,34-36] and 33% (6/18) of studies included adolescents (ie, <18 years [21,23,31,33,51,52]). A total of 22% (4/18) of studies included patients with chronic diseases (ie, obesity [27,36], type 2 diabetes [35], and cardiovascular disease [28]). A total of 6 trials were conducted in Europe; 4 in the United States; 3 in Australia and New Zealand; 3 in Canada; and 2 in Asia. Studies were published between 2014 and 2020, with 39% (7/18) published after 2018. Most studies were based on a smartphone app (n=10; [23,28,30-35,51,52]), web-based (n=3; [21,24,29]), or both (n=4; [22,26,27,36]). Nishiwaki et al [25] used a pedometer with computerized game functions. The duration of the intervention varied from 1 to 24 weeks, with a mean of 11.8 weeks, and the most common length was 24 weeks. The most used game mechanics were internet-based rewards, such as badges, medals, or trophies (13/18, 72%; [21,22,24,26-28,30,32,33,35,36,51,52]), teams or leagues (13/18, 72%;  [21] [22] [23] [24] 26, 27, 29, [32] [33] [34] 36, 51, 52] ), levels (9/18, 50%;  [22, 26, 27, 29, 33, 35, 36, 51, 52] ), points or scores (7/18, 39%;  [22, 26, 27, 29, 30, 35, 36] ), or the presence of a leaderboard (7/18, 39%;  [22, 29, 30, 33, 34, 51, 52] ). Almost all studies included social incentives such as team collaboration, social networking, and messaging facilities in their intervention (15/18, 83%; all except Nishiwaki et al  [25] , Direito et al  [31] , and H\u00f6chsmann et al  [35] ).

This effect was small to medium, suggesting the effectiveness of gamified interventions in promoting PA in both healthy participants and participants with chronic diseases. This significant effect was robust, as it persisted even after the different influence analyses were performed. Moreover, the effect was statistically significant both for objective measures of PA (Hedges g=0.45, 95% CI 0.08-0.82) and self-reported measures (Hedges g=0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.39) after sensitivity analyses. Unsurprisingly, subgroup analyses revealed after sensitivity analyses that the effect of gamified interventions is greater when compared with inactive control groups (such as waiting lists) than when compared with active control groups benefiting from a nongamified intervention (Hedges g=0.58, 95% CI 0.08-1.07 vs Hedges g=0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.41). Nevertheless, these effects were both statistically significant. This suggests that gamified interventions are not only efficient in changing behavior but also, to a lesser extent, effective compared with equivalent nongamified PA interventions (such as smartphone apps or self-monitoring interventions). These results are important considering the assets of gamification, which has the advantages of (1) reorganizing existing activity rather than adding additional demands to people's lives  [13] , (2) being easily implemented in natural contexts, and (3) having a broad accessibility through technology and advancing sensors, permitting to address a large population."

These results indicate that the effect of gamification persists after the end of the program, suggesting that it is not just a novelty effect due to the playful nature of gamification. However, this long-term effect was weaker and decreased with time after the end of the intervention."

Nevertheless, if many PA interventions increase PA levels in the short term, translating these temporary changes into long-term PA participation continues to be a challenge for PA research  [59] . With that in mind, the potential of gamification for PA increases in the long term, even minimal, is particularly important and promising in the area of PA interventions."

      "title": "Effect of Gamification on the Step Count",
      "text": "If the overall effect of gamified interventions on PA is positive, they increase the step count more than MVPA. Indeed, after sensitivity analyses, on the one hand, the meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant effect (Hedges g=0.49, 95% CI 0.05-0.93) of gamification for steps outcomes, with a statistically significant improvement of 1609.56 steps per day (95% CI 372.39-2846.73) for participants benefiting from gamified intervention versus those in the control group. On the other hand, no statistically significant effect of gamified interventions on MVPA was found (Hedges g=0.31, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.80). This can be explained by the game metrics and mechanics of the interventions included in the review, which are mainly focused on the step count of participants. Few interventions directly targeted MVPA. In the included studies, only 2 interventions  [31, 35]  integrated multi-PA intensity goals and mechanics, notably with physical exercises or running sessions in the game. In other words, participants played most of the time with their number of steps and had to generally walk more to make points and play the game. This results in an increase in walking time but not necessarily in more intense PA.\n\nThese findings are interesting considering the potential health benefits of increasing the number of daily steps by 1600 because of gamification. Indeed, previous work showed that walking was statistically associated with decline in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality  [60] [61] [62] [63]  and an improvement in body composition  [64] . Moreover, Oja et al  [62]  suggested that any walking exposure is beneficial for cardiovascular health, endorsing the idea that the most important is more global PA regardless of the intensity  [7, 65]  even when this activity only includes walking  [60] . In comparison, a previous study evaluating the effectiveness of activity trackers with and without incentives to increase PA  [66]  showed a significant improvement of 1050 daily steps for the cash incentive intervention versus the control intervention (95% CI 600-1490) but no statistically significant difference for the Fitbit-only group (340 daily steps, 95% CI -100 to 790]). In light of these results, gamified interventions appear as an added value compared with current interventions. Considering that 40% of the volunteers in this study abandoned their Fitbit monitor within 6 months, gamification is also a way to keep participants involved and motivated within the intervention."

According to a previous meta-analysis that reported significant positive effects of smartphone apps on PA only when used over a short-term period of <3 months  [67] , these results suggest that a condensed intervention could benefit more than a longer one, which could become redundant, boring, and exhausting for participants in the long run."

This heterogeneity may be explained by differences in study quality, diversity of designs, and variations in study populations. Despite several subgroup analyses, we cannot rule out that these subgroups and characteristics may not explain all the variance of the interventions. Indeed, demographic data often do not fully explain the differences in the effectiveness of interventions  [68, 69] , and more precise sociopsychological variables such as personality traits or motivational factors could explain this poorly understood significant heterogeneity. Moreover, the risk of bias analysis and the sunset funnel plot showed substantial differences in the quality of the included studies that can influence the heterogeneity. Finally, various trial designs were used (ie, parallel RCT, cluster RCT, and crossover RCT) that can also contribute to the overall statistical heterogeneity."

      "text": "This meta-analysis is informative regarding the effectiveness of gamified interventions. In view of the observed heterogeneity, the next step will be to investigate its causes from an interventional and theoretical perspective. Gamified interventions involve multiple interacting elements, and it is crucial to estimate the weight of each element in the behavior change process and how they interact with each other. Is it game mechanics, the implementation of behavior change techniques, or the presence of social interactions that make gamification effective? Unfortunately, the small number of studies included in the meta-analysis impeded us from conducting in-depth moderation analyses to answer this question. To better understand these relations, it is essential that both the development and assessment of gamified interventions be central, transparent, evidence-based, context-aware, and research-oriented  [70] . Moreover, if theoretical psychological models are often mentioned in the introduction of articles included in the review (Table  1 ), few have investigated the psychological mechanisms of their interventions in the field  [22, 31, 71] . Future studies should explicitly discuss motivational theory and systematically test the effect of gamification on psychological outcomes known to be involved in behavior change (eg, self-efficacy, attitudes, and intention) to better understand its mechanisms. The consideration of personality traits and psychological variables to determine behavioral phenotypes  [68]  is a promising way to evaluate participant's responses to the interventions."

      "title": "Perspectives for Future Research and Implications for Practice",
      "text": "The findings from this meta-analysis allow us to draw and discuss future work concerning the gamification of PA and SB. First, future trials should be conducted with more adequately powered sample sizes and should be strictly multiple arms-RCTs to isolate the effects of gamification elements and better understand gamification mechanisms. Second, the long-term effects are currently the main challenge of health interventions. Thus, it is essential to investigate the evolution of the effects of gamified interventions over time. Therefore, there is a need for more long-term follow-up measurements. In addition, the potentialities of digital technologies and their capacity to collect a large amount of real-world data could be used to assess the evolution patterns of the effect, allowing the detailed identification of its sustainability and evolvement or even make forecasts via time series analyses. Third, to our knowledge, only 1 team of researchers worked on a gamified intervention targeting SB by introducing sedentary breaks as a gaming part  [72] . Following this line of research, it could be interesting to develop gamified interventions affording participants to take more sedentary breaks. Finally, the cost-effectiveness ratio of gamified interventions may be better than that of many current interventions, considering the ease of implementation and generalizability of gamification. However, this assertion will have to be tested in future trials, including economic analyses.\n\nIn light of our results, gamified interventions appear to be a promising avenue to promote PA in different populations both in prevention in healthy people and in the treatment of chronic diseases. Gamified interventions have many benefits for participants with chronic diseases, such as empowerment of participants by improving their self-management skills, an effect across broad audiences enabling to target different types of pathologies, and an everyday life fit and easy implementation. Similar to other digital health processes, gamification makes it possible to address more patients, especially those who are isolated from health care facilities. Importantly, gamified interventions are especially pertinent during a health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, in which PAs and social interactions are restricted because of lockdown or teleworking and where structured PA possibilities are limited both indoors and outdoors. Gamifying walking and daily activities is, in this context, a great way to improve PA and limit SB of individuals in addition to providing social interaction among players. In the meantime, the face-to-face management of chronic diseases is usually suspended during the pandemic, which underlines the importance of offering remote supervision of PA.\n\nNevertheless, in view of the weaker postintervention effect, this study suggests that a one-shot intervention is not sufficient. A more interesting design would be to address multiple gamification doses during or after the course of treatment to obtain a sustainable implementation of the PA behavior. This configuration would also provide an ideal duration of intervention to avoid exhausting the participants with gamified interventions for >12 weeks."

Second, all stages of the review (screening and data extraction) were independently realized by 2 reviewers. Finally, various novel publication bias analyses and influence analyses were conducted in parallel with different subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.\n\nHowever, some limitations of this work must be mentioned. Overall, the meta-analysis included a small number of studies, and some articles were feasibility or pilot trials. Therefore, several trials included small sample sizes and were highly underpowered. Some studies were conducted with a high risk of bias. One of the main limitations of this work is the impossibility of demonstrating that the effect of gamified interventions is led by gamification itself given the lack of research examining this question. Finally, in the main analysis, we included diverse PA outcomes evaluating similar constructs but which are slightly different in practice. Moreover, not all included outcomes were objectively measured. As the field matures and new trials are published, an update of this work will be important to confirm these preliminary results."

      "text": "To conclude, gamified interventions appear to be a promising avenue for promoting PA in various populations. Influencing primarily the number of daily steps of the participants, gamification is an interesting way to improve daily PA and appears more efficient than equivalent nongamified interventions, such as mobile health apps. However, if the effect of gamification persists during follow-up, suggesting that gamified interventions are more than a novelty effect, this effect decreases with time with a smaller long-term effect. The integration of gamification in more global health care interventions could be a way to address this limited sustainability. Future rigorous trials are required to explore these perspectives."
