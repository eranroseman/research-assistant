  "title": "Effect of Gamification, Financial Incentives, or Both to Increase Physical Activity Among Patients at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events: The BE ACTIVE Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but few individuals achieve guideline-recommended levels of physical activity. Strategies informed by behavioral economics increase physical activity, but their longer-term effectiveness is uncertain. We sought to determine the effect of behaviorally designed gamification, loss-framed financial incentives, or their combination on physical activity compared with attention control over 12-month intervention and 6-month postintervention follow-up periods. \n METHODS: Between May 2019 and January 2024, participants with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a 10year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death of \u22657.5% by the Pooled Cohort equation were enrolled in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. Participants received a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, and were randomly assigned to control (n=151), behaviorally designed gamification (n=304), loss-framed financial incentives (n=302), or gamification+financial incentives (n=305). The primary outcome of the trial was the change in mean daily steps from baseline through the 12-month intervention period. \n RESULTS: A total of 1062 patients (mean\u00b1SD age, 67\u00b18; 61% female; 31% non-White) were enrolled. Compared with control subjects, participants had significantly greater increases in mean daily steps from baseline during the 12-month intervention in the gamification arm (adjusted difference, 538.0 [95% CI, 186.2-889.9]; P=0.0027), financial incentives arm (adjusted  difference, 491.8 [95% CI, 139.6-844.1]; P=0.0062), and gamification+financial incentives arm (adjusted difference, 868.0  [95% CI, 516.3-1219.7]; P<0.0001). During the 6-month follow-up, physical activity remained significantly greater in the gamification+financial incentives arm than in the control arm (adjusted difference, 576.2 [95% CI, 198.5-954]; P=0.0028), but it was not significantly greater in the gamification (adjusted difference, 459.8 [95% CI, 82.0-837.6]; P=0.0171) or financial incentives (adjusted difference, 327.9 [95% CI, -50.2 to 706]; P=0.09) arms after adjustment for multiple comparisons. \n CONCLUSIONS: Behaviorally designed gamification, loss-framed financial incentives, and the combination of both increased physical activity compared with control over a 12-month intervention period, with the largest effect in gamification+financial incentives. These interventions could be a useful component of strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients.",

[1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5]  Guidelines therefore recommend that adults obtain at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly.  6 However, only \u224825% of adults in the United States achieve this level of physical activity.  7, 8 ehavioral economics is a field of study that uses concepts from economics and psychology to better understand and influence how individuals make decisions.  9 Behavioral economic concepts relevant to motivation for engaging in healthy behaviors include immediacy (people are more motivated by immediate rewards than future rewards), endowment effects (whereby people put more value in something they already have relative to something they could attain), loss framing (people are more motivated when a situation is framed as a loss rather than a gain), and status quo bias (people avoid initiating change).  [10] [11] 1] [12]  In shorter-term studies, gamification-and financial incentive-based interventions leveraging these behavioral economic concepts have increased physical activity more than control in patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  [13] [14] 4] [15]  In these studies, each participant assigned to gamification was awarded points each week, with a fraction of those points taken away each day that they did not meet their step goal. They progressed through levels each week according to the total points they retained from that week. Participants assigned to financial incentive arms were awarded a sum of money each week, with a fraction of the money taken away each day they did not meet their step goal. The degree to which these interventions increase physical activity over longer periods is uncertain, as is the relative efficacy of gamification compared with financial incentives.\n\nWe therefore tested the effectiveness of behaviorally designed gamification, loss-framed financial incentives, or both compared with attention control to increase physical activity over prolonged follow-up in individuals at high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events."

After the run-in period, participants were informed of their baseline step count and asked to set a goal step increase of 33%, 40%, or 50% or a custom goal of \u22651500 steps greater than their baseline. This approach was selected to allow participants personalized goal setting  14  while nudging them to choose an ambitious but achievable target. Participants were then randomized 1:2:2:2 to attention control, gamification, financial incentives, or gamification+financial incentives, stratified by baseline step count (<4000, 4000-7000, or >7000 steps) with an electronic number generator through the Way to Health platform.

[14] [15] [16] 16] 19  First, participants signed a precommitment pledge to try their best to achieve their daily step goal, an approach shown to motivate behavior change.  20 Second, at the start of each week, participants received 70 points. Each day, if the step goal was achieved, participants retained their points; if the step goal was not achieved, they were informed that they had lost 10 points. This design was selected to leverage prospect theory, which has demonstrated that loss framing is more effective at motivating behavior change than gain framing.  10 Third, at the end of each week, participants moved up or down levels (blue, bronze, silver, gold, or platinum) according to the points retained the previous week. Each participant began in the silver level to create a sense of achievable goals.  21 Fourth, we leveraged the fresh start effect, the concept that individuals are more motivated for aspirational behavior around temporal landmarks such as the start of a new week,  22  by awarding points at the start of each week. Every 8 weeks, individuals in the blue and bronze levels were restarted back at silver, and they were offered a chance to adjust their step goal. This reduced the risk that participants would become discouraged if they initially set their goals too high. Fifth, each participant chose a family member or friend who received a weekly email with the participant's progress. These supportive sponsors helped enhance social incentives to motivate participants toward their goal. Finally, at the end of the intervention period, participants in the gold and platinum levels received a trophy recognizing their achievement.\n\nIn the financial incentives arm, participants were informed each week that $14 was placed in their virtual account. Each day, if the step goal was achieved, the balance remained. If the step goal was not achieved, the participant was informed that $2 was taken away from their account. This structure leveraged prospect theory and had successfully increased physical activity in a previous study of shorter duration.  13 n the gamification+financial incentives arm, participants received the interventions from both the gamification and financial incentives arms.\n\nIn all 3 intervention arms, participants had an 8-week rampup period during which goals were increased gradually from baseline to the target. After 12 months, participants no longer received their intervention but continued to receive a daily text message noting their step count from the day before (as in the control arm) for an additional 6 months."

With 300 participants in each intervention arm and 150 participants in the control arm, we estimated 93% power to detect a difference between arms of 1000 steps and 85% power to detect a difference of 750 steps, assuming a 10% dropout rate. This approach assumed that the control arm had mean daily steps of 6000, an SD of the difference between intervention and control arms of 2000 steps,  14, 15, 19, [27] [28] [29]  a 10% dropout rate, and a conservative Bonferroni adjustment of the type I error rate with a 2-sided \u03b1 of 0.017 to adjust for up to 3 comparisons. In the second phase, only intervention arms that were significantly different from the control arm were compared with each other, using a conservative Bonferroni adjustment of the type I error rate with a 2-sided \u03b1 of 0.017.\n\nAll randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nData are missing for any day that the participant did not use the wearable device or upload data. For the main analysis, we used multivariate imputation by chained equations for days with missing step values or values <1000 steps per day, as in previous work, because daily step values <1000 may not reflect full data capture.  14, 15, 30, 31 The following determinants were included in the imputation model: study arm, calendar month (fitted as a nominal variable), week of study, baseline daily steps, age, sex, race and ethnicity, educational level, marital status, household income level, self-reported health, and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We performed 20 sets of imputations and combined results using the Rubin standard rules.  32 We performed 2 sensitivity analyses using collected data without imputation (days with missing step count or step count <1000 are excluded); in the first sensitivity analysis, only days with missing step counts were excluded, and in the second, we excluded days with missing step count or step count <1000.\n\nThe primary analysis fitted generalized linear mixed-effect regression models to evaluate changes in daily steps and weekly minutes of MVPA, adjusting for each participant's baseline measure, time from study start (as a continuous measure), calendar month, and participant random effects to account for repeated measures. As a sensitivity analysis, we produced fully adjusted models, adding age, sex, race, education, marital status, income, self-reported health, and body mass index to the main adjusted model. For change in steps and weekly minutes of MVPA, we assumed a normal distribution and obtained difference in steps between arms for the intervention and followup periods as least squared means. We report the effectiveness of the intervention for the primary outcome overall and key subgroups. To estimate the adjusted difference in odds that a participant would have \u2265150 minutes of MVPA in a given week, we used generalized logistic mixed-effect regression models, including the same covariates as in models evaluating other outcomes.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) in February 2024."

      "text": "In this trial of adults at high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, interventions with gamification, financial incentives, and gamification+financial incentives significantly increased physical activity compared with attention control during a 12-month intervention period. This effect was sustained during a 6-month postintervention follow-up period in the group randomized to gamification+financial incentives, and with a nonsignificant trend toward higher mean daily steps during the postintervention follow-up in the group randomized to gamification. Gamification+financial incentives also increased weekly minutes of MVPA more than control during the intervention period, with trends toward signifi-cant increases with gamification and financial incentives alone. These findings, from one of the longest and largest trials of a fully home-based physical activity promotion intervention yet conducted, have important implications for the design and implementation of physical activity programs in clinical practice. First, the gamification and financial incentive interventions leveraged principles from behavioral economics, including precommitment, loss aversion, the endowment effect, goal gradients, and the fresh-start effect, as well as lessons from completed clinical trials. This study confirms the effectiveness of these strategies for physical activity promotion in a cohort of adults at high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Although hybrid home-and center-based interventions have increased physical activity in older adults during long-term follow-up,  33  leveraging behavioral insights facilitated the design of effective fully home-based interventions that do not rely on clinical personnel. Therefore, these interventions could be deployed at scale within a health system, identifying and inviting Downloaded from  http://ahajournals.org  by on July 28, 2025"

Second, no previous fully home-based physical activity promotion interventions had durations of >24 weeks or total follow-up of >36 weeks.  [13] [14] [15] 19, 29, 34  During our 12-month intervention, physical activity declined slowly among participants in all arms; however, it declined more slowly in the intervention arms and remained higher in all intervention arms compared with control. During the postintervention follow-up period, when participants in all arms received no intervention other than daily reports of their step counts, physical activity declined further but remained higher than control in the gamification and gamification+financial incentives arms. It is important to note that the increase in physical activity was compared with attention control, which involved goal setting and daily text messages and was itself associated with substantially increased physical activity. This observed increase in physical activity in the attention control arm might, to some degree, reflect the increase in physical activity that could be achieved by a motivated patient who bought and used a wearable fitness tracker, although participants also received daily text messages, which generated social accountability from participants knowing they were being observed. In this context, a conservative interpretation is that the difference between interventions and control reflects the additive value of a health system-based program to increase physical activity in motivated patients who purchased a wearable fitness tracker on their own. The change from baseline through the main intervention and postintervention follow-up periods in the intervention arms might be conceptualized as the effect that a health system-based program would have on physical activity compared with usual care. Compared with baseline, the mean increase in daily steps at the end of the 18-month study period was >1500 in all 3 intervention arms, and the mean increase in weekly minutes of MVPA was >40, indicating the potential for this intervention to have a large, sustained effect on physical activity compared with usual care if deployed in routine clinical practice. This suggests that a successful long-term intervention can change participants' habitual level of physical activity with maintenance of a higher level of physical activity after the intervention is withdrawn.\n\nThird, this study evaluated the relative effectiveness of gamification compared with financial incentives compared with gamification+financial incentives for physical activity promotion. There were no significant differences in physical activity outcomes between the gamification and financial incentives arms. A formal costeffectiveness analysis is forthcoming, but gamification\n\nTable 2.

Fully adjusted models included all elements of the main adjusted model plus age, sex, race, education, marital status, income, selfreported health, and body mass index. To account for multiple comparisons in the primary analysis, P<0.017 is defined as statistically significant.\n\nThe BE ACTIVE Trial may be preferable in many contexts for financial reasons and because there are no additional costs to continuing it indefinitely, potentially mitigating the risk of challenges with maintaining gains in physical activity after intervention withdrawal. Engagement remained high during the 12-month intervention, suggesting the feasibility of an indefinite intervention. Gamification+financial incentives were significantly more effective than financial incentives alone and with a nonsignificant trend toward greater effectiveness than gamification alone. The effectiveness of the gamification+financial incentives intervention may have been attributable to a response in a higher proportion of patients; some patients may have been motivated by gamification and others by financial incentives. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of tailored physical activity interventions, delivering gamification to patients likely to respond to this intervention and reserving financial incentives for patients who are unlikely to (or fail to) respond to gamification.\n\nIn observational studies, increased physical activity is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.  [35] [36] 6] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  According to data derived from these observational studies, a long-term increase in daily steps by \u224810% from a baseline of 5000 per day, as observed in all 3 intervention arms, would be associ-ated with a 6% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 10% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality,  41  highlighting the clinical relevance of the increase in physical activity achieved in this trial. The fact that much of the increase in physical activity persisted after withdrawal of the intervention suggests that this type of intervention could reduce cardiovascular events, and this should be tested in clinical trials designed to test these hypotheses directly."

Third, we captured physical activity data using Fitbit devices, which were selected for this pragmatic clinical trial because they are widely available, easy for participants to use, and could be feasibly implemented if similar interventions were deployed in clinical practice. Although concerns have been raised about the accuracy of Fitbit devices relative to research-grade accelerometers or other criterion standards,  42, 43  all participants received the same device, comparisons were between randomized groups, and any inaccuracy would not lead to systematic bias. Finally, the trial was powered to detect a 750-step difference among groups in mean daily steps during the main intervention period and was not powered to detect changes in MVPA or changes from baseline through the postintervention follow-up period. With 4 arms and 3 main comparisons, we used a conservative Bonferroni correction to establish thresholds for statistical significance. The observed differences between intervention and control arms in daily steps during the postintervention follow-up period and in weekly minutes of MVPA over the intervention and postintervention follow-up periods may be clinically relevant even if not statistically significant, and larger trials or trials with fewer comparator arms will be necessary to definitively determine the effect of similar interventions on those outcomes."
