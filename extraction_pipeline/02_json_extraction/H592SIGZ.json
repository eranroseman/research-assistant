  "title": "Social networking site use and relationship quality: A double edged sword",
  "abstract": "Given the increasing dependency on social networking sites in modern society, gaining a clearer and more nuanced understanding of whether and how use of this medium is related to relationship quality is of unprecedented importance. The current study reports the first meta-analytic investigation of this research literature, integrating results from 53 independent datasets and 13,873 participants. The data provide evidence for both beneficial and damaging associations, with ones' own or perceived partners' relational commitment, trust, and uncertainty most consistently explaining these relationships. With respect to positive associations, greater security was related to greater engagement of online positive relationship focused behaviors, such as uploading dyadic photos and having a visible and accurate relationship status. With respect to negative associations, lower security was associated with a greater propensity to pursue alternatives online, and for greater social networking site intrusion. Specific individual and relationship characteristics also influenced the magnitude of certain associations. Taken together, these data indicate that although the landscape of modern relationships has been substantially altered by the introduction of social networking sites, traditional relationship theories of investment and relational maintenance remain highly relevant to understanding which interpersonal behaviors are associated with specific relationship outcomes. This identification of a modern online translation of traditional relationship theories not only has important theoretical implications, but at a practical level can be used to inform the guidance provided to couples seeking to preserve or strengthen their relationships.",

      "text": "Given the centrality of romantic relationships in peoples' lives, it is unsurprising that they play a critical role in broader health and wellbeing, and links between relationship status, happiness, and an array of physiological and psychological health outcomes have been identified at all stages of the human lifespan  (Andrews et al., 2017; Diener & Chan, 2011; G\u00f3mez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2019; Kansky, 2018) . Romantic relationship quality appears to be of particular importance in understanding these links  (Andrews et al., 2017; Kansky, 2018; Love & Holder, 2016) , with meta-analytic reviews identifying significant associations between relationship quality, health, and wellbeing across a diverse range of relationship groups and research designs  (Mirsu-Paun & Oliver, 2017; Proulx et al., 2007; Whisman, 2001) . It is therefore important to understand the specific factors that influence romantic relationship quality.\n\nOf increasing importance in modern relationships are social networking sites (SNSs). SNSs represent a subset of social media that allow for the exchange of user-generated content over the internet, and for individuals to connect with others' publicly constructed network  (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010) . Some of the most high profile examples of SNSs are Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, but many other variants exist. It is hard to ignore the influence of SNSs in modern society because of their dramatic influence not just on romantic, but all interpersonal relationships (see  Rus & Tiemensma, 2017; Williams, 2019) . The most recent Digital Global Overview Report  (Kemp, 2020)  formally documented the high dependency and frequency of SNS use, showing that as of January 2020, there were 3.80 billion social media users, who, on average, spend just under two and a half hours on social media platforms daily. Further, a recent systematic review concluded that, SNSs' provision of constant access to others' highly visible social network, has potentially important implications for relationship quality  (Rus & Tiemensma, 2017) .\n\nHowever, to date there has been no statistical integration of this literature, and consequently the goal of the present study was to provide the first meta-analytic investigation of how SNS use and romantic relationship quality are related. Within this review, the term SNS use encompasses four distinct, common SNS behaviors: intrusion, surveillance, pursuing alternatives, and positive relationship-focused behaviors (PRFB). Intrusion is the extent to which SNSs are accessed in one's everyday life, including time spent on SNSs and SNS addiction. Surveillance refers to online monitoring of a partner  's profile and SNS interactions (e.g., comments, likes) . Sending or accepting friend requests to/from possible romantic interests, and flirting or keeping in contact with people through SNSs without the partner's knowledge, may all be categorized as pursuing alternatives. Finally, PRFB refers to behaviors such as sending messages to one's partner and creating content about/ for one's partner.\n\nRelationship quality broadly refers to how positively or negatively one feels about their romantic relationship  (Morry et al., 2010) . However, operational definitions of relationship quality are more complex due to its multidimensional nature  (Farooqi, 2014) . As such, to gain a clearer and more nuanced understanding of the interplay between SNS behaviors and relationship quality, relationship quality was examined both as a general construct, as well as in terms of four specific subjective experiences: satisfaction, security, intimacy, and conflict. These four specific subjective experiences were identified based on the overlap of questions included in commonly used measures of relationship quality. Satisfaction included measures interested in one's level of relational happiness or contentment (such as the Perceived Relationship Quality Component (PRQC) Satisfaction subscale,  Fletcher et al., 2000) . Security included measures of commitment, trust, and uncertainty (such as the Commitment subscale of the Investment Model,  Rusbult et al., 1998 ; the Relational Uncertainty Scale,  Knobloch & Solomon, 1999;  the Partner Trust subscale of the Trust Inventory,  Couch et al., 1996) . Each of these measures predominantly focus on how safe and stable a relationship is perceived to be, and the degree of confidence in a relationships' longevity. Intimacy included measures of intimacy, love, and connectedness (such as the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale,  Aron et al., 1992;  the Marital Disaffection scale,  Kayser, 1996 ; the PRQC Intimacy and Love subscales,  Fletcher et al., 2000) . Finally, conflict included measures of the frequency and/or seriousness of, verbal arguments with one's partner, as well as the effectiveness of strategies employed for resolution (such as The Facebook Related Conflict Scale,  Clayton et al., 2013 and the Conflict Scale, Braiker & Kelley, 1979) .\n\nThe first two primary aims were , to assess the associations between the four different types of SNS use with overall relationship quality, and to conduct meta-regression analyses to test which of the four specific dimensions of relationship quality contribute to any observed associations. It was predicted that SNS use in relation to relationship quality would represent a double-edged sword, with both beneficial and damaging associations expected. Specifically, as outlined in the following sections, relationship quality was expected to be positively associated with PRFB and negatively associated with intrusion, surveillance, and pursuing alternatives."

      "title": "The positive side of SNS use and relationship quality",
      "text": "According to  Canary and Stafford's (1992)  relational maintenance theory, there are five proactive strategies that partners can use to preserve the quality of their romantic relationship. These are positivity (e.g. expressing positive emotions, and refraining from criticism around the partner), openness (disclosing relational wants and needs), assurances (expressing commitment to and support in the relationship), social networks (relying on common friends and family for support), and sharing tasks (performing chores and other tasks equitability;  Stafford & Canary, 1991) . Past literature has demonstrated the importance of each of these strategies in maintaining relationship quality  (Canary et al., 2002; Canary & Yum, 2015; Ogolsky & Bowers, 2013) . In particular, positivity and assurances have been identified as the most effective approaches in predicting relationship satisfaction and commitment  (Canary & Yum, 2015) . Importantly, studies show that common offline interpersonal behaviors are often also used online, suggesting that positivity and assurances provided over SNSs may also favorably affect relationship quality  (Canary & Yum, 2015; Rus & Tiemensma, 2017) . Online translations of these two proactive maintenance strategies include sending cheerful messages to ones' partner (positivity) and writing posts like \"I love you\" on the partner's wall (assurances;  Dainton, 2013) . Consistent with a potential positive link between these specific types of SNS behaviors and relationship quality, previous studies exploring different PRFB and relationship quality have typically identified positive associations (e.g. Carpenter & Spottswood, 2013; Cole et al., 2018; Halpern et al., 2017; Saslow et al., 2013; Steers et al., 2016) .\n\nBeyond the simple translation of offline PRFB to an online setting,  Walther's (1996)  hyperpersonal model also explains the unique advantage such platforms provide. Specifically, online communications allow for careful construction and editing of content prior to uploading/sending. This additional time not afforded during face-to-face interactions ensures that one may portray themself, and their relationship, in the most desirable way, in turn reinforcing each other's perceptions of being an ideal romantic partner  (Walther et al., 2015) . Consequently, in line with both the relational maintenance theory  (Canary & Stafford, 1992)  and hyperpersonal model a significant positive association between PRFB and relationship quality was predicted.\n\nDue to the great variability between PRFB (e.g., interactivity and publicity), this SNS use was further separated into four common online behaviors, to examine which, if any, are most strongly linked to relationship quality. These behaviors are (i) having a visible and accurate relationship status (e.g. Facebook official) (ii) uploading 'couple' (i.e. dyadic), photos, (iii) sending private messages; and (iv) tagging or creating statuses about/for the partner or liking or commenting the partners' content."

      "title": "Intrusion",
      "text": "Despite several studies controlling for SNS intrusion as a potential covariate, surprisingly few have examined it as a direct predictor or correlate of relationship quality. The few that have done so have focused on time spent on SNSs  (Clayton, 2014; Hammond & Chou, 2016; Hand et al., 2013; Valenzuela et al., 2014) , and have shown that increased time is linked to lower relationship quality. Studies interested in SNS addiction have reported similarly undesirable effects (e.g. Abassi, 2019b; Abbasi et al., 2019; Elphinston & Noller, 2011) . Accordingly, in the present review a negative correlation between intrusion and relationship quality was predicted. This negative association may be partly attributable to 'partner phubbing', which refers to the extent to which an individual is distracted by their mobile device when in the presence of their romantic partner  (Roberts & David, 2016) . 'Partner phubbing' has been consistently associated with poorer relationship quality (e.g. Krasnova et al., 2016; McDaniel & Coyne, 2016; Nongpong & Charoensukmongkol, 2016; Roberts & David, 2016) , and has been explained in relation to the displacement hypothesis, whereby 'phubbing' reduces meaningful partner interactions, thereby leading to greater conflict and lower satisfaction  (Coyne et al., 2014; Roberts & David, 2016; Valkenburg & Peter, 2007) ."

      "title": "Surveillance",
      "text": "The uncertainty reduction theory  (Berger & Bradac, 1982; Berger & Calabrese, 1975; Knobloch & Solomon, 1999 , 2002)  posits that there are three conceptually and empirically distinct sources of relational uncertainty. These are one's own view of the relationship, how one perceives their partner views the relationship, and the nature of the relationship itself. The latter can also be divided and explained in terms of behavioral (acceptable and unacceptable boundaries within the relationship), mutuality (reciprocity of feelings), future (long-term direction of the relationship), and definitional (relationship status) uncertainty.\n\nWithin romantic relationships, greater uncertainty is negatively associated with relationship quality  (Knobloch, 2007; Knobloch & Satterlee, 2009; Solomon & Theiss, 2011) . A central tenet of uncertainty reduction theory is that, in order to combat this uncertainty, passive (e. g. observation), active (e.g. asking people within the partners' circle) and/or, interactive information seeking strategies (e.g. speaking directly to one's partner;  Knobloch, 2016; Knobloch & Solomon, 2002)  are used. Information seeking in modern times has been made easier with SNSs, with individuals' now more efficiently able to monitor their partners' profiles and online activity, and studies have reported that greater uncertainty is associated with higher levels of surveillance  (Dainton et al., 2017; Stewart et al., 2014) .\n\nIn the present review, it was therefore anticipated that degree of surveillance and relationship quality would be negatively correlated. Further, in line with the uncertainty reduction theory  (Berger & Bradac, 1982; Berger & Calabrese, 1975; Knobloch & Solomon, 1999 , 2002) , it was predicted that this association would be predominantly due to a significant inverse association between level of surveillance and relational security."

      "title": "Pursuing alternatives",
      "text": "SNSs have proven to be an effective platform for forming new relationships, and this is true both for single individuals, and those already in relationships (e.g. Abbasi, 2019a;  Dibble et al., 2018; Vossler, 2016) . Greater exposure to possible alternatives on SNSs therefore pose a new, unique threat to relationships, but whether one actively pursues these possibilities appears to be influenced by many factors. The most prominent theory proposed to explain the online pursuing of alternatives is  Rusbult's (1980)  investment model. Built on the foundations of Thibaut and  Kelley's (1959)  interdependence theory, this framework suggests that the quality of alternatives is assessed through social comparison. According to this theory, commitment in the relationship strengthens when an individual believes the rewards gained (minus the costs incurred) from the relationship outweigh what could be obtained from alternate relationships. Interestingly, this association seems to be cyclic, with those higher in commitment more likely to devalue potential alternatives (e.g.,  Gonzaga et al., 2008; Johnson & Rusbult, 1989; Lydon et al., 2003) .\n\nSupporting the translation of this framework online, associations between engaging alternatives through SNSs and lower relational satisfaction and security have been reported (e.g. de  Lenne et al., 2019; Drouin et al., 2014; McDaniel et al., 2017) . However, a recent systematic review highlighted that, although the investment model framework has been successfully applied to relationships offline, its role in explaining online behavior is less clear  (Rus & Tiemensma, 2017) . For example, a study by  Dibble and Drouin (2014)  testing this model revealed non-significant relationships between number of online backburners and relational commitment. It was noted that no associations may have emerged because of a belief that certain behaviors deemed unacceptable offline, may be considered acceptable online  (Dibble & Drouin, 2014; West, 2013) .\n\nAccordingly, a further aim of this meta-analysis was to test whether pursuing alternatives through SNSs is linked to poorer relationship quality. The investment model  (Rusbult, 1980)  predicts that a significant negative association between these constructs will emerge, and that this will be driven by lower security. Specifically, by this view, the less committed one is in their relationship, the more attractive possible alternatives are perceived, and thus the greater pursuit of alternatives online, consequently further lowering relationship security."

      "title": "Individual and relationship characteristics",
      "text": "The final aim was to test whether person (person using SNSs, gender, and age) and relationship (status/length) characteristics altered the associations between SNS use and relationship quality. Interdependence is a core element of romantic relationships, such that ones' own emotion, cognition, and/or behavior also affects ones partners' emotion, cognition, and/or behavior  (Finkel et al., 2017; Kelley, 1979; Kelley et al., 1983; Sels et al., 2020) . Accordingly, to gain a more nuanced understanding of the associations between SNS use and relationship quality, both self and partners' SNS use were included in the current review and examined separately through meta-regression. In line with interdependency, the significance of associations was predicted to hold for both self and partners' SNS use, however, due to limited empirical work directly exploring this question in the current context, no specific a priori predictions were made regarding differences in magnitude.\n\nWith respect to gender, past literature has shown that males and females have different motivations for engaging in SNS use. In particular, females are primarily focused on using these platforms to maintain close relationships (e.g. PRFB), and to search/access social information (e.g. partner surveillance; Goswami & Dutta, 2015;  Krasnova et al., 2017; Muise et al., 2014; Rus & Tiemensma, 2017) . Stafford and Canary (1991)  also proposed that females may be more aware of their partner's attempts to maintain the relationship and appreciate these efforts more. Past literature on SNS intrusion have also typically shown greater intrusion by females (e.g. Madden & Zickuhr, 2011; Moore & McElroy, 2012; Nadkarni & Hofmann, 2012) . In light of these identified differences, a moderating effect of gender is possible. However, with the exception of PRFB, how these differences relate to relationship quality has been largely ignored in prior literature. Thus, for PRFBs' and relationship quality, a larger, positive summary effect size was predicted for females, but no specific predictions were made in relation to how gender might influence the association between other types of SNS behaviors and relationship quality.\n\nWith respect to age, while recent statistics report just under two billion Facebook users, most of these fall within a narrow age-band of 18-34 years of age  (24% 18-24, 32% 25-34 years old; Kemp, 2020) . With this greater SNS engagement by younger generations, their relationship quality may be more sensitive to changes in SNS use (and vice versa) than older individuals. As such, age was expected to be a significant predictor of relationship quality for each of the SNS use summary effects, such that larger effect sizes were predicted for younger participants.\n\nFinally, theories of uncertainty reduction and investment also predict moderating effects of relationship length and status  (Berger & Bradac, 1982; Berger & Calabrese, 1975; Knobloch & Solomon, 1999 , 2002; Rusbult, 1980) . According to the investment model, not only does the quality of alternatives influence commitment, but so too does the level of investment. Specifically, because greater investment increases the costs associated with ending the relationship, commitment should be increased. Generally speaking, level of relational investment appears to strengthen with the length of time spent together, as well as with ones' relationship status. Further, the level of uncertainty in the relationship also typically lessens with increased time and status. This means that the more committed a relationship (non-exclusive to exclusive to cohabiting and/or engaged/married) the fewer concerns regarding behavioral norms, the mutuality of feelings, and the definition and/or the future of the relationship. This greater relational security that comes with longer lasting relationships, and a more committed status, is likely to influence the magnitude of the associations between SNS use and relationship quality. However, given the lack of direct empirical research on this question, in the present study no specific a priori predictions were made with regard to the direction of these effects."

Full-text screening was completed by the first author. The second author checked agreement on a representative sample of studies (i.e. half of the included and excluded studies; interrater reliability K = .97). In instances of uncertainty, inclusion was discussed with the third author. Studies were considered eligible if they: 1) Were quantitative, peer-reviewed studies that reported original data.\n\nAccordingly, qualitative studies and/or theses/dissertations, systematic reviews, and book chapters were excluded. Additionally, case studies were ineligible; 2) Explored the relationship between SNS use and current relationship quality (more detail on definitions of these variables is provided in the following sections) a. Studies that focused on SNS use outside the context of relational use (i.e. educational, career, or marketing purposes), for nonromantic relationships (e.g. friendships, family, followers), for forming relationships, and/or solely after a breakup were excluded; b. Studies that reported data both for single participants in addition to individuals' currently in a relationship were permitted to contribute, however in these cases authors were contacted to request data relating to only those participants in a current relationship  (Bevan, 2018; Brody et al., 2016; Clayton, 2014; Cole et al., 2018; Moyano et al., 2017) ; and c. Studies interested in SNS use in relationships without any focus on whether this was related to relationship quality were excluded.

Studies that solely looked at general mobile phone use (e.g. time on phone, phubbing, phone snooping), dating sites (e.g. tinder), or emails, were excluded. Additionally, studies that used hypothetical SNS situations were excluded; 4) The participants were unique. If the same participants contributed to multiple studies, these were considered one dataset. This was the case for Study 1 of Emery et al. (2015), Study 3 of Emery et al.

      "text": "SNS use broadly refers to using web-based services to connect with one's publicly constructed social network  (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Rus & Tiemensma, 2017) . For the purpose of this paper, SNS use was investigated through four distinct terms: intrusion, pursuing alternatives, surveillance, and PRFB.\n\nIntrusion referred to the extent to which SNSs were a part of one's daily life. This term included measures of the frequency and duration of SNS use (e.g. minutes per day, hours per week, number of logins), as well as SNS addiction or excessive attachment. Scales such as the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire  (Elphinston & Noller, 2011)  and the Facebook Intensity Scale  (Ellison et al., 2007)  were incorporated under this heading. Number of accounts however, was not included, as individuals may have many inactive accounts. Surveillance was defined as whether one monitors and/or the frequency in which one monitors their partner's profile and SNS interactions (e.g. comments, likes). Pursuing alternatives referred to sending or accepting friend requests to/from possible romantic interests, and/or flirting, and/or keeping in contact with people on SNSs, without the partner's knowledge, in the possibility that it may someday turn into a romantic or sexual relationship (i.e. backburners, exes). Finally, PRFB referred to such positive behaviors as sending messages to one's partner, engaging in partner's posts (i.e. commenting, liking), tagging, or creating statuses/wall posts about/for one's partner, uploading couple photos, and having a public and/or shared relationship status. Overtly negative PRFB such as publicly revealing things that one's partner wanted private, and excessive public displays were excluded (see  Brody et al., 2016; Seidman et al., 2019) . Measures that looked at self, objective partner (directly measured by partner) and subjective partner (perceived partner use) SNS use were permitted to contribute. Additionally, if the majority of a scale looked at a variable of interest (i.e. Clayton, 2014 for intrusion; Duerksen & Woodin, 2019 for intrusion; Iqbal & Jami, 2017 for surveillance), an attempt was made to contact authors for more specific information. If unsuccessful, the full scale data was permitted to contribute, but the corresponding effect size was carefully assessed using sensitivity analyses."

      "title": "Relationship quality",
      "text": "Relationship quality has been broadly defined as how positively or negatively an individual feels about their romantic relationship  (Morry et al., 2010) . Farooqi (2014)  emphasized the ambiguity of this construct due to its multidimensionality. In line with this, there is considerable heterogeneity between studies with respect to how relationship quality is operationalized. For clarity and to achieve greater consistency, relationship quality was defined as an overarching construct comprised of four subjective experiences: satisfaction, security, intimacy, and conflict. As noted, the classification of these terms were based on the overlap of questions asked in commonly used measures.\n\nSatisfaction was defined as one's level of happiness, contentment, and/or satisfaction towards the relationship and/or partner in general, or in certain areas (i.e. sexual satisfaction). Security referred to both one's own, and perceived partner's level, and/or certainty of the level, of commitment, dedication, and devotion to, and dependability, and trustworthiness of the relationship/partner. Intimacy included feelings of closeness, adoration, love, and/or interconnectedness with one's partner. Finally, conflict was defined as the frequency and/or seriousness of both general and SNS-specific (i.e. the Facebook-related Conflict Scale;  Clayton et al., 2013) , arguments with one's partner, as well as the effectiveness of strategies used for resolution. Conflict was used in reference to verbal disagreements only, with measures relating to physical threats/violence excluded.\n\nRelationship quality measures were coded at both the broader, aggregate level (i.e. as relationship quality in cases where the scale tapped into multiple facets) as well as the more specific sub-component level (for meta-regression). It is important to note that decisions for coding were based on the definitions provided in this section, rather than on the names of the scale and/or the terms used in each individual study. For example, the Satisfaction Subscale of the Investment Model  (Rusbult et al., 1998)  only contributed to the overall relationship quality summary effect sizes (and not the specific relationship quality dimension meta-regressions) due to questions targeting satisfaction, intimacy, and security. Additionally, unlike for SNS use, only self-report data was permitted to contribute (i.e. excluded partner ratings, and public perception ratings)."

The AXIS was selected as it was specifically created to evaluate cross-sectional studies. This tool typically involves dichotomously assessing each study on 20 criterions (yes, classified as one, or no/unclear, classified as zero). However, in the present review three questions regarding the categorization and description of non-responders were removed. This was because the use of online recruitment for most participants contributing to this review made these categorization decisions difficult to apply. As the AXIS does not provide specific interpretation guidelines, there is a degree of subjectivity involved, but this has been argued to be a potential strength as it allows for greater flexibility  (Downes et al., 2016) . In the present review, study quality was examined within the subcategories of reporting (seven questions), design (seven questions) and potential biases (3 questions), with studies characterized as low (0-3 yes' for reporting and design, 0-1 for biases), medium (4-5 yes' for reporting and design, 2 for biases), or high quality (6-7 yes' for reporting and design, 3 for biases; question 19 reverse scored) for each category. When a paper reported multiple studies (e.g. Marshall et al., 2013; Saslow et al., 2013; Seidman et al., 2019) , each relevant study was assessed separately."

To ensure accuracy, the second author checked agreement on half of the included studies, with complete coding inter-rater agreement achieved. The following data were extracted:\n\n1) Participant and relationship characteristics.\n\nThe continuous variables here were age and relationship duration. Gender (male, female, or other), relationship status (single, in an unspecified relationship, non-exclusively dating, or engaged, married or cohabiting), sexual orientation (heterosexual, same sex, bisexual, or other), person using SNS (self, objective partner, or subjective partner), country, and participant source (general population, student, or mixed) were also coded for; 2) SNS features. Specifically, SNS platform (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Myspace, multiple, or not specified), and SNS use type (intrusion, surveillance, pursuing alternatives, or PRFB) and measure were coded for. Where possible, type of PRFB was further divided into visible and accurate relationship status (e.g. Facebook official), couple photos (e.g. dyadic Facebook profile photo), private messages, or tagging/statuses/likes/comments. 3) Relationship quality type (quality vs. satisfaction vs. security vs. intimacy vs. conflict) and measure used; and 4) Data to calculate precise effect sizes. Specifically, sample sizes, and bivariate Pearson's correlations were extracted. If correlations were unavailable, authors were contacted and/or if applicable, in line with Peterson and Brown's (2005) recommendations, direct effect beta coefficients from mediation analyses residing between \u00b1.50 were extracted (i.e. Krueger & Forest  , 2020) . For each study, values were extracted so that positive effect sizes denoted a positive relationship between SNS use and relationship quality."

      "text": "Four separate summary analyses were conducted to assess each specific SNS behavior (i.e., intrusion, pursuing alternatives, surveillance, and PRFB) with relationship quality. To analyze these data, the metafor  (Viechtbauer, 2010)  and dmeta  (Harrer et al., 2019)  packages were used within RStudio (version 4.0.0; RStudio Team, 2020). Effect sizes were calculated as r, signifying the degree of correlation between SNS use and relationship quality. The interpretation of r follows Cohen's (1977) conventions with effects of 0.10 deemed small, 0.30 moderate, and correlations equal to and larger than 0.50 interpreted as large. Additionally, the percentage of variance accounted for (PVAF) by each SNS behavior was calculated.\n\nDue to the majority of studies reporting multiple outcomes, a threelevel random-effects meta-analytic model was used to account for the dependency between effect sizes  (Moeyaert et al., 2017; Van den Noortgate et al., 2015) . Advantages of this model over the traditional two-level (univariate) model are firstly, that multiple effect sizes are not averaged together, thus reducing the chance of Type 2 error from standard error overestimations. Secondly, multi-level modelling further divides variance into within-study (level 2) and between-study (level 3) variance, allowing for more precise estimations of effects  (Assink & Wibbelink, 2016; Moeyaert et al., 2017; Pastor & Lazowski, 2018) . To assess effect size distribution heterogeneity for each SNS behavior, the proportion of variance (I 2 ) at levels 2 and 3, and the 80% prediction interval around the mean effect size for a new study were calculated.\n\nTo gain a more nuanced understanding of how the SNS behaviors and relationship quality were related, the associations between each behavior and the specific quality experiences of satisfaction, security, intimacy, and conflict were explored through meta-regression analyses (reported when k \u2265 3). For the PRFB analysis only, type of behavior (i.e. shared relationship status vs. couple photos vs. private messages vs. tagging/statuses/likes/comments) was also examined. Finally, for each SNS use summary effect size, the importance of participant characteristics of age, gender, relationship length, relationship status, and person using the SNSs were explored using meta-regression, again, when k \u2265 3 for two or more groups for categorical variables. When studies distinguished the sample composition in regards to gender and/or relationship status, authors were contacted in an attempt to gain the relevant participant subgroup correlations.\n\nIn meta-analyses a particular concern threatening validity is publication bias. Termed \"the file drawer problem\"  (Rosenthal, 1979) , this type of bias refers to the higher probability of significant (relative to non-significant) data being published  (Easterbrook et al., 1991) . To examine whether there was any evidence of this type of bias in the studies contributing to the current meta-analysis, three techniques were used. Firstly, Orwin's Failsafe N  (Orwin, 1983)  was used to estimate the robustness of each mean effect to any bias. This statistic quantifies the number of studies averaging null results that must exist to reduce the unweighted mean effect past a specified threshold (in the present study an unweighted mean effect of \u00b1.05). Secondly, analysis of asymmetry in the funnel plot was used to test whether effect sizes were predicted by standard error using Egger and colleagues' (1997) regression test. Finally, trim-and-fill analyses were used to establish how each respective mean effect size would change if any identified bias were to be removed. For the latter two techniques, multilevel models have not yet been developed and so data was aggregated prior to performing the tests.\n\nLastly, two sensitivity techniques were used to identify any effect sizes that may be exerting disproportionate influence over findings. In particular, Cook's distances  (Cook & Weisberg, 1982) , and standardized residuals where scores \u00b1 2.24 standard deviations are regarded as extreme  (Aguinis et al., 2013; Martin & Roberts, 2010) . Once each potentially influential case was identified, a new summary effect excluding this case was calculated and compared to the original to assess any potential distortion to the pooled effect  (Viechtbauer & Cheung, 2010) ."

An examination of each criterion revealed that, while seven of the AXIS criteria were clearly met by the included studies, and three by the majority, seven of the assessment criteria were met by less than 50% of the studies appraised (Fig.  4 ). One of the main concerns related to study design was that only 23% of studies used an appropriate sample frame (i.e. probabilistic sample, quota sample, convenience sample from multiple locations/platforms, or online recruitment sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk). Instead, the vast majority of studies used snowball sampling, recruited from a single university, or, even when recruited from multiple locations/platforms, had an uneven gender split (greater than 60%; most commonly a female majority); in these instances, a zero was assigned. In regards to the quality of reporting, only 23% of studies provided adequate detail regarding statistical methods, software packages, and statistical significance levels and/or provided a comprehensive description of the results of all planned analyses, or provided adequate a priori (in method section) details of the analyses allowing for confidence that all results (included non-significant results) were described.

Nonetheless, the original model was retained as neither new model (when each case was excluded) altered significance or magnitude of the small effect size. Examination of publication bias also raised no concerns regarding the validity of the aggregated effect size.\n\n78.63% of the heterogeneity in this relationship was not attributable to sampling error, with most variance accounted for by within-study heterogeneity (I 2 Level2 = 64.88%).

In terms of which PRFB were most strongly associated with quality, having ones relationship status visible on SNSs, and posting dyadic photos explained the greatest proportion of variance in relationship quality, followed by commenting, tagging, liking, and creating statuses for or about ones' partner. Interestingly, only public behaviors shared a significant positive relationship with quality, with private messaging non-significant. While past literature examining  Canary and Stafford's (1992)  relational maintenance theory have argued that there are many similarities in the use and implications of strategies on and offline  (Canary & Yum, 2015; Rus & Tiemensma, 2017) , these data suggest that, in contrast to traditional PRFB, proclamations may need to be expressed publicly when in an online setting in order to positively impact relationship quality. One possible reason is the inherently public nature of SNSs which were designed to allow individuals to stay updated and connected with others' lives  (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010) . As such, private SNS behaviors may be less readily interpreted as attempts to provide positivity or assurance. Another possible interpretation could be that public PRFBs are, in line with  Walther's (1996)  hyperpersonal model, subject to greater contemplation and revision to ensure the best self and relationship presentation to one's greater social network. Consequently, these public expressions may be more explicitly positive or assuring in nature. Future research is now required to directly assess the different SNS (e.g., interactivity, publicity, frequency) and person (e. g., motivation behind behavior) characteristics of online PRFB to better understand how these function to enhance romantic relationship quality.\n\nAs noted, negative associations also emerged between the specific SNS behaviors of intrusion and pursuing alternatives with relationship quality. Interestingly, the former of these associations was notably smaller relative to the significant effects of pursuing alternatives as well as PRFB. Specifically the PVAF was five times greater for PRFB, and over 20 times greater for pursuing alternatives. This may be explained in terms of the large variety in both how people spend their time on SNSs (e. g. PRFB, pursuing alternatives etc.), and when (e.g. alone, with partner etc.). Although the present review did not distinguish between when one uses SNSs, the person using SNSs sub-analysis for intrusion does provide some initial support into the importance of this variable. In particular, significant associations were only evident for self and subjective partner, and not objective partner intrusion. Thus, it appears that it is not how much ones' partner actually uses SNSs, but rather how much an individual perceives their partner uses these sites that is important, and potentially detrimental. Individuals' ratings of partner intrusion should be primarily based on time spent together, suggesting, in line with the displacement hypothesis  (Coyne et al., 2014; Roberts & David, 2016; Valkenburg & Peter, 2007) , that it is the felt reduction in meaningful partner interactions that leads to lower relationship quality. In other words, this review provides tentative support for the notion that engaging in SNSs in the presence of a significant other is detrimental to relationship quality (i.e. phubbing). Further supporting this possibility, when comparing ones' own level of intrusion to subjective partner intrusion ratings, the latter explained over 15 times more variance in lower overall relationship quality (although these findings need to be interpreted cautiously due to the relatively small number of studies contributing to these particular analyses). Taken together, the small intrusion effect size calculated in the present review likely reflects the multifactorial nature of this construct, and future research is needed to focus on the influence of more specific aspects of intrusive behavior, such as when partners' are using SNSs on relationship quality. Surprisingly, surveillance was not related to relationship quality, both at the general, as well as at the more specific experience level. As noted, a significant negative association primarily driven by security had been anticipated, in line with the uncertainty reduction theory  (Berger & Bradac, 1982; Berger & Calabrese, 1975; Knobloch & Solomon, 1999 , 2002) . However, some meta-regression variables were significant, with stronger negative associations identified in younger participants. An interesting avenue for future research is therefore to test the potential limits and potential modifiers of the null effect identified between surveillance and relationship quality. For example, the few studies looking at the translation of adult attachment styles to online behaviors have recognized its role in partner surveillance, with preoccupied and fearful individuals (characterized by high anxiety) engaging in greater SNS partner monitoring, and highly avoidant individuals engaging in less  (Fox & Warber, 2014; Marshall et al., 2013) . Additionally, a study by Seidman (2019), identified greater partner surveillance and conflict in highly neurotic and extraverted individuals. Accordingly, future research is needed to better understand the complex interplay between individual differences, surveillance and relationship quality, to establish whether there are specific conditions in which the predicted harmful association may emerge."

      "title": "SNS use and specific relationship quality dimensions",
      "text": "Results examining whether associations between relationship quality and SNS behaviors were driven by specific subjective experiences showed that differences in security most consistently explained significant associations (see Fig.  5 ). In the current review, security was indexed by using questions that related to ones' own and perceived partners' level of commitment, trust, and uncertainty, with greater security representing stronger commitment, dedication, and devotion to, and dependability and trustworthiness of the relationship/partner.\n\nFor pursuing alternatives, to be in line with the investment model  (Rusbult, 1980) , any observed association needed to be driven by lower security. Specifically, the less committed one was to the relationship, the more attractive possible alternatives should be and the greater their online pursuit, leading to further reductions in relational security. The moderate negative effect size identified between pursuing alternatives and security is therefore consistent with this model. However, as all meta-analyses are entirely reliant upon the availability of existing data, there were limits and boundaries on how extensively predictions from this model could be tested. In particular, the role of conflict and intimacy could not be explored. Consequently, while these data show that security is significantly associated with pursuing alternatives, it remains unclear whether and if so how conflict or intimacy may interact with these variables. As such, an interesting area for future research would be to ascertain whether heightened conflict and/or lower intimacy are significantly associated with pursuing alternatives.\n\nIt should also be noted that small but significant differences in satisfaction were also identified, but only for PRFB (positive) and pursuing alternatives (negatively). Additionally, while conflict was not associated with PRFB, it was the most important contributor of the negative association between SNS intrusion and relationship quality. That is, the greater the online intrusion, the greater the conflict. Interestingly, intimacy was only found to be important for PRFB, such that the greater ones' own and partners' engagement in PRFB, the stronger the feelings of closeness, adoration, love, and interconnectedness."

      "text": "The final aim was to explore whether the strength of the summary effect sizes differed according to individual and relationship characteristics (see Fig.  5 ). In line with predictions, not only was a larger positive summary effect size identified for females and online PRFB, but this relationship was also non-significant for males. This finding aligns with previous literature showing a greater tendency for females to use these platforms to maintain close relationships  (Krasnova et al., 2017; Rus & Tiemensma, 2017) , as well as predictions derived from relational maintenance theory  (Stafford & Canary, 1991) , that females should have both greater awareness of and appreciation for their partner's attempts to maintain the relationship. Interestingly, no significant gender differences were reported for other SNS uses.\n\nIn regards to age, based on younger individuals' greater engagement with SNSs (Kemp, 2020), it had been predicted that relationship quality would be more sensitive to changes in SNS use (and vice versa) in younger relative to older cohorts. Partial support for this hypothesis was found with significant effects of age reported for intrusion and surveillance. Specifically, greater negative associations between these uses and relationship quality were identified for younger participants. Why a similar pattern did not emerge for age and PRFB or pursuing alternatives is unclear, and requires future investigation. One possible interpretation for PRFB may be that although SNSs are monopolized by younger age groups, older individuals who make the effort to create an online presence also view SNSs as an important means of partner communication. For pursuing alternatives, age may not have influenced the relationship due to a universal understanding in today's society that SNSs are the most efficient and effective platform to make new connections.\n\nFinally, meta-regression analyses focused on the influence of relationship status and length provided some support for the theories of uncertainty reduction and investment  (Berger & Bradac, 1982; Berger & Calabrese, 1975; Knobloch & Solomon, 1999 , 2002; Rusbult, 1980) . Looking first at PRFB, while relationship length was not significant, differences between the statuses of participants emerged. In particular, the positive association between PRFB and relationship quality only applied to exclusively dating individuals, and not cohabiting, engaged, and married individuals. This may be interpreted as cohabiting, engaged, and married individuals requiring less assurances, and consequently being less sensitive to positive SNS behaviors, and not engaging in them as frequently. Additionally, these individuals seeing each other more often also likely reduces the need for online assurances.\n\nFor SNS intrusion only relationship length significantly predicted the relationship, with greater negative effect sizes revealed for participants in newer relationships, and it seems likely that those dating for shorter periods of time are more sensitive to intrusion given the greater uncertainty surrounding the relationship. Relationship length did not influence the associations between relationship quality with either surveillance or pursuing alternatives. Similarly for surveillance, relationship status was non-significant, however the role of status on pursuing alternatives could not be assessed due to lack of data. As such, future research is needed to understand the potential role of relationship status in understanding the association between pursuing alternatives and relationship quality. Additionally, understanding the diverging importance of relationship length versus status for PRFB and intrusion requires further empirical attention."

      "text": "A key limitation of this meta-analysis relates to generalizability. Most studies that contributed were conducted in the US or other Western societies, restricted SNS use to Facebook, and only included heterosexual individuals. It is therefore important for future studies to examine whether the results extend to other countries, SNSs, and sexual orientations. The cross-sectional design used by most studies also limits conclusions regarding the directionality of the effects identified. Thus, although the most parsimonious explanation is that a reciprocal causal relationship exists, such that relationship quality influences online behaviors, thereby influencing relationship quality, and so on, longitudinal research is needed to directly test these proposed inter-relationships.\n\nAs mentioned previously, a limitation of all meta-analytic studies is the dependence on the availability of existing data. This means that although it was possible to analyze the associations between SNS uses and relationship quality at both the aggregate and specific experience level, the meta-regression analyses of person using the SNSs, as well as participant and relationship characteristics, could only be explored at the overall construct level. Further research is therefore needed to assess potential moderators of the association between relationship quality and SNS use at the subjective experience level so that a more complete and nuanced understanding of the associations may be achieved.\n\nFinally, while this review focused on SNS use, there are many other technologically based mediums becoming increasingly prominent in today's society that may also meaningfully impact the formation, maintenance, and breakdown of romantic relationships. This includes texting and apps like Tinder and Bumble. Accordingly, some important and interesting avenues for future research would be to explore and compare the association of relationship quality with different digital mediums, as well as to look at the role SNS use and these other channels play in relationship formation and breakdown."

The results also highlight the complexity of this relationship, showing that many distinct individual differences and relationship variables influence these effects. Theoretically, the results also highlight how traditional relationship theories, and in particular investment and relational maintenance, have considerable value in understanding which interpersonal behaviors are related to specific relationship outcomes. However, it is hoped that the results from this study also have practical implications, in providing evidence-based guidelines in the broad field of relationship therapy about the types of online behaviors that shouldand should not beengaged in, to optimize relationship quality."
