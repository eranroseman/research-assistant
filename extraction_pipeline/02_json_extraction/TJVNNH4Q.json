  "title": "How are Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Used in Digital Behavior Change Interventions? A Scoping Review",
  "abstract": "To assess the current real-world applications of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) as functionality of digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) that influence patient or consumer health behaviors. A scoping review was done across the EMBASE, PsycInfo, PsycNet, PubMed, and Web of Science databases using search terms related to ML/AI, behavioral science, and digital health to find live DBCIs using ML or AI to influence real-world health behaviors in patients or consumers. A total of 32 articles met inclusion criteria. Evidence regarding behavioral domains, target real-world behaviors, and type and purpose of ML and AI used were extracted. The types and quality of research evaluations done on the DBCIs and limitations of the research were also reviewed. Research occurred between October 9, 2023, and January 20, 2024. Twenty-three DBCIs used AI to influence real-world health behaviors. Most common domains were cardiometabolic health (n\u00bc5, 21.7%) and lifestyle interventions (n\u00bc4, 17.4%). The most common types of ML and AI used were classical ML algorithms (n\u00bc10, 43.5%), reinforcement learning (n\u00bc8, 34.8%), natural language understanding (n\u00bc8, 34.8%), and conversational AI (n\u00bc5, 21.7%). Evidence was generally positive, but had limitations such as inability to detect causation, low generalizability, or insufficient study duration to understand long-term outcomes. Despite evidence gaps related to the novelty of the technology, research supports the promise of using AI in DBCIs to manage complex input data and offer personalized, contextualized support for people changing real-world behaviors. Key opportunities are standardizing terminology and improving understanding of what ML and AI are.",

      "text": "achine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) hold promise for the operation, implementation, and optimization of digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) focused on real-world health behaviors. With applications ranging from consuming complex and disparate data streams to delivering support tailored to patient needs at scale, ML and AI have captured the imagination of behavior change professionals. The potential for what AI can support in DBCIs is enormous, and the importance of patient behavior in driving critical population health and economic outcomes  1  presents a meaningful opportunity to change real-world behaviors using AI. However, reviews published in the past 5 years summarizing how ML and AI are used in DBCIs show rare applications to change real-world behavior. 2e5  This scoping review aimed to examine the uses of ML and AI in DBCIs to influence real-world health behavior, that is, behavior that takes place outside of the digital ecosystem in the physical world. Examples include exercise, eating, or engaging in clinical care. We excluded DBCIs that serve solely in the interest of mental health and well-being. Although digital interactions such as practicing cognitive behavioral therapy or completing educational modules likely promote improvements in health and well-being, we were interested in the application of ML and AI to directly facilitate real-world health behaviors."

      "text": "The behavioral literature lacks clarity about what constitutes AI and its subcategories, particularly ML. This imprecision complicates discussion of the suitability of each technique for a given purpose and whether and how AI was used in the development of an intervention. For example, in 1 systematic review of context-aware DBCIs,  3  at least 2 articles that relied on hard-coded automation were classified as using AI.  6, 7 An audience without AI expertise, such as the typical readers of these articles, would not be able to reliably discern the difference.\n\nFor that audience, we describe the major classes of ML and AI that might be used in a DBCI (Table  1 ). 8e12  Machine learning is generally considered a subset of AI.  8  However, the relationship between the 2 is rarely well defined. Any modern definition of AI carries a connotation of computer-based task automation that might otherwise require human-level reasoning. Machine learning is more specifically defined as a field of study in which computers are given an ability to learn, typically to address complex inference tasks not solvable via an explicit set of steps.  9 Because most modern AI advancements are built using ML algorithms, these terms are often used interchangeably; we deliberately use the term AI to cover both moving forward. Because one of the distinguishing characteristics of ML is its focus on generalization ability, most human-level reasoning falls within its purview. Machine learning practitioners aim to create models with utility beyond their training data: that is, models that learn rather than memorize. Any system only able to memorize information should not be labeled AI. Similarly, hard-coded expert systems should be excluded from the AI category. Just as we would not categorize a book of decision flow diagrams as AI, we do not categorize knowledge encoded in an interactive computer program as AI.\n\nA subfield of AI poised to play an increasing role in DBCIs is reinforcement learning (RL). Reinforcement learning is concerned with sequential decision making in interactive environments, making it particularly relevant for real-world interaction scenarios. The primary characteristics of an RL algorithm are a set of states, a set of actions that may be taken, a learned policy that determines what action to take in any given state, and a potentially delayed feedback signal (reward or penalty) that drives learning.  10 einforcement learning is best known in fields such as robotics and video games,  13  but these techniques have been broadly applied to recommender systems  14  and in alignment tasks for generative AI model training.  15 any of the latest advances in RL are geared toward solving real-world problems including tasks involving complex human interactions.\n\nA particularly important category of RL for DBCIs is contextual bandits, which do not try to model the full complexity of how a sequence of states affects feedback. They only consider the immediate reward received when attempting to evaluate the value of a particular action at a given state.  10 Contextual bandits are more practical in real-world scenarios, and they are a powerful tool for learning to make contextualized decisions in uncertain environments.\n\nMany familiar forms of AI, such as natural language processing (NLP) and image processing, are actually application areas. Many of these techniques are field-specific given the criticality of domain expertise in the application of AI, contributing to conflation of fields of application and actual subfields of AI. For example, NLP consists of many generative and nongenerative ML approaches applied to ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS d Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) targeting real-world health behaviors, but these have not been catalogued to understand which AI tools are being used and how.\n\nd A scoping review identified 23 different AI-DBCIs incorporating AI to influence real-world health behaviors, most of which used proprietary technology rather than licensing third-party capabilities. The most frequent behavior targeted by these interventions was physical activity.\n\nd A lack of consistent and accurate terminology to describe AI in the DBCI literature limits the ability to compare approaches and determine which AI tools are best suited for purpose. While early evidence of the use of AI to influence real-world health behavior suggests positive effects, few studies examine longterm outcomes. There are abundant opportunities for future exploration and research.\n\nTABLE 1. Glossary of AI Terminology 8e12"

      "text": "A subfield of ML that attempts to deal with decision making in interactive environments with feedback. Simple forms or RL include multiarm bandits and contextual bandits. Full reinforcement learning involves modeling of many states and the relationships between choices in the states and eventual rewards that may only be observed after many state transitions.\n\nnatural language  16  (as opposed to language in structured forms such as database entries).\n\nThere are many nongenerative forms that can play an important role in DBCIs, such as natural language understanding (NLU) and sentiment analysis. Much of the current AI buzz is about generative AI,  17  defined as an ML model that can generate novel content such as a conversational response or image.  18 However, generative models have been a part of ML long before the rise of content generation models. For example, most early speech-to-text systems included generative models that considered the probability of a sequence of letters or words as part of their decision processes. Even the category of large language models (LLMs) including Open AI's GPT-4,  19  which dominate the subfield of generative AI, are not a proper subset of generative AI. For example, Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model  20  is an LLM that converts text to an embedding in a continuous high-dimensional space but does not generate content. Generative AI language models will likely be used in many behavioral interventions in the future because they offer a powerful technology for interfacing with other machine-based models or solutions. However, their current unpredictability is a barrier to direct use in DBCIs.\n\nOn the contrary, there are many categories of ML that are potentially useful in more traditional supervised learning tasks, such as classification problems. These include kernel machines (eg, support vector machines), manifold learning methods, and neural networks.  21 In addition, there are many algorithmic areas focused on specific types of challenges such as limited training data. Semisupervised learning, multitask learning, multimodal learning, and active learning are subfields that have expanded the reach of ML algorithms by incorporating more complex assumptions and crafting more robust algorithms that solve for them.  22 nderstanding the interplay between these various forms of AI is complicated by the fact that most of these terms arose independently and were, therefore, not designed to fit into a coherent scheme. For example, many generative AI models are now improved by using RL algorithms,  15  and recommender systems are often built using contextual bandits.  23 t is also important to clarify that many techniques that may be used as 1 step in a larger AI model or system are not themselves AI. As previously mentioned, we do not consider a hard-coded expert system to be AI. Similarly, other methods are sometimes erroneously termed AI when learning and reasoning-based induction are not used. A useful heuristic is that ML improves generalization ability.  11 By this measure, many data mining techniques, such as clustering, do not qualify as AI. Moreover, most classical statistical methods and most standard dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis, are not AI, even if some of them inspired or play a role in AI systems. If there is no basis for inductive reasoning and some effort to ensure that the knowledge is generalizable, then a technique cannot reasonably be classified as belonging to the field of ML and, subsequently, modern AI.\n\nTABLE 1. Continued AI Term Definition Supervised learning The most common ML problem formulation, which covers any learning problem mapping input data (often called features or attributes) about examples to labels associated with said examples. This includes most classification problems, as well as regression problems.\n\nSemisupervised learning Algorithmic methods for solving supervised learning problems that attempt to leverage unlabeled data to speed up learning when labeled samples are limited or expensive.\n\nTransfer learning A set of ML methods that attempt to transfer or share learnings among multiple models.

      "title": "The Potential for AI-Powered Behavioral Interventions",
      "text": "The disciplines of behavioral science and AI have a deep historical relationship. Early mechanistic views held that human behavior is based on fixed rules,  24  which could allow for simulation via AI. Early psychologists, philosophers, computer scientists, and mathematicians attempted to describe aspects of human intelligence so precisely that a machine could simulate them.  25 An illustrative example of the relationship between the fields is that a well-respected ML textbook  9  leverages a Skinner behavioral study  26  to explain inductive bias. Rudimentary applications of AI have a long history in the behavioral sciences, stemming from the at-the-time revolutionary ELIZA chatbot in the 1970s.  27 In the time since, the use of NLP and conversational AI in the form of chatbots for behavioral health has continued, with evidence suggesting that use of these technologies is associated with improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety. 28e30  Outside of mental health care, health care chatbots have also been used for symptom assessment and monitoring,  31  care referrals,  32  and patient education.  33 owever, other patient-directed applications of AI to change behavior have been limited. This is partially because of the complex health care data landscape. Interoperability continues to be a barrier for electronic health records  34  and other data sources such as sensors and trackers.  35 Although data are aggregated, the resulting consolidated records may be noisy and unwieldy. Artificial intelligence approaches such as NLP have the potential to enable the ingestion and digestion of large quantities of disparate data related to people's health and behaviors.  12 Managing complex input data is a prerequisite for offering a seamless DBCI experience across platforms, devices, and channels.  36 f these challenges can be overcome, AI can support behavior change by facilitating personalized recommendations and experiences. In general, personalized interventions work better than generic ones  37, 38  and are more likely to prompt sustained behavior change over time.  39 This is likely because people perceive personalized interventions as more relevant  40  ; functional magnetic resonance imaging scans show that exposure to personalized content activates regions of the brain associated with self-relevance.  41 In turn, such brain activity is associated with changes in behavior.  42 ersonalization can also encourage the initiation and sustenance of new behaviors via motivational pathways. For example, AIpowered recommender systems have shown promise in creating medication schedules,  43  supporting provider treatment selections based on patient information,  44  surfacing credible health education content,  45  and suggesting healthier dietary options.  46 In theory, personalized recommendations are more likely to align with people's reasons for pursuing change and support basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. 47e50  This in turn promotes engagement with target behaviors.  51 urrently, many DBCIs offering personalization use decision rules or user-driven selection, with very few using AI.  52 Yet, AI's ability to consume and make sense of disparate data streams and adjust based on new information, coupled with the potential to select from a huge and diverse set of recommendations, suggests AI is well-suited to power personalization of DBCIs, for example through a combination of sensor data and RL.  53 This is especially exciting given evidence that personalization with objective data (eg, systemcaptured) may be more effective than with self-report.  54 eyond recommendations, personalization can also be used to deliver the appropriate support based on a person's barriers to a target behavior. Not only do people have different barriers from each other, but also any individual's barriers may change over time and across contexts. 55e57 A successful intervention accounts for such changes in the behavioral support it offers, often through personalization.  58, 59 Although human coaches can deliver personalization through direct interaction, the model is prohibitively cost-intensive and labor-intensive to scale.  60 Machine learning is well-suited to account for a complex set of variables and previous behaviors to determine the optimal behavioral support to maximize an outcome.  59 inally, although AI is not required for sophisticated approaches to behavioral assessment and modification such as ecological momentary assessment  61  and just-in-time adaptive interventions,  62, 63  it may accelerate their inclusion in commercially available technologies. Because DBCIs incorporate such approaches, their developersdboth behavioral designers and supporting data scientists and engineersdshould understand the available technical toolkit to optimize it.\n\nGiven myriad ways in which AI could support the goals of DBCIs in changing real-world behaviors, an assessment of the field is needed. An accounting of the current state of artificial intelligence digital behavior change interventions (AI-DBCIs) will provide insight into opportunity areas for intervention development, an understanding of unanswered questions about the effective use of these technologies, an overview of the state of the field with respect to a common understanding of what ML and AI are and how they are best used in support of DBCIs, and directives for future work."

These target behaviors are specific actions users would be encouraged to take outside of the intervention; it is assumed that engagement with the intervention is also a target behavior.  102 Target behaviors are not always the same as the behavioral domain or the dependent variables in a study of the AI-DBCI. For example, in 1 application of the Lark intervention in the cardiometabolic domain, increasing physical activity was a target behavior, and reduction in weight was a dependent variable.  79 The most common real-world target behavior was physical activity, with 16 of the 23 AI-DBCIs (69.6%) including it. Diet was targeted in 4 AI-DBCIs (17.4%). No other target behaviors appeared in more than 2 interventions. The remaining categories included clinical provider encounters, completing cancer screenings; logging biometric data such as blood pressure, blood glucose, or weight; improving sleep habits; adhering to prescribed medication regimens; reducing the use of alcohol, tobacco, or other substances; and rehearsing disclosure of sexual health status. Table  3  summarizes the target behaviors by AI-DBCI.\n\nCountries of Origin. Although results were limited to developed nations with mature technology infrastructures, there were still patterns in where AI is used in digital health. Most technologies were deployed in the United States, with 25 of the 32 (78.1%) articles meeting inclusion criteria describing research conducted there. Three articles described research conducted in the Netherlands (9.4%), and there was 1 article each (3.1%) from South Korea, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Switzerland, France, and Italy (cross-national study). Specific Type of AI Used. In total, 23 AI-DBCIs were described in the 32 articles included in this scoping review. Of the 23 AI-DBCIs reviewed, 10 (43.5%) used some type of classical ML algorithm, with varying degrees of specificity in the description of algorithm type. Eight (34.8%) used NLU and RL respectively, whereas 5 (21.7%) used conversational AI. One DBCI used virtual reality (4.3%). The types of AI used by AI-DBCI are summarized in Table  4 .\n\nMost AI-DBCIs reviewed (n\u00bc21, 91.3%) used proprietary AI rather than licensing capabilities.

Most research questions related to the effectiveness or efficacy of the AI-DBCI (n\u00bc28, 87.5%). One article explored economic impact of the intervention,  80  whereas 2 evaluated user engagement with the AI-DBCI,  88, 98  and 1 evaluated usability. 100 Summary of Evidence. Most studies reported positive results supportive of the AI-DBCI (n\u00bc24, 75%). Four studies reported mixed results (12.5%), whereas 2 reported null results (6.3%) and 2 did not have directional results (6.3%).\n\nObserved Limitations. The most common type of limitation mentioned was measurement issues such as inability to directly measure the phenomena of interest or use of self-report rather than objective measures (n\u00bc17, 53.1%). Other common limitations included generalizability of the sample population (n\u00bc16, 50%), small sample sizes (n\u00bc12, 37.5%), inability to establish causality with the study design (n\u00bc11, 34.4%), measurement time frames being too short (n\u00bc10, 31.3%), and technology or design issues with the AI-DBCI (n\u00bc7, 21.9%).

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The interdisciplinary nature of AI and its potential for transforming DBCIs emphasize the importance of scoping reviews to map the literature on evolving or emerging topics. This scoping review identified 32 articles describing 23 AI-DBCIs that use AI as core functionality. The most common behavioral domains were cardiometabolic health and lifestyle change, frequently supported by target behaviors physical activity and diet. Most AI-DBCIs were tested in the United States and used proprietary ML or AI technology. Classical ML algorithms were the most common methods used, followed by NLU, RL, and conversational AI. Research on the use of AI-DBCIs was largely positive (likely partly due to the file drawer problem 103 ), suggesting effectiveness to change behavior and good user experience. There were also common limitations to the research. Specifically, many of the studies either were not designed to establish causality of outcomes or experienced other methodologic or technology issues that merit further study (Table  5 ).\n\nThe evidence in this review supports the promise of AI-DBCIs but making clear they are still nascent. It is only recently that sophisticated AI techniques have become accessible for use in DBCIs; the earliest research in this review is from 2015  91  and the bulk of the research from 2018 onward. At the same\n\nRoby X Sweetch X Tough Talks X Woebot-SUDs X Total 2 3 4 2 1 2 13 1 1 2 2 Abbreviations: CBP, chronic back pain; CBT-CP, cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain; DBCI, digital behavior change interventions; PAUL, Playful Active Urban Living; PERSPeCT, Patient Experience Recommender System for Persuasive Communication Tailoring; PowerED, Prescription Opioid Wellness and Engagement Research in the Emergency Department; SUDs, substance use disorders.\n\ntime, it is no small task to leverage AI. Developing an AI-DBCI can be technologically and ethically complex, which warrants early exploratory research such as the studies reviewed in this study to test the approach before scaling it or investing in more rigorous investigation.  104 Moreover, the volume of data needed to adequately train AI models creates natural time constraints for generating long-term evidence. It is interesting that most reviewed DBCIs use proprietary AI, given these challenges.\n\nThe newness of AI-DBCIs also limits evidence of impact. None of the included AI-DBCIs are available direct to consumer (consistent with recent scoping reviews  4  ), which means people must qualify for access through a research study or organizational initiative. Sometimes, this method of access is responsible for generalizability issues in AI-DBCI research, such as when the study population is recruited entirely from the Veterans Health Administration  73  or work for the university where the research is conducted.  71 nce someone accesses the AI-DBCI, it may take months or years to fully understand outcomes; for example, behavior changes for people with diabetes can take several months to affect A1c values.  105 Many of the studies in this review were not long enough to detect such outcomes, but it is likely that research is underway. As the use of AI-DBCIs becomes more mainstream, we expect an accumulation of higher quality evidence for the use of AI to change real-world behaviorsdespecially as randomized controlled trials showing causal impact will be necessary for widespread clinical adoption 106 and with innovative approaches such as just-in-time adaptive interventions and N-of-1 experimentation available to use. Research on safety and appropriate use will be needed alongside research on AI-DBCI effectiveness.\n\nDespite pervasive limitations, most of the included research was rated as moderate or strong in terms of evidence quality. Although the EPHPP is an accepted quality assessment tool,  68, 107  it focuses largely on study design and how research is reported. Limitations such as short evaluation timeframes or inability to directly measure outcomes are not captured by the tool, nor is the real-world significance of the research. Moreover, self-reported research limitations were not a reliable indicator of quality. The number and type of reported limitations may better correlate to the rigor of the publication outlet or the standards of the researchers than the underlying quality of the work. Although the quality assessments and review of limitations help identify weaknesses in research publications, we caution against using them in isolation. A substantial opportunity area uncovered by this scoping review is developing a shared and accurate understanding of AI among people who design DBCIs. Many records (511) were excluded from this review on the basis of not describing a true AI approach, yet in some cases, the authors explicitly described their interventions as using ML or AI. Sometimes, this was attributable to advances in AI that render earlier approaches irrelevant, but it was often due to either misunderstanding or misrepresentation. Furthermore, it was necessary to include a skilled AI scientist in this scoping review to parse what was represented as ML and AI. Rigor around AI's terminology and accurate description of its use in AI-DBCIs are necessities to inform generalizability and extension of findings, particularly as the social sciences grapple with the need to improve reproducibility in the aftermath of their replication crisis.  108 The reliance on proprietary AI in DBCIs may add to this challenge by limiting comparisons between approaches.\n\nA related issue in this scoping review is our deliberate use of the generic term \"classical ML algorithm\" to describe the AI in some AI-DBCIs. Although some articles detailed the underlying techniques, others were extremely vague. It is likely that some AI-DBCIs in the classical ML algorithm category have heterogeneous approaches that were not documented in this review owing to a lack of information in the original report, thereby limiting our ability to draw conclusions about specific algorithm types and their effects.\n\nIn addition to developing rigor in how AI is described, it is also advisable to work directly with experts in designing AI-DBCIs to ensure optimal use. Someone with deep knowledge of AI can recommend appropriate tools to achieve behavioral objectives, as well as guide model development and training; this in turn will enable future research to parse which AI models are best suited for purpose and what AI-DBCIs are most effective for specific objectives. Expert collaborators can ensure that quality is acceptable by overseeing model evaluation research.  109 Understanding the underlying technology also supports ethical design. When it comes to risks, benefits, and implementation considerations, not all AI is created equal. For example, federated learning, a way to train ML models with consolidated data, has challenges for user experience 110 which should be considered if that approach is used in an AI-DBCI. Expert collaborators can help.\n\nIt is notable that none of the AI-DBCIs reviewed AI-generated content, given media focus on LLMs specifically.  15 In fact, most real-world health care applications of ChatGPT 111 (a specific system leveraging LLMs) are for expert use, not patients.  112 his speaks to the risks inherent in LLM use, which include the potential for misinformation.  113, 114 The accessibility of open source LLMs may make it too easy for missteps to occur. For example, in order to be effective in a health setting, an LLM must be trained against domain-relevant data, 115 yet an assessment of health care related data sets shows a lack of alignment with clinically relevant benchmarks.  116 Despite the excitement about LLMs, they are not yet ready for use in patient-facing AI-DBCIs."

      "text": "The use of AI in DBCIs to influence real-world health behaviors is limited but growing. Twenty-three AI-DBCIs were reviewed, offering insights into the health domains and behavior types where AI has been deployed to further behavior change. Evidence quality and ability to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of using AI in DBCIs reflect the novelty of the AI-DBCI approach but are expected to rapidly improve with advancements in technology and more widespread adoption of AI techniques. A significant opportunity area is for people who develop DBCIs to become more conversant in the terminology of AI, so they can appropriately describe their interventions as well as better understand the available technologies to be leveraged in support of behavior change. More rigorous and accurate terminology will support the successful and ethical use of AI to drive health behavior change and positively impact outcomes."
