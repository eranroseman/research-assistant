  "title": "Dropout Rate in Digital Health Interventions for the Prevention of Skin Cancer: Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Metaregression",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital strategies are innovative approaches to the prevention of skin cancer, but the attrition following this kind of intervention needs to be analyzed. \n Objective: The aim of this paper is to assess the dropouts from studies focused on digital strategies for the prevention of skin cancer. \n Methods: We conducted this systematic review with meta-analyses and metaregression according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statements. Search terms for skin cancer, digital strategies, and prevention were combined to search PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from inception until July 2022. Randomized clinical trials that reported dropouts of participants and compared digital strategies with other interventions to prevent skin cancer in healthy or disease-free participants were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data for analysis. The Revised Cochrane Collaboration Bias tool was employed. We calculated the pooled dropout rate of participants through a meta-analysis of proportions and examined whether dropout was more or less frequent in digital interventions against comparators via an odds ratio (OR) meta-analysis. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted in a meta-analysis of proportions and OR meta-analysis to assess the dropout events when data were sorted by digital interventions or control comparator. A univariate metaregression based on a random-effects model assessed possible moderators of dropout. Participants' dropout rates as pooled proportions were calculated for all groups combined, and the digital and comparator groups separately. OR>1 indicated higher dropouts for digital-based interventions. Metaregressions were performed for age, sex, length of intervention, and sample size. Results: A total of 17 studies were included. The overall pooled dropout rate was 9.5% (95% CI 5.0-17.5). The subgroup meta-analysis of proportions revealed a dropout rate of 11.6% for digital strategies (95% CI 6.8-19.0) and 10.0% for comparators (95% CI 5.5-17.7). A trend of higher dropout rates for digital strategies was observed in the overall (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98-1.36) and subgroup OR meta-analysis, but no significant differences were found between the groups. None of the covariates moderated the effect size in the univariate metaregression. Conclusions: Digital strategies had a higher dropout rate compared to other prevention interventions, but the difference was not significant. Standardization is needed regarding reporting the number of and reasons for dropouts.",

      "text": "Digital strategies have experienced a boom in use in prevention programs for skin cancer in recent years. Primary and secondary prevention programs are the mainstay to reduce the incidence rate of skin cancer  [1] . In fact, recent publications have stated a stabilization in melanoma incidence in young cohorts, due to governmental efforts to promote prevention programs  [2] . Nonetheless, cases of melanoma will continue to rise in the coming years, primarily in older adults  [3] . The continuous rise in the incidence of skin cancer in recent decades suggests a current global public threat  [4, 5] .\n\nDigital strategies seem to be more effective in the prevention of skin cancer than other conventional strategies  [6] . The former can be defined as interventions provided through a digital environment such as web-based interventions, smartphone apps, SMS text messaging, web-based videos, or wearable devices  [7] . Digital approaches to the prevention of skin cancer present additional advantages such as feedback, interactivity, accessibility, and gamification, which make them suitable and attractive for stakeholders  [8, 9] . Conversely, possible drawbacks of digital strategies in dermatology could be their availability, financial aspects, reliability, security, confidentially, and lack of education and training of the user  [10] . Given all these issues, the feasibility of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in digital health research continues to be discussed  [11, 12] . However, digital strategies such as telemedicine in different areas of health care are expected to continue growing in the coming years  [13] .\n\nThe engagement of the patients with the prevention and digital strategies determines their effectiveness. Despite the increasing interest of researchers in implementing RCTs that analyze digital strategies, there is still no consensus in the literature on whether they positively or negatively influence the dropout and adherence of participants  [14, 15] . However, some authors have reported that the dropout rate was higher in digital strategies than analogue interventions  [16, 17] . Some of the reasons for the higher loss of participants could be the participant's reluctance to join remote research studies and mistrust in sharing data  [18] . Dropout or attrition is a constant challenge for researchers in RCTs and other longitudinal studies  [19, 20] . In addition, characteristics of the target population could influence attrition, because maintaining prevention behaviors in healthy participants could be challenging  [21] . The absence of perceiving disease, geographical location, or accessibility are some of the factors that could lead to the failure of long-term prevention strategies  [22, 23] . Disentangling the factors and trend in dropouts in RCTs would help researchers develop future digital interventions for the prevention of skin cancer.\n\nNo previous studies have analyzed dropout in digital strategies for skin cancer prevention; therefore, our aim was to systematically assess and meta-analyze the existing RCTs to calculate the overall pooled dropout rate and to examine possible factors that could influence the dropout of users."

      "title": "Quantitative Assessment of Data",
      "text": "A dropout was considered when a participant did not complete the intervention or follow-up period, after the randomization process. For studies that included more than 2 groups of intervention, we separately analyzed the comparison groups two by two. Dropout data were extracted from the text of the randomized controlled trials provided in either a flowchart, in the description of participants, in the results sections, or in the discussion.\n\nTo analyze data, we used the free software R Studio version 4.1.1. (R foundation for Statistical Computing) metafor (version 3.0-2)  [26] , meta (version 5.1-1)  [27] , and dmetar (version 0.0.9000) [28]  packages. The analysis consisted of overall and subgroups proportion and odds ratio (OR)-based meta-analyses and metaregression.\n\nA random-effects model was employed in all meta-analyses considering possible heterogeneity between our selected RCTs. Furthermore, heterogeneity was assessed with I 2 , with values exceeding 50% indicating large heterogeneity. The subgroup meta-analysis and metaregression was run when at least 3 arms of study were available.\n\nThe meta-analysis of proportions allowed us to calculate the overall pooled dropout rate with its 95% CI of all arms of the studies included in our review  [29, 30] . Additionally, a subgroup analysis was performed to calculate the pooled dropout rate for digital or comparator interventions and to determine which type of intervention resulted in the highest dropout rate. This analysis was complemented by an OR subgroup analysis ordered by digital or intervention comparator to determine whether the probability of losing the participants was greater in one group or another.\n\nThe OR meta-analysis evaluated whether the event (dropout) was more or less frequent in the digital or comparator intervention. When the OR was less than 1, dropouts were less likely in digital strategies. To assess the measure of effect on binary outcomes, the OR with a 95% CI was calculated, and the inverse variance method was used to adjust the pooled estimations to sparse data. The restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for \u03c4 2 estimated the variance among RCTs  [31] . When studies reported zero events in one or all groups of intervention, we added a 0.5 continuity correction to the meta-analyses so that these studies could contribute to the overall sample size of the review  [32] . The OR meta-analyses were conducted and subsequently described in terms of absolute values. The results of the meta-analyses were displayed in forest plots.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was carried out to detect how studies influenced the effect size. When a study was identified as an outlier based on the dropout variable, it was removed from the analysis. Furthermore, to confirm previous results, we performed an exploratory analysis using the L'Abb\u00e9, Baujat plot, Leave-One-Out meta-analysis, and influence plot.\n\nA univariate metaregression analysis based on a random-effects model assessed the continuous variables of age, female percentage, male percentage, length of intervention in months, and sample size as covariates of the occurrence of dropouts. These predictors were selected to determine how the characteristics of the participants and interventions could influence dropouts  [33] . Bubble plots were used to illustrate how a covariate modified the effect size in the metaregression analysis."

The complete process is shown in Figure  1 .

      "text": "This systematic review synthesizes information on the attrition of RCTs based on eHealth interventions for the prevention of skin cancer. Quantitative analysis evaluated the pooled dropout rate and dropout OR, in addition to moderators that could influence the dropout of subjects in the meta-analyzed RCTs. Although the digital strategies employed within studies used different platforms or devices, all of them were focused on skin cancer prevention and were supervised by expert dermatologists.\n\nThe meta-analysis of proportions showed a pooled dropout rate of 9.5%, with a dropout rate of 11.6% and 10.0% for the eHealth interventions and comparators, respectively. These results are in line with the findings by Walters et al  [51] , who reviewed the retention in RCTs of health technology programs in the United Kingdom. This review established that there was a dropout rate of up to 11% in a significant proportion of RCTs. Dropout rates of 5% are likely to introduce bias, while if 20% is exceeded, this could affect the validity of the study due to insufficiency during data analysis  [52, 53] . No background research was found performing similar analyses in the dermatology literature, so the comparison of rates was not viable.\n\nEysenbach et al  [20]  hypothesized that the nature of digital strategies tends to a higher loss of participants, a phenomenon called the \"Law of attrition.\" Although a slightly higher dropout rate was observed in digital strategies compared with comparator groups in our proportion and OR meta-analysis, the difference was not significant. Our findings refute the \"Law of attrition\" in those studies that aim to prevent skin cancer through these innovative interventions.\n\nPrevious systematic reviews, such as Bevens et al  [54] , focused on the analysis of attrition of digital strategies in people with multiple sclerosis and found no significant differences between dropout rates in participants allocated to digital or control interventions. Although our findings are in line with these previous findings, the target population and research conditions differed from ours, so comparison of findings are difficult.\n\nAs in the overall OR meta-analysis, the subgroup meta-analysis sorted by type of digital strategy and comparators found no significant differences in dropout rate. Only SMS text messaging presented a lower odd of dropout compared with other digital interventions, but without statistical significance. Reminder-based interventions such as SMS seem to promote adherence in chronic conditions, but further research is still needed  [55] . It is noteworthy that the dropout rates in participants allocated to no intervention showed losses similar to digital strategies, reflecting the prior expectation that they could be affected by nonexperimental factors and the loss of perspective of therapeutics goals  [56] .\n\nOur metaregression found that none of the covariates moderated the interventions' effect size. Nonetheless, Torous et al  [17]  obtained higher dropout rates in studies with larger sample sizes that used apps for depressive symptoms, possibly related to a lower rate of individual follow-up and feedback from subjects.\n\nIn addition to the moderator analysis, assessment of the reasons for dropping out could be a way to identify barriers to reduce attrition in future RCTs. However, the lack of transparency and homogeneity in reporting reasons for participants' dropout in the studies included in this review made the aforementioned task challenging. The main reported cause of attrition in our RCTs was loss to follow-up, but this aspect did not show the real reason for the loss of participants."

      "title": "Research Implications",
      "text": "As previously mentioned, dropout could threaten internal or external validity in studies. We recommend that researchers use our overall pooled dropout rate to calculate the sample size of future trials, avoiding possible threats. The overrecruitment of 10.1% in the sample size of RCTs may be a suitable way to overcome external validity risks  [57, 58] .\n\nAlthough our OR meta-analysis showed no differences in attrition between digital strategies and comparator interventions, in order to obtain conclusive results that can be turned into daily clinical practice, we point out the need for further research with head-to-head comparison between digital and conventional interventions (eg, education programs or brochures) for the prevention of skin cancer  [59] . Dropout rates have previously been directly related to the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention  [60, 61] .\n\nGiven the scarce information and lack of transparency provided by studies when reporting the number of and reasons for dropouts, a deep change in the research framework is needed. To overcome this obstacle, relevant guidelines such as Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials report the need to detail the reasons and the number of participants lost during the study period  [62, 63] . Accurately following these guidelines would pave the way for researchers to find suitable dropout prevention plans. Previous literature, based on user experience with digital strategies, indicates that reliability, lack of technological education, lack of satisfaction with intervention, and sparse human feedback seem to be the main barriers to their use  [63] [64] [65] . We encourage future researchers who aim to develop a digital strategy or perform RCT protocols to implement solutions to the mentioned barriers such as gamification, tailored and customizable e-interventions, personalized feedback, or programmed reminders (eg, mail and SMS). The gamification principles of meaningful purpose, meaningful choice, supporting player archetypes, feedback, and visibility proposed by Floryan et al  [66]  could enhance the user experience and engagement within digital health interventions. Gamification could increase motivation, reinforce learning objectives, and increase enjoyment and positive experiences in dermatological education and prevention approaches  [9] . Likewise, programmed reminders are an effective way to promote prevention habits, highlighted by the use of text messages in dermatology  [64] . Reminders associated with professional supervision have shown even greater results in prevention programs  [67] .\n\nGiven that RCTs are the first step required to translate research results into clinical settings, success in decreasing the number of participants dropping out within the research context could improve long-term engagement in digital programs for the prevention of skin cancer."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "This review has several strengths. Our study provided an initial analysis of the dropout from RCTs to prevent skin cancer through digital strategies. Our computed rates could help calculate sample sizes in future studies. We performed a sensitivity analysis that helped us detect outliers and confirm the absence of publication bias. Moreover, the subgroups and metaregression analyses allowed us to understand how loss of participants could be modified by different predictors.\n\nThe main limitation of our review is that potential literature from other databases with non-English records could have been missing. Furthermore, our outcomes may have been conditioned by the heterogeneity of the experimental interventions in the included studies. Some of the studies compared digital strategies with no intervention, so we cannot assert that dropouts from these groups could be related to external factors. Evidence from the subgroup meta-analysis sorted by an active comparator group should be interpreted with caution because of the low number of analyzed studies; further research is needed to obtain strong evidence. We were unable to propose tailored advice to improve retention for this kind of RCT owing to the sparse information on reasons for dropout provided by the authors."

Although a slightly higher pooled dropout rate was recorded for digital strategies, the OR-based meta-analysis did not show significant differences against the comparator groups. Our meta-analyses of subgroups sorted by digital and comparator interventions did not present significant statistical differences. Age, sex, length of the intervention, and sample size did not modify the effect size, so they were not moderators of dropout. We highlight the need to follow the guidelines and standardize reporting of the number of and reasons for participants' dropout because this will be the only effective way to design a successful plan to reduce the loss of participants in studies that analyze digital approaches to prevent skin cancer."
