  "title": "Detecting latent topics and trends in educational technologies over four decades using structural topic modeling: A retrospective of all volumes of Computers & Education",
  "abstract": "Computers & Education has been leading the field of computers in education for over 40 years, during which time it has developed into a well-known journal with significant influences on the educational technology research community. Questions such as \"in what research topics were the academic community of Computers & Education interested?\" \"how did such research topics evolve over time?\" and \"what were the main research concerns of its major contributors?\" are important to both the editorial board and readership of Computers & Education. To address these issues, this paper conducted a structural topic modeling analysis of 3963 articles published in Computers & Education between 1976 and 2018 bibliometrically. A structural topic model was used to profile the research hotspots. By further exploring annual topic proportion trends and topic correlations, potential future research directions and inter-topic research areas were identified. The major research concerns of the publications in Computers & Education by prolific countries/regions were shown and compared. Thus, this work provided useful insights and implications, and it could be used as a guide for contributors to Computers & Education.",

      "text": "Technologies have a significant impact on humans and society. They have changed our ways of thinking, feeling, and acting, as well as how we communicate and obtain knowledge  (Kenski, 2008, p. 21) . The ways we learn and teach have been dramatically influenced by technological advancements  (Martin et al., 2011) , and technology used for educational purposes has been progressively growing  (Berrett, Murphy, & Sullivan, 2012; Inan; Lowther, 2010) .\n\nMany universities and academics incorporate innovative technology-based educational methods both inside and outside the classroom to suit different learners' needs and to stay competitive within the worldwide educational markets  (Stacey & Gerbic, 2008; Garrison & Kanuka, 2004) . There has been increasing interest in the uses of technology among teachers and educators since the early 2000s  (Bonk & Graham, 2005)  through face-to-face and online instructions for course teaching  (Margulieux, McCracken, & 1987 -1996 , the community focused mainly on stand-alone multimedia learning. In the period 1997-2006, issues relevant to networked computer use for enhancing collaborative learning showed precedence. Online learning attracted more attention during the period 2007-2016. Yet, for topic detection and tracking, topic modeling is considered more flexible and effective than alternative approaches such as document clustering  (Kuhn, 2018) . Topic modeling serves as a natural language processing method to uncover topics hidden within large quantities of textual data  (Nielsen & B\u20ac orjeson, 2019) . It has been proven to be a valuable and suitable tool to uncover meaningful topics from substantial quantities of text data  (Jiang, Qiang, & Lin, 2016; McFarland et al., 2013; Nichols, 2014) . Wide ranges of recent studies have been conducted to apply topic modeling to research areas concerning social sciences (e.g.,  Vilares & He, 2017; Hannigan et al., 2019; Park, Chung, & Park, 2019; Franz, Nook, Mair, & Nock, 2019; Ye, Zhao, Shang, & Zhang, 2019; Houghton et al., 2019; Bastani; Namavari, & Shaffer, 2019) . However, the use of topic modeling for exploration of research topics in relation to the educational field is still limited.\n\nTo this end, the present study conducted a topic-based bibliometric analysis of the 3963 articles of Computers & Education during the period 1976-2018. The major research topics, their trends over time, their correlations, and their distributions across influential countries/regions and institutes, were analysed and presented. In addition, the major contributors to the Computers & Education , as well as the scientific collaborations among them, were identified and depicted for the first time. Specifically, this study focused on five major research questions:\n\n(1) Which countries/regions and institutions were the major contributors to Computers & Education?\n\n(2) What were the scientific collaborations among major contributors like? (3)  In what research topics were the Computers & Education community interested ? (4) How did such research topics evolve over time? (5) What were the main research concerns of the major contributors?"

      "title": "Data retrieval and preprocessing",
      "text": "The Computers & Education articles during the period 1976-2018 were retrieved from Web of Science, using the search strategy \"Publication Name \u00bc Computers & Education.\" The results were then restricted to original research articles  (Geng et al., 2017) . A total of 3963 articles were retrieved. Citations of these articles were also retrieved up to July 06, 2019.\n\nThe primary materials of the topic modeling were the title, keywords, and abstract of each article. It is commonly agreed that titles, abstracts, and article keywords are suitable for conceptual reviews, because they usually represent the noteworthy content of articles  (Cretchley, Rooney, & Gallois, 2010; Zhong, Geng, Liu, Gao, & Chen, 2016 ). In addition, abstracts are able to present summaries of articles in terms of research aims and problems, as well as major findings  (Lee, Jung, & Song, 2016; Yan, 2015) . Of the articles collected, 621 articles without abstracts were excluded, and 3342 articles with abstract information were selected for topic modeling analysis. The dataset, as well as the sources for the analysis codes, are available online.  2 n the analysis of prolific countries/regions, articles affiliated to England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland were unified into articles of the UK. However, articles affiliated to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan were individually calculated.\n\nTo improve the data quality before conducting the topic modeling, pre-processing was performed. Firstly, numbers, punctuation, symbols, and stop words (e.g., \"me,\" \"I,\" \"or,\" \"him,\" \"a,\" and \"they\") were deleted to enhance consistency and reduce computational load  (Boyd-Graber & Blei, 2009; Hoffman, Bach, & Blei, 2010) . Secondly, terms with multiple spellings were consolidated (e.g., \"behaviour\" and \"behaviour\"). Thirdly, terms were converted to the singular form and lower case. We then assigned the weights 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2 to terms from keywords, titles, and abstracts, separately, as suggested by  (Chen et al., 2018c) . Since in topic modeling, the estimations of document-topic and topic-term distributions are based on the document-term distribution, which is frequency-based, the assignment of weights was performed by multiplying the frequency by weight. For example, for each document, if f 1wi ,f 2wi ,f 3wi denoted the frequencies of word w i amongst the keywords, titles, and abstracts respectively, then the weighted frequency of word w i in the document was denoted by 0:"

      "title": "Structural topic modeling",
      "text": "To identify the topics of the 3342 articles with abstract information, we employed a newly developed topic modeling method, the structural topic modeling (STM)  (Roberts, Stewart, & Tingley, 2014; Roberts et al., 2014) . The graphical representation map for topic modeling, adapted from  Nabli, Djemaa, and Amor (2018) , is shown in Fig.  2 . Topic modeling considers each document as being composed of terms, each topic as a distribution over terms, and each document as a combination of topics. Given K topics for the d th document and V terms for the k th topic, STM performs two major tasks toward estimating the distributions of the document-topic \u03b8 d and the topic-term \u03b2 k . A variational expectation maximization (VEM) method was applied to the estimation of parameters  (Roberts, Stewart, & Airoldi, 2016) .\n\nAlthough STM is relatively new, applications of it in topic detecting research are common. For example, Reich, Tingley, Leder-Luis,  Roberts, and Stewart (2015)  adopted STM to uncover topics hidden in discussion forum posts of an online course. Tvinnereim and Fl\u00f8ttum (2015)  implemented STM to explore people's understanding of climate change. By utilizing STM,  Das, Dixon, Sun, Dutta, and Zupancich (2017)  identified the research themes discussed in transportation articles. Their study demonstrated that STM enabled the creation of tools for investigating the topic prevalence and relevant trends in the research.\n\nIn this study, an R package, named stm  (Roberts, Stewart, & Tingley, 2014)  was utilized. STM is an unsupervised modeling method, one essential step of which is to decide upon the number of topics before modeling. Existing research work demonstrated that an exclusive reliance on statistical measures could result in a less meaningful model parameter choice  (Levy & Franklin, 2014) . Thus, following the suggestions of previous studies  (Farrell, 2016; Tvinnereim & Fl\u00f8ttum, 2015) , we ran a set of models by setting topic numbers as  20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35 . Two domain experts independently compared the 16 models with different numbers of topics by inspecting the representative terms and articles  (Jiang, Qiang, Fan, & Zhang, 2018) , based on the following criteria.\n\n(1) Representative terms in each topic could form a meaningful topic together;\n\n(2) The top representative articles for each topic were in close relation to the topic;\n\n(3) There was no overlap between topics within one topic model; (4) All important topics in educational technology were included.\n\nBased on the above criteria, the two domain experts independantly selected the best fitting model. It turned out that they both selected the 24-topic model. The 24-topic model was identifiedsince qualitative evaluation also indicated that this number produced the greatest semantic consistency within topics, as well as exclusivity between topics.\n\nTo illustrate the robustness over topics, an analysis of the 24-topic estimation was compared against the estimations with fewer topics (e.g., K \u00bc 23) and more topics (e.g., K \u00bc 25). Table  2  shows the comparisons between the 23-, 24-, and 25-topic models. The problem of using fewer than 24 topics was that meaningful research issues were confounded. For example, in the 23-topic estimation, as shown in Table  S1  in the Supplementary materials, Human-computer interaction and Virtual reality were combined into one topic. Compared to the 24-topic model, in the 25-topic model (see Table  S2  in the Supplementary materials), the topics Human-computer interaction and Program and curriculum were abstent, and the topics Evaluation and organization, Communication channels, and Teaching methods appeared. As human-computer interaction had gradually evolved into an established field of teaching and research  (Gross, 2014) , it had been a broadly studied and essential issue in educational technology, and as such it could not be overlooked. Thus, we finalized the input by selecting the 24-topic model, as it captured all major research issues in the field of computers and education."

      "title": "Analysis of STM results",
      "text": "The analyses of the model results included topics' interpretations, proportions, trends, and correlations, as well as their distribution across influential countries/regions and institutions. We first interpreted the statistical results into important topics relevant to the field of computer-or technology-enhanced education. We then obtained the most discriminating terms for each of the topics based on a distribution matrix of topics and terms  (Roberts et al., 2016) . The label for each topic was identified and summarized by two domain experts. Specifically, the following steps were set for conducting the labeling task.\n\n(1) Interpretation of the discriminating terms within topics based on their semantic meanings;\n\n(2) Examination of a sample of representative articles for each of the topics;\n\n(3) Comparison of the labeling results of the two experts, with the inconsistent labels being discussed and unified.\n\nTake the topic Context learning & Collaborative learning as an example. The two domain experts first examined the most representative terms such as \"collaborative,\" \"cooperative,\" \"collaboration,\" \"context-aware,\" and \"computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL)\" and found that they were all context-or collaboration-related. Next, they examined the three most representative articles for this topic, details of which are presented as follows. (1)  Splichal, Oshima, and Oshima (2018)  developed and evaluated a computer-based collaborative learning setting for project-enhanced learning . (2)  Hwang, Chu, Lin, and Tsai (2011)  explored how Mindtool could support students' learning with a context-aware ubiquitous learning process and compared it to learning with a conventional ubiquitous learning process. (3)  Hwang, Wang, and Sharples (2007)  evaluated the use and influence of a web-based annotation application in online learning, with the employment of collaborative mechanisms of group and full annotation-sharing to enhance learners' annotation motivation. The first and third articles were related to collaborative learning, while the second related to context learning. The two domain experts discussed with each other; based on the examination results of the representative terms and articles, and named the topic Context learning & Collaborative learning. For the topic Online/web-based learning, the two domain experts first inspected the discriminating terms such as \"podcasting,\" \"distance,\" \"tele-learning,\" \"medium,\" \"podcast,\" and \"computer-mediated,\" which pertained to online/web services, as well as terms such as \"post-secondary,\" \"education,\" \"teaching-learning,\" \"higher,\" \"university,\" and \"institutional,\" which were education-or learning-related. Then, they examined the top three representative articles of Online/web-based learning to verify the label. These are as follows. (1)  Shneiderman (1998)  published an article concerning a teaching or learning philosophy for cyber-generation. (2)  Walls et al. (2010)  investigated learners' readiness and attitudes towards tedious and supplementary podcasting. (3)  Beyth-Marom, Chajut, Roccas, and Sagiv (2003)  examined differences in terms of demographics, achievements, and value priorities between learning in internet-based and traditional distance-learning environments. The aforementioned three all related to learning using cyber, podcasting, internet, and distance services, all of which could be considered as online/web-based learning. Thus, considering the representative terms and research work, we labelled the topic Online/web-based learning. Following the same strategy, welabelled the other 22 topics.\n\nNext, to investigate the popularity and prevalence of each topic in the computer-or technology-enhanced education research, we calculated topics' proportions based on a \u03b8 matrix estimated by STM, where \u03b8 ij (i \u00bc 1; 2;\u2026; 3324j \u00bc 1; 2; \u202624) was the probability of"

Since an article could be related to more than one topic, we considered the probability of each article to each topic, rather than selecting only the topic with the highest proportion. For instance, in a four-topic model, one document might be 55% related to Topic 1 and 15% to each of Topics 2, 3, and 4. Thus, in this study, for article i, its proportions over all the 24 topics were denoted as \u03b8 i;1 \u03b8 i;2 , \u2026, and \u03b8 i;24 , respectively, where \u03b8 i;1 \u00fe\u03b8 i;2 \u00fe \u2026 \u00fe\u03b8 i;24 \u00bc 1. For topic j, the proportions were denoted \u03b8 1;j \u03b8 2;j , \u2026, and \u03b8 3324;j , respectively. Thus, to indicate how popular each topic was, we summed the proportions of each article by topic to obtain the proportions for each topic, that is, \u03b8 1;j \u00fe\u03b8 2;j \u00fe \u2026 \u00fe\u03b8 3324;j . To investigate if the identified topics exhibited increasing or decreasing trends, we applied the Mann-Kendall statistical test  (Mann, 1945) . We employed an R package called huge  (Zhao, Liu, Roeder, Lafferty, & Wasserman, 2012)  to indicate how the topics correlated to each other, which visually displayed correlations based on a semi-parametric Gaussian procedure. In the graph, each topic was represented by a circle, with the size being proportional to the topic's proportion. Topics connected by a dotted line were more likely to be discussed within a paper. A shorter link between two topics indicated a stronger correlation between the two. Moreover, we identified and compared the topic distributions for prolific countries/regions and institutions. Using the topic proportion metric of prolific countries/regions (or institutions) in json format as the dataset, we implemented a graphing tool named Cluster Purity Visualizer  (Swamy, 2016)  to obtain a basic distribution graph. Using JavaScript packages d3.v3.js foot_2  and clusterpur-ityChart.js, foot_3  the basic graph was then modified to conduct layout adjustment and coloring."

Such results demonstrated the growing influence and impact of Computers & Education in academia. Until 2004, the annual number of citations was comparatively low, remaining below 350. Since then, this number seemed to have grown exponentially, reaching a peak of 14,972 in 2017. The slight drop observed in the citation count for the most recent year (2018) might result from the citation time-window. From this, it is reasonable to predict that the annual number of citations will continue to increase in future."

These analyses were a continuation of the study by  Chen et al. (2019c) , which reported the top influential countries and institutions, as measured by the Hirsch index.\n\nA total of 85 countries/regions contributed to the 3963 articles comprising the Computers & Education corpus. Despite of the large geographic distribution of the article contributors, the top 11 countries/regions ranked by the article count in Table  3  together contributed to more than 73% of the 3963 articles. In terms of the Hirsch index, the USA (78), Taiwan (76), the UK (56), Spain (43), and the Netherlands (41) were the top five countries/regions. It is worth noting that although Taiwan contributed far fewer articles than the USA, its Hirsch index value was very close to that of the USA. This showed the wide influences of the articles published by academics affiliated with Taiwan institutions in Computers & Education.\n\nTable  4  displays the 15 most prolific institutions. These institutions altogether contributed to nearly 20% of the total corpus. Among these 15, eight were from Taiwan; and three of the top four were also from Taiwan, demonstrating the dominant position of the publications by institutions from Taiwan in the community of Computers & Education. National Taiwan Normal University contributed the most (92 articles), followed by The Open University from the UK (83), National Taiwan University of Science and Technology from Taiwan (73), and National Central University from Taiwan (63). In terms of the Hirsch index, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, and National Central University were the top three institutions. National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, though exhibiting a relatively low article count as compared to National Taiwan Normal University, had a much higher Hirsch index value.

In the network, countries/regions and institutions were represented by nodes. The size of each node denoted the article count of each country/region or institution. The various forms of groupings were colored differently according to continental or national/regional information.\n\nThe collaborative network connecting the top 20 most prolific countries/regions is shown in Fig.  4 , including 95 links and 20 nodes. Of these 20 countries/regions, the USA, the UK, Taiwan, and Germany collaborated with the most countries/regions, each with 17, 15, 14, and 14 respectively.

      "text": "The results of the STM analysis showed that the most frequently used terms in the 3342 articles included \"learning (in 2500 articles),\" \"student (2351),\" \"education (1840),\" \"environment (1450),\" \"technology (1355),\" \"system (1256),\" and \"computer (1099).\" As stated by  Grimmer and Stewart (2013) , the key methodological point is to \"validate, validate, and validate.\" Thus, we further implemented three other topic-modeling approaches including latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)  (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003)  using VEM, Gibbs sampling, and latent semantic analysis (LSA) to verify the results. The 24-topic model showed the best fitting performance, and the interpretations of the 24 topics for the four methods were approximately identical, as exemplified and demonstrated in Table  5 . For instance, regarding the topic Game-based learning, several game-related terms such as \"game,\" \"gaming,\" \"gameplay,\" \"gamification,\" \"play,\" \"game-based,\" and \"playing,\" appeared consistently across the four topic models. As for the topic Technology acceptance model, the four methods all identified terms such as \"acceptance,\" \"perceived,\" \"technology,\"\"satisfaction,\" and \"usefulness\". For the topic Assessment, several assessment-related terms such as \"peer-assessment,\" \"e-assessment,\" \"self-assessment,\" \"assessment,\" and \"feedback,\" were identified by the four models. Thus, using triangulation, we selected the 24-topic model for the exploration of the research topics and topic trends within Computers & Education publications.\n\nTable  6  shows the 24-topic STM results, with the representative terms, topics' proportions within the whole corpus, suggested topic labels, and topical trends. The top five most-discussed topics were Context and collaborative learning (7.49%), E-learning and policy (6.61%), Experiments and methodologies (6.01%), Human-computer interaction (5.31%), and Social network and communities (5.19%).\n\nNote: Topics are ranked by proportion in a descending order.

The remaining three topics, i.e., Demographic issues, Virtual Reality, and Science education, showed no significantly increasing or decreasing trend. The annual proportions of the identified topics are also visualized in Fig.  6 . These analyses were a continuation of the study by  Chen et al.

However, in this study, we focused on the evolution of the topics identified using a topic model.\n\nThe layout of topic correlations, based on a semi-parametric Gaussian procedure, is shown in Fig.  7 . In the figure, a shorter link between two topics indicated a stronger correlation between them. For example, close links among Social network and communities, Online/web-based learning, and Blended learning are presented."

      "text": "The topic distributions of the prolific countries/regions and institutions are visualized in Fig.  8 , which shows a clear picture of which countries/regions or institutions were productive in, and devoted to, particular topics. For example, the UK was more active in Program and curriculum, while Turkey was more interested in Experiments and methodologies. National Taiwan University of Science and Technology and National Central University were more productive in Context and collaborative learning, while the University of Twente and University of Ghent had contributed more to E-learning and policy.\n\nFig.  9  shows the topic proportion distributions by year in the Computers & Education publications. The results clearly showed the dominating research topics for each year. For example, Programming language was the most focused-upon topic in 1991, and Program and curriculum gained the most attention from the Computers & Education community in 1992. In 1993, Conceptual mapping was the predominant focus of the community. Hardware was the most-studied issue in 1994. These results also showed that in earlier years, authors tended to concentrate more on a handful of specific research topics, whereas in the later years, the community seemed to have paid more balanced attention to almost every prominent aspect of research.

      "title": "The most representative research work for each topic",
      "text": "For a profound understanding of the identified topics, we analyzed the most-cited research work for each topic here. For the topic Context and collaborative learning,  Zurita and Nussbaum (2004)  explored how several issues, for example, the inconvenience of coordination and communication, difficulty of material organization, and mobility deficiencies, could be solved within a mobile, computer-enhanced collaborative learning environment. For the topic E-learning and policy,  Pelgrum (2001)  reported findings from an investigation of primary and secondary sectors to understand the major obstacles impeding ICT integration in schools. For Experiments and methodologies, by adopting an experimental design method,  Kebritchi, Hirumi, and Bai (2010)  aimed to discover how computer games affected the achievement and motivation of mathematics learners. For Human-computer interaction, through an examination of secondary school students,  Walraven, Brand-Gruwel, and Boshuizen (2009)  found that students seldom evaluated the information they found online. For Social network and communities, using social constructivist learning as their research framework, Pena-Shaff and Nicholls (  2004 ) examined communication forms and knowledge construction processes of learners utilizing a computer bulletin board system for course discussion. For Program and curriculum, using activity theory as a basis,  Blin and Munro (2008)  presented discussions concerning their preliminary analysis of the teaching practices revolution. For Demographic issues,  Li and Kirkup (2007)  examined the differences between Chinese and British learners in their use of, and attitudes towards, computers and the Internet. In addition, they investigated the gender differences within this context. For Blended learning, Junco (2012) investigated how learners' Facebook use frequencies and activity participation related to their engagement. For Data mining,  Romero, Ventura, and Garc\u00eda (2008)  first surveyed the adoption of data mining technologies in learning management systems, and then provided a tutorial using Moodle. For Online/web-based learning, Jones, Ramanau, Cross, and Healing (2010) reported the major findings from the first period of a project exploring online learning of net generation-age college students. For Multimedia and data-driven studies, Mason, Tornatora, and Pluchino (2013) adopted eye-tracking techniques to explore how students processed texts and graphics online during the process of reading an  illustrated science text. For Technology acceptance model,  Sun, Tsai, Finger, Chen, and Yeh (2008)  examined the factors influencing learners' satisfaction with e-learning. For MOOCs, through evaluating instructional design quality of 76 MOOC courses,  Margaryan, Bianco, and Littlejohn (2015)  concluded that most MOOCs obtained low scores on their instructional design principles and high scores in their organization and presentation of course materials. For Conceptual mapping, through evaluation of the effectiveness of concept mapping for students learning with a hypertext system,  Reader and Hammond (1994)  concluded thatconcept-mapping improved post-test scores as compared to traditional note-taking,. For Virtual reality,  Chittaro and Ranon (2007)  presented discussions on the use of virtual reality for educational purposes, as well as its possible positive and negative effects, and suggested further potential research directions. For Programming language, Chao (2016) studied learners' practices, designs, and problem-solving capabilities concerning computation in the contexts of visual programming. For Mobile learning and early childhood education, Patten, S\ufffd anchez, and Tangney (2006) highlighted that the adoption of handheld devices could promote learning. For Game-based learning, Huang, Huang, and Tschopp (2010) highlighted the requirements of both motivation-based processing and outcome-based processing during the creation of game-based learning activities. For Science education, through evaluation of the unique affordances of augmented reality (AR) in environmental science education, Kamarainen et al. (2013) concluded that a combination of AR and probes had the potential to enhance learning. For Teacher training, Angeli and Valanides (2009) presented several issues regarding technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). For Language learning, Korat. (2010) investigated how reading an e-storybook influenced kindergarten children's language and literacy. For Special education, Parsons, Leonard, and Mitchell (2006) employed a qualitative case-study approach to illustrate the observations of, as well as comments from, two teenagers with autism. For Assessment, through the examination of how different online peer feedback affected high-school students, Tseng and Tsai (2007) highlighted the utility of reinforcing peer feedback, as well as the unsuitability of didactic and corrective feedback for students' development of better projects. For Hardware, through a comparison of remote and hands-on laboratories, Nickerson, Corter, Esche, and Chassapis (2007) presented an innovative method for evaluating the effectiveness and utility of engineering laboratories for educational purposes. From these representative research works, readers can obtain an in-depth understanding of major issues concerned by the Computers & Education community."

      "title": "Interpretations of the most studied topics with significantly increasing trends",
      "text": "Of the topics that exhibited statistically significant increasing trends, four topics registered a proportion exceeding 5%, namely Context and collaborative learning, E-learning and policy, Experiments and methodologies, and Social networks and communities. These topics were the most prominent and significant issues that were discussed among the Computers & Education authors.\n\nFirst, the topic Context and collaborative learning accounted for the largest proportion (7.49%). The discriminating terms such as \"collaborative\", \"cooperative\", \"collaboration\", \"CSCL\", and \"context-aware\" demonstrated the popularity of collaborative learning and context learning in Computers & Education research. CSCL tools had been widely used to assist students to employ collaborative learning to improve learning outcomes  (Splichal et al., 2018) . Fu, Wu, and Ho (2009)  investigated how a productive learning atmosphere was developed in a web-enhanced learning context and concluded that strategies of cooperation within the group and competitions between groups were ideal, because competitions and cooperation promoted development of various types of knowledge.\n\nSecond, E-learning and policy comprised a proportion of 6.61%, with the most discriminating term being \"ICT.\" ICT interactive applications like blog and blackboard had contributed greatly to the success of e-learning systems  (Hernandez, Montaner, Sese, & Urquizu, 2011) . Furthermore, scholars as well as policy-makers demonstrated increasingly more awareness of the importance of ICT policy plans for educational purposes  (Vanderlinde, van Braak, & Dexter, 2012) .\n\nThe third topic was Experiments and methodologies (6.01%). The relevant studies on this topic were commonly experiment-based or test-related. For example, by using a non-equivalent quasi-experiment with senior high school students taking biology courses,  Owusu, Monney, Appiah, and Wilmot (2010)  examined the comparative effectiveness of computer-enhanced instruction and traditional instruction. Using an experimental design method with fourth-grade students,  Pilli and Aksu (2013)  investigated how Frizbi Mathematics 4 affected students' achievement, retention, and attitudes towards math and computer-enhanced instruction methods.\n\nIn addition, Social network and communities (5.19%) was also an imporatnt topic, with discriminating terms including \"community,\" \"computer-mediated communication (CMC),\" \"synchronous, discussion,\" \"message,\" \"forum,\" \"social,\" \"networking,\" and \"twitter.\" CMC is \"communication between individuals and among groups via networked computers\"  (Naidu & J\u20ac arvel\u20ac a, 2006, p. 1) . Social networking sites were widely utilized for educational and professional development purposes  (Kimmons & Veletsianos, 2014) . Xie, Miller, and Allison (2013)  conducted an investigation to understand situations in which social conflicts were introduced into peer-moderated discussions in online courses. Wise and Cui (2018)  compared social relations and the underlying interactions relevant and irrelevant to the learning of a MOOC about statistics."

      "title": "Global changes of research topics/trends",
      "text": "In addition to the aforementioned topics, several other topics demonstrated global changes of research trends. On the one hand, some topics showed fluctuations in their shares of the corpus, with some emerging to become highly discussed, indicating the shifting tendencies in the research interests of the Computers & Education authors. For example, topics such as Blended learning, Technology acceptance models, and Game-based learning had started to gain increasing attention from the academia since the period 2003-2006, demonstrating a growing enthusiasm among scholars in teaching and learning using technologies and games. For example,  Chen et al. (2018)  explored productive learning performances of learners, with the help of instant revision feedback in the context of blended learning. Shih, Liang, and Tsai (2019)  investigated college students' self-regulation in flipped classrooms, using the structural equation modeling method. Prasad, Maag, Redestowicz, and Hoe (2018)  investigated post-graduate information technology students' behavioral intentions towards using a blended learning program. Homer, Plass, Raffaele, Ober, and Ali (2018)  focused on improvements of the executive functions of high-school students by means of digital games. It is thus reasonable to predict that the use of technologies and games for educational purposes will continue to represent a promising research area. Teacher training also showed a continually increasing research trend since the beginning of the studied period. As pointed out by  Yeh, Hsu, Wu, and Chien (2017) , with TPACK, teachers were able to select suitable instruction technology and adopt it for educational purposes. The integration of TPACK into teaching practices related to \"the knowledge constructs that teachers in the digital era develop for and from their teaching practices with technology\"  (Jen, Yeh, Hsu, Wu, & Chen, 2016, p. 1) . Such topics are still of research potential and tend to continue to be the research foci in future.\n\nOn the other hand, research interest in topics such as Special education, Language learning, Mobile learning and early childhood education, Social networks and communities, and Science education seemed to have been stable since about 2006. As indicated by  Martin et al. (2011, p.10) , who in 2010 reported that \"social web and mobile devices are currently the most important technologies for the near future in education,\" the integration of social networks and mobile devices in education had played a continuingly important role, however, without a corresponding increasing research trend. In this sense, we may conclude that such research seems to be sufficiently mature in education and is less possible to attract more attention in the near future. Lin et al. (2019)  examined how learners' perceptions of learning practices correlated with relevant self-efficacies concerning mobile-enhanced, seamless science learning. Tsai and Tsai (2019)  examined how pre-service instructors' conceptions of teaching with mobile devices correlated to the quality of technology incorporation into their lesson plans. Additionally, research enthusiasm in topics such as Virtual reality, Context and collaborative learning, MOOCs, and Human-computer interaction in the contexts of education seemed to have been declining since about  2000-2003. In particular, topics such as Program and curriculum, Hardware, Conceptual mapping, and Programming language had received a continually decreasing research interest since earlier years. Drom the above analyses, we conclude that these topics are very likely to be less popular in the near future."

      "title": "Topic correlations",
      "text": "From the topic correlation graph in Fig.  7 , some implications can be drawn. For example, several topics, including Social networks and communities, Online/web-based learning, Blended learning, and Technology acceptance model, at the lower left-hand side seemed to be closely correlated. These four topics all involved the integration of innovative technologies, such as social networks and the Web in learning and teaching. In blended learning, classroom courses could be supported by different types of materials provided in various technological formats  (Van Niekerk & Webb, 2016) . According to  Chau (1996, p.1) , the \"technology acceptance model is one of the most influential research models in studies of the determinants of information systems/information technologies,\" especially for online/web-based learning.\n\nThe three topics MOOCs, Hardware, and Program and curriculum, were closely related. MOOCs had attracted learners from various educational and professional contexts. Hardware concerned curriculum-related issues particular within web-based contexts, for example, public key infrastructures  (Chadwick, Tassabehji, & Young, 2000)  and computer-aided design programs  (Johnson & Diwakaran, 2011) .\n\nIn addition, several topics in the upper right-hand side were closely linked. Among them, three topics, namely Conceptual mapping, Assessment, and Special education, could be considered as specific purposes or issues in teaching and learning. However, another three topics including Programming language, Multimedia and data-driven studies, and Data-mining could be regarded as analysis methods or techniques. Their links indicated the widespread use of analysis methods for the solution of complex issues. For instance,  Ak\u00e7ap\u0131nar (2015)  explored how feedback, produced automatically using text mining techniques, affected plagiarism in online coursework."

Compared with the institutional perspective, the topic distributions of countries/regions seemed to be more balanced, especially for the USA and Canada. However, the topic diversities amongst institutions were more important.\n\nFurther combining the scientific research collaboration analysis results, it seemed that the topic distribution patterns of some prolific countries/regions with close collaboration tended to be similar (e.g.,Australia and the Netherlands, as well as the USA and Canada). However, the results were not very significant for the countries/regions with the closest collaboration, for example, the USA, Taiwan, and China. The closely collaborative institutions tended to show similar topic distribution patterns, especially those from the same countries/regions. Take the five institutions from Taiwan as an example. Almost all five were more active in the research on Context and collaborative learning as well as Experiments and methodologies, compared to the research on other topics."

      "title": "Implications for future directions concerning educational technology",
      "text": "Based on the findings of the topic modeling analyses, several promising future directions for the educational technology field can be suggested for technological designs and uses in educational settings. For example, game-based learning seems particularly promising. In particular, studies evaluating the effectiveness of learning with games with the use of experimental designs are highly encouraged. As indicated, \"game-based intervention is an approach where games such as computer-based narrative games, are used to enhance learning\"  (Jamshidifarsani, Garbaya, Lim, Blazevic, & Ritchie, 2019, p. 19) , and gamification served to enhance learning attendance, motivation, and engagement, all of which were essential for the development of reading skills  (Gooch, Vasalou, Benton, & Khaled, 2016; Hong & Masood, 2014) . In this sense, research on the gamification of reading interventions is a promising direction for future research  (Jamshidifarsani et al., 2019) . Blended learning is another research area of great promise. Cloud computing had received attention from scholars who were interested in providing solutions to the issues surrounding tacit knowledge conversion within a blended collaborative learning context  (Uden, Liberona, & Welzer, 2014) . Studies had been published (for example,  Mtebe, 2013; Mtebe & Kissaka, 2015)  regarding the significance of utilization of particular cloud computing instruments for the promotion of particular collaborative learning activities. In addition, it is found that collaborative learning was useful in improving learners' achievement and engagement  (Quaye & Harper, 2014) . However, research on the combination of cloud computational techniques and blended learning for conducting collaborative learning activities remaines limited  (Al-Samarraie & Saeed, 2018) . Moreover, according to our study, Blended learning had received a significantly increased amount of attention, particularly in collaborative learning contexts, and its promising directions relate to social networks and communities, as well as online/web-based learning research.\n\nIn addition, correlation-based topical analysis provided insights into potential inter-topic research by identifying topics with strong correlations. For example, one potential research direction is that of multi-disciplinary methods, designed by integrating context and collaborative learning, social networks and communities, blended learning, online/web-based learning, and technology acceptance models in order to develop adaptable and adaptive online and web-learning platforms and applications. In this way, the relationship between approachability and e-learning for scholars, instructional creators, technical personnel, as well as users can be strengthened by offering services to meet an individual's needs  (Cinquin, Guitton, & Sauz\ufffd eon, 2019) . In contrast, the multi-disciplinary groups formed by decreasing topics, such as Human-computer interaction, Virtual reality, Program and curriculum, Hardware, and MOOCs, are possible to be less popular."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This study presented an STM topic modeling-based bibliometric analysis to answer questions such as \"in what research topics were the Computers & Education community interested,\" \"how did such research topics evolve over time,\" and \"what were the main research concerns of the major contributors.\" The major contributors to the Computers & Education research were identified, and the scientific collaborations among them were also visualized. The topic-based bibliometric analysis contributed to Computers & Education by providing a comprehensive overview of its community. Moreover, the findings were beneficial to the resource allocation by decisionmakers, including the potential contributors to Computers & Education and the Computers & Education editors who decide the directions and policies of Computers & Education. In addition, as Computers & Education is \"one of the oldest, most established, and prestigious journals in the field of educational technology and computer-assisted learning, with a high impact in terms of citations\" (Zawacki-Richter & Latchem, 2018, p. 2), implications of the present study can assist research governors and funding agencies in their research policy-making decisions in relation to educational technology. The exploration of important topics, topic prevalence and developments, and emerging inter-topic directions are helpful for the identification and comparison of current and potential scientific strengths. Research governors or funding agencies can optimize research policies to vigorously promote current and potential competitive research areas and enhance scientific communication and collaborations with promising countries/regions or institutions in specific research areas in order to bolster scientific activities.\n\nAs it explores the structures and research topics within the Computers & Education corpus, this review study serves as a starting point for further in-depth research into technology uses in education. First, since the current findings are based only on a single journal, further investigations with comparable journals are advised to be conducted to investigate the research field of educational technology more thoroughly. Second, as STM allows the incorporation of metadata into the model to evaluate how metadata affect topic prevalence, further explorations of topic prevalence in different varieties, such as international collaboration and funding information, are recommended. In addition, the discussed research scope of educational technology is relatively broad, thus a detailed level of categories, for example, learning domains such as medicine and science, as well as technological domains such as mobiles, could be considered in future research to provide insights within a particular domain."
