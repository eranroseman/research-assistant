  "abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile application (app) in patients already using total body photography (TBP) to increase skin self-examination (SSE) rates and pilot the effectiveness of examination reminders and accountability partners. Design Randomized controlled trial with computer generated randomization table to allocate interventions. Setting University of Pennsylvania pigmented lesion clinic. Participants 69 patients aged 18 years or older with an iPhone/iPad, who were already in possession of TBP photographs. Intervention A mobile app loaded with digital TBP photos for all participants, and either (1) the mobile app only, (2) skin examination reminders, (3) an accountability partner, or (4) reminders and an accountability partner. Main Outcome Measure Change in SSE rates as assessed by enrollment and end-of-study surveys 6 months later. Results Eighty one patients completed informed consent, however 12 patients did not complete trial enrollment procedures due to device incompatibility, leaving 69 patients who were randomized and analyzed [mean age 54.3 years, standard deviation 13.9). SSE rates increased significantly from 58% at baseline to 83% at 6 months (odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.20-4.09), with no difference among the intervention groups. The group with examination reminders alone had the highest (94%) overall satisfaction, and the group with accountability partners alone accounted for the lowest (71%). Conclusion A mobile app alone, or with reminders and/or accountability partners, was found to be an effective tool that can help to increase SSE rates. Skin examination reminders may help provide a better overall experience for a subset of patients. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02520622. \n Key points Skin self-examination (SSE) rates are low, even in highrisk groups such as those who warrant professional total body photography (TBP). In this randomized controlled trial, a mobile application alone, or with reminders and/or accountability partners, was found to be an effective tool to help increase SSE rates in patients using TBP for their skin examinations. Skin examination reminders were associated with the greatest overall patient satisfaction.",

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "The importance of home skin examinations is highlighted by a number of studies supporting an association between higher skin self-examination (SSE) rates and thinner, more treatable, melanomas at diagnosis  [1] [2] [3] . However, SSE rates by adults are as low as 10% in high-risk groups such as those who warrant professional total body photography (TBP)  [4, 5] . With TBP, the patient receives 20-50 photographs produced with professional lighting and a contrasting background to optimize image quality. The patient uses these photographs to compare against when checking for new or changing pigmented skin lesions  [6] .\n\nSeveral studies suggest that the use of photographs, including TBP, as well as patient education on skin examinations and melanoma may be effective interventions to increase SSE rates  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Our previous work demonstrated the efficacy of both printed TBP photos and a mobile application loaded with TBP photos, at increasing SSE rates  [13] . However, the previous study was limited to patients who had never had TBP prior to the study, with the potential that initial use could stem from a motivating event such as a new diagnosis or recommendation.\n\nAccordingly, we investigated the use of a mobile app loaded with TBP photos in a different patient population, i.e. those with established TBP use for SSEs, in order to evaluate the generalizability of our previous findings. In addition, an extensive body of research  [14]  underpinned by social and health behavior models such as the theory of reasoned action  [15, 16] , the theory of planned behavior  [17, 18] , and the model of interpersonal behavior  [19]  highlight the influence that social pressure, or subjective norms, can have on patient behavior. Consequently, we piloted the use of skin examination reminders and personalized skin examination performance reports sent to accountability partners as potential means of enhancing perceived social pressures and improving self-examination rates."

      "text": "The study included adults aged 18 years or older who presented to the Penn Dermatology Pigmented Lesion Clinic with an iPhone/iPad and who were already in possession of TBP photographs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02520622). With the approval of the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB), the study occurred between August 2015 and January 2017, when target enrollment was reached. We targeted enrollment of 70 patients based on prior literature successfully assessing the impact of image-based interventions on SSE rates  [8, 9] .\n\nImmediately after completion of the enrollment survey, all patients were set up with a mobile app loaded with their TBP photos, and were then randomized by a study coordinator (using Stata) into one of four groups that consisted of the following interventions: (1) the mobile app only; (2) the receipt of monthly skin examination reminders; (3) an accountability partner that would receive a monthly performance report of their skin examination progress; or (4) a combination of both monthly reminders and a report to an accountability partner. All groups could continue to use the standard of care at the University of Pennsylvania, consisting of printed photographs and a CD containing digital copies. The primary outcome variable was the change in SSE rates as assessed by enrollment and end-of-study surveys, while the secondary outcome variable was patient satisfaction as assessed by the end-of-study survey."

      "text": "The patient's professionally taken TBP photographs were loaded into the mobile app where they were encrypted, password protected, and stored within the app on their device. The app was developed for iOS only (based on clinic surveys showing a majority of patients with iOS); devices released before the iPhone 5s or iPad Air were not supported in order to simplify app development and support. The app allowed patients to magnify photos, make side-by-side comparisons, and flag photo areas for follow-up with their clinician. The app also provided skin cancer and skin examination education and tracked how frequently each of the photos were viewed as part of a skin examination. Through the app's communication with Way to Health, an automated information technology platform that has been used in prior behavioral intervention studies  [20] [21] [22] [23] , this skin examination data was used to email monthly performance reports to accountability partners, depending on the study arm. The Way to Health platform also distributed monthly skin examination reminders by email and/or text message depending on the study arm."

We considered participants to be performing regular skin examinations if they conducted a self-examination at least four times in the past 6 months. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression (STATA version 14, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) to examine changes in our primary outcome (SSE rates) while accounting for correlation between longitudinal responses within individuals. Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate differences in patient satisfaction between intervention groups."

      "text": "From August 2015 to April 2016, 68% (81/119) of patients agreed to participate in this study and subsequently provided informed consent (see Fig.  1 ). Of the 81 patients, 12 did not complete trial enrollment procedures due to device incompatibility, leaving 69 patients who were randomized and analyzed. Reasons for not participating included concerns about privacy/security, not being very technologically savvy, not wanting to change their routine, and not wanting to get involved with a research study. Table  1  presents the study population characteristics, with none differing significantly across the four groups. The mean age of participants was 54.3 years (standard deviation [SD] 13.9). All study patients identified as Caucasian, and 44% had graduate or professional training. The average time each participant was a patient at the Pigmented Lesion Group (PLG) clinic was 8.4 years (SD 7.9), while the average time each participant had TBP photos was 8.5 years (SD 7.6), with the shortest period being 170 days. Overall, 83% of patients started using TBP within 1 year of their entrance into the PLG clinic. The average time between when patients started in the study to when they completed the end-of-study survey was 226 days (7.52 months) Table  2  shows that SSE rates increased significantly over the 6-month study period (odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.20-4.09), with no difference between the intervention groups. Overall, 58% of our study population, regardless of study arm, performed regular skin examinations at baseline, increasing to 83% 6 months later. Participation in the study, with access to a mobile app and performance reports, may have helped patients complete more thorough skin examinations, with significant SSE rate increases for difficult-to-examine areas such as the lower back (75% increasing to 92%, p = 0.008) and back of the legs (80% increasing to 95%, p = 0.006).\n\nWhile SSE rates were similar across the study groups, satisfaction rates were highest in the reminders group, and lowest in the accountability partner group, with rates of 94 and 71%, respectively (Table  3 ). When these two groups were compared directly in post hoc analysis, the difference in satisfaction between the reminders and accountability partner groups trended toward significance (p = 0.085), although this study was small and may have been underpowered to detect significant differences in satisfaction, if they in fact existed. In addition, anticipated future use of the app differed significantly between interventions (p = 0.049), with the accountability partner group having the lowest future use rate at 76%. Over 80% of study participants reported having help from a partner during SSE, with no significant difference between intervention groups. The following characteristics occurred in the majority of patients and did not differ significantly between study groups: described skin selfexaminations as beneficial; felt their knowledge of skin cancer risks and how to perform an examination was good; felt skin examinations were difficult to perform but were confident in performing them; had an abnormal skin lesion/biopsy; had help from a partner during skin examinations; received education on skin examinations/skin cancer; had a pigmented lesion clinic appointment in the past 6 months; had skin examinations by a clinician in the past year; and had regular skin self-examinations recommended to them by a dermatologist.

      "title": "4. Discussion",
      "text": "We demonstrated that a mobile app alone, or with reminders and/or accountability partners, can be an effective method of increasing skin examination rates in a patient population that had an average of 8.5 years of printed TBP use (versus a population that was new to TBP, as in our previous study)  [13] . This improvement in examination rates without significant intergroup differences suggests that participation in the study alone, or the Hawthorne effect, may have played a role in the observed SSE rate increase. Future studies could evaluate this potential effect by including a crossover point where patients would revert back to their baseline skin examination modality after being randomized to an intervention. A sustained increase in skin examination performance after reverting to a baseline skin examination modality may help elucidate any potential Hawthorne effect. While examination rates did not differ significantly between study groups, anticipated future use of the mobile app differed significantly, with the accountability partner group having the lowest future use rate. Additionally, overall satisfaction was highest in the reminders group and lowest in the accountability partner group, with patients anecdotally volunteering that the examination reminders were invaluable. This satisfaction with reminders was consistent with other studies demonstrating the efficacy of smartphone reminders in helping patients increase SSE rates, increase sunscreen use, lose weight, and show up for clinic appointments  [24] [25] [26] [27] .\n\nGiven the occasional displeasure patients expressed upon being randomized into the accountability partner group, we suspect that the relative decrease in satisfaction with this intervention may stem from patient discomfort with giving up privacy and having their skin examination habits disclosed to a third party (who may or may not be the same person as their examination partner). In addition, over 80% of study participants had help from a partner when performing skin examinations, with no significant difference between study arms. Consequently, based on this study, we could not draw conclusions about the potential benefit of having a skin examination partner. This study's limitations include the reliance on selfreported responses to surveys and the lack of blinding to the intervention. Additionally, the study group was a selfselected group of patients who were interested in participating in a clinical trial using a mobile app for skin examinations. Consequently, it is possible that the significant increase in SSE rates may not generalize well to a patient population not interested in this trial. However, we were encouraged by the trial's 68% participation rate and that study participants represented a wide range of age and technical abilities."

      "text": "In this study, we piloted the effectiveness of a mobile app alone, or with skin examination reminders and/or accountability partners, at increasing SSE rates. After 6 months of follow-up, our analysis demonstrated the efficacy of a mobile app at increasing SSE rates in a different patient population than our previous study. Future research should investigate whether this impact can be sustained over longer periods of time and should consider reverting to baseline skin examination modalities after intervention use in order to better elucidate any potential Hawthorne effect. Regardless, these results, along with the high satisfaction rates associated with the mobile app and examination reminders, further established mobile technology as a viable option for patients to use and for clinicians to offer in support of regular SSEs."
