      "text": "There is limited evidence of smoking cessation interventions demonstrating effi cacy in adolescents and young adults  ( Backinger, Fagan, Matthews, & Grana, 2003 ; Grimshaw & Stanton, 2006 ; Skara & Sussman, 2003 ) . Smoking cessation services, such as advice from health professionals and nicotine replacement therapy, are underutilized by them  ( Meyer, Rumpf, Hapke, & John, 2000 ) . Innovative interventions and delivery systems that could reach, motivate, and treat entire populations of young adults are needed to prevent major health problems, including cancer and heart and lung diseases  ( Bock et al., 2004 ; Ezzati, Lopez, Rodgers, Vander Hoorn, & Murray, 2002 ) . Computerized expert system technologies that provide information to support smoking cessation based on individual characteristics can be a viable, time-and cost-saving alternative to interpersonal counseling  ( Noar, Benac, & Harris, 2007 ; Walters, Wright, & Shegog, 2006 ) . In a recent review of smoking cessation interventions for adolescents aged less than 20 years, approaches based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) of behavior change  ( Prochaska & Velicer, 1997 )  achieved moderate long-term success, whereas the effi cacy of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions has not been demonstrated so far  ( Grimshaw & Stanton, 2006  ).\n\nCommon expert system interventions provide tailored letters at one or more predefi ned points in time but are infl exible to use, regarding time and place where the respondent receives the information. Intervention approaches and delivery systems that consider more carefully the lifestyle of adolescents and young adults are needed to provide appropriate support  ( MacDonald, Rothwell, & Moore, 2007 ) . Communication technologies such as mobile phone short message service (SMS) text messaging provide more fl exible opportunities for individualized information that may easily be accessed, independent of place and time.\n\nIn 2005, 94% of German adolescents aged 12 -19 years owned a mobile phone  ( Medienp\u00e4dagogischer Forschungsverbund S\u00fcdwest, 2006 ) . Text messaging creates fl exible opportunities (a) to provide individualized information generated by expert system assessments, (b) to monitor target behavior within short time intervals for an immediate adaptation of expert system feedbacks, (c) to request tips and strategies by the participants whenever necessary, and (d) to increase the frequency of contacts between provider and participants.\n\nTo date, two smoking cessation studies have been conducted in which text messaging was used as the main communication medium  ( Obermayer, Riley, Asif, & Jean-Mary, 2004 ; Rodgers et al., 2005 ) . Obermayer et al. combined individualized text messages with additional information on a Web site to support students in the period before quitting and immediately thereafter. The 46 participants received at least two SMS messages per day. In this pilot study, 10 (22%) participants reported 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at the end of the program lasting 6 weeks. Saliva samples for biochemical validation could be retrieved from 8 of the 10 persons reporting abstinence. Forty-three percent reported that they made at least one 24-hr quit attempt during the study period  ( Obermayer et al. ) . In the controlled study by  Rodgers et al.  , participants planning to quit within the next month received individualized SMS messages providing smoking cessation advice, support, and distraction for a period of 26 weeks. The messages were matched to participants ' smoking behavior characteristics. Five SMS messages per day were sent to the participants 1 week before and 4 weeks after a predefi ned quit date that was negotiated with each participant. After this period, the intervention became less intensive, with the number of messages sent being reduced from fi ve a day to three a week until the end of the 26th week. An assessment after 6 weeks of program participation revealed higher self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates in the intervention group (28%) compared with the control group (13%), which did not receive any intervention. Self-reported quit rates after the end of the program remained higher in the intervention than the control group, but there was some uncertainty about between-group differences because of incomplete follow-up. Intention-to-treat analyses assuming participants with missing smoking status to be smoking could not reveal a signifi cant intervention effect at the 6-month follow-up  ( Rodgers et al. ) .\n\nThe interactive features of SMS to receive messages, to send messages, and to \" reply \" to messages were not utilized fully in the existing studies. Furthermore, studies using SMS for persons without or with only low motivation to quit smoking have not been reported yet.\n\nTo obtain a sample with a substantial proportion of smokers not willing to quit, proactive recruitment strategies are required, which means that subjects are contacted directly and that the services are offered to them personally  ( Velicer et al., 2005 ) . In the present study, we proactively addressed all smokers from a given sample of young adults, independent of their motivation to quit.\n\nThe study aimed at testing (a) the feasibility and (b) acceptance of a program using interactive mobile phone text messaging to support smoking cessation in a pilot experimental study. Since little is known about the optimal intensity of text messaging interventions, particularly for smokers not intending to quit, we additionally (c) investigated the impact of different support intensity on the acceptance of the program by comparing two groups of participants which received different support intensity. Furthermore, we (d) explored the short-term effi cacy of this approach by comparing the two intervention groups and a control group on smoking variables which precede smoking cessation  ( Velicer, Redding, Sun, & Prochaska, 2007 ; West, McEwen, Bolling, & Owen, 2001 ) ."

      "text": "Participants were recruited by two graduate students at a cafeteria of the University of Greifswald in Germany in August and September 2007. Over a period of 20 days, visitors to the cafeteria were approached after lunch as they were leaving. The graduate students were located at the exit of the cafeteria and tried to address all persons; however, during peak hours, this was not possible. In total, 575 persons were asked about smoking status and usage of text messaging. Persons who refused to give any information at the fi rst contact were not pursued on the following recruitment days. From the 575 screened persons, 194 (34%) who reported daily smoking and weekly usage of SMS were invited for participation in a study evaluating an SMS-based program for smoking cessation. The individuals received further study information material and provided informed consent for study participation before they were enrolled. Reimbursement of \u20ac 5 ( ~ $6.45 US) for participation at the follow-up assessment after 3 months was offered to all study participants. Among the 194 persons who fulfi lled the inclusion criteria for the study, 174 (90%) consented to participate.\n\nPreceding the baseline assessment that was conducted using a notebook, participants were assigned by computer algorithm to one of three study groups using simple randomization: (a) The assessment-only group received no intervention, (b) the 1SMS group received a low-intensity SMS-based intervention to support smoking cessation, and (c) the 3SMS group received an SMS-based intervention to support smoking cessation of higher intensity. Participants were not informed about the intervention provided to the other groups. Within the baseline assessment, number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking-related variables derived from the TTM (stage of change, self-effi cacy, decisional balance, and processes of change), and demographic variables were assessed. Reimbursement of \u20ac 0.5 ( ~ $0.65) per SMS response to the weekly SMS assessments was offered to the participants of the intervention groups (prices for sending SMS messages within Germany vary from \u20ac 0.09 [ ~ $0.12] to \u20ac 0.20 [ ~ $0.26] per SMS). At the end of the 3-month intervention period, study participants were contacted via telephone for program evaluation."

This allowed a classifi cation of the participants into precontemplation (no intention to quit smoking), contemplation (intention to quit smoking within the next 6 months), preparation (planning to quit smoking within the next 4 weeks), or action (quit smoking in the past 6 months). The SMS assessment questions were sent at a fi xed point in time each week (6 p.m. at the weekday of registration for the program). The monitoring question could easily be answered by typing a single letter and using the reply function of the mobile phone. Incoming text messages at the study center were automatically analyzed by a specifi c software developed for the purpose of this study. Participants who did not reply to the weekly questions within 24 hr received an automatic reminder from the system.\n\nThe SMS intervention program ran fully automated for a period of 14 weeks. The system was based on Internet technology using a LAMP system (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). All incoming and outgoing messages were automatically recorded. Incoming messages were analyzed immediately 24 hr/day."

      "title": "SMS feedbacks .",
      "text": "Depending on the intervention group (1SMS, 3SMS), program participants received either one or three weekly SMS feedback messages on their mobile phones. The content of the feedback messages was tailored to the individuals ' data from the baseline assessment as well as the weekly SMS assessments considering stage of change. Feedback was tailored to the individuals ' values on core constructs from the TTM. On the fi rst level, wording and content of the SMS feedback messages were tailored to participants ' stage of change, that is, precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, and action. On the second level, the feedback was tailored to individuals ' scores on the TTM constructs decisional balance (pros and cons of nonsmoking), self-effi cacy, and processes of change (risk assessment, commitment to change, helping relation-ships, stimulus control, and coping with temptations). The feedback depended on individuals ' scores on each of the aforementioned TTM core constructs compared with the population norm. Norms and cutoff points for this study were calculated using data from earlier studies conducted by our institute in which the TTM core constructs were assessed within large population-based samples  ( Meyer, Rumpf, Schumann, Hapke, & John, 2003 ; Meyer et al., 2008 ; Schumann, Meyer, Rumpf, Hapke, & John, 2002 ) . We used the 67th percentile as the cutoff point for the processes of change, decisional balance, and self-effi cacy scores. Participants below the cutoff scores were motivated to use, for example, a certain process of change more often; participants above the cutoff scores were reinforced in their actual behavior.\n\nA series of approximately 40 SMS feedback messages were generated by the system immediately after the baseline assessment. Depending on the study group, one or three of these feedback messages were sent to the participants weekly. The messages sent to the participants were selected randomly, but each message was sent to a participant only once. After a participant progressed or regressed within the stages of change, the subsequent SMS feedback messages were no longer tailored to his or her data from baseline assessment but only stage tailored ( Figure  1  ). The fi rst weekly SMS feedback messages were sent to the participants immediately after they answered the weekly SMS assessment. If participants did not respond to the weekly SMS assessment within 2 days, the feedback considered the latest available information concerning stage of change. For the 3SMS intervention group, the second and third feedback messages were sent 1 and 2 days, respectively, after the fi rst feedback. Exemplary input from the assessments and corresponding feedback messages are shown in Figure  2  ."

Particularly, the number of responses to the weekly SMS assessments and usage of the SMS craving helpline were examined. At postassessment, different aspects concerning the usage of the SMS program were assessed. Participants were asked whether they (a) read through the SMS feedback messages thoroughly, (b) took only a short look at the feedback messages, or (c) did not read the feedback messages. Using a yes/no question, we also evaluated whether the participants always answered honestly to the weekly SMS assessments. To examine participants ' satisfaction with and helpfulness of the program, we developed seven items which assessed participants ' agreement to different statements about SMS-COACH using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = \" I do not agree \" to 5 = \" I totally agree \" ). Suggestions for improvement of the program were assessed by the open question \" Do you have any suggestions to improve the program SMS-COACH? \" An exploration of the short-term effi cacy of the program was conducted by comparing the three study groups at postassessment on the number of cigarettes smoked per day, quit attempts, intention to quit, self-effi cacy, and decisional balance.\n\nNumber of cigarettes smoked per day was assessed by the question \" How many cigarettes do you smoke on an average day? \" Quit attempts during the period of program participation were assessed at postassessment by the yes/no question \" Did you succeed in staying abstinent from cigarettes for 24 hours or longer during the last three months? \" S tage of change was assessed using the algorithm by  DiClemente et al. (1991)  . Smokers in the precontemplation stage did not intend to quit smoking in the next 6 months. Smokers in the contemplation stage were seriously considering quitting in the next 6 months and (a) were not seriously planning to quit smoking within the next 30 days, (b) had not made at least one 24-hr quit attempt in the past year, or (c) both. Smokers in the preparation stage were seriously planning to quit smoking within the next 30 days and reported at least one 24-hr quit attempt during the past year. Persons in the action stage quit smoking within the last 6 months. Smoking cessation self-effi cacy was assessed by a nine-item scale  ( J\u00e4kle, Keller, Baum, & Basler, 1999 ; T\u00f6njes et al., 2007 ) . Smokers indicated their confi dence not to smoke in positive social situations or in tempting situations on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all confi dent) to 5 (very confi dent). Decisional balance was assessed with two fi ve-item scales comprising positive and negative aspects of nonsmoking  ( J\u00e4kle et al. ; T\u00f6njes et al. ) . Participants rated the importance of each statement for their decision to smoke or not to smoke on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (very important)."

One person from the 3SMS group reported lack of time as the cause of program discontinuation, while two did not give any information.\n\nTransmission of the SMS assessments and feedback messages by the system worked without technical problems. In total, 5,553 SMS messages were sent to the program participants (110 test SMSs, 1,512 assessment SMSs, 3,136 feedback SMSs, 303 reminder SMSs, 394 craving helpline reminder SMSs, and 98 craving helpline feedback SMSs), and 1,305 SMS messages were received from the program participants (98 test SMS confi rmations, 1,109 replies to assessment SMSs, and 98 craving helpline retrievals). Depending on the length of the single SMS feedback messages and the number of reminder and craving helpline messages, the costs for transmission of the SMS messages added up to approximately \u20ac 5 ( ~ $6.45) for an average person in the 1SMS group and \u20ac 8 ( ~ $10.30) for an average person in the 3SMS group. The median ( Mdn ) number of replies to the weekly SMS assessments was 12.5 (percentile 25 ( P 25 ) = 6.8; percentile 75 ( P 75 ) = 14.0) in the 1SMS group and 13.0 ( P 25 = 7.0; P 75 = 14.0) in the 3SMS group ( U = 1442.5, p = .72).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this smoking cessation study, SMS was used as an interactive medium and all smokers from a given sample, independent of their motivation to quit, were addressed. Compared with earlier studies  ( Brendryen & Kraft, 2008 ; Obermayer et al., 2004 ; Rodgers et al., 2005 ) , we not only provided information and support via SMS but also assessed the participants ' target behavior weekly via SMS and modifi ed the provided information based on these data. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptance of this approach in a student sample. Higher feedback intensity resulted in a lower number of SMS requests from the craving helpline but did not affect program acceptance. The exploration of the short-term effi cacy of this program revealed no superiority for any of the intervention groups.\n\nThe participation rate of 90% underlines the attractiveness of this communication medium for smoking cessation interventions in young adults. Taking into account that 44% of the study participants were in the precontemplation stage of change at the baseline assessment, this high participation rate is of special relevance. The response rates in our study demonstrate the potential of SMS for frequent assessment of smoking behavior within short time periods. Only 3 of the 110 participants (3%) discontinued the intervention. In both intervention groups, the Mdn number of replies to the 14 weekly assessments was higher than 12. However, it remains an open question to which extent these response rates were increased by the generous reimbursement of the SMS costs in our study. The participants received \u20ac 0.5 ( ~ $0.65) per reply, which was \u20ac 0.10 -\u20ac 0.41 ( ~ $ 0.13 -$0.53) more than their actual costs, depending on the participant's cell phone provider. Nearly all participants reported to have answered honestly to the weekly SMS questions. Taking the low costs for these automated assessments into account, SMS appears to be an excellent medium to realize frequent contacts between the provider and the participating individual.\n\nOnce the program was developed and set up, the personnel costs to run the intervention were low. The system worked without any technical problems. Introduction to the program and baseline assessment took only 10 -15 min per program participant for our graduate students. Using a group setting, these personnel costs could be further reduced in future studies. This underlines the potential of this fully automated intervention to reach a high population impact  ( Thyrian & John, 2007 )  in young adults, if the intervention proves to be effective.\n\nFeedback intensity did not affect students ' satisfaction with the program and their ratings of its helpfulness. Most partici-pants in both intervention groups stated moderate satisfaction with the program and reported that they would participate again. However, feedback intensity affected usage of the SMS craving helpline, which was used more often by participants in the 1SMS group compared with the 3SMS group. What this difference refl ects, however, remains an open question. Hence, further research, in particular effi cacy trials, is needed to determine the optimal level of feedback.\n\nA comparison of the smoking variables in the three study groups suggests that, if any, only small intervention effects can be expected by this intervention. The study was conducted as a pilot study and thus is likely to have been underpowered to detect statistically signifi cant differences. Due to the small sample size and a lack of longer term follow-up assessments, the results concerning the effi cacy of the program are not conclusive. The intervention effect might also have been diminished by the comprehensiveness of the baseline assessment compared with the SMS intervention. The cessation rate in our control group is beyond the rate that would have been expected for self-change based on population data. The baseline assessment, which was administered to the participants of all three study groups and consisted of more than 50 items assessing smoking-related variables, might itself be regarded as a minimal intervention.\n\nTable 2.

Future studies should test the generalizability of these results to young adults with lower educational level and other age groups. Future SMS interventions could be improved by considering a wider variety of smoking-related variables in the weekly assessments. For example, weekly assessment of stage of change, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and self-effi cacy to resist cigarette smoking could result in a more frequent update of these variables and a wider variety of SMS feedback messages. Another promising enhancement might be to tailor the number of SMS feedback messages to participants ' intention to quit or to integrate periods with more frequent feedbacks immediately before and after quitting. Previous studies suggest that, for smokers with a high motivation to quit, several daily messages might be more effective  ( Obermayer et al., 2004 ; Rodgers et al., 2005 ) .\n\nCompared with face-to-face counseling and tailored letters, one major difference of SMS counseling is the brevity of the intervention contact, due to the limited number of characters which can be exchanged. This results in brief, pointed messages and minimal effort for the participants to read and reply to text messages. Another major difference compared with face-to-face counseling is that text messages can be read and replied to whenever the user wants and no appointments need to be fi xed. These general characteristics enable frequent repeated intervention contacts and can provide a viable intervention approach, particularly for smokers without or with only low motivation to quit. The increasing popularity of SMS and the high participation rates in our study suggest that SMS-based interventions might better fi t the lifestyle of young adults than traditional intervention approaches. Future studies should empirically compare the impact of different communication channels (e.g., SMS, Internet, and face-to-face counseling) to reach young adults, to retain them in the intervention, and to achieve long-term health behavior change."
