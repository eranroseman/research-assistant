  "abstract": "Objective Meta-analyses of behavior change (BC) interventions typically find large heterogeneity in effectiveness and small effects. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of active BC interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating and investigate whether theoretically-specified BC techniques improve outcome. \n Design Interventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults were systematically reviewed. Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 BC techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically-derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression. \n Main Outcome Measures Valid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating. \n Results The 122 evaluations (N = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.36) (I 2 = 69%). The technique, \"self-monitoring\", explained the greatest amount of among-study heterogeneity (13%). Interventions that combined self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory were significantly more effective than the other interventions (0.42 versus 0.26). \n Conclusion \n Classifying interventions according to component techniques and theoretically-derived technique combinations and conducting meta-regression enabled identification of effective components of interventions designed to increase physical activity and healthy eating.",

      "text": "Interventions designed to change health-related behaviors generally include many components and typically produce small effects in meta-analyses, but with large heterogeneity in effectiveness (e.g. National Institute for  Health and Clinical Excellence, 2007; Dishman & Buckworth, 1996; Grimshaw et al., 2004 ). This limits the potential for understanding how intervention content relates to effectiveness and, consequently, the inferences that can be drawn regarding optimal design and the content of future behavior change interventions. Recent guidance has called for new methods to evaluate the effects of \"complex\" interventions  (Craig et al., 2008) . This study aimed to assess the utility of classifying the content of behavior change interventions into component techniques and applying meta-regression to identify effective individual techniques and theoretically-derived combinations of techniques.\n\nTo address this aim, we focused on interventions designed to increase physical activity and healthy eating because these are key change targets in the context of the growing obesity epidemic, one of the most serious health risk factors in both the developed and developing world  (World Health Organisation, 2002) . We further focused on active interventions that engaged participants in the process of behavior change, rather than passive interventions such as simply providing information or advice. Self management approaches, involving people in their own change, have had considerable success among those with long term illnesses (e.g.,  Lorig, Ritter & Plant, 2005) , can initiate change within other groups  (Bandura, 2000; Gupta, 2005) . Active interventions have also been found to be more effective than passive interventions in other areas  (Albarrac\u00edn, et al., 2005)  and, because of the sustained behaviour changes necessary to translate dietary and physical activity into health benefits, self regulatory processes are likely to be central to health-enhancing change, recommending active engagement of participants. Yet, despite the potential of active, self management approaches, there is little guidance on which techniques are important to the effectiveness.\n\nTwo methodological advances have enhanced our capacity to learn from intervention evaluations. First, reliable methods of specifying component techniques (e.g.,  Abraham & Michie, 2008)  and, second, use of meta-analysis and meta-regression to identify the effects of individual techniques, and combinations of techniques, across studies (e.g.,  Albaraccin et al., 2005) . In the current study we combined these tools in an investigation of effective change techniques included in healthy eating and physical activity interventions.\n\nRepeated calls have been made for precise specification of what makes one behavior change intervention more effective than another and how this can be understood theoretically (e.g.,  Rothman, 2004 ). In the current study, we used a reliable taxonomy of 26 techniques to identify intervention content. Reliability checks have shown that independent coders can reliably judge whether or not published intervention descriptions in papers or manuals indicated inclusion of each technique  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) .\n\nIf we are to understand, not only what works, but how interventions work, it is necessary to understand the causal mechanisms hypothesised to explain intervention effects (Michie &  Abraham, 2004; Michie, Johnston, Francis, Hardeman & Eccles, 2008) . Interventions have been found to be more effective if they involve techniques that behavior change theory predicts would act synergistically  (Albaraccin et al., 2005) . Carver and Scheier's (1981; 1982)  control theory specifies action control processes underpinning behavioral regulation. The theory proposes that setting goals, monitoring behavior, receiving feedback and reviewing relevant goals in the light of feedback are central to self management and behavioral control. Therefore, while we examined which of 26 change techniques would be most strongly associated with intervention effectiveness, we hypothesized that interventions which included five self-regulation techniques derived from control theory would be more effective than other techniques. These were (1) prompt intention formation or goal setting, (2) specify goals in relation to particular contextualized actions, (3) self monitoring of behavior, (4) feedback on performance, and (5) review previously-set goals. These techniques may act additively or synergistically; the number of studies required to detect the latter is substantially greater than the former.\n\nPrevious studies have employed meta-analysis to assess whether the presence or absence of particular techniques is associated with effectiveness. For example,  Albarrac\u00edn et al. (2005)  showed that 10 techniques (e.g., provision of factual information and attitudinal arguments) could be reliably identified in published descriptions of interventions designed to promote condom use, and that inclusion of some of these (e.g., provision of attitudinal arguments) was associated with greater effectiveness, while inclusion of others (e.g., threat-inducing arguments) was not. Noar,  Benac and Harris (2007)  showed that eight targeted theoretical constructs could be reliably identified in reports of tailored print interventions designed to promote health behaviors, and that inclusion of some of these constructs (e.g., attitudes, self-efficacy) was associated with greater effectiveness. Two (social norms and behavioral intentions) were not associated with effectiveness and one (perceived susceptibility) was associated with decreased effectiveness. Despite the impressive scope of these meta-analytic reviews, they have shortcomings. First, only 10 distinct techniques and eight constructs, respectively, were considered. The need for more comprehensive categorization of intervention content is evidenced from reviews of interventions in other behavioral domains (e.g.,  Webb & Sheeran, 2006) . In addition,  Albaracc\u00edn et al. (2005)  used within-group change over time as the criterion of effectiveness as opposed to behavior change observed in an intervention group relative to changes observed in a matched no-intervention control. This allows inclusion of many more datasets but is a less rigorous criterion of effectiveness because the benefits of controlling for techniques within the control conditions are lost. In addition, both these reviews usedmeta-analysis and/or univariate regression rather than multivariate meta-regression to synthesize the evidence. While meta-analysis provides a technique for combining data from separate studies to arrive at pooled effect size estimates, meta-regression provides a means of assessing both single and multiple predictors of effect size from variables derived from individual studies, while weighting the regression so that precision of study results is properly accounted for  (Sutton & Higgins, 2008) .\n\nThe present systematic review applied a reliable taxonomy of behavior change techniques and meta-regression to analyse the effect of individual intervention techniques and the effect of combining five theoretically-derived self-regulation techniques. [HE] = 20,899). After excluding duplicates, 28,440 references remained (PA = 10,859 (including 22 papers recommended by experts in the field); HE = 17,581). In a sample of 300 titles screened independently by two reviewers, there was 100% agreement on inclusion/ exclusion. One thousand and forty one studies identified as potentially relevant were further screened by abstract to assess suitability for inclusion (PA = 472; HE = 569). One hundred abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers, with 85% agreement on inclusion. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consulting a third reviewer and where uncertainly remained the full paper examined. After screening by abstract, full text papers were obtained for 270 articles (PA = 156; HE = 139). Where there was insufficient statistical or intervention information (N = 17), authors were contacted (35% responded). Detailed evaluation according to the inclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 139 studies. Of these, 38 were excluded from the meta-analysis (see supplementary material, Table  S1 ), leaving 101 papers reporting 122 evaluations (PA = 69; HE ="

      "text": "In evaluations of PA interventions reporting multiple outcome measures, the most general or comprehensive measure was selected (e.g., exercise level, energy expenditure). For studies of healthy eating, measures of good and/or poor diet were extracted. There was a significant correlation (r = .91, p < .001) between the \"good diet\" and \"poor diet\" measures 1 , consequently, an average effect size from each study was used for the meta-analysis. For studies reporting more than one measure of fat intake, total fat intake (grams per day or % energy from fat) was preferred over saturated fat intake or kcal consumption, since a certain kcal consumption may reflect a more or less healthy diet. For studies reporting the percentage of participants consuming five fruit or vegetable servings per day in addition to the number of fruit and vegetable servings per day, the latter was selected.\n\nEffect sizes were indexed as the standardised mean difference (the difference between two means divided by their pooled standard deviation) with Hedge's correction for small sample size  (Hedges & Olkin, 1985) . For studies that reported continuous data, the effect size was computed from means and standard deviations (adjusted for baseline differences if reported), or, if these data were not reported, from the sample size and p-value from an appropriate between-groups t-or Ftest. For studies that only reported dichotomous data, the log odds ratio was converted into a standardised mean difference using the meta-analysis software. For cluster RCTs, where the study had used an appropriate analysis to account for the effect of clustering, the results of the analysis were used to estimate the effect size. Where the analysis did not properly take account of clustering, we calculated an effective sample size using the following formula: N (effective) = (k x m) / (1+ (m -1) * ICC, where k indicates the number of clusters; m, the number of observations per cluster; and ICC, the intracluster correlation coefficient  (Shojania et al., 2006) . We imputed unreported ICCs based on an empirically derived value of 0.05  (Elley, Kerse, Arroll & Robinson, 2003; Elley, Kerse, Chondros & Robinson, 2005) . When results were reported only as significant, p = .05 was assumed, and when only as non-significant, p = .50 was assumed. Where data were reported from multiple time points, outcomes or evaluations, an average effect size was used (we explored the effect of doing this using a series of sub-group analyses, but found little difference between sub-groups; data not reported but available from the authors). Where there were two interventions compared in one study and both met the inclusion criteria, we chose the intervention with the greatest effect (because we were exploring determinants of effectiveness). Where a single study reported both PA and HE outcomes, both were entered into the analysis as if from separate evaluations, but group sample sizes were halved when calculating the standard error of the effect size. This avoids double counting participants and underestimating the variance associated with each effect size."

These were (T1) provide information on behavior-health link, (T2) provide information on consequences, (T3) provide information about others' approval, (T4) prompt intention formation, (T5) prompt barrier identification, (T6) provide general encouragement, (T7) set graded tasks, (T8) provide instruction, (T9) model/ demonstrate the behavior, (T10) prompt specific goal setting, (T11) prompt review of behavioral goals, (T12) prompt self-monitoring of behavior, (T13) provide feedback on performance, (T14) provide contingent rewards, (T15) teach to use prompts/ cues, (T16) agree a behavioral contract, (T17) prompt practice, (T18) use of follow up prompts, (T19) provide opportunities for social comparison, (T20) plan social support/ social change, (T21) prompt identification as role model/ position advocate, (T22) prompt self talk, (T23) relapse prevention, (T24) stress management, (T25) motivational interviewing and (T26) time management. Inter-rater reliability checks on identification of techniques was conducted by the first two authors on the first 29 papers reporting PA intervention evaluations and the first 22 papers reporting HE interventions (i.e., 51 of 71 included papers, 72%). Modal and mean kappa values and average percentage of disagreements were, respectively, 0.79, 0.80, and 8.2% for PA evaluations and 0.81, 0.82, and 6.7% for HE evaluations, suggesting high reliability. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The coding manual is available from the first two authors  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) ."

Using the revised metareg command in Stata, we conducted random effects meta-analysis and random effects meta-regression with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and the improved variance estimator of  Knapp and Hartung (2003) . Meta-regression is \"...a combination of meta-analytic principles (of combining results from multiple studies with due attention to within-study precision and among-study variation) with regression ideas (of predicting study effects using study-level covariates).\" (p.629)  (Sutton & Higgins, 2008) . In our analysis, the regression coefficients (\u03b2) are the estimated increase in the effect size per unit increase in the covariate(s). Positive effect sizes indicate that the intervention had a better outcome than the control group.\n\nA random effects model  (DerSimonian & Laird, 1986)  was used in the analyses to incorporate the assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, treatment effects. In addition, the random effects model was used to incorporate heterogeneity beyond that explained by the explanatory variable(s) included in the meta-regression. Where the metaregression suggested the presence of a potentially important covariate, we used sub-group analyses to further investigate the data. To counter the high risk of false-positive results in the univariate meta-regressions because of among-study heterogeneity and the large number of covariates, we used the  Higgins and Thompson (2004)  Monte Carlo permutation test (10,000 permutations) to calculate p-values adjusted for multiple testing (implemented using the revised metareg command in Stata).\n\nTo examine statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, both the Q statistic and I 2  (Higgins & Thompson, 2002)  were used as well as a visual inspection of the forest plots. I 2 describes the \"...percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance\"  (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003) . Based on suggestions made by  Higgins et al. (2003) , we interpreted an I 2 of over 75% as high heterogeneity and over 50% as moderate.\n\nWe used random effects univariate meta-regression models to examine whether any of the following intervention characteristics were associated with intervention effectiveness: target behavior (coded as physical activity or healthy eating); number of intervention techniques, duration of intervention (weeks); source of delivery (coded as medically trained health professional non-medically trained health professional or non-health professional); format of delivery (coded as individual, group, or mixed); country (coded as UK, other European, US or other); treatment setting (coded as community, primary care, or workplace); total number of techniques; use of multiple sessions (coded as yes or no); time of outcome measurement (coded as immediate or follow up); target population: disadvantaged/low income (yes, no); target population: sedentary/low active/obese/at risk of cardiovascular disease (yes, no); target population: women only (yes, no).\n\nRandom effects univariate meta-regression models were also used to examine the association between the 26 individual behavior change techniques and intervention effectiveness. To be included in the analysis, each technique was required to be evaluated by at least four separate studies. We then created a multivariate meta-regression model including all study characteristics and behavior change techniques that were shown in the univariate models to have a meaningful association (i.e., \u03b2 >.10 for dichotomous variables) with effect size.\n\nTo examine how much of the heterogeneity was accounted for by the covariates(s) included in each model, we used the adjusted R 2 produced by the revised metareg command in Stata. The adjusted R 2 is calculated by comparing the baseline value of the heterogeneity variance (\u03c4 a 2 )\n\nobtained from the empty regression model with the heterogeneity variance from the metaregression (\u03c4 b 2 ) after the covariate(s) were added, using the following formula: 100% x ([\u03c4 a 2 -\n\nSensitivity analyses were used to explore the effect of removing: a) studies which were not randomised at the individual participant level; b) studies not randomised or for which assumptions about statistical significance were made, and c) studies with results classified as outliers, determined by the Sample-Adjusted Meta-Analytic Deviancy (SAMD) Statistic  (Huffcut & Arthur, 1995) .\n\nWe assessed the possibility of publication bias using the Stata metabias command. Where there was evidence of significant asymmetry in the funnel plot (as judged by the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation test)  (Begg & Mazumdar, 1994) , we used the Stata metatrim command to perform the Duval and Tweedie nonparametric \"trim and fill\" method  (Duval & Tweedie, 2000) . This method was used to examine the impact of the missing studies by adjusting the meta-analysis to take into account the theoretically missing studies."

Fifty-one evaluations targeted physical activity only, 35 targeted healthy eating only and 18 targeted both. Table  1 , shows that the majority of studies evaluated a multifaceted intervention, using more than one behavior change technique. Of a possible 26 behavior change techniques, the overall average per intervention was 6.0 (SD = 3.1) (online supplementary, Table  S3 ). Two techniques were used in less than four evaluations ('provide information about others' approval' and 'prompt identification as role model/ position advocate'). In most evaluations, the intervention was compared with a no treatment or treatment-as-usual control, while a small number of evaluations used an active control. Overall, the mean number of techniques in the control groups was 0.8 (SD = 1.3).\n\nThe duration of interventions varied greatly, ranging from receipt of a single session to two and a half years (M = 24.9 weeks, SD = 29.1) (online supplementary material, Table  S3 ). Overall, in 16% of the evaluations the treatment was brief (< 1 day), in 9% it was less than one month, in 34% it was between 1 and 5 months, in 22% it was between 6 and 11 months, and in 20% it was 12 or more months long. Overall, in 84% of evaluations, multiple sessions were used to deliver the intervention, and the majority (59%) assessed the outcome at follow up, which ranged from one week to 36 months post baseline assessment. In 13% of evaluations, the intervention was delivered by a clinically trained health professional (defined as someone qualified to provide direct patient care), in 28% delivery was by a non-clinically trained health professional (e.g., health educators or exercise facilitators) and in 59% a non-professional delivered the intervention.\n\nFormat of intervention delivery was 'individuals' in 62% of evaluations, 'groups' in 17% and both individuals and groups in 20%. In 55% of evaluations, the setting was the community, in 25% primary care and in 20% the workplace. Studies were conducted in Australasia (10%), Canada (2%), United Kingdom (11%), another European country (11%), the US (61%) or Japan (4%).

Sensitivity analyses excluding studies defined as outliers 2 , non-randomised studies or other studies for which assumptions were made had little effect on either the overall effect size or heterogeneity.\n\nModerating variables. To explore the reason for heterogeneity across evaluations, we used meta-regression to examine 10 intervention characteristics (e.g., target behavior, duration of intervention, target population) and the 26 behavior change techniques (see online supplementary material, Table  S4  and S5, Models 1 to 33). Initially, potential moderators were entered into univariate models to determine the size of the association and the percentage of among-study heterogeneity (adjusted R 2 ) explained by the covariate. The results indicated that most variables explained very little of the heterogeneity, with 'prompt self-monitoring of behavior' (T12)\n\nexplaining the greatest amount (13%) (see model 21).

      "text": "This systematic review of interventions designed to promote physical activity and/or healthy eating used a novel approach to classifying intervention content according to change techniques and theoretically-derived technique combinations  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) . Use of metaanalysis and meta-regression showed that specification of intervention content clarified which interventions were most likely to be effective.\n\nThose including self-monitoring and at least one of four other self regulatory techniques derived from control theory (Carver & Scheier,1981; 1982) were significantly more effective than interventions not including these techniques, both in interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating. Thus our hypothesis that inclusion of the five techniques derived from control theory (i.e., prompt goal setting, specify goals in relation to contextualized actions, self monitoring of behavior, feedback on performance, and review of previously-set goals) was partially supported. We identified 122 evaluations of interventions which actively involve adults living in the community in cognition and behavior change sessions and were evaluated using an experimental or quasi experimental design. We found that such interventions are effective with effect sizes of 0.32 and 0.31 for physical activity and healthy eating interventions, respectively. These are small effect sizes (Cohen, 1992) in the typical range for psychological interventions (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Our results show that the behavioral target and many design characteristics (duration, person delivering the intervention, delivery format [e.g., individual versus group], setting [e.g., workplace or community settings], use of multiple sessions, time to follow up, target population did not distinguish between effective and ineffective interventions. Moreover, the number of behavior change techniques included did not increase effectiveness. This may be because intervention quality and fidelity of delivery may be compromised by a large number of techniques. By contrast, intervention content was associated with intervention effectiveness. Moderator analysis, using both univariate and multivariate meta-regression, revealed that the number of theoretically-derived self-regulation techniques, and in particular, self-monitoring of behavior was associated with improved effectiveness. The interpretation of this effect is supported by the finding that combining self-monitoring with the other theoretically-predicted techniques enhances its effect. Interventions combining self-monitoring with one or more of four other hypothesized self-regulation techniques, namely, prompting intention formation or goal setting, specifying goals in relation to particular contextualized actions, providing feedback on performance and reviewing previously-set goals were significantly more effective than interventions not including self-monitoring and one other self-regulatory technique (pooled effect sizes for healthy eating: 0.54 versus 0.24; physical activity: 0.38 vs. 0.27; all interventions: 0.42 vs. 0.26). Unfortunately, we were unable to reliably compare interventions which combined all five of our hypothesized self-regulatory technique set with those that did not because only two studies included all five. Nonetheless, these data strongly suggest that inclusion of self-monitoring in combination with other self-regulation behavior change techniques is likely to enhance the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote healthy eating and physical activity.\n\nIt would be desirable to test our hypothesis on a larger set of intervention studies, since the model may be over-determined, given the ratio of techniques to studies. However, at present, this would mean relaxing the methodological rigour by which we selected evaluations, i.e., including only experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Sensitivity analysis suggests that our findings are robust. For example, it is possible that the magnitude of the intervention effects were overestimated due to publication bias, indicated by asymmetry in the funnel plot (provided in the online supplementary materials). However, using the \"trim and fill\" method  (Duval & Tweedie, 2000)  to adjust the meta-analysis to incorporate the theoretically missing studies, the overall pooled effect size did not substantially change. In addition, excluding both non-randomised studies and studies for which we had to make assumptions when calculating effect sizes (for example, studies reporting non-significant effects were assumed to have an effect size of 0.50) did not substantially change the results. This suggests that our sample of intervention evaluations is representative of the population of such evaluations using rigorous evaluation methods.\n\nOur analyses do not illuminate determinants of a large proportion of unaccounted variance in effect size heterogeneity but we have shown that a series of study characteristics that might be expected to affect effectiveness do not account for this heterogeneity. It is likely that combinations of characteristics and behavior change techniques may interact to account for this heterogeneity.\n\nHowever, the number of studies in the available literature does not allow us to reliably explore these potential effects.\n\nIn   , 5, 6, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26 Calfas et al., 2000 (M)  144 -0.17 0.17\n\nCampbell et al., 2002 538 0.12 0.24 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13,

Three search filters were used, one for interventions targeting physical activity/healthy eating, one for study design and one to exclude those with chronic diseases. Studies were also sought from experts in the field, identified by the British Psychological Society's Division of Health Psychology experts list. Inclusion criteria specified interventions which recruited adults' (18 years or over) in order to increase their levels of physical activity or healthy eating, used experimental or quasiexperimental designs (that is, controlled trials and interrupted time series designs) and outcome measures that were objective, standardised or validated self-report measures. Inclusion criteria also specified that interventions had to use cognitive or behavioral change strategies so that, for example, interventions consisting only of the provision of information were excluded. The following were excluded: interventions aimed at pregnant or recently post-natal women, amateur or professional athletes, those already engaged in a another intervention such as dietary, slimming or fitness programs, and interventions targeting those not living in the free-population or those exclusively targeting participants with physical or mental health problems. Studies targeting the general population, with a small proportion exhibiting physical or mental health problems, were included if members of that sub-set were assessed as being healthy enough to participate by a physician.

Three search filters were used, one for interventions targeting physical activity/healthy eating, one for study design and one to exclude those with chronic diseases. Studies were also sought from experts in the field, identified by the British Psychological Society's Division of Health Psychology experts list. Inclusion criteria specified interventions which recruited adults' (18 years or over) in order to increase their levels of physical activity or healthy eating, used experimental or quasiexperimental designs (that is, controlled trials and interrupted time series designs) and outcome measures that were objective, standardised or validated self-report measures. Inclusion criteria also specified that interventions had to use cognitive or behavioral change strategies so that, for example, interventions consisting only of the provision of information were excluded. The following were excluded: interventions aimed at pregnant or recently post-natal women, amateur or professional athletes, those already engaged in a another intervention such as dietary, slimming or fitness programs, and interventions targeting those not living in the free-population or those exclusively targeting participants with physical or mental health problems. Studies targeting the general population, with a small proportion exhibiting physical or mental health problems, were included if members of that sub-set were assessed as being healthy enough to participate by a physician.

The implications of these analyses need to be tested experimentally with study designs of interventions which do, and do not include, sets of behavior change techniques theoretically predicted to effect change (e.g., the set of five intervention techniques based on Carver and Scheier's [1981; 1982] control theory). This will advance both the design of more effective interventions and theory development."
