      "text": "In the postpandemic era, the significance of mobile health (mHealth) has been highlighted, and explosive growth in this area is expected to continue  [1, 2] . Cutting-edge technologies are converging with health care, and mHealth, based on hyperconnected intelligence, is leading the paradigm shift in medical care  [3, 4] . Many countries have already entered a superaged society, and the proportion of gross domestic product expenditures for medical care is increasing due to an upsurge in the number of people with chronic diseases. In addition, the excessive demand compared to the available supply, the lack of health care infrastructure, and the unbalanced distribution of medical staff are also problems. Therefore, prediction, prevention, and management through artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical big data analysis are required, and for this purpose, ubiquitous and accessible medical services using personalized devices must be provided  [5] . mHealth is a strong candidate to make this possible, and the ultimate goal is to dramatically improve the standard and satisfaction of living by providing quality services at affordable prices  [6, 7] .\n\nWearable electronics and smartphones are representative types of mobile systems optimized for personalized health care sensing. As shown in Figure  1    [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , wearable devices that cover the human body and smartphones, a necessity for modern people, enable comprehensive health management in real time. Application and placement schematic illustration of wearable devices by body part and smartphone for mHealth management. The images were reprinted from Shin et al  [8, 19] , Kim et al  [9, 19] , Escobedo et al  [10, 19] , Hwang et al  [11] , Nakamura et al  [12, 19] , Hua et al  [13, 19] , Moon et al  [14, 19] , Zhao et al  [15, 19] , Kim et al  [16, 19] , Liu et al  [17, 19] , and Chan et al  [18, 19] . e-Skin: electronic skin; mHealth: mobile health.\n\nHowever, the pace of the development and popularization of mHealth technology is progressing more slowly than expected. From the perspective of a paradigm shift from the smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones, this viewpoint aimed to propose ways to unleash the potentiality of mHealth in the postpandemic era. The smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones do not simply mean that current smartphones become wearable devices and that current wearable devices maintain the functions of current smartphones. The smartphonization of wearable devices is to completely replace the smartphone function with a wearable device, while upgrading health care performance by embedding the current smartphone's computational power and sensor-integrated display, including large-area panels and user interaction, in the wearable system. In addition, the wearable deviceization of smartphones refers to a change in the form factor so that health care sensing can be performed by switching from the current rigid form to a form that can be attached to a curved skin surface. The new form factor, which features both wearable computer and smartphone functions, will improve detection performance through large-area sensing and increase the penetration rate. This viewpoint investigated recent trends in health care sensing methods using wearable devices and smartphones, which are the central axis of mHealth. In the case of wearable devices, the form factor for each detailed location on the body and the corresponding detection target technology was described. In the case of smartphones, it covered the detection target and principles of health care according to the application of internal and external sensors, materials, and software. This viewpoint also analyzed the prospects of and current challenges in existing mHealth systems and considered new health care solutions using flexible displays for the convergence form factor of smartphones and wearables. The differentiating point was to consider the direction of mHealth from the perspective of a sensor-integrated and new form factor display. Ultimately, from a display perspective, solutions for the smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones will provide insight into the health care paradigm shift."

Face-wearable devices with various form factors, such as bands, caps, headsets, lenses, glasses, tattoos, mouthguards, and masks, may be distributed at each part of the head, eyes, nose, mouth, and ears to sense critical biosignals. In the case of the head, a wearable system that can analyze brain waves and psychological states can be applied  [8, 20, 21] . Figure 2A  [8]  shows a wireless wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement device based on a tattoo. AI can enhance decision-making by deep learning classification of received EEG data. Namely, it advances the decision performance of AI by feedback through brain waves. Additionally, it would be possible to grasp the degree of brain activation and mental condition of the frontal lobe and temporal lobe through the measurement of biosignals, such as brain waves."

In the case of lenses, eye health factors, such as glucose, intraocular pressure, and electroretinographic measurements, can be determined using noninvasive methods  [9, 22, [24] [25] [26] . For example, a corneal sensor embedded in a disposable soft contact lens can be deployed for electroretinography based on electrochemical anchoring, as shown in Figure 2B  [22] . These corneal lenses are functional sensors tailored for ophthalmic electroretinographic testing in human eyes via a user-friendly interface and a design that can be deployed noninvasively. Glasses for health care are prescribed by doctors as an auxiliary tool for surgery and can also analyze the electrolyte and metabolite content of sweat flowing from the head  [27] [28] [29] . In addition, a wearable system placed on the nose in the form of a nose pad on the glasses can sense the pulse wave, respiratory rate, and electrooculographic measurements  [30, 31] ."

Such a device may be used in research to study the prevention of hypertension by facilitating continuous quantification analysis of sodium intake. Figure 2D  [10]  shows a sensing platform for detecting gaseous CO 2 inside a face mask via stable inorganic phosphors whose luminescence is controlled by a pH indicator. A mask combining a battery-free printed near-field communication (NFC) tag and a photochemical sensor for noninvasive CO 2 measurement was used to achieve detection performance with a resolution of 103 ppm. Practicality in physical activity has been increased through the compensation of the temperature noise and characterized analytical specifications of measurement systems.

The system, which uses a pressure sensor and mixed-signal radio electronics, follows the principle of sensing the air pressure change inside the channel when breathing force is applied to the transducer surface. In particular, tactile sensing, including pressure sensing, is critical in health care. This is because tactile sensors attached to the skin detect physical stimuli, such as breathing patterns, heart rate, pulse, muscle activity, and body temperature, linked to biological signals. Skin, the most widely distributed organ among the five sense organs in the human body, is a tactile sensor with receptors that detect pressure, delicate movements, and temperature and is also an actuating organ that emits the same physical stimulation.\n\nFlexibility is a crucial element for the tactile sensor to be conformally attached to the skin to detect minute physical changes in detail and increase user convenience  [50] [51] [52] .\n\nFurthermore, digestible pills check medication compliance. Management of medication adherence can prevent patients with severe mental illness from experiencing relapses and hospitalizations  [53] .

For instance, a multisensory electronic skin integrated into a polyimide network simultaneously detects physical properties, such as temperature, strain, humidity, light, magnetic field, pressure, and proximity, in real time, as shown in Figure 4A  [13] . It can also be used for rehabilitation evaluation using personalized intelligent prostheses."

Among them, wristwatches, bands, and bracelet devices can detect health factors, such as the heart rate, oxygen saturation, number of steps, blood pressure, ECG characteristics, glucose, blood sugar, and sweat metabolites  [14, 15, [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] . Figure 4B  [15]  shows a magnetoelastic generator that provides the power to drive a wearable biosensor system. This generator can help measure cardiovascular parameters underwater without encapsulation for telemedicine and has excellent water vapor transmission characteristics.\n\nA patch sensor attached to the arm can measure the pH, sweat rate, lactate, heart rate, temperature, electromyogram (EMG) and ECG characteristics, blood pressure, and water content and can also be applied for wound treatment and rehabilitation evaluation  [62] [63] [64] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . For instance, a stand-alone organic skin patch for health care with an organic light-emitting display with sufficient pixels reports the heart rate via a stretchable photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor, as shown in Figure 4C  [62] . An ultrathin patch of 15 \u03bcm is configured on a soft elastomer substrate and can operate stably at 30% strain using a combination of a stress relief layer and deformable microcracks. Figure 4D  [63]  shows a wireless graphene patch that simultaneously provides thermal sensing and thermotherapy capabilities. This thermal patch consists of a graphene-based capacitive sensor, a graphene thermal pad, and a flexible wireless communication module to continuously monitor temperature changes with high resolution and sensitivity and perform thermal treatment through a graphene-based heater. Beyond the existing complex multisensor structure, skin patches alone may decode movements of 5-finger gestures by detecting microdeformation using the laser-induced crack structure, as shown in Figure 4E  [64] . Based on the same principle, it can be attached to various body parts to track physical movements.\n\nFurthermore, ECG, EMG, temperature, sweat, and interstitial fluid analyses can be performed following health care monitoring through arm tattoos  [16, 86] . For instance, a noninvasive epidermal biosensing system includes physically separated electrochemical biosensors for the extraction of interstitial fluid at the cathode and sweat stimulus extraction at the anode, as shown in Figure 4F  [16] . Namely, this biomarker monitoring system is a single wearable epidermal platform that simultaneously samples and analyses different biofluids."

For instance, appropriate dressing changes for exudative wounds are essential. Using a moisture sensor mounted on the bandage, as shown in Figure 5A  [89] , the change in the amount of dressing on the wound can be detected and the replacement time determined, increasing patient convenience. A motion capture device can accurately measure the movement of limbs during daily activities, strenuous exercise, and long-term exercise, as shown in Figure 5B  [17] . Existing drift and instability problems are solved by integrating microtriaxis inertial and microtriaxis flow sensors. Additionally, it is possible to evaluate gait performance on irregular and uneven surfaces using a wearable sensor in the form of a strap with 6 inertial measurement units (IMUs) and an analysis algorithm, as shown in Figure 5C  [92] .

As shown in Figure 6A  [18] , the atrial fibrillation screening ability using PPG pulse analysis based on a smartphone camera and a commercialized app showed a similar performance level to that of patches used for singlelead ECG monitoring. It has been proven that prodromal stroke symptoms can be detected using only a smartphone in a primary care setting. In addition, the fingertip motion signal and color intensity signal, both heterogeneous signals, are acquired and analyzed using a camera to remove finger movement and optical noise, as shown in Figure  6B  [104].

The platform shown in Figure  7A  [128] performs a visual, quantitative analysis of pesticides using an optical system that combines a dark cavity and an ultraviolet lamp with a smartphone. In other words, integrating a smartphone and a gadget-based paper strip enables real-time and on-site food evaluation.

In particular, the third generation of medicine and therapies that rely on novel solutions are emerging beyond the existing state of mHealth. Among them, bioelectronic medicine is a nonpharmacological treatment category that stimulates nerve functions with energy, such as electricity, light, and ultrasonic waves. This approach uses an electronic device that controls metabolic function to maintain homeostasis by regulating hormones [141]. To date, electroceuticals have been used for obesity, asthma, sleep apnea, brain tumors, epilepsy, and Parkinson disease and have shown substantial and significant therapeutic effects  [142] [143] [144] . It is also one of the most innovative fields in medicine because it has significant advantages when considering the development time and cost of existing drugs.\n\nUsing digital therapeutics, also referred to as \"software as a medical device,\" it is possible to manage and treat not only physical diseases but also psychiatric conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia  [145, 146] . It is of great significance in terms of patient convenience that personal and sensitive mental health conditions can be diagnosed in real life, not in hospitals, through digital phenotypic analysis, such as smartphone usage patterns and uploaded social networking service (SNS) content.\n\nFrom the point of view of the wearable form factor, since much of health care sensing is possible on the wrist, the smartwatch is currently playing a pivotal role in health care. The finger (as well as the wrist) is a body part to focus on as it can be used to assess health factors, such as the heart rate, oxygen saturation, ECG characteristics, blood pressure, blood sugar, biometric authentication, body temperature, and dietary monitoring. Therefore, it is expected that in the future, the ring type of device for health care will pair with the smartwatch as the 2 main pillars."

      "text": "This viewpoint investigated comprehensive health care sensing technology using wearable electronics and smartphones. However, mHealth is less widely used than expected, unfortunately. Wearable devices are relatively more optimized for continuous and real-time health care sensing compared to smartphones  [147, 148] . However, the penetration rate compared to smartphones worldwide is sluggish  [149] [150] [151] . A smartwatch, a representative wearable device, needs to be connected to a smartphone to operate, so users do not recognize the wearable device as an independent entity. Independent use is required to be fully positioned as a separate device. These devices lack effectiveness due to reduced user convenience because of their small screens, poor battery performance, low usage rate, clunky design, and high price. Wearable devices are recognized as a kind of subdevice rather than an essential and leading product because they do not have as much impact as smartphones. Therefore, in the case of wearable devices, innovative solutions are required to make them universal necessities for human beings, such as smartphones.\n\nHowever, in the case of smartphones, the penetration rate is high worldwide, including low-and middle-income countries  [152] . In the case of current smartphones, the fundamental value in terms of user experience as well as utility is high. However, it is not such a great solution from the perspective of health care. It is challenging to conduct biosignal sensing using a smartphone while being in close contact with human skin all day long, so it is challenging to implement continuous real-time big data-based predictive and preventive medical care using smartphones from the health care perspective. Smartphones desperately require a breakthrough that can allow them to monitor health in real time continuously, 24 hours a day, through a form more closely adherent to the skin, while maintaining the current phone function."

      "text": "The display is a crucial component of a health care system. In other words, smartphones and wearable devices, as central axes of the mHealth system, are inseparable from their displays. In addition, displays and sensors in mobile devices are closely related. To improve the convenience of user interaction, the proportion of the active area of mobile displays is increasing. However, the increase in the active area has a limitation that reduces the sensing performance, including sensitivity. To overcome this, the upper part of the sensor covers the display by lowering the resolution of the display to prevent the deterioration of the sensing transmittance. A typical example is under-panel camera (UPC) technology that covers the camera with the display by reducing the display resolution on the top of the CMOS image sensor to increase light transmittance."

      "title": "Sensor-Integrated Display Solution",
      "text": "However, the ultimate and ideal method is a sensor-integrated display solution. A sensor-integrated display has many advantages from a health care sensing point of view. This is because (1) many mHealth sensors use an optical approach, (2) it is relatively easy to manufacture large-area sensors, and (3) the application of a new form factor display can lead to an increase in the body contact area.\n\nFirst, the majority of mHealth sensing approaches are optical methods. Various health care parameters, such as the heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, environmental monitoring, and ECH characteristics, can be measured optically. A display is an optical system that already has the means to transmit light. Therefore, a sensor-integrated display could be an optimized health care solution. To implement health care devices using optical systems, in addition to optical transmitters, receiver systems must also be equipped. For advanced performance, the light-emitting wavelength band needs to be expanded and supplemented, including infrared as well as visible light, through the development of materials for the light-emitting layer.\n\nSecond, since the sensing area and detection performance are proportional, health care ability can be improved through a sensor embedded in a wide display area. It enables health care sensing in a large area over the entire display area when the built-in optical system is applied, considering design rules. In addition, it is more advantageous for wearability because of a reduction in volume due to the implementation of microlevel thickness because of the sensor-integrated display. Additionally, compared to the number of photomasks needed to manufacture a conventional display, the number of additional photomasks required to implement a display health care system with built-in sensors is far less. It can contribute to popularization due to the low manufacturing price according to the integral type. Ultrathin, low-cost health care devices with relatively simple processes have significant benefits over conventional, bulky, and expensive wearable computers.\n\nFinally, the new form factor device, such as a stretchable sensor-integrated display, increases the area of contact with the body and improves detection capability through health care sensing in close contact with the skin. Flexible panels with user convenience could be applied to the human skin, considering ergonomic factors  [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] . The flexibility of not only the active matrix backplane and core of the panel but also the touch sensor, fingerprint sensor, and pressure sensor must be ensured, as shown in Figure  8A  [153]. In a complete sensor-integrated display, the flexibility of the backplane allows the sensor part to gain flexibility naturally. Furthermore, Figure  8B  [154] shows a wearable full-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display using a 2D material-based backplane transistor suitable for complex skin shapes. The 18\u00d718 thin-film transistor array was fabricated on ultrathin MoS 2 film and then transferred to Al 2 O 3 (30 nm)/polyethene terephthalate (6 \u03bcm), providing mechanical flexibility beyond conventional OLED technology."

      "text": "The left picture of Figure  8C  simulates a multilayered display, and when this display is bent, tensile strength is applied at the top and compressive strength is applied at the bottom. Assuming that it is formed with only a single layer of the same thickness rather than a laminated structure, extreme tensile and compressive forces occur on the upper and lower surfaces, resulting in cracks in the display, as shown by the solid blue line in the right graph. However, in the stacked structure, a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) between the display layers continues to create new neutral planes, as shown by the dotted red line. In response, the magnitude of the tension and compression force at the top and bottom surfaces does not increase, even if the thickness of the display increases. In other words, using the PSA, it is possible to implement a flexible display without cracks.\n\nNo part of the human body is flat. When the health care system and the skin conformally adhere, sensing performance improves. Display technology based on PSA with the harmony of creep and recovery characteristics induces form changes in wearable devices and smartphones. A new form factor with flexibility based on PSA technology that creates a new neutral plane will facilitate a critical conversion of the mHealth system."

      "text": "A new form factor display for health care with flexibility and display convergence technology using an optical method attaches a large-area health care system to the human skin conformally and continuously detects health care factors in real time, thereby providing a framework for collecting big data. As a result, the existing smartphone becomes a wearable device attached to the body, and the existing wearable device is equipped with smartphone functions suitable for user convenience. Namely, convergence health care technology with the sensor-integrated and new form factor display is an indispensable element that enables the smartphonization of a wearable device and the wearable deviceization of the smartphone. Of course, health care systems with new form factors and sensor-integrated displays do not solve all mHealth problems. In other words, advances in big data AI software analysis and medical security should go hand in hand with the smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones. Furthermore, it will be necessary to supplement the medical system policy so that these benefits do not become the exclusive property of the upper class of the economy and so that people from lower social classes can also benefit. Advanced and popularized mHealth system technology could ensure universal health coverage so that everyone can use essential, high-quality medical services without discrimination. In other words, the authentic democratization of health care could become a reality, and a standard for a future health care paradigm in the post-pandemic era could arise."

      "text": "Personalized platforms, such as wearable devices and smartphones, can be applied to AI-based disease prediction, prevention, and treatment. This viewpoint researched the latest technology trends in mHealth regarding form factors and detection targets according to body attachment location and type. In particular, the sensor convergence technology of the new form factor display provides a framework to analyze health factors in real time by conformally adhering a large-area system to the skin. Innovation in form factors in sensor-integrated displays and convergence health care solutions enable the smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones. In addition, the strategy for the smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones can accelerate the development of mHealth, realizing the democratization of medical care so that anyone can use essential services of high quality. Furthermore, it is expected to create a new milestone for the medical paradigm shift in the postpandemic era."
