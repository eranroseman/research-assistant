  "title": "Remote Patient-Reported Outcomes and Activity Monitoring to Improve Patient-Clinician Communication Regarding Symptoms and Functional Status: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE Routine collection of patient-generated health data (PGHD) may promote earlier recognition of symptomatic and functional decline. This trial assessed the impact of an intervention integrating remote PGHD collection with patient nudges on symptom and functional status understanding between patients with advanced cancer and their oncology team. METHODS This three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted from November 19, 2020, to December 17, 2021, at a large tertiary oncology practice. We enrolled patients with stage IV GI and lung cancers undergoing chemotherapy. Over 6 months, patients in two intervention arms received PROStep-weekly text message-based symptom surveys and passive activity monitoring using a wearable accelerometer. PGHD were summarized in dashboards given to patients' oncology team before appointments. One intervention arm received an additional text-based active choice prompt to discuss worsening symptoms or functional status with their clinician. Control patients did not receive PROStep. The coprimary outcomes patient perceptions of oncology team symptom and functional understanding at 6 months were measured on a 1-5 Likert scale (5 5 high understanding). RESULTS One hundred eight patients enrolled: 55% male, 81% White, and 77% had GI cancers. Patient-reported clinician understanding did not differ between control and intervention arms for symptoms (4.5 v 4.5; P 5 .87) or functional status (4.5 v 4.3; P 5 .31). In the intervention arms, combined patient adherence to weekly symptom reports and daily activity monitoring was 64% and 53%, respectively. Intervention patients in the PROStep versus PROStep 1 active choice arms reported low burden from wearing the accelerometer (mean burden [standard deviation], 2.7 [1.3] v 2.1 [1.3]; P 5 .15) and completing surveys (2.1 [1.2] v 1.9 [1.3]; P 5 .44). CONCLUSION Patients receiving PROStep reported high understanding of symptoms and functional status from their oncology team, although this did not differ from controls.",

      "text": "Patients with advanced cancer suffer from significant symptoms, decreases in functional status, and worsening quality of life because of cancer progression or treatment.  [1] [2] ] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  These are associated with lower survival, greater acute care utilization, and higher financial burden for patients, caregivers, and the health care system.  [8] [9] ] [10] [11] [12] [13]  Accurate identification of patients with high symptom burden, poor quality of life, or poor functional status is critical for the delivery of high-quality cancer care.  [14] [15] 5] [16]  However, in large prospective studies, oncology clinicians identify as low as 25% of patient-reported symptoms.  11, [17] [18] 8] [19] [20] [21]  Furthermore, in nearly three quarters of cases where patient-and clinician-reported symptoms are not concordant, clinicians underestimate symptom severity.  11, [17] [18] ] [19] [20] [21]  Similarly, oncology clinicians often overestimate patient activity levels, and discordant patient and clinician assessments of functional status are associated with worse survival.  [22] [23] [24] [25]  Patient-generated health data (PGHD) are routinely collected information about symptoms and activity levels that patients report directly or passively using devices such as wearable accelerometers.  [26] [27] 7] [28] [29]  Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), typically symptoms that are directly reported by a patient, are one example of PGHD.  [30] [31] 1] [32] [33]  PROs may be collected in the clinic, and randomized trials of PROs demonstrate survival and health care utilization benefits.  34, 35 In addition to quality of life and symptom burden, functional status also informs a patient's treatment and prognosis. PGHD may offer objective measures of functional status that could improve upon often discordant patient and clinician assessments.  25, 36 ctivity monitoring among patients with advanced cancer is feasible and associated with high levels of adherence in previous trials.  [37] [38] 8] [39] [40]  Technologies that enable remote collection of PROs and functional status using text message-based questionnaires and passive activity monitoring via accelerometers may provide more objective, granular, and relevant information to clinicians.  32 lue-based cancer care models, including Medicare's recently announced Enhanced Oncology Model, now require PGHD collection to satisfy quality metrics. Although PGHD provide important clinical and prognostic data, a critical evidence gap is how to optimally integrate these data in clinical care to prompt earlier recognition of symptom and functional decline that could lead to treatment modification or goals-of-care conversations. Behavioral economic principles can inform the optimal use of PGHD to improve symptom management.  41 Clinician-targeted automated default email and text alerts about prognostic risk or evidence-based practice may improve guideline-based practice in oncology.  [42] [43] 3] [44]  Additionally, patient-targeted nudges using active choice-a behavioral economic method used to address delays in decision making by prompting an immediate decision between choices-have been shown to increase rates of cancer screening and may prompt patients to proactively discuss burdensome symptoms with their clinicians.  [45] [46] 6] [47]  The objective of this study was to test the impact of an intervention integrating remote collection of PGHD with clinician and patient nudges to improve patientreported clinician understanding of symptoms and functional status for patients with advanced cancer."

Weekly clinic schedules for GI and lung cancer specialty oncologists were screened for eligible patients who were undergoing intravenous chemotherapy. Patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor therapy, targeted therapies (eg, cetuximab, trastuzumab), or oral chemotherapy without concurrent intravenous chemotherapy were excluded to enrich the study population for patients likely to experience treatment-related toxicity who may benefit from closer symptom and functional status monitoring. Eligible patients were English-speaking, used a smartphone with short message service and Bluetooth capabilities, and received their primary oncology care at the study center. Patients on active interventional trials were excluded because such trials often have a PRO collection mechanism that may confound the impact of the intervention. Finally, we excluded patients who were confined to a wheelchair or bed because step data collected as a key feature of the intervention would not be expected to improve care for these patients."

      "text": "The PROStep intervention consisted of three components. Weekly text message-based surveys were sent to participants at the start of the week on Monday mornings at 10 am on their mobile phone from W2H to allow more time during the week to prompt if needed. These eight-question PRO surveys inquired about select symptoms from the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scored on a 5-point Likert scale (Data Supplement, Fig S1, online only); symptoms were chosen based on feedback from participating oncologists regarding which would be most useful in practice. One question assessed patients' functional status. Nonresponding patients received reminders at 1 and 3 days to complete their survey for that week. Patients who reported a severe symptom received a text encouraging them to contact their oncology team and an electronic health message was sent to their oncologist. Patients were also given an accelerometer (Fitbit Inspire hazard ratio) and asked to wear and sync their device regularly (by opening the W2H application on their phone), with automated prompts to sync sent every 3 days if the device had not been synced in that time frame. Finally, patients' PGHD was summarized in a dashboard (Data Supplement, Fig  S2 ) and provided in paper or electronic form to the patient's oncology clinician (physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner) on the morning of the clinic visit. These dashboards included (1) trends in PROs and step data, with worsening symptoms or step counts highlighted; (2) the date of their last outpatient palliative care visit; (3) the date of their last documented Serious Illness Conversation; and (4) recent acute care utilization in the UPHS (including oncology urgent care, emergency room, and inpatient admissions). PRO data were self-reported and collected from patients using the PRO Survey (Data Supplement, Fig  S1 ).\n\nStep data were collected when participants synced their Fitbit app with the W2H platform. All utilization data were collected via the UPHS electronic health record. To test the effectiveness of patient prompts to discuss symptoms on the intervention's effect on study outcomes, patients in arm C also received an automated active choice text prompt on the morning of every scheduled medical oncology appointment. This message included a text message summary of worsening symptoms and step data followed by an active choice prompt consisting of the following question: \"Do you plan on discussing these symptoms with your oncologist at your upcoming visit? Patients in arm A (control) did not receive PROStep or active choice prompts."

The coprimary outcomes were patient response, on a 1-5 Likert scale, to the following two questions at 6 months: \"How well do you feel your oncology team understands your symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, etc)?\" and \"How well do you feel your oncology team understands your activity level and ability to function?\" Higher values indicated greater patient-perceived symptom and activity level understanding from clinicians. We arrived at the wording of these questions through iterative feedback with GI and thoracic medical oncologists at PCAM, a group of five patients, and the W2H team. Responses to the 3-month assessment were used when 6-month responses were not available due to death, study discontinuation, or failure to complete the 6-month survey. Secondary outcomes included responses to these two questions measured at 3 months and adherence to PGHD collection between arms B and C at 3 and 6 months. Patients were considered adherent for each week that they completed their PRO survey and synced their step data for 4 or more days of that week. Cumulative adherence was calculated by dividing adherent weeks by the total number of weeks that a patient was enrolled in the trial. We assessed additional survey responses among patients in the intervention arms including the following questions: \"I feel that PROStep data prompted better communication with my oncology team about my symptoms,\" \"I feel that PROStep data prompted better communication with my oncology team about my activity level,\" and \"My oncology team has discussed PROStep data during my appointments.\" As another secondary outcome, clinicians completed brief utility surveys for each patient receiving the intervention at 3 and 6 months to provide additional feedback (Data Supplement, Fig  S3 ). Exploratory outcomes included (1) hospitalization and/or emergency room utilization and (2) palliative care visits among patients who had not previously seen specialty palliative care."

T-tests, Kruskal-Wallis, and two-sided proportional tests were performed to compare means of normally and nonnormally distributed outcomes and percentage outcomes, respectively. Our primary end points were originally specified to compare primary outcome questions for arms A versus B versus C; because of lower-than-anticipated enrollment and higher-than-expected mortality, this end point was modified before the completion of the follow-up period and before any data analysis to compare the control arm (A) with the combined intervention arms (B 1 C). Secondary analyses compared responses between individual arms (A v B v C). In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated 6-month analyses only using those patients with completed responses at 6 months. Hypothesis tests were two-sided using a significance level of 0.05. Analyses were conducted via Jupyter Notebook version 6.1.4 using Python 3.8.5 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE).\n\nOn the basis of an estimated 20% dropout and survey nonresponse rate, we estimated that a sample of at least 125 patients would ensure 80% power to detect a 0.68-point Likert scale increase in patient-reported symptom and functional status understanding. The study was terminated after the recruitment of 108 patients because of slow accrual.\n\nBefore launching the study, the research team introduced clinicians to the trial at a weekly tumor board meeting for relevant GI oncology and thoracic medical oncologists. The PIs went over the study plan including the design, background, and outcomes, and provided feedback to refine the intervention. The intervention was also pilot-tested on 10 oncology patients before rollout.  54 The study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this randomized trial, patients receiving PROStep-remote reporting of PGHD with and without active choice prompts to discuss concerning symptoms-reported a high understanding of symptoms and functional status from their oncology team. Despite such positive perceptions and moderate adherence, however, the intervention did not improve patient-perceived symptom understanding relative to controls, owing to high levels of understanding of symptoms and functional status reported by the control group. To what extent was the information provided in the PROstep dashboard helpful for you to better understand your patient's functional status?\n\n1.77 (0. PROStep is one of the first published studies combining PROs with step count data to improve understanding of patient symptoms and functional status. Several of our findings highlight the promise of PGHD collection in routine oncology care. In addition to reporting high levels of symptom and functional status understanding, patients receiving PROStep perceived that clinicians addressed their symptoms and functional status well and that PGHD collection was not overly burdensome. Patients were very likely to recommend the intervention to others. We also found that adherence to text-based PROs and wearable-derived step counts individually was under 70%. Although this is lower than the >90% adherence reported in seminal RCTs of PRO interventions, adherence to PROs in our trial was in line with other real-world rollouts of PROs 55 in community oncology settings. Furthermore, PROStep studied entirely remote methods of PGHD collection.  56, 57 This study used an abbreviated PRO survey of just eight questions delivered using a text-based response system that may have reduced patient burden for reporting. Other trials may have achieved higher adherence by using in-clinic PROs or applying multiple methods of PRO collection (eg, web-based collection or telephone with nursing follow-up for nonrespondents).  58, 59 y contrast, we relied entirely on automated preclinic prompts via text message, and adherence to activity level monitoring required patients to remember to both wear their device and periodically open the W2H application to automatically sync the data. Thus, purely remote collection of PGHD may require other strategies to make it easier for patients to report symptom and activity data.\n\nThere may be several reasons why we found no significant difference in primary or secondary outcomes between intervention and control groups. First, despite literature often showing a disconnect between patients' and clinicians' perception of patient symptoms and functional status,  11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  patients in both control and intervention arms of this study reported high levels of oncology team understanding of symptoms and functional status. In previous research, PRO rollout has been associated with increased patient-reported satisfaction and improved patient-doctor communication.  58, 60, 61 However, in this study, patients in the control arm reported high levels of oncology team understanding of symptoms and functional status, and thus the intervention did not result in a meaningful additional improvement. Additionally, our patient population was ill, with 43% of patients experiencing an emergency room visit or hospitalization and 12% of patients dying during the 6-month follow-up period. Although this population was deliberately selected as they may benefit the most from closer symptom and activity monitoring, patients may have been too acutely ill to benefit from proactive monitoring or to adhere regularly to the intervention, or clinicians may have recognized that increased illness severity and adjusted their communication accordingly. This suggests that the selection of appropriate patient populations may influence the effectiveness of broad-based PGHD collection. There is a clear need to identify specific subpopulations of patients with advanced cancer who are more likely to report a poor understanding of symptoms with their care team and/or who are more likely to benefit from routine PGHD completion.\n\nNotably, patients reported that the intervention marginally improved discussions with their oncologists, but that their team rarely discussed the data; clinicians felt the intervention was less helpful for improving symptom understanding. Overall, these results suggest that remote collection of PROs and activity data has the potential to improve communication about cancer care, but more work is needed in the presentation of the data and to make the data relevant and actionable to clinicians. For instance, studies might identify thresholds for changes in activity level that warrant intervention, while qualitative studies among clinicians may help to elucidate for which patients, when in the therapy cycle, and at what frequency PGHD are most useful. Additionally, strategies that embed targeted PRO data in the electronic health record may be easier for clinicians to act upon PRO data. Finally, worsening PROs require timely response and initial PRO triage by nonclinicians may reduce burden on busy clinicians. This study has several limitations.

      "text": "statistically limited our ability to demonstrate the a priori specified 1-point improvement in patient-perceived symptom understanding that the study was designed to detect. Of note, the study did not measure actual patient-clinician concordance on symptom and functional status understanding, and patients may believe that clinicians have a better understanding of their symptoms and functional status than the literature suggests is the case. Another potential limitation is that our patient population was relatively young (mean age, 58.9 years). Although this age distribution is reflective of the population in our cancer center, and there was a high death/hospitalization rate in this cohort, the results of PROStep for this younger population may not be generalizable to older populations.\n\nIn conclusion, our trial suggests that remote PGHD monitoring is associated with a high understanding of symptoms and functional status between patients and clinicians, although this did not differ from controls. Additional work is needed to streamline remote PRO and activity data collection to improve patient adherence while also creating actionable data that oncology clinicians can interpret to improve symptom management and discussions about treatment and goals of care."
