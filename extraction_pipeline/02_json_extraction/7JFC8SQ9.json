  "title": "The effectiveness of interventions using electronic reminders to improve adherence to chronic medication: a systematic review of the literature",
  "abstract": "Background Many patients experience difficulties in adhering to long-term treatment. Although patients' reasons for not being adherent are diverse, one of the most commonly reported barriers is forgetfulness. Reminding patients to take their medication may provide a solution. Electronic reminders (automatically sent reminders without personal contact between the healthcare provider and patient) are now increasingly being used in the effort to improve adherence. Objective To examine the effectiveness of interventions using electronic reminders in improving patients' adherence to chronic medication. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Electronic searches were supplemented by manual searching of reference lists and reviews. Two reviewers independently screened all citations. Full text was obtained from selected citations and screened for final inclusion. The methodological quality of studies was assessed. Results Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies evaluated short message service (SMS) reminders, seven audiovisual reminders from electronic reminder devices (ERD), and two pager messages. Best evidence synthesis revealed evidence for the effectiveness of electronic reminders, provided by eight (four high, four low quality) studies showing significant effects on patients' adherence, seven of which measured short-term effects (follow-up period <6 months). Improved adherence was found in all but one study using SMS reminders, four studies using ERD and one pager intervention. In addition, one high quality study using an ERD found subgroup effects. Conclusion This review provides evidence for the shortterm effectiveness of electronic reminders, especially SMS reminders. However, long-term effects remain unclear.",

      "text": "Adherence is the extent to which a person's behaviordtaking medication and/or executing lifestyle changesdcorresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider.  1 Many patients, especially those with chronic illnesses, experience difficulties in adhering to prescribed treatment. Average adherence rates to long-term treatment are low.  1 2  Poor adherence compromises the effectiveness of medication treatment and results in suboptimal illness control. This can lead to increased use of healthcare services, reduction in patients' quality of life, and increased healthcare costs. 3e5  Numerous interventions aimed at improving adherence have been conducted, but these were mostly complex and not very effective.  6 omplex interventions are often time consuming, labor intensive and costly, thus not feasible in busy clinical practice. According to experts in the field of adherence, simple interventions, ie, interventions that are workable in daily practice and that are easy for both professional and patient, appear to be most promising in furthering patients' adherence.  7 An example of a simple intervention is reminding patients of their medication intake. Reminders can especially provide a solution for patients who are unintentionally non-adherent, ie, patients who are willing to take their medication but forget it or are inaccurate with their timing.  8 Forgetfulness is commonly reported as a barrier to adherence in various patient populations. 9e18  Albeit the range of patients reporting this barrier varies from 22% to 73% across the studies, in all studies forgetting to take a dose was the most frequently cited reason for non-adherence.\n\nTwo reviews on the effectiveness of 'reminder packaging', which refers to any medication package (eg, a pill box, blister package, bottle) that physically incorporates a system for the day and/or time for medication to be taken, reported modest improvements in adherence to long-term medications.  19 20 However, patients are not actively reminded with this type of packaging. Studies evaluating the effect of personaldand thus actived reminders, such as telephone calls or emails from healthcare providers to patients, revealed positive effects on adherence rates.  21 22 However, personal reminders can require an extensive time investment from healthcare providers. Electronic reminders, on the contrary, are automatically sent to patients at the appropriate time without interference of a healthcare provider. Examples are reminder messages automatically sent to a patient's mobile phone with a short message service (SMS), an electronic reminder device (ERD) that provides patients with an audio and/or visual reminder at predetermined times, or text messages sent to patients' pager to alert them of their medication. This type of reminding does not require additional effort from professionals and may be easy to integrate in patients' daily life.\n\nInterventions using reminders are primarily based on the principles of behavioral learning theory.  23 ccording to this theory, behavior depends on stimuli or cues, either internal (thoughts) or external (environmental cues), suggesting that non-adherent behavior can be modified after sufficient repetition of external stimuli or cues such as reminders.\n\nWith the increasing use of electronic reminders aimed at improving medication adherence, there is a need to gain insight into the effects of this type of reminding. Previous reviews evaluating strategies for improving adherence among which electronic reminders often focused on specific patient populations. For example, Gray et al  24  found that a reminder device might be beneficial to patients with glaucoma. Wise and Operario  25  showed that half of the studies included in their review reported significantly improved adherence in HIV patients as a result of ERD. Misono et al  26  reviewed studies using healthcare information technology interventions to improve adherence to cardiovascular and diabetes medication, and showed that of these interventions, reminder systems provided the best evidence for increasing adherence. To our knowledge, no review has been conducted that systematically studied the effects of specifically electronic reminding (eg, via SMS, ERD, pager/beeper systems) on patients' adherence to a range of long-term medication. Therefore, in this systematic review, we aim to synthesize and critically appraise the existing evidence on the effectiveness of electronic reminders in improving patients' adherence to chronic medication. In addition, we aim to investigate the characteristics of electronic reminders that are associated with their effectiveness."

Performance bias (four criteria), referring to systematic differences between the groups in the care provided to participants, apart from the intervention that is evaluated: (d) participants kept blind to treatment allocation; (e) care providers kept blind to treatment allocation; (g) co-interventions were avoided or were similar for all groups; (h) compliance was acceptable in all groups. 3. Attrition bias (two criteria), referring to systematic differences between the groups in participants who drop out and those who remain: (i) proper description of and acceptability of drop-out rate; (k) analysis according to intention-to-treat principle. 4. Detection bias (two criteria), referring to bias in how outcomes are ascertained, diagnosed or verified: (f) outcome assessor kept blind to participants' exposure to intervention; (j) timing of outcome assessment was similar in all groups.\n\nEach criterion was scored with a 'yes', 'unclear' or 'no', where 'yes' indicates the criteria have been met and thus suggest a low risk of bias.

Eight (four high and four low quality) studies reported significant overall effects on patients' adherence as a result of an electronic reminder. Hardy et al 28 compared the adherence of HIV patients receiving SMS reminders with patients using a beeper as a reminder and found a significant difference in favor of SMS reminding. Strandbygaard et al 31 revealed that adherence rates of asthma patients who received daily SMS reminders were higher than those of patients who were not reminded. The third study also focused on asthma patients and found that an ERD with an audiovisual reminder significantly improved adherence.  34 Two other studies also used an ERD with audiovisual reminders, both in patients with glaucoma, and found higher adherence rates in patients receiving these reminders.  33 38 Da Costa et al 37 reported significant differences in adherence between patients with hypertension who used a reminder alarm card that produced a beep at predetermined times, and patients who did not. Safren et al  40  revealed improvements in adherence in patients with HIV as a result of reminder messages sent to patients' pagers. The last study found that patients who were reminded once a week had higher adherence rates than patients reminded daily or patients not reminded at all.  29 One (high quality) study revealed significant effects in a subgroup of the intervention group; Andrade et al  36  found that an ERD with audiovisual reminders significantly improved adherence in memory-impaired patients (assessed with neuropsychological tests), but not in memory-intact patients.

Regarding the type of electronic reminder, there is evidence resulting from three high quality studies of the effectiveness of SMS reminders in improving adherence.  28 31 Moderate evidence was found for audiovisual reminders from ERD as a strategy to improve adherence, as one high quality and three low quality studies found significant effects.  33 34 37 38 There is insufficient evidence for the effect of pager reminders in particular, as the low quality study reported significant effects.  40 s sensitivity analysis, BES was first repeated using seven high quality RCT (thus disregarding six low quality RCT).

However, limited evidence is now found for the effectiveness of ERD with audiovisual reminders.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This review provides evidence for the short-term effectiveness of electronic reminders in improving adherence in patients using chronic medication. Significant improvements in adherence were found in all but two studies following patients for a period of less than 6 months (four high and four low quality studies).\n\nOnly one (with a high quality) of three studies with long-term follow-up reported significant effects on patients' adherence.\n\nThe electronic reminders evaluated in those studies included SMS reminders, audio/visual reminders from ERD and reminders delivered to pagers. Stratified by the type of electronic reminder, our review shows that SMS reminders in particular but also ERD can be effective strategies for improving patients' adherence in the short run.\n\nMost studies included in this review followed patients for a period of less than 6 months. It is, however, important to investigate whether the effects of electronic reminding remain for a longer time period. Patients who are adherent at first can become non-adherent over time.  43 Furthermore, all 13 studies included in this review automatically sent electronic reminders regardless of whether or not patients took their medication. This may negatively influence the long-term effects of electronic reminders, as these automated reminders can become a routine resulting in habituation. This may be the reason that Pop-Eleches et al  29  found that SMS reminders sent once a week significantly improved the adherence of HIV patients whereas daily reminders did not. Further research is needed to investigate the influence of the frequency with which reminders are sent in improving of adherence. Moreover, real time adherence monitoring is now upcoming,  44 45  offering the possibility to intervene only when patients miss a dose, thus avoiding the reminders becoming routine. The effectiveness of this nonautomated type of electronic reminding on adherence is currently being investigated.  46 ith technology evolving rapidly, the use of older technologies such as pager systems is likely to decrease and new technologies may arise, such as applications for smart phones. Currently, SMS reminding is increasingly being implemented in interventions aimed at improving adherence as mobile penetration is high. The effectiveness is influenced by patients' willingness to receive SMS reminders. Two of the included studies reported patient experiences with SMS reminding.  30 31 Both studies reported a positive evaluation of this type of electronic reminding, although in one of the studies the majority of patients indicated that the predetermined time at which the reminder was sent daily was unsuitable.  31 In addition, three included studies evaluating ERD reported that these devices were well accepted by patients,  35 36 38  which is in line with other research.  47 48 ur review showed that SMS reminders are effective in increasing adherence. There are, however, differences in the SMS reminders sent. One study used personalized text messages that requested a reply,  28  the other two studies yielding significant effects sent standardized text messages without requiring acknowledgment.  29 31 Earlier research showed that a tailored message is usually more effective than a standard text.  49 This cannot be confirmed by our findings. However, more studies are needed to investigate the influence of the content of reminder messages on adherence behavior.\n\nReminders can especially be used to modify the behavior of unintentionally non-adherent patients, ie, patients who are willing to take their medication but forget it or are inaccurate.  8 onetheless, none of the included studies focused specifically on this patient group, implying that the intervention was possibly not suited for some of the patients; those who deliberately miss or alter their doses and make a rational decision to do so by weighing pros and cons of the medication. Interventions using reminders may be more effective when they are solely focused on patients who are unintentionally non-adherent. On the other hand, using text messages, for example, to stimulate patients who doubt the effectiveness of medication by stressing the importance of the intake in the message may provide a solution for intentionally non-adherent patients.  50 eminders can be beneficial for improving adherence in patients of all ages. Elderly patients may be at risk of forgetting to take their medication because of memory problems. Adolescents, on the other hand, may be at risk for forgetting their dose because of their busy (social) lives. Zelikovsky et al  18  reported that being out with friends and participating in activities were reasons for forgetting among adolescent renal transplant candidates. Furthermore, as adolescents extensively use mobile phones, SMS reminders might be particularly useful for reminding them. Miloh et al,  51  for example, showed improved adherence rates as a result of text messaging in pediatric liver transplant recipients. None of the studies included in our review, though, specifically targeted the pediatric population. Future studies involving the pediatric population are recommended.\n\nElectronic monitoring is currently seen as the most reliable and objective method in measuring adherence, while self-report is considered less reliable as this measure tends to overestimate adherence.  52 53 Most studies included in the review used electronic monitoring for adherence measurement, sometimes combined with self-report. In two studies, in which adherence was measured with both electronic monitoring and self-report, effects were only found when adherence was measured with electronic monitoring, while no effects were found for selfreport. A possible explanation may be that with self-report patients report a high adherence rate from the beginning, leaving no or insufficient room for improvement. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating objective methods for adherence measurement into studies whenever possible.  6"

      "text": "The methodological quality of the studies varied. In studies identified as low quality, mostly the risk of selection and attrition bias is present. By using a BES, this methodological quality was taken into account in attributing levels of evidence to effects found in studies.\n\nThe electronic database searches provided five studies in which a more complex intervention was used, with an electronic reminder as one of the aspects of the intervention. 54e58  Those studies only reported the total effect of the complex intervention on patients' medication adherence, no direct relation between the reminder and adherence was reported. Therefore, those studies could not contribute to this review, thus we decided to exclude those studies.\n\nThe primary aim of electronic reminders is to improve patients' medication adherence. Therefore, we focused not on clinical outcomes, but on adherence as (one of the) main outcome measures. In adherence research, a patient is often classified as adherent when an adherence rate of over 80% is reached.  59 This cut-off point indicates the minimum level of adherence needed for therapeutic effect. In the HIV population, the cut-off point is 90%. Although often used, these cut-off points are arbitrary. Only two studies in our review used a cutoff point for adherence. Pop-Eleches et al 29 used a binary indicator of whether HIV patients achieved more than 90% adherence as a primary outcome. Charles et al 34 used cut-off points of over 50%, over 80% and over 90% adherence for asthma patients. Both studies, however, did not link their findings to clinical outcomes nor reported on the clinical significance of the effects found. Trials aiming to evaluate the effects on patients' medication adherence usually have insufficient power to detect significant differences in clinical outcome measures. Of the nine studies that showed an effect on adherence, three studies also reported clinical outcomes,  31 36 37  of which one found a significant improvement in the intervention group.  36 Although adherence appears to be an intermediate outcome, there is evidence of the association between increased adherence rates and positive health outcomes.  4 60"

      "title": "Limitations of the review",
      "text": "A methodological limitation of our review may be that we used a 'top-down' approach in our search strategy, which means that we relied on existing databases and their search terms for identifying relevant studies. This may lead to missing relevant studies due to miscoding of search terms. A 'bottom-up' strategy, relying on searching existing databases in the broadest way possible, is significantly more time and labor-intensive but has the advantage of being comprehensible. To reduce this potential problem, we used the snowball method to identify studies that we possibly missed with our top-down strategy in addition to the electronic database searches."

      "text": "After providing patients with the electronic reminders, no additional effort is needed from healthcare providers, making this an intervention easy to implement in daily practice. Furthermore, electronic reminders and especially SMS reminders appear to be easily integrated into patients' lives. As such, this seems to be a simple intervention for both patient and professional for enhancing medication adherence. However, the healthcare system needs to be ready to include the use of electronic reminders in usual care for patients using chronic medication."

      "title": "Implications for further research",
      "text": "Future studies should aim specifically at patients who are unintentionally non-adherent in examining the effects of electronic reminders on adherence. In addition, further research is needed to identify for which patient groups electronic reminding is most beneficial, for example, studies involving the pediatric population and studies involving patients with other types of chronic illnesses. Moreover, the included studies mostly found short-term improvements. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of electronic reminders and search for additional features of electronic reminding to improve adherence in the long-term. One example may be not to send patients reminders daily at predetermined times, but to intervene only when necessary, by sending patients reminders only when they forget to take their medication.  46 Another example may be to tailor the content of the reminder message to the needs of the patients based on their illness and treatment beliefs.  50"

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "This review shows that electronic reminders lead to short-term improvements of patients' adherence to chronic medication, while the long-term effects remain unclear. The increasing opportunities of new technologies make it possible to tailor reminding both in timing (only when needed) and in content (tailored messages). In this way, long-term improvements in medication adherence may be achieved."

Box 1 presents the principles of BES. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify how sensitive the results of BES are to changes in the way this synthesis was performed. For the sensitivity analysis, BES was repeated in two ways: low quality studies were excluded; studies were classified as high quality if they met four instead of six internal validity criteria."
