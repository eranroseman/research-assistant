  "title": "Benefits and Harms of Digital Health Interventions Promoting Physical Activity in People With Chronic Conditions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital health interventions for managing chronic conditions have great potential. However, the benefits and harms are still unclear. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the benefits and harms of digital health interventions in promoting physical activity in people with chronic conditions. \n Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from inception to October 2022. Eligible randomized controlled trials were included if they used a digital component in physical activity promotion in adults with \u22651 of the following conditions: depression or anxiety, ischemic heart disease or heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, knee or hip osteoarthritis, hypertension, or type 2 diabetes. The primary outcomes were objectively measured physical activity and physical function (eg, walk or step tests). We used a random effects model (restricted maximum likelihood) for meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses to assess the impact of study-level covariates. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Results: Of 14,078 hits, 130 randomized controlled trials were included. Compared with usual care or minimal intervention, digital health interventions increased objectively measured physical activity (end of intervention: standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.29, 95% CI 0.21-0.37; follow-up: SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.31) and physical function (end of intervention: SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.12-0.59; follow-up: SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.01-0.57). The secondary outcomes also favored the digital health interventions for subjectively measured physical activity and physical function, depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life at the end of the intervention but only subjectively measured physical activity at follow-up.

      "text": "Chronic conditions are the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease, which is continuously increasing  [1] . Living with \u22651 chronic conditions significantly impacts a person's life, family, and society  [1] . Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for at least 35 chronic conditions, which has become a global health concern  [2] . Physical inactivity is expensive, constituting up to 4.6% of a country's national health care expenditure  [3] . In contrast, being physically active can benefit physical and psychosocial health  [4] . In fact, following a structured exercise program can reduce the symptoms of chronic conditions with no additional risk of serious adverse events  [5] . However, a high proportion of people living with chronic conditions do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity  [6, 7] , possibly because of various reasons such as lack of access; travel distance; time inconvenience; cost; or internal factors such as pain, lack of motivation, or reluctance to engage in group activities  [8] .\n\nRegarding physical activity interventions, it is essential to understand and adapt care according to the individual's needs, preferences, and abilities  [9] . One way to deliver and make physical activity available, individually or as an add-on, is through digital health interventions  [10] . Digital health involves multiple solutions, including telephone calls, SMS text messages, mobile apps, websites, videoconferencing, and wearables (eg, activity trackers). The potential advantages of digital health solutions are convenience in terms of reduced distance, time, and cost, thereby limiting some of the more traditional barriers to physical encounters  [10] . Digital health solutions enable personalized and person-centered tailored health interventions. Such personalized care empowers people to manage their health, increases health care efficiency, and reduces health care costs  [11] . Consequently, the focus on digital health interventions has steadily grown over the last 2 decades  [12] , accelerating further in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  [13] . This has led to digital health interventions being initiated without fully knowing their effect, potentially introducing people to ineffective interventions  [14] .\n\nSeveral systematic reviews have investigated the effect of digital health interventions on health outcomes in people with individual chronic conditions (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  [COPD] , heart disease, and diabetes)  [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Some reviews have focused on physical activity  [19] [20] [21] 23, 25, 27] , but these included few studies, as they focused on a single condition, solution (eg, only telephone calls or apps), or outcome measure  (eg, pain) . This challenges the assessment of the benefits and harms of digital health intervention. Furthermore, the proportion of people with >1 chronic condition is increasing. More than half of the people with chronic conditions have at least 2 conditions  [28] ; therefore, to increase the power of the results and better resemble real-life clinical practice, including studies on several chronic conditions is relevant. Therefore, a more comprehensive approach is needed to provide clinicians and decision makers with the best current evidence."

Digital health interventions were defined as interventions in which any solution or technology (eg, website, app, and wearable) was used to deliver health information between health care providers and participants over a distance  [47] . Studies were included if  (1)  physical activity (any activity that was up to the participants to choose), exercise (any prescribed activity), or exercise therapy (any planned and structured prescribed activity) was used or promoted; (2) the primary or secondary aim was physical activity promotion; and (3) digital health intervention was delivered with or without additional pharmacotherapy or other nondigital adjuvant interventions  (eg, rehabilitation, education, or counseling) .\n\nMoreover, studies had to include adults (aged \u226518 years) with \u22651 of the following chronic conditions: depression or anxiety (mental health condition), ischemic heart disease or heart failure (heart disease), COPD, osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, hypertension, or type 2 diabetes. The inclusion criteria focused on these specific conditions, as they are among the most common worldwide according to the global burden of disease  [1] . Furthermore, they share the risk factors of physical inactivity and systemic low-grade inflammation, which can cause a chain of events that can lead to worse outcomes and other chronic conditions  [4, 48] .\n\nStudies were excluded if they included angina, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, hypertension if systolic blood pressure \u2264139 mm HG or diastolic blood pressure \u226489 mm Hg, mixed populations of type 1 and 2 diabetes, tested the same digital health intervention but in different settings, or used the digital health solution for monitoring without any interaction with or feedback to the participants (ie, electronic health records or passive use of telemonitoring or a blinded actigraphy device)."

Although no restrictions were applied to the search, we only included studies if available in 1 of the following languages: English, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, or Italian. Covidence was used throughout the selection process.\n\nA standardized data extraction form (piloted in 5 studies) was used. A total of 4 authors (AB, BL, NN, and GZ; in pairs) independently extracted data at two time points: (1) immediately after the end of the intervention and (  2 ) at follow-up, the time point closest to 12-month follow-up. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by referring to a third author (CBJ). WebPlotDigitizer (version 4.5; Ankit Rohatgi) was used to extract data from the figures  [194] . The authors were contacted if the studies had missing or unclear information or data  [195] . If the authors did not respond, the study eligibility was reassessed and consequently excluded."

Another systematic review focused on multimorbidity and the effect of digital telemedicine on health outcomes but did not report any physical activity outcomes  [19] . A third review focused on exercise intervention in people with chronic conditions but solely assessed videoconferencing as the delivery method and found a moderate to small improvement in exercise capacity, which is not directly comparable with physical activity or physical function  [25, 199] . Finally, a fourth review assessed objectively and subjectively measured physical activity in people with chronic conditions and found a small effect in both outcomes but only significant for the subjective measured outcome  [200] .

Clinically, a 1000-steps increase is considered important and showed a risk reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality for each additional 1000 daily steps taken, even below the 10,000 daily recommended steps  [202] . However, we did not find any improvement in MVPA at the end of the intervention. This intensity level may provide even greater health benefits compared with lower physical activity levels, but importantly, any increase in physical activity is associated with health benefits, regardless of the duration  [203] .\n\nAssessing objectively measured physical function by pooling 6MWT data, we found an improvement  (19.8 m)  comparable with previous systematic reviews  [15, 16]  and within the clinically relevant limits of 14.0-30.5 m that are considered clinically meaningful for people across different chronic conditions  [204] ."

      "text": "Subjectively measured physical activity and physical function showed almost the same effect as objectively measured outcomes at the end of the interventions, but it is known that people tend to overestimate their physical activity level when using subjective outcome measures  [205] . It is problematic that the study participants could not be blinded to the intervention, especially when using subjective outcome measures, which is reflected in the higher risk of bias profile of the studies in the subjectively measured outcomes compared with the objectively measured outcomes.\n\nThe digital health intervention also showed end-of-intervention effects on other essential health parameters such as depression, anxiety, and HRQOL. Depression and anxiety often coexist with other chronic conditions but are often undetected and untreated  [206] . However, digital health interventions may offer a dual effect, as we found both an effect on frequent physical conditions and mental health conditions. Furthermore, our meta-regression indicated that there might be a higher effect for people with higher levels of depression. A similar effect was found in a study that investigated in-person physical activity interventions  [5] .\n\nHRQOL is an important person-reported outcome measure and is associated with higher rates of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality  [207] [208] [209] . Our findings are comparable with those of previous research  [210] , which also found a small effect on HRQOL in people with physical disabilities (eg, musculoskeletal conditions); however, we have overlapping studies. There has been a focus on measuring HRQOL in health research  [208] , and HRQOL was by far the most assessed outcome but also showed a high level of heterogeneity, highlighting the differences between trials and within-outcome assessment. This may hide the actual effect because of the differences in the intervention and outcome measures.\n\nAlthough exercise therapy has proven safe and beneficial for people with multiple chronic conditions  [5] , safety is paramount when initiating a digital physical activity intervention. We found an increased risk of nonserious events in the intervention groups, commonly musculoskeletal problems, soreness, or pain, which can be expected after engaging in physical activity, even in face-to-face interventions  [211] . The higher risk of nonserious events should also be seen in the light of including participants with COPD and heart failure, who often experience complications  [212, 213] . No increased risk of serious adverse events aligns with previous reviews of in-person physical activity interventions among people with chronic conditions and multimorbidities  [5, 211] ."

The risk of selection bias within the RCTs, our inclusion criteria, which focused on 8 specific chronic conditions, thereby excluded, for example, cancer, and the fact that only a few RCTs targeted hypertension, depression, anxiety, and multimorbidity limits the generalizability of our results. Furthermore, few RCTs had follow-up data that induced uncertainty regarding whether the effect was maintained beyond the end of the interventions. In addition, the reporting of digital health solutions and the type and dose of physical activity were poor for many RCTs, preventing us from conducting further analyses on the intervention characteristics. Another limitation is the lack of measuring digital health literacy within the included studies, as it is known that low literacy (both health and digital) affects participation and health outcomes and deepens health inequities  [222] . Therefore, we lack information on whether the participants in the included studies were the ones with high or low levels of digital health literacy, as we may suspect that in groups with lower literacy, the effect would become even smaller  [223] .\n\nThe quality of the evidence had to be downgraded to low or very low for objectively measured physical function, subjectively measured physical activity, anxiety, and HRQOL, implying that the actual effect might be different from the estimated effect. In addition, a small study bias cannot be ruled out for some outcomes, although other factors, such as high heterogeneity and low quality of evidence, may contribute to funnel plot asymmetry.\n\nNevertheless, the strengths of this systematic review are the meticulous, state-of-the-art design and methodology, following the Cochrane handbook and reporting using the PRISMA guidelines. In addition, we assessed the effects across several chronic conditions, breaking down the more silo-based thinking of chronicity."

It should also focus on whether any digital health solution or features within these are more effective than others and whether a dose-response relationship exists. Studies focusing on the impact of comorbidities or multimorbidities are also warranted. Furthermore, if digital health solutions are to live up to their potential and be part of the solution to the health care shortage, the digital divide must be addressed by assessing if and how the participants' digital health literacy levels affect digital health interventions."
