  "title": "The growing field of digital psychiatry: current evidence and the future of apps, social media, chatbots, and virtual reality",
  "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies -such as smartphone apps, virtual reality, chatbots, and social media -have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for \"digital phenotyping\" and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions -including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders -as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.",

      "text": "Mental health problems impact over one billion people world wide annually  1  , with depression representing the leading cause of disability across the globe  2  . The World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) outlines evidence based interventions to address this global crisis, yet acknowledg es that barriers include lack of available services and funding  3  .\n\nThe extent of these barriers, even for highincome countries, is highlighted in a December 2020 report from the US government, which indicates that offering evidencebased mental health care in the US alone would require an additional 4 million trained professionals 4 . On a global scale, it is simply not feasible to pro pose that practices based entirely on inperson care will ever be able to meet this demand. Thus, even before the emergence of the COVID19 pandemic, there was growing interest in the pos sible role of new technologies to extend care.\n\nThe rapid international growth in access to and capabilities of digital health technologies (DHTs) presents a feasible route to wards augmenting traditional mental health care and bridging the gap between the need for treatment and the capacity to de liver it. In this paper, we consider DHTs to be innovations beyond electronic medical records or classical telepsychiatry, to instead focus on the recent developments in smartphone apps, virtual reality, social media, and chatbots.\n\nWhile the integration of these DHTs into mental health care began somewhat slowly, restrictions driven by the COVID19 pandemic have sparked a paradigm shift as assumptions, inter est and utilization of digital health have undergone a fundamen tal transformation. Although there has been variability in the response of health care services to the unmet needs raised by the pandemic, a recent study encompassing 17 different coun tries reported an overall increased use of digital health in mental health care settings, as well as a renewed support for facilitating uptake during the pandemic  5  . This increased uptake in response to the pandemic is related not only to DHTs' ability to connect people to care while social distancing regulations are in place, but also to recent innovations in these technologies that enable them to deliver scalable, affordable and accessible mental health care solutions  6, 7  .\n\nIn this stateoftheart review, we explore the technologies, the available research evidence and the implementation issues most relevant to integrating digital psychiatry within mental health care. In the first section, we discuss technology medi ums of smartphones, social media, virtual reality and chatbots as innovations in the digital psychiatry revolution. The second section critically discusses recent research informing the clini cal evidencebased uses of DHTs, with a focus on smartphone studies, covering their use across multiple contexts, from the promotion of public mental health and wellbeing, to the man agement of longterm psychiatric conditions. The third section identifies the forefront challenges towards implementation, and discusses potential solutions for improving the use and facilitat ing evidencebased adoption of DHTs into mental health care across the world."

      "text": "The aptly titled 2012 New York Times article The Therapist May See You Anytime, Anywhere  8  highlights that the use of smart phone devices in mental health care has been discussed and an ticipated for nearly a decade. Smartphones have quickly become a driving force of digital health, due to special properties defining both the hardware and software of these devices.\n\nFrom a hardware perspective, they are compact and wireless, with low purchasing and running costs, making them the first devices to provide ubiquitous connectivity/Internet access for a sizeable proportion of the global population. The sensors on these devices allow for new data capture and graphical/comput ing power for delivery of individualized interventions.\n\nAccording to 2018 survey data, 76% of people in advanced economies and 45% in emerging economies owned a smart phone  9  , with recent data from the US showing that ownership rates may be as high as 70% even among people with severe mental illness  1012  . While a digital divide still does exist, it is feasi ble to envisage that, in the near future, the majority of the world will have access to some form of a smartphone device.\n\nFrom a software perspective, the relative ease of building new smartphone programs (termed applications or \"apps\"), com bined with the centralized online platforms for finding, sharing and downloading these (i.e., the \"app store\"), creates an almost infinite potential for any new idea to quickly become an \"app\", which can in turn be readily proliferated across any number of users, potentially reaching billions of people across the world. Further, smartphones can serve as a digital \"hub\" for integration of novel devices such as wearables and other sensors.\n\nIn the context of mental health, the clearest result of this focus on smartphones has been the massive influx of apps aiming to provide therapeutic interventions for virtually all known mental health problems  13  . Alongside appbased therapeutic interven tions, smartphone devices also hold the potential for bolster ing mental health care in a number of other ways, including: a) capturing longitudinal, dense and multimodal mental health data for use in diagnosis and monitoring; b) analyzing data, increasing ly via machine learning paradigms, to generate clinically individu allevel actionable insights and predictions; and c) offering a wide range of interventions often outside of the app itself, through fa cilitating connections to clinical care, peer support, personalized resources, emergency care, and even novel therapies. Below, we explain in more detail the evidence behind the multifaceted and largescale applications of smartphones."

      "title": "Smartphone sensor data and digital phenotyping",
      "text": "Until recently, a large portion of the understanding around the determinants of the onset, relapse or temporal variation in mental disorders was primarily based on data from large pro spective studies. Although useful, the broad insights gained from such data may fail to capture individual differences or the more finegrained temporal relationships between causes and con sequences of mental illhealth. Across the entire field of health care, smartphones are providing a plethora of data enabling new insights into various conditions, through combining their increasingly detailed streams of longitudinal, multimodal and temporally dense data collection. To better clarify the nature and clinical utility of these data, the concepts of \"active\" and \"pas sive\" data are useful.\n\nActive data typically refers to smartphonebased surveys -i.e., active symptom monitoring or ecological momentary assess ment -which can be completed by the user either spontaneously or in response to a prompt, and then stored while crucially time stamped (a digital record of the date and time when an item was completed) onto the collecting app. Active data capture offers a new means to characterize a patient's clinical course.\n\nWhile most clinical assessment scales have not been validated for deployment on mobile devices, strong correlations between traditional inclinic metrics and their oftensimplified mobile versions suggest adequate face validity  14  . The evolution of these assessments to focus on nontraditional metrics such as percep tion of self, functioning and social life (which research has shown to be particularly important to patients  15  ) provides new oppor tunities for furthering the potential of active data collection. The use of smartphones for cognitive assessment  16  and for remotely monitoring symptoms 17 also appears feasible, with promising results even for severe mental illness such as schizophrenia  18, 19  .\n\nWhile concern is often raised around using mental health apps for monitoring suicidal thoughts and urges, or even elicit ing an increase in symptoms through reactivity to monitoring, research shows that actively collecting data on suicidal thoughts and urges does not elicit adverse effects  20  .\n\nPassive data are obtained automatically through sensors, ei ther on the smartphone or via a wearable device, ranging from simple device use metrics to accelerometry, global positioning system (GPS), and even now voice tone (via microphone) or fa cial expression (via camera) data. These automatically collected data offer a means to reduce patient burden typically related to active data collection, while also capturing novel digital markers of behavior.\n\nOften referred to as \"digital phenotyping\"  21  within the emerging framework of precision psychiatry, the multimodal nature of pas sive data obtained from consumer grade devices offers a means to understand the lived experiences of mental health in context  22  . For example, GPS data have recently offered insights into the re lationship between reduced mobility and poorer mental health during the COVID19 pandemic  23  . Passive data from smartphones have also been shown to correlate with outcomes such as social functioning and loneliness  24, 25  . An important trend emerging from passive data studies in various conditions is that variance, or measures of entropy or deviation from a personal mean, appear of more value than absolute measurements from any sensors  2325  .\n\nRecent reviews suggest that \"most studies still only scratch the surface of advanced smartphone capabilities\"  26  , and less than 2% of apps on the commercial marketplaces appear to leverage digital phenotyping potential  27  . Still, recent studies are employ ing digital phenotyping methods across diverse mental disor ders  2830  , and research interest in this field is expanding at a rapid pace.\n\nThe density and complexity of passive data  31  is far greater than current clinical assessments, which continue to rely on static scales that ask a patient to recall symptoms over a defined pe riod of time -e.g., a two week period in the case of the ubiquitous depression assessment by the Patient Health Questionnaire9 (PHQ9)  32  . However, the depth and diversity of passive data (which already typically combine measures such as step counts from wearables, text analytics from social media, metadata from electronic medical records, or greenspace exposure from geolo cation) require new techniques in data science, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to meaningfully combine and utilize such \"big data\" to inform mental health care  33  .\n\nAdvances in artificial intelligence and machine learning will likely represent a prominent bridge for translating new data into clinically relevant digital biomarkers  3436  . Like all biomarkers, though, impact will be determined not only by statistical signifi cance but also by clinical utility. A case in point refers to digital markers of selfharm and suicide, which, according to a recent review, possess high classification accuracy yet near zero accu racy for predicting future events  37  .\n\nHowever, other approaches to digital phenotyping for differ ent conditions/outcomes are beginning to show some promise. For instance, relapse risk in schizophrenia may be foreseen by \"anomaly detection\", which involves the use of smartphone sen sor data to monitor divergences of an individual's behavioral patterns compared to his/her personal baseline. Preliminary studies in small samples have found reasonable sensitivity and specificity from applying this approach to date  30  .\n\nOverall, while active and passive data have the potential to make smartphones crucial elements for the development and implementation of precision psychiatry  38  , the validity of the measures, how the data can be meaningfully represented, and the potential for ethical and effective uses in treatment delivery have all yet to be established."

      "title": "Smartphone technologies for closed loop interventions",
      "text": "A rich legacy of Internetdelivered and computerized therapy research and experience  39  is now in the process of being trans lated into new smartphonebased interventions, with promising results as well as challenges. These appbased interventions often utilize established aspects of cognitive and behavioral therapies to offer patients \"on demand\" access to evidencebased care tools. Examples abound of studies targeting mental health problems such as depression and anxiety 4043 , and early psychosis and schizophrenia  44, 45  , that have been the subject of previous re views  4651  . The existing clinical evidence for digital health inter ventions across specific disorders is reviewed in more detail in the second section of this paper.\n\nThe potential for more personalized digital health interven tions is bright. Known as a justintimeadaptiveintervention (JITAI), active and passive symptom data capture may aid in the development of personalized and realtime intervention strate gies  52, 53  . For example, the smartphone may be able to infer low mood in the context of social isolation and offer a relevant inter vention, whilst, in another circumstance, it may infer low mood in the context of poor sleep and recommend an alternative in tervention. Although in its infancy, using JITAIs to offer \"closed loop\" mental health interventions is a promising area for future research.\n\nNevertheless, app marketplaces rarely reflect evidence from recent studies, or otherwise take advantage of the unique po tential of app interventions  54  . For instance, just one percent of marketplace apps support use of sensors  55  , suggesting that concepts of digital phenotyping to support JITAI or behavioral interventions via apps are largely not incorporated into exist ing commercial technologies. Rather, even when considering more static interventions that do not take advantage of advanced smartphone features, the evidence base for widely proliferated apps remains poor  54  . For example, one review suggests that only ~2% of commercially available mental health apps are supported by original research evidence  27  . As we explore more details of app interventions in later sections, it is useful to consider that integration with sensors and digital phenotyping will likely soon transform this space."

      "title": "Social media",
      "text": "The relationship between social media and mental health has received much attention from not only the academic literature, but also the traditional media and general public  56  . Frequently accessed via smartphone apps and connecting people from their own devices to global networks of friends, information, and health resources, social media can represent both a means to quantify mental health as well as a source of both positive and negative interactions.\n\nIncreasingly, research suggests that absolute screen time or exposure itself is not strongly associated with adverse men tal health outcomes  57  . This is in marked contrast to the more popular conception that screen time and social media use is detrimental to mental health. In part, this view gained ascend ence from the older literature, which was largely based on self reported usage and crosssectional analysis, thus offering limited evidence in this regard. Recent studies, however, based on ob jective screen use and social media engagement measurements, prospective cohorts, and new scales to assess problematic Inter net use, are painting a more nuanced picture of social media and mental health  58, 59  . For example, during the COVID19 pandem ic, social media have been a source of social support for many who have been socially isolated and lonely.\n\nWhile excessive use of social media and screen time is likely not beneficial for mental health (in the same manner that exces sive use of any activity or behavior is often associated with del eterious outcomes), the quality of screen time and social media interactions appears to be more important than the quantity  60  . It is interesting that in recent years social media companies such as Facebook and Pinterest have undertaken new efforts to flag con tent that may be related to selfharm or suicide  56  . Nevertheless, it is currently difficult to determine the results of such interven tions. The impact of social media on the developing brain also re mains an unresolved  61  yet frequently discussed topic, especially as the pandemic has forced increasing reliance on technology to connect people.\n\nPatterns of social media use may represent a means to detect worsening of mental health symptoms. For example, changes in the content and style of social media posts may offer an early warning sign of relapse in schizophrenia  62  . Social media, com bined with natural language processing methods, also offer a practical means to understand populationlevel mental health trends. For example, an analysis of 60 million Twitter posts in MarchMay 2020, as compared to one year prior, was able to de tect pandemicrelated increases in coping mechanisms  63  . These methods have also been employed in studies exploring psycho social reactions to the COVID19 pandemic  64, 65  , as well as the ef fects of psychiatric medications  66  .\n\nWhile currently available work has largely focused on text based natural language processing methods, the increasingly voice and videobased nature of newer social media content has sparked interest in emotion recognition  67  . For example, early studies identified relationships between negative mood and posting pictures with darker colors  68  , although such relation ships are now known to be more nuanced, thus highlighting in herent challenges in assessing mental health without a broader context.\n\nSocial media can also be used as a therapeutic tool. Novel re search using carefully curated and monitored social networks as interventions has shown promise in youth with diverse mental health needs  6971  . For example, the PRIME app  72  is designed to help people with schizophrenia through the promotion of func tional recovery and the mitigation of negative symptoms (e.g., amotivation) through a supportive and personalized network. The Moderated Online Social Therapy (MOST) platform is an other example of an innovation that offers personalized therapy combined with social connections among other features  71, 73  .\n\nIt is noteworthy that social media are not without risk. Disin formation  74  and stigma on social media are forces that cannot be ignored. Stigma on social media is common  75  , although efforts are also underway to challenge and reverse this trend  76  . Using social media for mental health work also remains a catalyst for ethical tensions, and a recent review offers a practical taxonomy of these tensions as well as guidance for navigating through these ongoing challenges  77  ."

      "title": "Chatbots",
      "text": "Conversational agents, such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, have become common in the digital marketplace. Termed \"chatbots\", the use of these conversational style interfaces offers an intelligent, automated system for detecting and responding to immediate mental health needs. Chatbots have the look and feeling of interacting with a human, despite being run by an au tomated software program. Thus, chatbots or \"robot therapists\" have become a galvanizing force for those seeking to automate therapy where software programs listen and respond to people's mental health needs. While the words \"robot therapist\" conjure images of a physical robot, most are actually text based, although animated video and even physical robot versions have been re searched  78, 79  .\n\nOne ongoing challenge in chatbot work is seeking to offer emotional support from inherently inanimate computer code. There is some evidence that people can develop therapeutic re lationships with digital technologies (referred to as \"digital thera peutic alliance\"  80  ). As therapeutic alliance with an inperson therapist is related to more positive outcomes in mental health treatment  81  , harnessing the digital therapeutic alliance through humanstyle interactions with a chatbot might promote change without the need of human support  82  . Research has found that some people feel more comfortable conversing anonymously with a chatbot  83  , and that this may open up the possibility to im prove detection of distress and in turn provide momentary in terventions to those who feel less comfortable with facetoface contact  84  .\n\nChatbot interfaces have become a key feature of many com mercially available mental health apps. However, their evidence base is not well established  85  . Across two recent systematic re views, 24 studies investigating chatbots for health care were identified  85, 86  . Of the 11 trials targeting mental health problems, most were for depression, with a smaller number targeting anxi ety, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and autism spectrum disorder. Only two randomized controlled tri als were included, and, while some mental health benefits from chatbot interventions were indicated, the types of benefits ob served were not consistent across studies, which were further limited by small sample sizes, short duration, and a lack of fol lowup data.\n\nWhile the development and implementation of more complex interactive systems is inevitable, current chatbots are limited in their ability to deliver appropriate contextual responses to com plex language inputs, presenting important safety concerns. One study of commercial chatbots such as Siri found that they often failed to recognize serious mental health concerns and provide appropriate responses such as referral to a support service  87  . For example, chatbots were found to not recognize when suicidal ideation was being discussed, and these devices also seemed to ignore domestic violence problems. Further, surveys of consumer attitudes reveal concerns about the privacy of chatbots as well as their potential to replace human care. Nevertheless, satisfaction ratings in the limited number of pilot and feasibility studies tend to be high, and rates of adverse events low  88  . Given the evidence and governance in place at this time, chatbots are best used only as a supportive tool in the context of a broader treatment plan."

      "title": "Virtual reality",
      "text": "Virtual reality involves an immersion in an interactive, com putersimulated environment via a headset. The ability to create and control exposure to realworld environments presents im portant opportunities for mental health assessment and treat ment  8991  . Standard psychological assessments are limited by a lack of realworld validity and overreliance on subjective rat ings  92  . Virtual reality allows precise, realtime data capture of re sponses to stimuli within controlled virtual environments, and hence provides critical insight into the way in which clinically relevant phenomena develop in real world  89, 93  .\n\nControlled exposure to anxietyinducing stimuli within a vir tual environment offers a safe, convenient and accessible medi um to deliver exposurebased behavioral treatments. The benefit of virtual reality treatment lies in the repeated exposure to feared stimuli, enabling the individual to adapt to triggers and develop healthy responses in a safe and controlled therapeutic plat form  94  . For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that learning to engage in virtual social interactions can reduce paranoia in people experiencing psychosis  95, 96  .\n\nA recent metareview of 11 metaanalyses, covering predomi nantly anxiety disorders and PTSD, found that effect sizes for vir tual reality exposure treatments were overall moderate to large, and were typically maintained at followup  97  . A smaller number of trials have been conducted for other psychiatric disorders, with emerging evidence that virtual reality treatment may be ef fective for depression, schizophrenia  97  and eating disorders  98  . However, in the studies that have compared virtual reality to tra ditional treatment, there was little evidence for superior efficacy. Further, the quality of evidence is overall low to moderate, due to the predominance of studies with small sample sizes, the rela tively limited number of randomized controlled trials, and issues around publication bias.\n\nFewer studies have explored virtual reality treatments beyond exposure therapy, with the exception of skills training, which has also demonstrated positive results  99  . Pilot studies have also shown that virtual reality applications can guide people to learn therapeutic skills such as mindfulness 100102 , relaxation 103 and self compassion  104, 105  . Using virtual reality as a vehicle to deliver expe riences that help people develop skills to manage mental health difficulties may increase treatment engagement and efficacy.\n\nVirtual worlds offer a compelling solution to increased de mand for technology platforms that can deliver personal clinical care remotely  106  . Virtual worlds enable users to meet within vir tual environments, represented as personalized avatars, and in teract with other users in real time. Whilst few studies have been conducted in mental health, there have been promising early results especially in psychosis 107 . Delivering therapy via virtual worlds has the clear potential of offering highly accessible care within personally tailored, engaging therapeutic environments that provide a safe and comfortable medium for social interac tions.\n\nWhilst commercial growth in virtual reality is occurring rap idly, with an estimated growth of $54 billion over the next 7 years 108 , the technology remains unfamiliar and inaccessible to many users, presenting a barrier to implementation  89  . As costs decrease and virtual reality becomes more mainstream (partly due to the increased capacity to deliver it via smartphones), there is a need for further research and subsequent provision of evidencebased treatments and protocols, with adequate train ing for relevant workforces to enable their implementation."

      "text": "Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most com mon types of mental health conditions in the world 109 , and many more individuals experience subthreshold albeit disabling symptoms. Due to the high demand for selfmanagement strat egies for depression and anxiety, smartphone apps claiming to help with these problems are widely available on app market places  110, 111  .\n\nA recent largescale metaanalysis of 66 randomized con trolled trials explored the efficacy of smartphone apps for mental health problems including depression and anxiety across clini cal and nonclinical populations 112 . For depressive symptoms, this metaanalysis found that smartphone apps outperformed control conditions, with larger effect sizes found when waitlist or educational resources (health tips, information) were used compared to attention/placebo controls (e.g., gaming apps)  112  . Smartphone apps also outperformed control conditions for generalized anxiety and social anxiety symptoms 112 . App inter ventions for anxiety did not differ significantly from facetoface or other computerbased interventions in terms of outcomes, although only a small number of studies were used in these comparisons. For both depression and anxiety, studies which provided professional support alongside the smartphone app (e.g., through supportive phone calls or personalized thera pist feedback) produced larger effect sizes compared to studies which did not.\n\nA common criticism of smartphone apps for depression and anxiety is that they lack an underlying evidencebased frame work  111, 113  . A review of 293 commerciallyavailable apps for anx iety and/or depression found that just over half (55.3%) included a reference to an evidencebased framework in their app store descriptions  111  . When a reference was included, a range of thera peutic frameworks were mentioned, including cognitive behav ioral therapy techniques (30.0%), mindfulness (15.7%), positive psychology (9.2%), dialectical behavior therapy (3.4%), acceptance and commitment therapy (1.7%), and other techniques (6.8%). However, of the 162 apps that claimed to use a theoretical frame work, only 6.2% had published evidence supporting their effica cy  111  .\n\nThe selective adoption of selfmanagement apps for depres sion and anxiety has also been explored. A consumer datadriven review highlighted that the proliferation of depression and anxi ety apps on the marketplace is in contrast with the relatively small number of apps which are regularly downloaded and used. The review reported that just three apps (Headspace, Youper and Wysa) accounted for about 90% of app downloads for depression. Similarly, three apps (Headspace, Calm and Youper) accounted for approximately 90% of downloads and daily active users of anxiety apps 114 . Moreover, most apps for depression (63%) and anxiety (56%) had no active users for the onemonth period un der review 114 . While commercial app companies do not publish engagement data, it is clear that downloads do not automatically translate into active use. For example, the popular (and free) COVID Coach app designed to address stress during the pandemic re ported over 140,000 downloads, but only 1.56% of individuals who have downloaded the app recorded at least two weeks of use  115  .\n\nThere are several areas in which improvements can be made for apps dedicated to depression and anxiety. They include: en suring substantive involvement of relevant health care profes sionals in the development of the apps 110 ; embedding apps within local health care settings 116 ; more robust testing of apps, specifi cally more welldesigned randomized controlled trials to assess their efficacy 114 ; understanding engagement techniques to en sure optimal use 114 ; and using validated treatment techniques/in terventions within the apps 116 . Further evaluation of anxiety and depression apps is clearly warranted 114 , including the need for ad ditional research into the efficacy of appdelivered interventions compared with facetoface \"care as usual\"  116  . Further research is also needed to understand the longterm engagement, as well as to examine any possible deleterious effects related to app us age  111  .\n\nThe evidence to date suggests that smartphone apps could provide an accessible, scalable and lowcost mechanism to de liver effective selfmanagement interventions for symptoms of depression and anxiety, particularly to nonclinical populations and those who cannot access facetoface services  110, 116  . Howev er, the promise of apps to increase lowcost access to evidence based treatment for depression and anxiety has not yet been fully realized. Efficacy trial data are needed to support many anxiety and depression apps available on the marketplace. Most of such apps have no clear evidence of efficacy  47, 51, 117  ."

      "title": "Clinical management of major mood disorders",
      "text": "Despite the growing evidence base described above on the use of DHTs for selfmanagement of depression and anxiety, much of the existing research has been conducted in general population samples or people with mildtomoderate symp toms. Thus, the current applicability of such research in the actual clinical management of severe mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, remains unclear.\n\nA recent systematic review and metaanalysis concerning the efficacy of digital interventions in bipolar disorder found posi tive effects on both depressive and manic symptoms 118 , but only four of the ten included studies were randomized controlled trials  45, 119121  . As to unipolar depressive disorder, while an in creasing number of randomized controlled trials of apps with psychotherapyrelated content have been published  26  , several of them have shown no evidence that delivering psychological in terventions via smartphone confers a significant advantage be yond control conditions  122124  . However, randomized controlled trials which have used appbased interventions alongside hu man coaching to bolster their usage in community patients with depression have produced more robust evidence  42  , suggesting that human engagement in supporting appbased interven tions is critical. New roles such as digital navigators to support app use in mental health care may provide one solution to offer human support without overburdening the clinician 125128 (see below).\n\nThe fact that bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder are characterized by episodic fluctuations in mood and behavior may suggest that smartphonebased interventions which pro vide finegrained monitoring and realtime treatment (including JITAIs) may improve outcomes, either by fostering early identi fication of deterioration and/or by providing means for flexible and timely treatment interventions. Preliminary evidence in pa tients with major depression indicates that smartphones do in deed represent an available platform for realtime monitoring of patientreported symptoms, such as changes in mood and activ ity, through ecological momentary assessments 129131 , and that this can feasibly be supported through collection of sensorbased data such as the number of incoming and outgoing calls and text messages, or location information which may reflect changes in behavior and psychomotor activity. Similarly, in bipolar disor der, several recent studies have shown that smartphonebased active and passive data reflect digital markers of symptoms 132134 , and classifications of affective states  135, 136  and affective traits  28, 137  have been published. Collectively, these studies suggest that such digital data could provide important realtime information reflecting the psychopathological status of patients with major mood disorders.\n\nAn important consideration is that patientreported symp toms collected in clinical encounters have an inherent risk of recall bias  45  . On the other hand, establishing the extent to which patientreported mood ratings collected via smartphones are consistent with clinical symptom ratings in patients with se vere mood disorders is imperative for determining the role of such technologies in the clinical landscape. Studies examining this issue have largely indicated that smartphonebased mood assessments represent promising alternatives or adjuvants to traditional clinical measures, while acknowledging the method ological limitations in the existing evidence base, including that the overwhelming majority of trials and observational studies to date have enrolled small samples 138140 .\n\nTo determine how worthwhile these new approaches could be in routine practice, it is also crucial to examine whether the use of monitoring technologies as an adjuvant ongoing evi dencebased tool for major mood disorders would result in an improvement of outcomes. In keeping with this view, two recent pragmatic randomized controlled trials have examined the ef fect of smartphonebased monitoring and treatment in patients with bipolar disorder 139 and unipolar depressive disorder 140 in realworld settings. These trials found no effect on primary or secondary outcome measures, including rates of rehospitalization or severity of depressive or manic symptoms, whilst showing higher levels of patientreported recovery, compared to the control condi tion.\n\nOverall, there are several promising trends in the use of smart phones for treatment and monitoring 141144 in clinical samples with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Continuous data analysis (potentially paired with machine learning models) could support prediction of relapse and use of smartphone based interventions in realtime within the context of precision psychiatry. However, validating the measures used, establishing clinically useful interventions, and ensuring that patients are in deed able to engage with these longterm interventions, are all key steps to be undertaken by researchers prior to the evidence based implementation of these novel technologies in routine clinical practice."

      "title": "Psychosis/schizophrenia",
      "text": "While those outside of the mental health field at time wonder if smartphones and digital technology could induce paranoid delusions in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the reality is quite the opposite. People with psychosis/schizophre nia are interested and eager to use innovative tools to possibly augment their care and ultimate recovery. Adverse events re lated to paranoia are nearly nonexistent. Research in this area features innovative works around both remote monitoring and appbased interventions.\n\nRemote monitoring is of interest in psychotic disorders, espe cially to augment selfreported information when cognition may be overly impaired. Realtime and incontext patientgenerated symptom data, obtained through remotemonitoring platform technology, have the potential to timely warn clinicians about the need for intervention, improve treatment decisions by pro viding a clearer picture of changing patterns of symptoms, and support scheduling of health care contacts based on need  145  .\n\nResearch groups around the world have started to explore how integrating this active data collection with passive re mote monitoring can both predict relapse and allow delivery of timesensitive intervention strategies. To date, these data streams have been predominantly used in small (N<100) stud ies in selected populations, with promising results. A systematic review 146 of studies conducted in samples with psychotic dis orders identified 17 active monitoring apps. App use duration ranged from 1 week to 14 months, with selfassessment prompts ranging from multiple times per day to weekly. People typically adapted their response strategy to less frequent active data col lection over time. App assessments were well tolerated, with 69% to 88% assessments completed. All studies showed that people found this active data collection acceptable and useful, despite some negative effects reported (e.g., increased aware ness of symptoms).\n\nSensors on the smartphone or a wearable device have emerged as tools to assess behavioral patterns in a range of populations, and have been utilized to both reduce the burden associated with active symptomatic monitoring and to obtain additional objec tive behavioral data. A systematic review of studies 146 identified four passive monitoring studies, with usage ranging from 5 to 365 days in sample sizes ranging from 5 to 62 participants. Two studies found that passive monitoring was largely acceptable, al though 20% of participants reported privacy concerns and 20% felt upset by it.\n\nMore specifically, Barnett et al 147 followed 17 patients with psychosis using a passive monitoring app installed on their smartphone for up to three months, and identified anomalies in mobility patterns and social behavior in the two weeks prior to relapse. A further study in 83 patients with psychosis using digital markers found similar results  30  . This was also observed in a study (N=60) using a neural network approach  148  .\n\nBenZeev et al 149 identified sensor data changes -includ ing physical activity, geolocation, phone unlock duration, and speech frequency and duration -in participants with psychosis in the days leading up to a relapse. Wisniewski et al 150 also noted high variability in behavioral patterns observed through passive monitoring in individuals who were deemed to be at clinical high risk for psychosis. However, the utility of passive monitoring in predicting conversion to psychosis among these individuals remains unclear.\n\nAlthough in their infancy, passive monitoring studies have shown that most patients with psychotic disorders are comforta ble, able and willing to use wearable devices to monitor outcomes in their daily life 151 , with emerging evidence supporting identifi cation of an impending relapse through changes in passively col lected behavioral data. However, robust safety data are needed to understand the utility of this approach more clearly 152 .\n\nBeyond monitoring, DHTs have also played a significant role in delivering intervention strategies and support for psychosis. A recent systematic review identified 21 DHTs for psychosis pub lished in the peerreviewed literature, incorporating a mixture of computerized, avatar, and appbased approaches. The studies included a total of over 1,500 participants, and were mostly con ducted in Europe and North America 152 .\n\nWhilst it is difficult to compare these studies, given the dif ferent technologies used and outcomes measured, there is emerging evidence that DHTs can improve symptoms, as well as cognitive and other clinical outcomes, in people with psy chosis  152  . For example, the Actissist app targets negative symp toms (e.g., reduced socialization), general psychotic symptoms, mood, and cannabis misuse through offering tools to help with cognitive appraisals, belief conviction, emotions and associated behaviors  153  . Another app (SlowMo) targets paranoia through offering tools to help with jumping to conclusions and belief inflexibility as part of blended care 154 . A study of 361 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, randomized to receive either SlowMo therapy or usual care, found no significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes related to paranoia at 24 weeks (the primary endpoint), though significant effects be tween groups were apparent posttreatment  154  .\n\nWhile these approaches are promising, further wellpowered efficacy trials are needed to appraise their full potential. Code sign of the technology with the actual end users is vital in ensur ing that engagement to DHT is maximized  155  . Furthermore, with some exceptions 153,156 , trials have not robustly measured adverse events, which is needed when determining the safety of DHTs not only in people with severe mental health problems but in health care more broadly.\n\nThere is, of course, the challenge of implementing these in tervention approaches, should they prove to be effective and costeffective. There are very few examples of successful imple mentation of DHTs into routine clinical services, though research groups have proposed frameworks to support implementation from the outset of digital health program development  157159  ."

      "text": "The interest in smartphone app technologies for eating disor ders is growing, either as a standalone intervention or an adjunct to traditional treatment services.\n\nPeople with eating disorders are a clinical group that could be well suited to appbased interventions, as the egosyntonic nature of these conditions usually results in treatment refusal, ambivalence to change, or low motivation to engage in the ther apeutic process  160, 161  . The ability for apps to allow an individual to approach treatment at his/her own pace may address these concerns and could help individuals feel more in control of their treatment. Similarly, tailored reminders and motivational mes sages to practice key therapeutic skills may help increase these patients' motivation and adherence to the treatment program.\n\nFurthermore, their scalability, flexibility, and cost advantages over traditional facetoface services indicate that smartphone app technologies could offer a potential solution to many exist ing helpseeking barriers and the widespread treatment gap re ported in this clinical group  162  . Importantly, recent survey data show that a significant proportion of individuals with an eating disorder report a preference for, and willingness to use, smart phone apps and other DHTs  163, 164  , indicating that their demand is high.\n\nThe quality of information in publicly available eating dis order apps has been widely discussed. Existing eating disorder apps tend to serve one or more of four broad functions: delivery of information, selfassessment, selfmonitoring, and provision of advice or treatment. Two earlier systematic appraisals of the quality of commercially available eating disorder apps conclud ed that very few of them incorporated components of evidence based treatments, with some even providing potentially harmful information  165, 166  . However, four commercially available eating disorder apps (Mental Health Tests, Recovery Road, Rise Up, and Psychiatry Pro-Diagnosis, Info, Treatment, CBT & DBT)each of which are grounded in an evidencebased framework -account for 96% of monthly active users according to a recent review  167  , indicating that those resorting to apps to help manage their eating disorder are likely exposed to credible information.\n\nLimited research has been conducted on the efficacy of smart phone apps as a standalone intervention approach for eating disorders. The most uptodate metaanalysis of self or minimal lyguided DHTs for the treatment and prevention of these disor ders did not locate any published randomized controlled trials of standalone appbased interventions up until June 2020  168  . One randomized controlled trial has since been published, finding preliminary support for the shortterm efficacy of a transdiag nostic cognitivebehavioral app (Break Binge Eating) on nu merous symptom measures among individuals with a threshold or subthreshold binge eatingtype disorder  169  . Although these results are promising, additional evidence from randomized controlled trials with longer followups is needed to determine whether smartphone app technologies are an appropriate stand alone intervention modality or first step in the treatment and management of eating disorders.\n\nMore attention has been devoted towards understanding the role of smartphone apps as an adjunct to traditional facetoface services. In light of evidence demonstrating a robust relation ship between low skills utilization and poor treatment outcomes among individuals with eating disorders 170,171 , app technologies have been proposed to augment facetoface treatments by al lowing patients to more regularly practice essential homework tasks between sessions 172 . Indeed, evidence from existing randomized controlled tri als indicates that the addition of smartphone app technology to traditional facetoface services may lead to greater treatment adherence and skills utilization, and quicker symptom improve ments in adults with binge eating  173, 174  . However, whether these benefits persist in the longer term, and for whom specifically app technology offers an added benefit, remains unclear.\n\nOverall, although significant interest has been generated to wards understanding what role apps might play for the treatment and management of eating disorders, further rigorous trial de signs with longer followup assessments across different diag nostic categories (e.g., anorexia nervosa) are needed."

Inbuilt app features such as machine learning algorithms, that automatically adjust in response to active and passive data, can facilitate the delivery of highly specific, tailored intervention strategies in moments of need  52  . This functionality is especially applicable for substance use disorders, as affected individuals often find it difficult to antic ipate upcoming internal or external events that trigger a relapse  175  .\n\nAlthough an increasing number of apps for substance use dis orders are commercially available, their focus is largely restricted to targeting smoking or alcohol consumption, with few apps spe cifically designed to address other costly and debilitating disor ders, such as cocaine or methamphetamine use  176  .\n\nApps to address opioid use disorder have recently become available and received Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s approval in the US. However, a 2020 report examining the eco nomic benefit of these apps for opioid use disorders noted: \"At current\u2026 pricing, and given available evidence, these potential cost offsets and clinical gains were not enough to generate in cremental costeffectiveness estimates beneath commonly cited costeffectiveness thresholds\"  177  .\n\nEmpirical research investigating the efficacy of appbased interventions for substance use disorders remains limited, but is rapidly expanding. In the context of smoking, one recent me taanalysis  51  of three randomized controlled trials comparing standalone apps to control conditions observed a significant al though small effect size for reduced smoking frequency in favor of the app conditions (g=0.39, 95% CI: 0.210.57). In contrast, a recent Cochrane review 178 of five randomized controlled trials found no significant differences in rates of smoking cessation between apps and nonapp smoking cessation support condi tions (risk ratio, RR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.661.52). For alcohol use, the above metaanalysis  51  identified three randomized controlled trials comparing a standalone app to a control condition, report ing a small and nonsignificant pooled effect size (g=-0.03, 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.17). Other recent qualitative reviews have not been able to identify any randomized controlled trials of appbased interventions for other substance use disorders  179, 180  .\n\nAdditional research is needed to better understand what role smartphone app technologies could play towards the treatment, prevention or management of substance use disorders. Although the quality of commercially available apps for these disorders is suboptimal, it is promising to see research teams from around the globe beginning to develop smartphone apps in this area that have a clear underlying evidencebased framework, capi talize on latest advancements in technology (e.g., gamification, conversational agents), are routinely tested for their usability, in volve feedback from end users, and are registered for evaluation in prospective clinical trials  181185  ."

The increasing ubiquity of smartphone use among these populations suggests that smartphones could be an ideal mode of delivery for mental health interventions  187  . A systematic and metareview of DHTs for children and young people identified anxiety and depres sion as the most common mental health problems targeted, with many other areas (e.g., psychosis) being relatively under researched  188  .\n\nThe strongest evidence of effectiveness of DHTs for children and young people is reported for approaches using comput erized or Internet cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT)  49, 188  . A metaanalysis of 34 randomized controlled trials for depression or anxiety in child and adolescent populations supported the ef fectiveness of iCBTbased interventions in comparison to waitlist controls 189 . More favorable outcomes were achieved when the treatment was therapist or parentsupported  189  .\n\nAlongside the growing evidence for digital therapies in young people, passive sensing technology is likely to be used in future research.

A core challenge in this research is the additional privacy issues inherent to working with young people, as well as continued screen time concerns (as noted in above sections). Still, the future is promising, and particular progress has been made on iCBTbased interventions for anxiety in chil dren  190  .

In actuality, however, implementing DHTs has proven challeng ing. Even the relatively simple task of translating effective face toface interventions directly into digital versions is often more complex than once thought  191, 192  .\n\nThere are numerous implementation science frameworks. In this section, we utilize the Integrated Promoting Action on Re search Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS)  193  frame work, which focuses on three elements: the innovation itself, the recipients of that innovation, and the context surrounding the in novation. While the prior two sections of this paper have focused on innovations across DHTs and clinical use cases, here we focus on recipients (patient/clinician implementation) and context (health care factors, including regulatory, market, ethical, and global mental health forces). Only when the three elements -in novative DHTs, recipients primed to utilize DHTs, and contex tual forces that support and sustain DHT use -are all aligned, can the full potential be realized. Despite rapidly advancing work around DHT innovation, the latter two elements have not re ceived equal attention."

Thus, a larger threat to access may be a new digital divide around technology literacy. If DHTs become a part of routine practice within mental health services, will the most vulnerable patients be able to navigate these technolo gies and access care? Formal data on digital literacy in mental health is scarce, but there are mounting calls for new resources and tools to help ensure that patients have the skills, training and confidence to utilize DHTs 195197 . Training programs designed to teach patients how to utilize DHTs are becoming available. An example is the Digital Outreach for Obtaining Resources and Skills (DOORS) program  198  , that offers a suite of inperson and online training resources.\n\nMany DHTs rely on enduser engagement in offering moni toring or interventions, yet engagement remains a core chal lenge  199, 200  , both in and outside the context of research trials. Without standard measurements for evaluating or comparing engagement across DHTs 201,202 , progress towards improved en gagement has been fragmented. Extracting engagement data from apps and other technologies, especially outside of academic re search efforts, is often impossible, except through market research companies that can only offer general populationbased samples.\n\nUsing this type of data, a 2020 study examined engagement rates of popular (over 100,000 downloads) mental health apps on the app stores/marketplace, and found that 90% of users abandon apps within 10 days 200 . Actual data on app engagement from over 100,000 participants in different studies across various health conditions showed that the median participant retention was just 5.5 days 203 . As mentioned before, this dropoff in use was also found in a 2021 report of the stress app COVID Coach, which reported that only 1.56% of users remained engaged for at least 14 days 115 . Research data also do not confirm commonly held assumptions that older adults will engage less than younger people  203  , although other reviews suggest the opposite  197  .\n\nStudies suggest that human support alongside app use offers the strongest contribution towards improving engagement 112 . However, human facilitation of appbased tools limits the scal ability and underlying potential of many apps to expand access to care. An increasing attention is now devoted to codesigning and coproducing digital mental health tools with end users and all stakeholders at the outset, in the hope that digital solutions will reflect the actual needs and preferences of those they are de signed to serve  204, 205  .\n\nDHTs hold an unique potential to extend access to care in middle and lowerincome countries, where there is less invest ment or infrastructure around mental health  206  . Yet, a recent review on this topic found only 37 relevant studies published in those countries between 2016 and 2020, with the majority re porting feasibility and accessibility outcomes instead of efficacy, costeffectiveness or implementation  207  . Yet, smartphone use is common and rapidly expanding in those countries, and thus represents a promising tool to reduce the mental health gap.\n\nResearch in lowresource countries has focused to date on medication and appointment adherence as well as relapse and rehospitalization prevention 208 , which offer important targets with transdiagnostic potential. Leaders in the field have called for a focus on data science, task sharing by empowering community health workers, and early interventions as promising leads  209  . The untapped potential for global mental health is to adapt cur rent digital health tools with strong efficacy data, and devote resources towards establishing local effectiveness and routes towards implementation. While this has not frequently occurred to date, recent research in implementation science holds lessons for this translation, suggesting that context, culture, and personal connections cannot be ignored when deploying an app in a nov el setting  158, 210, 211  ."

      "text": "While clinicians are aware of the potential benefits of DHTs, they are also concerned about several factors, ranging from safety of apps to therapeutic alliance rupture  212, 213  . Furthermore, the ra pidity of developments of digital mental health technologies repre sents a challenge to clinicians. Medical education programs often do not cover digital mental health, and many clinicians are left without the resources to utilize the newest innovations. Education al efforts focusing on the clinical workforce are now emerging  126  .\n\nOn the other hand, it may be necessary to consider in this area a new team member analogous to the radiology or pathology tech nologist, a \"digital navigator\" who is able to support both the clini cian and the patient in implementing digital technology into clinical care  127  . The role of this digital navigator will include helping to match patients to the useful apps, helping set up and trouble shoot technol ogy, assisting the patient with customizing the technology based on clinical needs, offering support for continued use, and summarizing data for presentation to both the clinician and the patient. Another version of this concept is the \"coach\", who is more patientfacing and often employed to drive engagement 214 .\n\nAlongside workforce considerations, the positioning of DHTs within the clinical workflow must also be determined. While downloading an app onto a smartphone is relatively simple, re cent reviews highlight many challenges in implementing an app into the clinical workflow in this way  191, 215  . Solving these issues is a high priority and significant challenge  216  . New workflow con siderations were critical to designing a digital psychiatry clinic in Boston in order to ensure that apps were a core part of treat ment  217  .\n\nIn the US, the Kaiser Permanente Health system reported that, through offering training to clinicians on using apps in the context of care relationships, the number of referrals to using a mental health app doubled from 20,000 in January 2020 to over 44,000 in May 2020  218  . The US Veterans Administration has out lined best practices for use of apps and offered training and re sources to help integrate its suite of apps into care settings  219  .\n\nAs so few DHTs discussed in this paper have been imple mented into realworld care, workflow considerations remain among the least explored but most needed factors towards fa cilitating implementation. DHTs offering immediate feedback for patients, medical record integration for clinicians, and data portals for administrators hold potential for better fitting popula tion health needs."

While the various governments across the world have opted for different approaches, common aspects have been temporary increases of reimbursement for telepsy chiatry, reduction in some licensing requirements, and waiving of certain liability concerns. It remains to be seen whether these regulatory changes will become permanent, and the extent to which this recently increased use of telepsychiatry can extend to DHTs such as smartphone apps, chatbots, virtual reality, and social media. Taking examples and adopting models from other areas of health care may speed up the process of building appro priate regulatory frameworks. For example, remote monitoring in cardiology is well established and regulated already, with ap propriate reimbursement models in place  220  .\n\nOne area where the context for DHTs has made less recent progress is that of trust. Trust from both patients and clinicians around DHTs remains low, especially with respect to sharing data with companies 221 . Lax privacy regulations as well as their limited enforcement  222, 223  further limit trust. A 2021 report by the magazine Consumer Reports highlighted numerous privacy poli cy flaws in popular mental health apps 224 , underscoring that pro gress around privacy enforcement/legislation remains lacking.\n\nCompounding this, the amount of misinformation about apps continues to present challenges to both clinicians and pa tients in evaluating their risks as well as benefits  225  . Transform ing the image of DHTs from the current \"lawless wild west\" will require advancing evidence but also censuring false claims that obscure actual evidencebased tools which patients and clini cians should feel comfortable using today. While evolving regu latory approaches will help bring order and trust, an important step will be general education about risks and benefits for both clinicians and patients. Such education programs are emerg ing  127, 198, 226  and will continue to evolve.\n\nNot all regulatory hurdles have been reduced by the COV ID19 pandemic. Many DHTs continue to live outside of any effective regulation by declaring themselves a wellness device (rather than a medical device). With so many thousands of apps and emerging virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and chatbot programs, it is clear that new regulatory approaches are neces sary. In the US, there is an ongoing pilot testing of a novel regu latory framework called \"precertification\", which would move much of the regulatory burden towards selfcertification by the technology developers. Such a system is not without critics, and its utility in the mental health field remains unclear  227  . Already some groups have raised concerns about regulations for new apps -such as those around substance use disorders that are approved for use only in conjunction with medication assisted treatment, but not psychotherapy -which exclude nonprescrib ing mental health professionals  228  . Other countries are also look ing for new ways to regulate DHTs, with developing policies from Australia, the UK, and the European Union  229  .\n\nThe app marketplaces themselves serve as another source of informal regulation around DHTs. Today the commercial app stores, namely the Apple iTunes and Android Google Play stores, have a role in advertising claims, privacy protections, and pay ment models around appbased DHTs. Entrepreneurial invest ing and startups have also become a proving ground for new DHTs. The aptly entitled paper published in this journal in 2016, Tech Giants Enter Mental Health 230 , was a harbinger for increas ing investment from venture capital, entrepreneurs, and a wave of startups in digital mental health. However, understanding the value of DHTs, and their related companies, remains elusive, as the necessary data around engagement, effect sizes, neces sary dose, and duration of effect remain unknown for almost all DHTs 231 .\n\nStill, funding has continued to grow, with the marketplace of investors now focused on DHTs that can offer a sustainable business model. This has fueled trends in DHTs that focus on the needs of employees (for employer payers) or offer traditional telehealth services, such as Internetdelivered therapies, which have been found to be viable and costeffective for improving several mental health outcomes 232 . Understanding the costef fectiveness of DHTs will likely become the new point of compe tition for companies, as the markets begin to saturate with new product offerings.\n\nThe technical integration of DHT data presents a final chal lenge related to contextual factors. The digital information that is eponymous to DHTs is only as useful as it can integrate across devices, networks, and health care settings. Yet, most apps today do not draw on data from existing medical records, and predic tive models based on social media or app data (active or passive) are not routinely integrated into the clinical visit or history, large ly because of technical integration challenges in sharing data A related challenge is that, even with such standards in place, uti lization cannot be assumed. Barriers must be overcome at the level of patients, clinicians and systems, with one recent study showing that only 1% of patients at a large hospital chose to link their app data with their medical record  233  . In April 2021, new rules to limit information blocking have taken effect in the US, and even mental health notes must now be electronically shared with patients.\n\nAs more mental health data become easily available, interop erability will be even more critical in the DHT ecosystem. Cre ating new DHTs that are able to comply with and interface with different data systems is an important first step towards building the next generation of useful technologies."

      "title": "Recommendations around implementation",
      "text": "Considering all the issues discussed in this section, it be comes clear that the main limiting factors of digital psychiatry are not the technologies or innovation themselves, but rather the challenges related to priming the recipients (i.e., patients/clini cians) and the context of health care delivery (e.g., regulation). Therefore, the most immediate benefits in the field could be re alized through making effective and ethical use of existing tech nologies in realworld settings. While it is unlikely that there will be a single solution to these implementation challenges, various options can be considered depending upon local conditions and clinical needs.\n\nUsing a recent app evaluation model  7, 234  as a scaffold, we put forward the following recommendations around highpriority opportunities for advancing the field:\n\n\u2022 Privacy and security. Without a renewed focus on privacy and protecting users' data, DHTs will lack the trust necessary for uptake. Across all conditions and technologies, ensuring privacy remains critical. Coproducing digital solutions with end users, starting with the fundamentals around data use, is critical. \u2022 Efficacy. Increasing evidence shows that DHTs are feasi ble and acceptable to those with mental health problems. Likewise, efficacy studies suggest that, under ideal research conditions, DHTs can offer benefit and have clinical utility. As DHTs seek reimbursement or addition into national for mularies, the need for highquality effectiveness data can no longer be ignored. Highquality studies that compare DHTs to active control or placebo groups are required to support this. \u2022 Engagement. Downloads are a poor proxy for app engage ment. Available data suggest that engagement remains limited across all apps. Augmenting app use with human support ap pears to offer one solution to sustain engagement, though this detracts from apps' potential to offer scalable and affordable solutions to health care access. Research on why people use DHTs, and how best to encourage sufficient engagement, is necessary. \u2022 Clinical integration. Integration of DHTs into clinical prac tice is feasible, but remains cumbersome. Creating new \"digi tal\" clinical services and rethinking care models is necessary to realize the full benefit of DHTs. Advances in digital health standards, policies and regulation are more feasible in the post COVID19 era, and the field must be prepared to offer viable solutions.\n\nThese recommendations apply across all DHTs, but there are special considerations for each technology that are summarized in Table  1 . Understanding the future potential, key issues, and priority actions is most productive in the light of the above dis cussion of challenges concerning recipients and context."

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "The role of the Internet and digital technologies in providing wider access to psychological interventions and mental health care has long been discussed. However, only in recent years have the abilities, affordability and accessibility of ubiquitous Internet devices (particularly smartphones) advanced to such a point as to allow digital psychiatry to move from a theoretical concept to a realistic option for augmenting traditional mental health care globally.\n\nThe development of related technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, chatbots, and vir tual reality, alongside empirical research on the utility of each within mental health contexts, has presented a number of prom ising avenues. The uptake of this has further been accelerated by the COVID19 pandemic, which has highlighted how digital approaches can offer some level of adaptive care under circum stances where access to inperson services is precluded.\n\nIn terms of DHTs for the clinical management of longterm mental health problems, there are several lines of research emerg ing, in multiple different conditions, to support the use of DHTs for individuals to selfmanage their symptoms, as an adjunctive to usual care. Alongside digitally delivered therapies, there has also been progress towards the use of smartphonecollected data for predicting clinical outcomes or risk of relapse. Future research should aim to combine these two areas, in order to harness the available data to provide timely and targeted remote interven tions, termed JITAIs, to prevent relapse and other adverse out comes  235  . Finally, the considerable interest and investment in the application of DHTs within child and adolescent mental health should aim to take advantage of young people's apparent procliv ity towards new technologies.\n\nAll of the aforementioned advances in both the technologies themselves and research supporting them, however, are not enough to ensure that their potential is realized in realworld set tings. Instead, a number of pitfalls and possibilities surrounding implementation must now be addressed. At the patient level, a better understanding of user engagement with these technolo gies, and how this relates to benefits observed, is required. At the provider level, improved training for \"prescribing\" DHTs by the mental health care workforce, clearer expectations of where DHTs should sit within the clinical workflow, and improvements of interoperability for new DHTs within existing systems are all necessary if integration is to be at all possible. At the policy level, further action is required to ensure that clinical regulations are suitably flexible to allow for innovation to be effectively adopted within health care services, while stricter regulations for com mercial settings may be needed to protect the public and in crease their confidence in these new approaches.\n\nEach of these implementation issues must also be considered and actioned with an understanding of the complex ethical is sues surrounding DHTs, and their related data. Overall, it now seems inevitable that digital technologies will change the face of mental health research and treatment. The extent to which these changes are genuinely beneficial for those with mental disorders will depend on equitable access, robust research, and ethical, ev idencebased implementation of these new technologies within global mental health care."
