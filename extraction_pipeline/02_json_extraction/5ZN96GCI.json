  "title": "Gamification for health promotion: systematic review of behaviour change techniques in smartphone apps",
  "abstract": "Objective: Smartphone games that aim to alter health behaviours are common, but there is uncertainty about how to achieve this. We systematically reviewed health apps containing gaming elements analysing their embedded behaviour change techniques. Methods: Two trained researchers independently coded apps for behaviour change techniques using a standard taxonomy. We explored associations with user ratings and price. \n Data sources: We screened the National Health Service (NHS) Health Apps Library and all top-rated medical, health and wellness and health and fitness apps (defined by Apple and Google Play stores based on revenue and downloads). We included free and paid English language apps using 'gamification' (rewards, prizes, avatars, badges, leaderboards, competitions, levelling-up or health-related challenges). We excluded apps targeting health professionals. Results: 64 of 1680 (4%) health apps included gamification and met inclusion criteria; only 3 of these were in the NHS Library. Behaviour change categories used were: feedback and monitoring (n=60, 94% of apps), reward and threat (n=52, 81%), and goals and planning (n=52, 81%). Individual techniques were: self-monitoring of behaviour (n=55, 86%), non-specific reward (n=49, 82%), social support unspecified (n=48, 75%), non-specific incentive (n=49, 82%) and focus on past success (n=47, 73%). Median number of techniques per app was 14 (range: 5-22). Common combinations were: goal setting, self-monitoring, nonspecific reward and non-specific incentive (n=35, 55%); goal setting, self-monitoring and focus on past success (n=33, 52%). There was no correlation between number of techniques and user ratings ( p=0.07; r s =0.23) or price ( p=0.45; r s =0.10). Conclusions: Few health apps currently employ gamification and there is a wide variation in the use of behaviour change techniques, which may limit potential to improve health outcomes. We found no correlation between user rating (a possible proxy for health benefits) and game content or price. Further research is required to evaluate effective behaviour change techniques and to assess clinical outcomes.",

There are over 2 billion smartphone users globally in 2016 and by 2018 one-third of the world's population will use smartphones.  1 China had 500 million smartphone users in 2014, and in 2016, India will exceed 200 million users overtaking the USA as the world's second-largest smartphone market.  1 ccompanying this rapid growth in smartphone use is a huge expansion in applications targeting health and health-related behaviours. Over 100 000 health applications (apps) are available worldwide for smartphones with exercise, diet and weight management apps being the most popular downloads.

      "text": "\u25aa This is the first comprehensive systematic review examining the use of behaviour change techniques in smartphone games aimed at changing health-related behaviours. \u25aa We rigorously evaluated behaviour change techniques and classified them using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1. \u25aa We identify individual behaviour change techniques and combinations of techniques commonly used in smartphone games to facilitate development of more effective applications in future. \u25aa We screened only 1680 top-rated apps in the most popular app stores; so while our sample may be representative of apps in common use, we did not examine the full repertoire of apps offered by developers. \u25aa We were not able to assess the clinical benefits or potential harms from using the apps since none have been rigorously evaluated.\n\nmost health applications for smartphones have very simple functions and do little more than provide basic information.  6 There is little evidence that public health practitioners and users participate in the design of health apps and most apps do not contain theoretically consistent behaviour change techniques.  [7] [8] ] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Very few apps comply with regulatory processes or have had their effectiveness formally assessed,  6 8 16 19  leading to concerns about lack of benefit or even potentially harmful apps.  19 hile there is guidance from Apple and Android stores on criteria that must be met for app inclusion,  20 21  this focuses on ensuring that app content is not of a violent, illegal or sexual nature, that it functions reliably and that intellectual property is secured. The National Health Service (NHS) Health Apps Library uses a more rigorous approach with a clinical assurance team to ensure apps comply with trusted sources of information and to identify apps that may potentially cause harm.  22 owever, currently, there is no requirement to demonstrate effectiveness in modifying either behavioural or clinical outcomes or that the app complies with regulatory frameworks ( http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/  DigitalHealth/MobileMedicalApplications/default.htm ,  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical- devices-software-applications-apps ).\n\nIn parallel with the growth in health apps, there has been a remarkable increase in gaming on personal computers, dedicated game consoles and on smartphones. Games now form the largest market share of apps comprising 33% of all downloads.  23 It is estimated that 69% of people in the UK aged 8-74 are playing games on average 14 hours per week.  24 Of these players, 52% are female and the average age is 31 years. 'Gamification' harnesses a desire for competition, incorporating 'gaming elements' such as badges, leaderboards, competitions, rewards and avatars to engage and to motivate people.  25 The use of gamification is increasingly popular for training programmes in industry with a projected $2.8 billion spend on gamification by businesses in 2016.  26 igher education institutions have also integrated gaming techniques into their teaching programmes.  27 hile there are successful health applications of gamification on Super Nintendo, Nintendo Wii and personal computers, gamification in mobile health is, perhaps surprisingly, a relatively new concept.  [28] [29] 9] [30] [31]  Gamification can be effective in promoting and sustaining healthy behaviours, tapping into playful and goal-driven aspects of human nature. Gamification strategies such as goal setting, providing feedback on performance, reinforcement, comparing progress and social connectivity share key elements with established health behaviour change techniques.  32  behaviour change technique is 'an observable, replicable and irreducible component of an intervention designed to alter or redirect causal processes that regulate behaviour; that is, a technique is proposed to be an \"active ingredient\" (e.g., feedback, self-monitoring, reinforcement)'.  7 These techniques have been clearly defined, linked with theories of behaviour change and classified into an internationally recognised taxonomy, comprising 93 individual techniques, grouped into 16 behaviour change categories.  7 his taxonomy builds on previous work to identify the active components of complex interventions.  8 33-37 For example, Dombrowski et al coded behaviour change techniques for obese adults with obesity-related comorbidities in behavioural interventions applying a 26-category taxonomy developed by Abraham et al.  34 38  Although apps have proliferated, work aiming to characterise the use of behaviour change techniques in smartphone apps and smartphone games is relatively novel. Two reviews include Direito et al, who used a 26-category taxonomy developed by Abraham et al,  38 39  and Conroy et al, who used the Coventry, Aberdeen and London-Revised (CALO-RE) developed also by Michie et al and found the limited use of behaviour change techniques in diet and physical activity apps.  8    40  Crane et al 41 examined the use of behaviour change techniques in alcohol reduction apps using the BCT taxonomy (v1). Findings again found the limited use of behaviour change techniques.\n\nHere we provide the first comprehensive systematic review of behaviour change techniques in smartphone games classified using the BCT taxonomy (v1) developed by Michie et al comprising 16 behaviour change categories and 93 individual techniques. The purpose of this review is to identify appropriate behaviour change techniques and combinations of techniques for use in this setting to facilitate development of more effective smartphone games to promote health.  7"

Test devices were unmodified consumer-grade smartphones running up-to-date versions of their mobile operating system. The same version of each app was used throughout testing. The entire app content was coded for behaviour change techniques, including text, images, video and other multimedia content. Apps found in the Apple store and Google Play store were not included twice and were recorded only in the Apple iPhone data.\n\nTwo researchers trained in behaviour change technique coding (EAE and JL) coded apps independently. App content was coded using the BCT taxonomy (v1).  7 echniques were classified as either present or absent. An example of the coding process and application of behaviour change techniques to app content is provided (see online supplementary figure  S1 ). The number of individual behaviour change techniques included in each app was counted. There was no count of the frequency in which techniques were used in each individual app.\n\nWe used Cohen's \u03ba to assess inter-rater reliability of BCT coding at the initial stage of review. There was substantial agreement between the two reviewers (\u03ba=0.79, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.81). All discrepancies in reviewer coding were then resolved through discussion with a third trained reviewer (LS), a health psychologist.\n\nCodes from each reviewer were recorded on a standardised, structured form. We recorded information on app version, date of first release, date of latest update, publisher, description, main function, target user, special features and number of downloads where available. Missing data were requested from the author/publisher of the app or from the Apple/Android stores."

Additional discussions occurred during this initial search period between EAE and other review authors about inclusion of particular apps.\n\nApple displays 240 top-rated medical and 240 health and wellness apps comprising free and paid apps. Android displays free and paid apps separately, displaying their 300 top-rated free medical apps, 300 top-rated paid medical apps, 300 top-rated free health and fitness and 300 top-rated paid health and fitness apps. Thus, more Android than Apple apps were included.\n\nIn the apps meeting inclusion criteria, targeted behaviour changes included increasing/improving exercise (n=45, 70%), improving fitness (n=11, 17%), smoking cessation (n=4, 6%), encouraging oral hygiene (n=2, 3%), weight loss (n=1, 2%) and blood glucose measurement adherence (n=1, 2%, see online supplementary table  S1 ).

      "text": "We found that self-regulatory behaviour change techniques were most commonly used (feedback and monitoring including self-monitoring of behaviour). These techniques are also commonly used in non-gamified apps targeting physical activity, healthy eating and alcohol reduction.  39 40 41 The effectiveness of these techniques in achieving behaviour change is supported by findings from a wide range of studies  8 33-37  and linked to control theory.  37 Control theory suggests that setting goals, monitoring of behaviour, receiving feedback and reviewing relevant goals in the light of feedback may be effective in changing behaviour  43  and is one of a broader group of theories involving feedback loops and self-regulation.  44 requently used behaviour change categories were comparison of behaviour and reward and threat. Common individual behaviour change techniques were social support unspecified, non-specific reward, nonspecific incentive and focus on past success. We suggest that the use of some of these techniques may be driven by ease of implementation in smartphone games with an internet connection. Sharing activity on social media is a common feature of mobile apps and is easy to integrate into app design. Social support as a behaviour change technique is also common in physical activity apps.  40 dwards EA, et al.

It is possible that this technique may be more suited to physical activity apps since it was not found in apps to reduce alcohol consumption.  41 Alcohol reduction apps also featured a range of techniques not found in smartphone games: facilitate self-recording, provide information on consequences, give options for additional and later support, and offer/direct towards appropriate written materials.  41 hile these techniques may be more suited to alcohol reduction apps, it is also possible that they do not lend themselves to use on the gaming platform.\n\nOne previous meta-analysis examined combinations of health behaviour change techniques using classification and regression trees and suggested that provide information about behaviour and prompt intention formation was one of the most effective combinations;  45  however, comparison with our findings is problematic because the study used the earlier 26-category taxonomy  38  which does not easily translate into the more recent 93 category taxonomy (v1).  7  second meta-analysis of internet-based interventions suggested that number of techniques included in the intervention and the resulting behaviour change outcomes were directly related.  46 This review also suggested benefit from linking techniques to behaviour change theory. We were not able to examine effects on outcomes because of lack of outcome data, although we saw no relation between behaviour change technique content and user rating which may be a proxy for outcome. Several studies in other clinical settings find no relationship between number of behaviour change techniques and health outcome, for example, in obesity, healthy eating and physical activity,  34 35 37  although these studies did not specifically examine effects using a technology-based delivery method. One study examining technology-based delivery found that popularity and user ratings were only weakly associated with behaviour change technique content.  41  found a high number of behaviour change techniques in each smartphone game (median: 14, range: 5-22). This figure is higher than previous reviews of non-app interventions to promote healthy eating (mean: 6, range: 1-13)  38  and physical activity (mean: 6, range: 1-13)  38  (mean: 6, SD: 3.1)  37  (mean: 8, range: 2-18).  39 wo other reviews of behaviour change techniques in physical activity and non-gamified alcohol reduction apps found a slightly lower number (mean: 4.2, range: 1-13)  40  (mean: 3.6, range: 0-13).  41 This may be related to the overlap between gamification methodology and health behaviour change techniques.\n\nWhile there was no overall relationship between user rating and behaviour change technique content, one particular app deserves mention. 'Diabetes Companion' by mySugr has a 5/5* customer rating in the app store and used 18 behaviour change techniques. The Diabetes Companion is a charming, sometimes outspoken, diabetes monster that aims to make diabetes monitoring and data collection useful and fun in everyday life. The app is approved as a medical device by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA and has a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene (CE) mark. Elements of gamification in the app and immediate feedback help to keep players motivated and involved in self-management. While there is no evaluation against health outcomes, this app may nevertheless provide a model for employing gamification and health behaviour techniques in smartphone apps.  47 48 e found that the price of an app was unrelated to number of behaviour change techniques reinforcing a similar finding from a content analysis of exercise apps.  49 However, other earlier studies showed a positive relationship between price and behaviour change technique content.  14 39 50 The disparity between findings could be explained by the recent rise in Freemium apps, which are free to download, but then apply charges for additional features.  51 rengths and weaknesses This is the first comprehensive review of the use of behaviour change techniques in smartphone games\n\nTable 3 Common combinations of behaviour change techniques"

Another review used the BCT taxonomy (v1), however, considered only non-gamified alcohol reduction apps.  41  further strength of this review is that we considered combinations of behaviour change techniques that were used in the apps. Many of the existing reviews report individual behaviour change techniques rather than combinations. However, our aim was only to identify the combinations of techniques that smartphone game developers are currently using. We had insufficient power to examine effects of theoretically consistent groups of techniques on proxy outcomes such as user rating or price. This is an interesting area of work requiring further research in larger databases, which would ideally include behavioural and clinical outcomes.  52 hile there may be a degree of subjectivity when coding behaviour change techniques using taxonomies,  53  this would have been reduced by independent coding by two trained researchers.  53 In addition, we demonstrated substantial agreement between the two reviewers.\n\nA limitation of our review is that we were unable to explore associations between the use of behaviour change techniques and change in health behaviour or other health-related outcomes. This is because none of the apps have been systematically evaluated and highlights the need for well-designed studies to determine the effectiveness of health and wellness apps against a range of process and health-related outcomes.\n\nA further limitation is that we only reviewed top-rated apps in the two most popular app stores and did not sample the entire range of apps available. Thus, the range of health behaviours targeted will reflect the preferences of the consumers rather than covering the entire repertoire of apps offered by developers. It is possible that apps with certain characteristics, for example, high behaviour change content, are less popular with users and we were not able to test this hypothesis. Nevertheless, we were able to study the use of behaviour change techniques in apps in common use, which was the objective of our study.\n\nIn this review, we focused on commonly used behaviour change techniques. It would be interesting to examine behaviour change techniques that were not used or had a low frequency of use, to determine how these aligned with relevant behavioural and cognitive theories and hence identify any potential opportunities for app developers. Similarly, we did not examine the frequency with which behaviour change techniques were used in each individual app and the mode of delivery of each behaviour change technique. Future work in larger data sets might usefully make these more detailed observations and could also examine the effects of prespecified, theoretically consistent groups of behaviour change techniques against relevant outcomes."

The NHS Library is currently updating review processes aiming to provide an accredited set of apps, which have been endorsed and given a service quality certification mark by The British Standards Institution (Kitemark) through NHS Choices.  54 he majority of apps that we identified focused on exercise and fitness. There were very few gamified apps targeting health behaviours more directly relevant to clinical outcomes, highlighting a potential gap in the market and possible untapped resource for health promotion. It is possible that the task of encouraging exercise and fitness lends itself more easily to gamification and that application of gamification to other aspects of health promotion will be more challenging. However, another explanation may be that health and fitness apps are simply more popular since we searched only the toprated apps in the most popular stores. In the latter case, the challenge will be to make apps and smartphone games that are as appealing to users as those promoting exercise and fitness."

      "text": "This review provides evidence to inform further research in the growing field of gamification in healthcare apps and to determine optimum use of behaviour change constructs in smartphone games. The relationship between the behaviour change technique content of an intervention and the resulting health behaviour change is not simple.  34 35 37 More techniques are not necessarily better and further work is needed on the specific combinations of techniques likely to be effective in smartphone games.\n\nThere may be potential for more effective apps to be developed drawing from the full repertoire of techniques and combinations of techniques, which are appropriate to this platform. This development will require multidisciplinary collaboration between game developers, behaviour change experts and public health specialists.\n\nFurther research and clinical evaluation is urgently needed for healthcare apps to assess their effectiveness in modifying health behaviour and the clinical consequences of these behaviour changes. None of the apps in our review has been evaluated in randomised controlled trials to quantify potential benefit and harms that may arise from use of this technology. There is a need for regulation of healthcare apps and strengthened approval mechanisms to ensure patients have access to effective and safe interventions. The British Standards Institution has formulated and published a code of practice for health and wellness apps, providing app developers with quality criteria to consider during the development process.  55 We suggest that this code should be widely adopted and could lead to better quality and more effective products.\n\nThe economics of production and scale of delivery could potentially give smartphone apps an advantage over other health promotion interventions. Similar methods of assessing cost-effectiveness could be used as for other health technologies ( https://www.nice.org.uk/about/  what-we-do/our-programmes/nice-guidance/nice-medical- technologies-guidance )."

      "text": "We provide an overview of the use of behaviour change techniques in the rapidly developing area of smartphone games, aiming to provide insights to inform more effective development of applications to change health-related behaviours. We suggest that strengthening collaboration between app developers, behavioural scientists and public health practitioners is necessary to realise the full health benefits of this new technology, which could be substantial. The benefits and harms arising should be evaluated using standard methods to enable consumers to make appropriate choices and allow health systems to make decisions about reimbursement."
