  "title": "A randomized controlled behavioral intervention trial to improve medication adherence in adult stroke patients with prescription tailored Short Messaging Service (SMS)-SMS4Stroke study",
  "abstract": "Background: The effectiveness of mobile technology to improve medication adherence via customized Short Messaging Service (SMS) reminders for stroke has not been tested in resource poor areas. We designed a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of SMS on improving medication adherence in stroke survivors in Pakistan. Methods: This was a parallel group, assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled, superiority trial. Participants were centrally randomized in fixed block sizes. Adult participants on multiple medications with access to a cell phone and stroke at least 4 weeks from onset (Onset as defined by last seen normal) were eligible. The intervention group, in addition to usual care, received reminder SMS for 2 months that contained a) Personalized, prescription tailored daily medication reminder(s) b) Twice weekly health information SMS. The Health Belief Model and Social Cognitive theory were used to design the language and content of messages. Frontline SMS software was used for SMS delivery. Medication adherence was self-reported and measured on the validated Urdu version of Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression was used to model the outcome against intervention and other covariates. Analysis was conducted by intention-to-treat principle. Results: Two hundred participants were enrolled. 38 participants were lost to follow-up. After 2 months, the mean medication score was 7.4 (95 % CI: 7.2-7.6) in the intervention group while 6.7 (95 % CI: 6.4-7.02) in the control group. The adjusted mean difference (\u0394) was 0.54 (95 % CI: 0.22-0.85). The mean diastolic blood pressure in the intervention group was 2.6 mmHg (95 % CI; -5.5 to 0.15) lower compared to the usual care group. \n Conclusion: A short intervention of customized SMS can improve medication adherence and effect stroke risk factors like diastolic blood pressure in stroke survivors with complex medication regimens living in resource poor areas.",

Two thirds of this burden is borne by low and middle income countries where they are more likely to be fatal or disabling  [3] . International comparison of stroke cost studies show that on average, stroke care accounted for 3 % of total health care expenditures  [4] . In Pakistan, community surveys suggest a lifetime stroke symptom prevalence of approximately 19 %  [5] , with an estimated annual stroke incidence of 250 per 100,000 population  [6, 7] .\n\nOptimal adherence to medications may reduce the risk of poor outcomes by 26 %  [8] . However, a recent 50 year ) meta-analysis reported global adherence rates around 75 %  [9] . Local studies report adherence rates to cardiac medicines ranging between 27-77 %  [10]  and a 68 % compliance in stroke patients in the first 2 years after the event  [11] .\n\nInterventions designed to overcome non-adherence include drug diaries, pill counters, automated reminders, patient counseling and improving social support  [12] [13] [14] [15] . Each of these interventions, involves substantial cost, time and effort with a variable response dependent on health and prescription literacy and self-motivation  [16] . These are not feasible in settings like Pakistan due to poor health literacy and awareness and severe resource limitations  [17, 18] . Short text message (SMS) is an inexpensive, ubiquitous and culturally acceptable tool with potential for behavioral change. Mobile phone users in Pakistan were recorded at greater than 137 million by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and total cellular density is reportedly 77 %  [19] . We hypothesized that our short intense SMS intervention would be able to demonstrate its potential if we used the Health Belief Model with Behavioural Change Theory to design it and reach large numbers frequently due to economic feasibility  [20] [21] [22] .\n\nWe sought to determine the effectiveness of customized SMS reminders plus Health information SMS in addition to usual care in adult stroke patients compared to usual care only in improving medication adherence at a hospital stroke service in Pakistan. In addition we explored the biologic effects if any, on blood pressure for those who received SMS and the scalability characteristics of the innovation based on Rogers Diffusion of Innovation Theory derived questionnaire that measures intervention qualities such as Simplicity, Compatibility, Observability and Relative advantage  [23] ."

This translated into 16 % effect size. Keeping a 15 % attrition rate the sample size was inflated so at least 100 subjects were needed in each group. Any improvement in the MMAS would translate into clinical improvement in the long run through effective secondary prevention.\n\nPilot Testing was done on 10 % of the sample size i.e., 20 participants and the intervention was also tested for smooth application and any systematic errors. This sample was excluded from the final analysis. These 20 participants were in addition to the 200 participants that were included in the final study.\n\nData was entered on Microsoft Access database through double entry. Analysis was performed using the intention to treat principle at two stages: interim analysis after 25 % of the sample had been reached (Additional file 1) and final analysis after data had been collected from all study participants. Descriptive statistics were reported as Mean (SD) or Median (IQR) for continuous variables like age, years of schooling, years since diagnosis, MMAS score etc. Proportions were reported for categorical variables like gender, marital status, area of residence, employment status, proportion of patients with depression etc. Multiple linear regression was performed to estimate the adjusted mean difference in MMAS between the two groups. Robust regression was applied to the final model. Sensitivity analysis were done by duration of intervention, SMS receiver (patient/caregiver) and primary stroke physician (refer to Additional file 1). The acceptability and patient satisfaction of the intervention were reported as proportions.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study is an early report of an SMS based intervention for improving medication adherence in stroke survivors based in a low resource setting. The results show a significant increase in medication adherence behavior which is encouraging and highlights the possibility of improving secondary stroke prevention through a simple intervention. Additionally, a small but significant difference in diastolic blood pressure was observed in those who received SMS, who were presumably more compliant in the intervention group. Users of the SMS for stroke service reported a high satisfaction and acceptability and the intervention itself showed good characteristics as an innovation that may disseminate favorably. We observed that the dosing frequency had a positively linear relationship with mean medication adherence in the presence of intervention. This shows that the intervention was effective in achieving high adherence for participants with most difficult dosing regimens like thrice daily frequency. This was possible because the intervention was tailored to individual patient prescription and reminders were sent according to dosing schedule. On the other hand it was seen that mean adherence was inversely related to total pill count prescribed per day. This contrasts with previous findings from a study in Pakistani hypertensive population  [10] , where increasing number of pills increased the adherence scores. Higher pill count may lead to patient fatigue and poorer adherence. Patients with stroke are have relative cognitive impairment leading to poorer adherence to a complex prescriptions, however in spite of this setting the   intervention was effective and users became more compliant. mHealth (mobile Health) is a rapidly developing field whose potential of leverage to improve medically important outcomes is great but is limited by a lack of well-designed randomized controlled trials that measure robust outcomes  [31, 32] . Most SMS studies are focused on communicable diseases with a recent shift towards non-communicable diseases. SMS based interventions have shown modest effect  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . We feel that in addition to robust RCT design the actual SMS wordings of our intervention were designed on theories of behavior change and may explain some effect as compared to simple knowledge transfer messages  [42] . Most IT interventions are not informed by theory or frameworks that would explain the mechanisms of why a message would work or not, and be replicable by other teams. We used the Health Belief Model, as opposed to simple knowledge transfer, which predicts influences on human behavior have 6 key determinants: Perceived susceptibility, Perceived seriousness, Perceived benefits of taking action, Barriers to taking action, Cues to Action and Self-efficacy  [43, 44] . Thus participants were enabled to change their behavior via messages that touched on these themes.\n\nAdherence has two components namely: i) Intentional non-adherence and ii) non-intentional non-adherence. It is important to distinguish the contribution of both the types in order to devise successful interventions  [45] . We targeted both aspects by providing knowledge and belief change messages and the other by cueing, nudging and reminder behavior to take medications.\n\nThe major strength of this study is its RCT design, with allocation concealment, blinded outcome ascertainment, and use of validated tools and effort to reduce attrition. We used an open access software for designing the intervention. Our intervention is clear, designed and taxonomy coded and replicable. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses also reinforce the independent effect of intervention.\n\nThe main limitation of this trial is the use of selfreported outcome measure the validated Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), which was chosen due to the complex stroke medication regimen and population characteristics. There have been comparative studies where self-reported adherence measures, like questionnaires, are found to be acceptable compared to more objective methods of measuring drug adherence like electronic pill boxes, biomarkers  [46] [47] [48] . We considered the use of electronic pill boxes and biomarkers for outcome assessment. However, stroke patients have diverse prescriptions which vary in the type of drug classes, number and frequency of dosage, no single biomarker would be applicable to all the study participants. Similarly, electronic pill boxes record the number of times a box is opened. Since stroke patients are on multiple drugs at any dosing time, it would be erroneous to believe that they have consumed all the pills for that dose when they open the box. It was logistically difficult to request disabled participants to physically visit for repeated pill counts. So we relied on self-reported scale as a measure of adherence. Additionally, to counter check our measure, we documented day to day adherence with return SMS from the participant. There are no ideal measures for reporting adherence, the MMAS itself is a reliable measure of selfreported adherence as it corresponds well to pharmacy refill rates  [49, 50] . We are exploring phone based adherence measures to improve our adherence measurement outcomes in future studies, such as unannounced pill counts and capsule photographs  [51, 52] . Another limitation is that the duration of this study did not allow measurement of definite biologic outcomes like stroke recurrence after the intervention. It may be argued that the patient population for this study had minimal disability (MRS < 3), but it is this high risk group which should be saved from recurrent disability by stroke recurrence. Moreover, our eligibility data show that 77 % of the stroke patients coming to our clinic were eligible for this intervention and only 11 % were excluded due to disability (Fig.  2 ). An inherent limitation of the study is the performance bias of an educational intervention; participants were not blinded to the reception of SMS and were well instructed and probably motivated to medication adherence than the control group. This motivation may be partially responsible for some of the adherence behavior. Although our population may have poor literacy and health literacy skills overall, we used a short text message service to improve adherence due to the fact that Roman Urdu (easily legible) and Bolo SMS (Verbal SMS) options were used in the study to send messages to participants and this is what helped with acceptability and reach. Pakistanis have exchanged 301.7 billion SMS with 317 million users during 2014, covering 92 % of the land area. In this study, there was an expected limitation for those who would not possess a cell phone, based on the eligibility criteria and review, Some operational difficulties with the intervention were faced when the SMS service was blocked in the country for security reasons. There were 3 separate occasions when this happened, each lasting 24 h. We anticipated such events and informed our participants about the possibility of not being able to send reminder messages that day and that they should manage their medications themselves to avoid anxiety. After set up it was very easy to operate the system.\n\nThe effect on diastolic blood pressure needs to be strengthened by improving study power and duration of exposure. We believe this tool has the potential to bring such changes if used over a significant duration.\n\nThe potential impact of using SMS to cue chronic disease desirable behavior is immense. SMS is incredibly popular and acceptable, with Pakistani mobile phone users exchanging a staggering 315.7 billion text messages during July 2012 to June 2013 or 865 million SMS messages a day and prefer this mode of communication  [39] . There are 135 million registered phone users in Pakistan whose data are biometrically verified, in addition there is a national electronic database where all users are linked and registered and potentially able to receive SMS  [19] . The cost of SMS is cheap including bundles for business and social marketing, and the software used to deploy mass messages is open access and freely available. Stroke happens a decade earlier in LMIC countries like Pakistan and the population at risk is using cell phones. Additionally, since the stroke survivor and primary caregiver reside in communities, the primary caregiver often has access to a mobile phone and it is possible to make the intervention effective in a relatively older population. Additionally, although the population has literacy challenges a text based reminder system works even in those who have had minimal schooling due to the widespread understanding of Roman Urdu (which we also used to send our messages).\n\nAlthough it is not known how SMS would affect terminal outcomes like recurrent strokes, death or disability, it is known that the effect size itself is modest. In spite of these acknowledged limitations, in population dense regions, in absolute numbers, millions of lives could be reached and positively influenced regardless of geopolitical strife, chaos, socioeconomic differences and access inequities."
