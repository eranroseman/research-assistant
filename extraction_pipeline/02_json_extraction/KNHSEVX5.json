  "title": "Parents with high levels of communicative and critical health literacy are less likely to vaccinate their children",
  "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the relationship between parents' health literacy and decision-making regarding child vaccinations. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 731 parents of children aged 3-4 years. Functional, communicative, and critical health literacy (HL), knowledge, beliefs, reliability of the vaccine's information resources, and vaccine's attitudes were measured. Attitudes included three types: pro-vaccine attitudes, anti-vaccine attitudes, and attitudes regarding mandatory vaccination. Path analysis was conducted to explore direct and indirect associations of compliance with childhood vaccinations and HL. Results: Communicative HL has a significant negative direct association with compliance with vaccinations (\u00df = \u00c0 0.06, p < 0.05). High functional and critical HL have significant negative indirect associations with vaccinations through parents' attitudes regarding vaccines. Higher levels of perception of reliability of informal information resources are associated with non-compliance. \n Conclusions: The results indicate that parents with high functional, communicative, and critical HL are more at risk of not vaccinating their children. The results are contrary to expectations in which people with high HL adopt more positive health behaviors. Practical implications: Public health professionals may need more sophisticated communication methods to transfer messages regarding vaccines to parents in order to prevent decline in vaccine coverage rates, taking into account levels of trust and health literacy.",

      "text": "Vaccinations are the most effective way of preventing disease and improving health and are one of the 10 major accomplishments of the 20th century in public health  [1, 2] . Despite the benefits of vaccines, \"vaccine hesitancy\" exists among many parents  [3, 4]  and is characterized by variance regarding the manner in which parents decide to vaccinate their children. Their decisions range from compliance with some of the vaccinations in the recommended protocol and the rejection of others, delay in age of the child at immunization, categorical refusal of any vaccination, and compliance with the entire series of recommended vaccinations, albeit with concern regarding their safety  [3] . As a result, there have been reports of an increase in the incidence of diseases that are preventable by vaccine, for example, measles, due to a decrease in vaccine coverage rates  [5, 6] .\n\nUnderstanding parents who are vaccine hesitant is important in order to maintain high vaccine coverage rates and prevent a decline in herd immunity  [7] [8] [9] . Studies that have investigated what influences parents' decision-making explored knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding vaccines  [3, [8] [9] [10] 11] . Prislin et al.  [12]  suggested that beliefs and attitudes regarding vaccines are mediating variables between sociodemographic status and vaccination."

      "title": "1.1.. Health literacy and vaccination",
      "text": "The concept of health literacy (HL) is recognized as one of the factors that affects health outcomes  [17] . HL is the ability of the individual to obtain basic health information, and to process and understand it, in order to make informed decisions regarding health  [18] . Nutbeam  [18]  claimed that HL is the product of education and health promotion, which include the improvement of personal, cognitive, and social skills. Among the outcomes gained through these improved skills are enhanced knowledge and understanding of the factors that affect health and a shift in one's approach and motivation to practice health-related behaviors, as well as improved self-efficacy in performing health-related tasks and in adopting the necessary behavioral changes. Studies have found that low levels of HL are associated with poor adherence with preventive and therapeutic medical recommendations  [19, 20] .\n\nHealth literacy may be a factor influencing vaccine hesitancy; however, only a few studies have looked at HL and compliance with childhood vaccinations  [13] [14] [15] [16] . Most of these studies focused on functional HL and some aspect of communicative HL, such as understanding medical information  [13] . Ratzan  [21]  argued that vaccination policy should include \"vaccine literacy,\" based on the idea of HL. An increase in vaccine literacy, particularly in vulnerable populations, will increase compliance with vaccinations. A study in Norway found that parents with high levels of HL were more active participants in the decision-making process regarding their child's vaccinations  [13] . Wilson et al.  [14]  found that low functional HL was associated with low knowledge about vaccinations, but Pati et al.  [15]  found no association with compliance with vaccinations."

      "title": "1.2.. The theoretical framework",
      "text": "In this study, we use the definition of HL provided by Nutbeam  [12] , which refers to three levels, whereby each level is characterized by personal development and growth relative to the previous level, until reaching the ability to feel personally empowered and to exercise personal autonomy. The first level, functional HL, refers to the basic ability to read and write in order to function when facing routine situations. The second level, communicative HL, refers to the ability to understand the significance of medical information, so as to interact with the medical environment. The third level, critical HL, refers to a higher level of skills required in order to critically analyze medical information, so as to have greater control over life events and developments. This level includes the ability to influence social, economic, and environmental factors related to health. At this level of HL, the individual is capable of influencing health determinants to alter expected health outcomes. Lee et al.  [22]  suggested a research agenda where knowledge, health risk behavior, preventive care, and compliance with medications are mediating variables between HL and health outcome. Paasche-Orlow and Wolf  [23]  suggested a theoretical HL model that can explain a causal relationship between HL and health outcomes. In that model, knowledge, beliefs, attitudes (and other factors) are mediating factors between HL and health outcomes. Drawing on these models, the theoretical model for the current study (Fig.  1 ) assumes:\n\n(1) A direct association between socioeconomic variables and levels of HL and compliance with age-appropriate, routine childhood vaccinations (2) Knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding vaccines mediate among socioeconomic variables, HL levels, and compliance with childhood vaccinations.\n\nTherefore, the goals of the study were to assess the relationship between HL levels and parent compliance with recommended vaccinations and to determine how knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding vaccines mediate that relationship."

Participants were recruited from among infants born in 2009 registered at the Mother Child Health Clinics (MCHC). Two groups of children were identified:\n\n(1) Children whose parents had not completed at least one of three childhood vaccinations by the age of two: three parts of the hepatitis B vaccination (HBV-3), four parts of the diphtheriatetanus-pertussis vaccination (DTaP-4), and vaccination against mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR-1). These vaccinations are routinely administered during the first year of life and are considered core vaccination protocol. (2) A control group of children whose parents had completed the three vaccinations by the age of two. Each group was randomly sampled and a telephone interview was conducted with one of the parents. At the end, 309 participants were included in the study group and 422 included in the control group (a response rate of 53.7% and 54%, respectively). Parents who refused to complete the interview were asked to provide a reason and to respond to demographic questions; however, as \"lack of time\" was the primary reason cited, no additional information was provided.\n\nData regarding the completion of vaccinations, as well as contact information, were retrieved from the medical files at the\n\nDemographic vari ables Health li teracy levels A\u01abtud es regarding vacc ina \u019fon A\u01abtud es regarding prac\u019fce of health promo\u019fng behaviors with children Complian ce with recommended chil dhoo d vaccina \u019fon protocol Perceived reli ability of informa\u019fon sources Knowledge ab out vacc ina\u019fons Fig. 1.

The telephone interviews were conducted between December 2012 and March 2013. 2.2. Measures 2.2.1. Health literacy The measure of HL was based on the Health Literacy Questionnaire developed by Ishikawa, Takeuchi, and Yano  [26] , which assesses functional, communicative, and critical health literacy (Cronbach's alpha values were 0.84, 0.77, 0.65, respectively). The questionnaire was adapted to reflect the topic of childhood vaccination, while remaining as faithful as possible to the original wording (see Appendix A). The adapted questionnaire, titled Vaccine Health Literacy Scale, included 13 items ranked on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 = \"not at all\" to 4 = \"very much so.\" Mean scale scores and standard deviations (SD) were calculated from the data. For communicative and critical HL, a score approximating a value of 4 indicated a high degree of HL. For functional HL, a score approximating a value of 1 indicated a high degree of HL (Cronbach's alpha values were 0.70, 0.66, and 0.81, respectively)."

In the current study, the questionnaire was adapted to refer to parents of infants. Questions that could not be changed to pertain to infants were eliminated. Responses were ranked on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = \"completely disagree\" to 4 = \"completely agree,\" except for the knowledge questionnaire. Mean scale scores and standard deviations (SD) were calculated from the data.\n\nKnowledge about vaccinations: Four questions were presented to the respondent, scored as either correct or incorrect, for example: \"Vaccinations protect not only the person receiving the vaccine, but also the people with whom one comes in contact with.\" The sum of the answers was calculated such that a score of zero indicated no correct answers and a score of four indicated that the participant answered all of the questions correctly.\n\nAttitudes towards vaccination: Eleven items describe attitudes, for example, (a) pro-vaccine attitudes (Pro VA): \"To what extent do you agree that vaccinations were proven as safe before it was decided to administer them to children?\"; (b) anti-vaccine attitudes (Anti VA): \"To what extent do you agree that vaccinations can cause attention deficit disorder, chronic illness, or autism?\"; and (c) attitudes regarding mandatory vaccination (Mandatory VA): \"To what extent do you agree that mandatory administration of vaccinations goes against freedom of choice?\". Answers were recorded on a Likert scale whereby 1 = \"completely disagree\" to 4 = \"completely agree.\" Exploratory factor analysis was conducted and three groups were identified (Varimax rotation method, Eigenvalue >1 and factor loading >0.4). Cronbach's alpha values were 0.84, 0.80, and 0.79, respectively.\n\nAttitudes regarding the practice of health-promoting behaviors with children: Four items measured the importance (range 1-4) of providing children with proper nutrition, fastening their seat belts, creating a smoke-free environment around the child, and brushing teeth before bedtime. The total score ranged from 4 to 16, whereby a higher score indicated a greater significance attributed to healthpromoting behaviors.\n\nBeliefs regarding reliability of information sources regarding vaccines: Ten items indicated participants' perceptions regarding the reliability of information sources related to vaccinations, for example, (a) formal sources of information: \"To what extent do you perceive the MCHC nurses as reliable?\"; and (b) informal sources of information: \"To what extent do you perceive the internet sites that oppose vaccination reliable?\". A Likert scale was provided whereby 1 = \"completely reliable\" and 4 = \"completely not reliable.\" Mean scale scores were calculated, resulting in a score ranging from 1 to 4.

      "text": "A path analysis (Fig.  2  and Table  3 ) found that decisions regarding vaccination were significantly and directly explained by the variable of parents' education level (\u00df = -0.12, p < 0.001), communicative HL (\u00df = \u00c00.06, p < 0.05), Pro VA (\u00df = 0.11, p < 0.05), Anti VA (\u00df = \u00c00.15, p < 0.001), Mandatory VA (\u00df = \u00c00.17, p < 0.001), and perceived reliability of unofficial information sources that oppose vaccination (\u00df = \u00c00.07, p < 0.05). In other words, the absence of an academic education, low level of communicative HL, high positive attitudes regarding vaccination, weak negative attitudes regarding vaccination, weak negative attitudes regarding mandatory vaccination, and considering unofficial information sources that oppose vaccinations to be unreliable increase the likelihood that parents will complete their children's vaccinations.\n\nAlthough the variables of parents' age, income, and religion (Jewish or Muslim) were found to be associated with the study group, in the path analysis, these variables did not have a direct effect on the completion of the vaccinations. Only the absence of an academic education was found to have a direct and independent effect on parents' decisions to complete childhood vaccinations. Similarly, although significant relationships were found between communicative HL, critical HL, and parents' decisions about vaccinating their children, the path analysis revealed that only communicative HL had a direct effect on completion of vaccination protocol.\n\nFunctional HL and critical HL were found to have an indirect effect, mediated through other variables on completion of the vaccination protocol. Findings of the Sobel test (Table  4 ) reveal that among the variables that were considered to be possible mediators, Pro VA, Anti VA, Mandatory VA, and perceived reliability of unofficial information sources that oppose vaccination acted as mediators among functional HL, critical HL, and parents' compliance with vaccination. The pathway of functional HL is indicated as follows: the higher the scores for functional HL, the lower the scores for pro-vaccine attitudes and the higher the scores for anti-vaccine attitudes; furthermore, unofficial information sources opposing vaccination were perceived to be more reliable.

      "title": "4.1.. Discussion",
      "text": "The path analysis indicates two major pathways between HL and compliance with recommended vaccinations.\n\n1. A direct path between communicative HL and compliance with vaccinations; 2. An indirect path between functional and critical HL through mediating variables leading to compliance with vaccinations.\n\nStudies show that parents who are capable of obtaining medical information from a wide variety of sources have difficulty in determining the credibility of such sources  [13] . In most cases, parents who did not comply with childhood vaccinations tended to search for additional information on the internet and to base their decisions on this information more so than parents who gave their children vaccinations  [32] . The non-compliant parents also perceived internet sites that opposed vaccinations to be reliable more so than other parents  [33] .\n\nIn our study, functional HL did not have a direct association with compliance. Pati et al.  [15]  also found that functional HL had a nonsignificant association with compliance with infant vaccinations. By contrast, a study conducted in India found that when adjusting for age and socioeconomic variables, mothers with a mid or high level of functional HL were significantly more likely than mothers with a low level of functional HL to complete child vaccinations  [16] . The situation in India may not be comparable to developed countries such as Israel due to large differences in levels of literacy in general.\n\nA few additional studies found that improving parents' functional HL led to better treatment outcomes for their children with chronic illness and to more informed use of healthcare services  [34, 35] .\n\nThe association between critical HL and noncompliance was mediated by negative attitudes regarding vaccination, negative attitudes regarding mandatory vaccinations, and the perception of information sources that oppose vaccination as relatively reliable. Thes mediating variabels had a significant effect on parents' decisions not to comply fully with vaccination. According to Nutbeam  [18] , critical HL is the highest level of HL towards which society should aspire. It is possible that parents with high levels of critical HL actively pursued information about vaccinations and refrained from blindly complying with a protocol that was recommended by a governmental body. For the most part, based on their pre-existing negative attitudes regarding vaccination or their concern about the vaccine, these parents pursued information that supported their fears, which they then used to make decisions  [16] . Moreover, it is possible that a high degree of functional HL gave parents greater access to large and diverse information sources beyond the scope of formal information that is typically accessed. Greater access also meant exposure to information opposing vaccinations, which may have affected the attitudes of parents and thus led to reduced compliance with the recommended vaccinations.\n\nIn this study, the health outcome of high-level critical HL is negative, namely, noncompliance with vaccinations. A paradox arises: in terms of public health, a well-educated public with high levels of HL in all three dimensions is a positive determinant of health  [18] . It is expected that people with high levels of HL will have the ability to obtain, analyze, and understand medical information; navigate in a medical environment; make medical decisions autonomously; and exert an overall positive effect on preventive medicine. However, the price of having a health-literate public is that some individuals, in this case, parents of infants, can show a high level of vaccine hesitancy and decide not to vaccinate their children based on their view that they are capable of making health decisions autonomously, albeit against the recommendations of the medical establishment. It seems that misleading information, especially on the internet  (32) , may be difficult to navigate, even for people with high levels of HL. They may not be able to distinguish between credible and incredible sources of health information.\n\nNo association was found in the current study between the variable of knowledge about vaccinations or perceived importance of health-promoting behaviors with children and compliance with vaccinations. This finding supports those of previous studies, in which levels of knowledge were found to be unrelated to the health outcome, and the level of knowledge about vaccinations in particular did not increase parental involvement in making decisions about vaccinating their children  [11, [36] [37] [38] . A number of studies found a positive relationship between parents' refusal to cooperate with health-promoting behaviors involving their children (e.g., giving fluoride supplements or vitamin K shots to newborns) and the likelihood of complying with recommended childhood vaccinations  [39, 40] .\n\nAlthough the current study found that formal information sources were perceived to be highly reliable, this variable was not found to have a direct relationship with vaccination compliance or to mediate functional or critical HL and compliance with vaccinations. In most cases, parents who considered these information sources as essential and reliable also complied with the recommended vaccination, compared to parents who perceived these sources as inefficient and unreliable  [41] . It appears that, although formal information provides reliable and up-to-date information, parents do not pay special attention to them when they have to decide whether or not to get their children vaccinated  [30, 13, 42] . Harmsen et al.  [43]  found that parents who consulted health professionals about vaccinations reported that health personnel had a weak influence on their decision whether to vaccinate their children. A possible explanation is that parents consider physicians or nurses to be a natural source of information about vaccination, given their professional role as part of the medical establishment. Parents also note that these medical professionals are obligated to represent vaccinations as efficient and safe, and hence they might feel compelled to provide an inaccurate or incomplete explanation by disregarding a vaccine's known side effects, risks, or the fact that each child's reaction to the vaccine is unique  [44, 45] . Occasionally, this practice decreases the influence of formal information sources and disrupts the public trust in official sources  [10] , so that although they are perceived to be reliable, they do not have a major influence on parents' decisions.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, according to the current study, is the high degree of reliability attributed to internet sources of information that oppose vaccinations. This finding echoes that of other studies  [32] . This variable mediates the association between functional and critical HL and vaccinations. It appears that for parents who did not comply with vaccination protocol, the perceived reliability of internet-based information sources that oppose vaccination is greater than that of formal information sources.\n\nThe current study has several limitations. As an observational cross-sectional study, causal relationships could not be inferred. Nevertheless, the path analysis enabled the construction of a causation model  [46] , as presented in Fig.  2 . In addition, the current study's HL questionnaire, which was validated in a study conducted with chronic disease patients, might not be best suited for use with a healthy population. However, this is the first time, as far as we know, that HL levels have been examined as health determinants of parents' vaccination decision-making. In addition, the measures were collected from the parent who responded to the interview; thus, we cannot know the attitudes of the other parent.\n\nFinally, this study refers to a sample of children who did not receive one or more vaccines. Therefore, we did not analyze the differences between children who did not get one vaccine and children who did not get more than one vaccine. We assume that if there are differences in HL between these groups, the bias will be stronger toward the association between high HL levels and less vaccinating."

In this complex situation, the health professionals need new, more sophisticated communication tools to explain the importance of vaccines to parents, such as social marketing tools and social media."
