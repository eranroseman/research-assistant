  "abstract": "Background and objective: Bronchodilators (BDs) are the cornerstone of COPD treatment. However, their underuse has been reported in real-life studies. PUMA is a primary-care study from Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay that could help understand the BD use in terms of frequency for long-acting (LA-BD) and short-acting (SA-BD) BDs alone or associated with corticosteroids (CS), and the use as-needed or on regular basis. Methods: This is a multicentre, multinational, cross-sectional, non-interventional study including no randomised primary-care centres from each country (total 57 centres) without connection with respiratory specialists. Subjects attending routine visits, at-risk for COPD (40 years, current or former smokers or exposed to biomass) completed a questionnaire and performed spirometry. COPD was defined as post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 and by the lower limit of normal (LLN). Prior physician diagnosis of emphysema, chronic bronchitis or COPD was also determined. Results: 1743 patients were interviewed, 1540 completed spirometry, 309 had COPD by post-BD FEV 1 / FVC < 0.70, 226 by LLN, and 102 had prior medical diagnosis. A total of 77/309 COPD patients by spirometry (24.9%) used BD (3.6% LA-BDs), 15.2% used BD \u00fe CS (13.6% LA-BD \u00fe CS). Among these patients, SA-BDs (monotherapy) were the most commonly used medication both as-needed (4.5%) and on a regular basis (17.5%). Similar findings were observed using the LLN criteria. In those with prior medical diagnosis, 66/102 (64.7%) used BDs (9.8% LA-BD), and 25.6% used BD \u00fe CS (13.6% LA-BD \u00fe CS); among them SA-BDs were the most commonly medication used as-needed (9%) and on a regular basis (48.1%). Having health insurance with medication coverage increased the use of BDs. Conclusions: Up to 60% of COPD patients by spirometry and 10% of those with prior medical diagnosis attending a primary care sample of four Latin American countries did not use BDs. LA-BDs are widely underused on a regular-basis (2.6% and 8.3% of patients with spirometric and medical-diagnosis, Abbreviations: BD, bronchodilator; CS, corticosteroid; FEV 1 , forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC, forced vital capacity; LABA, long-acting b-agonist; LA-BD, longacting bronchodilator; LAMA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist; LLN, lower limit of normal; PUMA, \"Prevalencia y pr actica habitUal (diagn ostico y trataMiento) en poblaci on de riesgo de EPOC en atenci on primaria en Am erica Latina\" [Spanish], Prevalence Study and Regular Practice, Diagnosis and Treatment, Among General Practitioners in Populations at Risk of COPD in Latin America [English]; SA-BD, short-acting bronchodilator.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "In general, all current COPD guidelines for the management of the disease are driven by the need to reduce symptoms, prevent exacerbations, reduce disease severity, improve health status and exercise tolerance  [1e4] . Bronchodilators (BD) are central to this therapeutic approach, especially with regards to symptom management. The main BD used in the treatment of COPD are b 2 -agonists and anticholinergics. The choice among these medications depends on a number of factors, including the individual's response in terms of symptom relief and side effects, availability and cost.\n\nThe guidelines also recommend that bronchodilators are prescribed on as-needed or a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms  [1e4] . Inhaled short-acting BDs (SA-BD) are recommended in mild COPD patients on as-needed basis for symptom relief, whereas long-acting BDs (LA-BD) are recommended on regular (maintenance) basis in patients whose symptoms are not controlled with as-needed SA-BD or in those who have more severe airway obstruction and/or frequent exacerbations. It is well known that in these patients LA-BDs are more effective at producing maintained symptom relief than SA-BDs [5e7].\n\nAlthough clinical practice guidelines have been developed for COPD, their influence on primary-care practice is currently unclear and there is a considerable gap between the guidelines' recommendations for the use of bronchodilators in COPD and the prescribing pattern in real-life  [8e12] .\n\nIn a large, commercial, Medicare COPD population, Make et al.  [12]  found that long-term maintenance medication was not prescribed in the majority of patients and that a LA-BD was prescribed in less than one-third of patients. Similar findings have been reported in the Copenhagen General Population Study involving COPD patients with FEV 1 < 60%  [13] .\n\nThe under-management of COPD with LA-BD therapy has also been reported in a survey of primary-care physicians, which found that only 35% of physicians chose a LA-BD if use with a SA-BD agent had failed to manage a patient's symptoms  [14] . Furthermore, data from the UK primary-care setting showed that in the total UK COPD population a small proportion of patients in all GOLD subgroups were only using LA-BD monotherapy  [9] .\n\nNo information exists regarding BD medication use in COPD patients from the Latin American primary-care setting. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess the frequency of use of SA-BD and LA-BD therapies, both as needed (rescue) and on a regular basis (maintenance), in patients with COPD attending primary-care settings in four Latin American countries."

Details of the methodology have been published previously  [15] . Briefly; the PUMA study is a multicentre, multinational, cross-sectional, non-interventional study performed in 2012. The larger countries of South America were invited to participate in the study. However, the countries that finally participated were those that accepted the invitation and had availability of local resources to conduct the study. Participating sites were selected according to local feasibility from previous local available database of potential principal investigators (not randomised) and included primary care centres (family doctors, general practitioners etc.), including social security centres with no direct connection with respiratory medicine specialists, These sites were selected trying to reflect national primary care practice in terms of geographical distribution (urban and rural) and healthcare sector (public and private). Subjects were enrolled during routine spontaneous or scheduled visits unrelated to the study objectives (with or without respiratory symptoms). Participants were all subjects at risk for COPD attending the selected primary care centres during the study period. The ethics committees for each site approved the protocol and all subjects enrolled provided written informed consent.\n\nAll subjects at-risk for COPD were included in the study; key inclusion criteria were: 40 years of age, current or ex-smokers (10 pack-years, 50 pipes/year or 50 cigars/year) and/or exposure to biomass smoke (wood or coal, for cooking and heating; exposure 100 h/year).\n\nThe participants completed a modified version of the Proyecto Latinoamericano de Investigaci on en Obstrucci on Pulmonar (PLATINO) study  [16]  questionnaire for information on factors potentially associated with COPD; these included demographics, smoking habits, education, employment, respiratory symptoms, use of respiratory medication, prior spirometry testing, and data on the medical coverage and lung medication payment by health insurance. Information on prior medical diagnosis of asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema or COPD, were also obtained. Spirometry was performed using the portable, battery-operated ultrasound Easy One spirometer (ndd Medical Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). Spirometry tests were performed at baseline and 15 min after inhalation of 400 mg salbutamol, according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria of acceptability and reproducibility."

A ratio of post-BD FEV 1 /FVC less than the LLN; defined as the lower 5th percentile for predicted post-BD FEV 1 /FVC.\n\nSeverity of COPD airway obstruction was stratified using the GOLD criteria  [1] . Additionally, a prior diagnostic label of COPD was determined using a patient self-reported physician diagnosis of emphysema, chronic bronchitis or COPD. This definition of COPD was also assessed in order to have a better understanding of the bronchodilator prescription pattern in this real-life study, since up to 77% of the COPD subjects diagnosed by post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 criteria in PUMA did not have previous diagnosis  [17] ."

      "text": "Participation rates in the PUMA study have been published previously  [15] . Among the 1743 patients that completed interviews, 1540 had acceptable spirometry. Using the post-BD FEV 1 / FVC < 0.70 definition, 309 patients had COPD (20.1% prevalence), and using the LLN definition 226 patients had COPD (14.7 prevalence). Furthermore, 133 patients were identified with a prior medical diagnosis of COPD. Detailed descriptions of the COPD prevalence and subject's characteristics of the PUMA study have been published elsewhere  [17] .\n\nThe general characteristics of individuals with COPD, defined using the post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 criteria or prior medical diagnosis, and the prevalence of SA-BD and LA-BD use over the past 12 months are shown in Tables  1  and  2 , respectively. In those with airway obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70), the use of any SA-BD was statistically higher among non-white individuals (29.6%), less schooling (29.7%), presenting with dyspnoea (28.6%) or cough (28.9%), with an exacerbation (66.7%) or hospitalisation (90.9%) in the past year and more severe airway obstruction (GOLD 3e4: 37.9%) (Table  1 ). The combination of LA-BD \u00fe CS was higher among white individuals (19.9%), those with dyspnoea (16.5%) and GOLD 3e4 (25.3%) (Table  1 ). No differences were found in any LA-BD or any combination of SA-BD \u00fe CS use in past year for those with airway obstruction defined using spirometric criteria. Similar patterns were found among those who were medically diagnosed with COPD (Table  2 ), with this group having higher use of any respiratory medicine.\n\nThe use of SA-BDs and LA-BDs in individuals with COPD defined using post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 and prior medical diagnosis criteria are shown in Fig.  1 . The bronchodilators most commonly used as monotherapy in patients with COPD defined using post-BD FEV 1 / FVC < 0.70 criteria were the SA-BDs (Fig.  1 ). Only 3.6% of individuals used LA-BDs as monotherapy and 13.6% used LA-BD \u00fe CS. Similar findings were observed when using the LLN criteria (Supplementary Fig.  S1 ). In individuals with COPD according to prior medical diagnosis, 9.8% used LA-BD as monotherapy and 21.1% used LA-BD \u00fe CS; SA-BDs (55.6%) were also the most commonly  Abbreviations: long-acting bronchodilator (LA-BD); short-acting bronchodilator (SA-BD); corticosteroid (CS); Body mass index (BMI). bronchodilators used in these patients. The use of bronchodilators as-needed (rescue) and on a regular basis (maintenance) in individuals with COPD defined using post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 and prior medical diagnosis criteria are shown in Fig.  2 . SA-BDs were the most commonly used bronchodilators both as-needed (4.5%) and on a regular basis (17.5%) in COPD patients defined using post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 criteria. Only 2.6% of these patients used LA-BD monotherapy for maintenance and 10.7% used LA-BD \u00fe CS (Fig.  2 ). Similar findings were observed when COPD was defined using the LLN criteria (Supplementary Fig.  S2 ). In individuals with COPD defined using prior medical diagnosis, 8.3% of patients used LA-BD monotherapy for maintenance and 19.6% used LA-BD \u00fe CS; SA-BDs were the most commonly used bronchodilators both as-needed (9%) and on a regular basis (48.1%) in these patients.\n\nThe use of BDs according to the medical coverage and payment for respiratory medication in patients with COPD defined by post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 is shown in Fig.  3 . As expected, patients who had health insurance with free medicine, 234/309 (75.7%), or without medicines coverage (medicines not paid by the insurance), 58/309 (18.8%), used more BDs than those without health insurance, 17/309 (5.5%). The patients with health insurance also used a greater variety of types of medicine compared with those without health insurance. LA-BD as monotherapy was the least used BD in those with health insurance and not used nat all by subjects without health insurance. Similar findings were observed when COPD was defined using the LLN criteria (Supplementary Fig.  S3 ). Fig.  4  shows the use of BDs according to the medical coverage in patients with prior COPD medical diagnosis. Only 3/133 (2.3%) patients had no health insurance, 115/133 (86.4%) had health insurance with free medicines and 15/133 (11.3%) health insurance without medication coverage. In all groups, SA-BDs were the most commonly used BD as monotherapy and LA-BD the least frequently used."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "The results of the present study indicate that in primary care setting of four Latin American countries under-treatment with LA-BDs is frequent in patients with COPD defined by spirometry criteria or previous physician diagnosis. SA-BDs, used either as monotherapy or in combination with CS were, in general, the most common medication irrespective of whether the use was asneeded or on a regular basis in COPD patients (defined using either criteria). Having health insurance with medication coverage increase the use of BDs.\n\nLA-BDs are the cornerstone treatment for COPD and are recommended by different guidelines; however, the under-use of these medications have been reported in several populations  [8, 9, 12, 13] . The results of an audit of COPD diagnosis and management in primary care practices in the UK showed short-and longacting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting b-agonists (LABAs) had been under-prescribed  [8] . Practices varied substantially in prescribing LA-BDs. The proportion of patients prescribed LABAs ranged between 23 and 56% in different practices and between 9 and 25% for LAMAs  [8] . In a large COPD population from USA, Make et al.  [12]  found that more than two-thirds of COPD patients in the commercial population and 70% of the Medicare population were not prescribed any long-term maintenance COPD medications. A LA-BD was prescribed in 23.5% of the commercial population and 15.2% of the Medicare population  [12] . Using data of the Copenhagen General Population Study, Ingebrigtse et al.  [13]  reported that only 30% of the individuals with FEV 1 < 60% were treated with any type of medication during the year before the baseline examination: of these, 16.5% received a SA-BD, 21.4% received a LA-BD, and 19.3% received an inhaled CS (ICS). An analysis of real-life treatment patterns of COPD in a large UK primary care database showed that a small proportion of patients across all GOLD groups were using LABA or LAMA monotherapy in the total COPD population (1.8% and 7.9%, respectively) and GOLD stage 2 subset (2.0% and 8.2%; respectively)  [9] . The use of any type SA-BD was reported in 12.5% of the total COPD population  [9] .\n\nNo information is available regarding the real-life BD use in COPD patients from primary care setting in Latin America. Data from the PLATINO study (a population-based study designed to determine the prevalence of COPD in S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City, Montevideo, Santiago de Chile and Caracas) indicate that only 36% of subjects with a prior medical diagnosis of COPD have received any type of bronchodilator in the past year  [16] . In addition, the study showed that the majority of patients used the medication based on symptoms rather than on a regular basis, and this finding was independent of disease severity  [16] .\n\nOur results are consistent with those reported in other populations from developed countries  [8, 9, 12, 13]  showing the underuse of LA-BD monotherapy as maintenance therapy in patients with COPD. These findings highlight the suboptimal prescription of COPD medications in some primary-care centres, particularly relating to the use of LA-BDs. These findings can be partially explained by the poor dissemination of guidelines information and implementation strategies for treating COPD in this setting, together with the low adherence to treatment guidelines among primary-care physicians worldwide  [9,11,18e24 ]. In addition, not having health insurance with medication coverage is another factor related to the under-utilisation of these drugs. A substantial gap between the actual medication used and the current guideline recommendations for the management of COPD patients will result in a considerable proportion of patients not being treated or not receiving the most appropriate medication. Failure to use BDs in agreement with treatment guidelines increases the burden of the disease, the inadequate control of the patients' symptoms and has  other important clinical implications, such as increasing the cost and the risk of exacerbations and hospitalisation  [25] . In light of these results, prescription of evidence-based therapies in COPD or the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines should be promoted and encouraged among primary care physicians in Latin America to improve patient outcomes and limit the risks and costs associated with the insufficient or inadequate treatment of the disease.\n\nWhen considering and interpreting the current findings, it is important to be aware of the following study limitations: not to generalise these results to all Latin American countries as the study was only performed in four countries, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay. These were the countries that finally accepted the invitation to participate and had availability of local resources to conduct the study. The centres were not randomised, so sites selection did not follow a representative sampling of national primary care practice. In addition, information on the level of prescribing in relation with local health system characteristics, accessibility, local regulations, and the impact of these variables on prescription patterns were not collected in the study, so these would be areas of interest to explore in future researches. Data on adherence have not been analysed, so it cannot be established whether the underuse of LA-BD is the result of suboptimal treatment or poor adherence to prescribed medications."

      "title": "5.. Conclusion",
      "text": "This is the first multicentre, multinational study to evaluate COPD bronchodilator use in the primary care centres in four Latin American countries. Our findings suggest that LA-BDs are frequently underused as regular maintenance therapy for COPD treatment in these centres and that the treatment received by COPD patients does not strictly follow the guidelines. They also show that having health insurance with medication coverage increases the use of BDs. Changes are needed to better transfer the current guideline recommendations for COPD treatment to primary-care physicians and to allow or facilitate access to this information, as well as medication coverage to patients with COPD."
