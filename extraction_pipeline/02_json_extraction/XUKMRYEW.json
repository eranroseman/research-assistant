  "title": "Drug consumption and futile medication prescribing in the last year of life: an observational study",
  "abstract": "Background: the last year of life for many older people is associated with high symptom burden and frequent hospitalizations. Hospital physicians have an opportunity to prioritize essential medications and deprescribe potentially futile medications. Objective: to measure medication consumption during hospitalization in the last year of life and the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) at hospital discharge. Design: retrospective chart review. Setting: acute hospital. Subjects: \u226565 years, hospitalized in the last year of life. Methods: medication consumption was determined by examining hospital Medication Administration Records. PIMs were defined using STOPPFrail deprescribing criteria. Results: the study included 410 patients. The mean age of participants was 80.8, 49.3% were female, and 63.7% were severely frail. The median number of days spent in hospital in the last year of life was 32 (interquartile range 15-59). During all hospitalizations, the mean number of individual medications consumed was 23.8 (standard deviation 10.1). Onein-six patients consumed 35 or more medications in their last year. Over 80% of patients were prescribed at least one PIM at discharge and 33% had \u22653 PIMs. Lipid-lowering medications, proton pump inhibitors, anti-psychotics and calcium supplements accounted for 59% of all PIMs. Full implementation of STOPPFrail recommendations would have resulted in one-in-four long-term medications being discontinued. Conclusion: high levels of medication consumption in the last year of life not only reflect high symptom burden experienced by patients but also continued prescribing of futile medications. Physicians assisted by the STOPPFrail tool can reduce medication burden for older people approaching end of life.",

      "text": "A hospital admission in an older person with end-stage chronic disease or progressive frailty is an appropriate time to review medications and goals of care  [1] [2] [3] . Large observational studies have shown that hospitalizations are frequent in the last year of life due to high symptom and illness burden  [4, 5] . Hospital physicians, therefore, have an opportunity to tailor medication regimens to the condition and prognosis of their patients and deprescribe potentially harmful or futile drugs.\n\nThe STOPPFrail criteria (Table  1 ) are an explicit list of 27 indicators to assist physicians with deprescribing decisions in frail older individuals with poor 1-year survival prognosis  [6] . The STOPPFrail criteria were developed by Delphi consensus of an expert panel comprising academic geriatricians, clinical pharmacologists, palliative care physicians, old age psychiatrists, general practitioners and clinical pharmacists. The tool is concise, has good inter-rater reliability  [7] , and is designed to be used by clinicians who commonly provide care for older people. The relevance and applicability of the STOPPFrail criteria Table  1 . The STOPPFrail criteria STOPPFrail is a list of potentially inappropriate prescribing indicators designed to assist physicians with stopping such medications in older patients (\u226565 years) who meet ALL of the criteria listed below: (1) End-stage irreversible pathology (2) Poor 1-year survival prognosis (3) Severe functional or severe cognitive impairment or both (4) Symptom control is the priority rather than prevention of disease progression\n\nThe decision to prescribe/not prescribe medications to the patient, should also be influenced by the following issues: (1) Drug adherence/compliance is difficult (2) Administration of the medication is challenging (3) Monitoring of the medication effect is challenging (4) Drug adherence/ compliance is difficult Section A: general A1: Any drug that the patient persistently fails to take or tolerate despite adequate education and consideration of all appropriate formulations A2: Any drug without clear clinical indication Section B: cardiology system B1. Lipid lowering therapies (statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrans, fibrates, nicotinic acid and acipimox) These medications need to be prescribed for a long duration to be of benefit. For short-term use, the risk of ADEs outweighs the potential benefits B2. Alpha-blockers for hypertension Stringent blood pressure control is not required in very frail older people. Alpha blockers in particular can cause marked vasodilatation, which can result in marked postural hypotension, falls and injuries Section C: coagulation system C1: Anti-platelets Avoid anti-platelet agents for primary (as distinct from secondary) cardiovascular prevention (no evidence of benefit) Section D: Central nervous system D1. Neuroleptic antipsychotics Aim to reduce dose and discontinue these drugs in patients taking them for longer than 12 weeks if there are no current clinical features of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) D2: Memantine Discontinue and monitor in patients with moderate to severe dementia, unless memantine has clearly improved BPSD (specifically in frail patients who meet the criteria above) Section E: gastrointestinal system E1. Proton pump inhibitors Proton pump inhibitors at full therapeutic dose \u2265 8/52, unless persistent dyspeptic symptoms at lower maintenance dose E2: H2 receptor antagonist H2 receptor antagonist at full therapeutic dose for \u2265 8/52, unless persistent dyspeptic symptoms at lower maintenance dose E3. Gastrointestinal antispasmodics Regular daily prescription of gastrointestinal antispasmodics agents unless the patient has frequent relapse of colic symptoms because of high risk of anticholinergic side effects Section F: respiratory system F1. Theophylline This drug has a narrow therapeutic index, requires monitoring of serum levels and interacts with other commonly prescribed drugs putting patients at an increased risk of ADEs F2. Leukotriene antagonists (Montelukast, Zafirlukast) These drugs have no proven role in COPD, they are indicated only in asthma (50) Section G: musculoskeletal system G1: Calcium supplementation Unlikely to be of any benefit in the short term G2: Anti-resorptive/bone anabolic drugs FOR OSTEOPOROSIS (bisphosphonates, strontium, teriparatide, denosumab) G3. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for osteoporosis Benefits unlikely to be achieved within 1 year, increased short-intermediate term risk of associated ADEs particularly venous thromboembolism and stroke G4. Long-term oral NSAIDs Increased risk of side effects (peptic ulcer disease, bleeding, worsening heart failure etc.) when taken regularly for \u2265 2 months G5. Long-term oral steroids Increased risk of side effects (peptic ulcer disease etc.) when taken regularly for \u2265 2 months. Consider careful dose reduction and discontinuation Section H: urogenital system H1. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors No benefit with long term urinary bladder catheterisation H2. Alpha blockers No benefit with long term urinary bladder catheterisation H3. Muscarinic antagonists No benefit with long-term urinary bladder catheterisation, unless clear history of painful detrusor hyperactivity Section I: endocrine system I1. Diabetic oral agents Aim for monotherapy. Target of HbA1c <8%/64mmol/mol. Stringent glycaemic control is unnecessary I2. ACE-inhibitors for diabetes Stop where prescribed only for prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. There is no clear benefit in older people with advanced frailty with poor survival prognosis I3. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) Stop where prescribed only for prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. There is no clear benefit in older people with advanced frailty with poor survival prognosis I4. Systemic oestrogens for menopausal symptoms Increases risk of stroke and VTE disease. Discontinue and only consider recommencing if recurrence of symptoms Section J: Miscellaneous J1. Multi-vitamin combination supplements Discontinue when prescribed for prophylaxis rather than treatment J2. Nutritional supplements (other than vitamins) Discontinue when prescribed for prophylaxis rather than treatment J3: Prophylactic antibiotics No firm evidence for prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrent cellulitis or UTIs Disclaimer (STOPPFrail) While every effort has been made to ensure that the potentially inappropriate prescribing criteria listed in STOPPFrail are accurate and evidencebased, it is emphasized that the final decision to avoid or initiate any drug referred to in these criteria rests entirely with the prescriber. It is also to be noted that the evidence base underlying certain criteria in STOPPFrail may change after the time of publication of these criteria. Therefore, it is advisable that prescribing decisions should take account of current published evidence in support of or against the use of drugs or drug classes described in STOPPFrail.\n\nto older people hospitalized in the last year of life has not yet been studied. The aims of this study were:\n\n\u2022 To determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), as defined by the STOPPfrail tool, in the discharge prescription lists of older adults hospitalized in the last year of life. \u2022 To measure medication consumption by older people while in hospital in the last year of life."

      "text": "We included people aged \u226565 years who were hospitalized for \u22652 days under general medical services in our institution in the year prior to death. The Hospital In-Patient Enquiry system (a national database of coded discharge summaries) was used to identify patients discharged between January 2013 to December 2014. When patients were admitted more than once during this period, a single hospitalization was randomly chosen as the index hospitalization. Patients who died during their index hospital admission and those discharged to a hospice, presumably in the final stages of a terminal illness, were excluded because the primary end point was to measure the prevalence of STOPPFrail-defined PIMs at the time of discharge. Deaths within 1 year of hospitalization were determined by accessing the Hospital Information System and an online death notification system ( www.RIP.ie ). In total, 603 patients were eligible for inclusion. We estimated that 50% of patients would be prescribed PIMs at discharge. Using a precision of 5% and a 95% level of confidence, we calculated that a minimum sample of 384 patients would be required for this study. To ensure an adequate final sample size, a random sample of 434 was generated using a randomization (RAND) function in Microsoft Excel\u00a9. The local Clinical Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol."

The prevalence of STOPPfrail-defined PIMs was measured by accessing the discharge prescriptions from the patients' index hospitalization. Disease burden and performance status at the time of hospital discharge were determined using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)  [8, 9]  and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)  [10] , respectively. The CFS is a 9-item scale and, in this study, we categorized patients into two groups: (i) those with scores of \u22657 (indicating severe frailty and/or terminal illness and therefore potentially eligible for the STOPPFrail tool) and (ii) those with scores <7 (indicating full independence, mild or moderate frailty). Medication consumption was determined by reviewing in-patient medication administration records from all hospitalizations in the last year of life. Medications that were prescribed but not consumed were not included, nor were nutritional products, blood products or intravenous fluids. A single ingredient constituted one medicine. For combination products, each ingredient was included as one drug as long as that ingredient was available as a medicine in the British National Formulary."

The principal characteristics of the decedents are summarized in Table  2 . The mean age of patients was 80.8 (standard deviation [SD] 7.9) and males and females were evenly represented. Polypharmacy was highly prevalent and the mean number of medications per patient at the time of hospital admission was 8.4 (SD 4.3).

Full implementation of the STOPPFrail recommendations for those with polypharmacy (defined here as \u22655 long-term medications) would have resulted in, on average, a 23% reduction in total medication burden.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This is the first study of its kind using recently validated explicit deprescribing criteria designed for application in the frailest older people. Our data show that older people in their last year of life receive high levels of polypharmacy, a quarter of which includes long-term preventive therapies which are likely futile. Hospital physicians need to (i) be able to recognize frailer older patients in their last year of life, and (ii) be prepared to deprescribe thoughtfully where appropriate, particularly long-term preventive drugs where benefit is unlikely to be realized. Symptoms at end of life are often complex. A large nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults in the USA reported that symptoms such as depression, confusion, dyspnea, incontinence, fatigue, anorexia and vomiting were all common in the last year of life  [11] . While improvements can usually be made regarding prescribing quality, high levels of medication consumption may be inevitable. This is important because the number of medications prescribed is the most important predictor of iatrogenic harm  [12] . The challenge for the prescribing physician is to strike a balance between controlling multiple symptoms and minimizing the inherent risks of polypharmacy.\n\nFull implementation of STOPFrail recommendations for hospitalized patients would have resulted in almost one-in-four long-term medications being discontinued. The process of deprescribing, of course, must be individualized and patients' preferences, clinical contextual factors and the potential for adverse drug withdrawal events given due consideration. Other deprescribing tools (e.g. CEASE  [13] , Good Palliative-Geriatric Practice  [14] ) are 'implicit' and demand that the prescriber balance risk and benefit of each medication. The real-world applicability of these methods to all but expert prescribers is doubtful. The value of STOPPFrail is that it is explicit, concise, easy-to-use, and, as we have shown, highly relevant to the practice of hospital physicians.\n\nRecognizing when people are in the final phase of life is key to operationalizing deprescribing. A 2012 systematic review by Yourman et al.  [15]  concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend application of any of the available prognostic models for older adults. Some degree of uncertainty when predicting prognosis seems inevitable. In this study, the majority of patients were severely frail and functional status has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in older people  [1, 15] . In addition, functional decline following hospitalization is associated with a poor survival prognosis  [16] . Perhaps then, it is patients who are severely frail at the time of hospital admission, and those who decline to a new frailer baseline despite adequate rehabilitation, that should be considered appropriate candidates for deprescribing.\n\nOur study has some limitations. Firstly, the experience described does not apply to the 18-29% of older people who are not hospitalized in the last year of life  [1, 4] . However, symptom, disease and medication burden are presumably less marked in this cohort. Secondly, we may have underestimated medication exposure and acute hospital care utilization because information about hospitalizations outside of our institution was not captured.\n\nIn summary, hospitalizations are common and drug burden is high in the last year of life and people are frequently discharged home with prescriptions for potentially futile medications. The STOPPFrail criteria are highly relevant and may assist physicians with deprescribing decisions."
