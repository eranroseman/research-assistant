  "title": "Effect of mobile text message reminders on routine childhood vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: The World Health Organization estimates that 29% of under-five mortality could be prevented with existing vaccines. However, non-consistent attendance for immunization appointments remains a global challenge to healthcare providers. Thus, innovative strategies are required to reach the last mile where technology could be effectively utilized to achieve better compliance with children immunization schedules. Therefore, the aim of the review was to systematically collect and summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of text message reminders on childhood vaccination. Methods: This review was conducted according to a priori published protocol on PROSPERO. A systematic literature search of databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane/Wiley library, and Science direct) was conducted. Eligibility and risk of bias assessments were performed independently by two reviewers. PRISMA flow diagrams were used to summarize the study selection process. Taking into account the level of heterogeneity, a random effects model was used and risk ratios with their 95% CI were used to present the pooled estimates. To investigate the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were also considered. In this review, publication bias was assessed statistically using Harbord test. Results: A total of 1771 articles were searched. Out of those 1771 articles, 558 duplicated articles were removed. About 1213 articles were further screened, and finally, ten articles met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that there is a significant effect of text message reminders on childhood vaccination coverage (RR = 1.11; 95% CI 1.05-1.17) with a moderate level of heterogeneity (I 2 = 64.3%, P = 0.003). The results from the Harbord test suggested that there is no evidence for publication bias (P = 0.340). Conclusion: This review highlights the potential benefits of incorporating mobile text message reminders into the standard management of childhood immunizations, especially in low-and middle-income countries. The frequency and timing of the text message reminders are also crucial in determining the effectiveness of text message reminders. Hence, mHealth interventions deserve more attention as a potential innovation to improve healthcare programs.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Vaccinations are widely regarded as one of the most costeffective public health interventions that help to reduce global child morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 29% of under-five mortality could be prevented with existing vaccines  [1] . However, vaccine-preventable diseases are still a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)  [2] .\n\nIn 2016, global vaccination coverage has stalled at 86% with an estimated 19.5 million infants worldwide not reached with routine immunization services. As a consequence of this continued failure to reach optimal immunization coverage, 1.5 million children die each year from vaccine-preventable diseases  [1] .\n\nThis high prevalence of childhood vaccine-preventable diseases can be significantly reduced through adherence to confirmed vaccination schedules. However, many barriers to vaccination compliance exist and the proportion of children who had not completed the vaccination program ranged from 23.3 to 76.3% in developing countries  [3] [4] [5] . The main parental barriers to vaccination include confusion and difficulty in tracking vaccination schedules, low parent knowledge about the benefits of vaccination, missing due dates, and fear of vaccinations' complications  [6] [7] [8] .\n\nA study in India found the reasons for infants missing vaccination are due to prior reminders not given (32.9%) and parent's forgetfulness (26.6%)  [6]  indicating that compliance to the recommended vaccination schedule is a challenge for healthcare systems. Thus, innovative strategies are urgently required where technology could be effectively utilized to achieve better compliance with children immunization schedules.\n\nThe increased penetration of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in health care offers an opportunity to strengthen the health systems  [9, 10] . Among the different ICT interventions, mobile phone-based (mHealth) text messaging has gained popularity and may be the key to penetrating hard to reach populations. Text message reminders provide a cost-effective method of relaying health information and reminders  [11, 12] . Evidence also showed that these demand-side interventions  [13, 14]  target characteristics such as forgetfulness in reducing dropouts from vaccination  [15] [16] [17] ."

      "title": "Justification for the review",
      "text": "Globally, non-attendance for immunization appointments remains a challenge to healthcare providers. In many countries, immunization coverage is low  [1] , routine immunization systems are weak, and the awareness of the community about the immunization program is low  [2, 18] . Though different strategies have been tried to increase the number of children vaccinated, there is a continued failure to achieve vaccination targets  [1, 10] .\n\nMaking well-informed decisions about how best to achieve and sustain high and equitable immunization coverage will depend partly on decision makers accessing the best scientific evidence about what interventions work and integrating this evidence into existing health systems. For any intervention to be adopted in a setting, it must be designed to meet the particular needs of the setting and in the magnitude that best addresses the needs. Although mHealth initiatives are found to be important in health care, its effectiveness varies with implementation context. Therefore, the increased drive to develop and scale-up mHealth interventions with the dynamic ICT environment demands the availability of robust and current evidence.\n\nWe set out to explore the evidence around the use of text messaging to improve childhood vaccination, and to our knowledge, found no published systematic review and meta-analysis so far on this topic to help guide decisionmaking. Therefore, this review would summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of text message reminders as compared to standard care on childhood vaccination for further public health interventions."

      "text": "Multiple established and emerging strategies have been implemented to foster vaccination coverage globally. Despite the vast investment of resources in improving vaccination coverage in LMICs, few studies are available to inform policy and decision-making on childhood vaccination. In this review, ten articles were included to estimate the best available evidence on the effects of text message reminders in increasing vaccination coverage among children less than 5 years of age.\n\nThe pooled estimate revealed that there is a potential for text message reminders to improve childhood vaccination rates. However, the included studies showed moderate heterogeneity, which could result from clinical differences across studies. The precise effectiveness of these interventions is likely to be influenced by numerous factors such as country setting and nature of the interventions used. We did not find any important changes in the level of heterogeneity when we investigated the effect by country setting and number of text messages sent. However, the level of heterogeneity became lower in studies with text messages sent on the due date of vaccination with statistically significant positive effect.\n\nSending the last text message reminder nearer to the vaccination appointment date was also found to be more important since tackling forgetfulness needs more recent information with immediate actions.\n\nWe found relatively lower effectiveness of text reminders in high-income countries, despite the much greater level of economic advancement and immunization infrastructure in these areas than low-and middle-income countries. Differences in study settings could explain some of the observed differences. For example, studies done in the USA were more likely to include participants who presented to healthcare facilities and thus had enough resources for healthcare access (facility-based studies). We used the GRADE approach to assess the level of confidence to be placed on the evidence for the effects of text message reminders on vaccination coverage  [19] . Randomized trials without important limitations provide high-quality evidence. However, in three of the included studies, the risk of attrition bias was high and in two studies the risk of blinding of personnel and participant was also high (Figure  10  in the Appendix). This led us to downgrade the quality of the evidence from high to moderate  [19] . In addition, the presence of moderate heterogeneity further downgrades the quality of the evidence to a low level. Low quality of evidence implies the likely effect of text message reminders on childhood vaccination coverage with low confidence on the estimates to be implemented globally.\n\nThe findings from our review are in line with the findings of other reviews done on vaccination uptakes among adolescent and pregnant women where text messages are found to be effective reminders  [13, 32, 33] . Stockwell et al. also presented a literature review of a broad range of health information technologies to improve vaccine communication and coverage and suggested that SMS is effective in improving vaccination uptake with the potential to penetrate large populations and relatively low cost  [12] . Text messaging was also shown to be effective in nonvaccination-related health conditions  [34] . The WHO has also reported that mHealth technologies are promising to strengthen health systems  [35] ."
