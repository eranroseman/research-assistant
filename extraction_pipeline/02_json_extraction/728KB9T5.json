  "title": "The DAILY (Daily Automated Intensive Log for Youth) Trial: A Wireless, Portable System to Improve Adherence and Glycemic Control in Youth with Diabetes",
  "abstract": "Blood glucose (BG) monitoring (BGM) is an important component of diabetes management. New wireless technologies may facilitate BGM and help to optimize glycemic control. We evaluated an integrated wireless approach with and without a motivational game in youth with diabetes. Forty youth, 8-18 years old, each received a handheld device fitted with a wireless modem and diabetes data management software, plus a wireless-enabled BG monitor. Half were randomized to receive the new technologies along with an integrated motivational game in which the participants would guess a BG level following collection of three earlier readings (Game Group). BG data, insulin doses, and carbohydrate intake were displayed graphically prior to the glucose estimation. The other group received the new technologies alone (Control Group). Both groups were instructed to perform BGM four times daily and transmit their data to a central server via the wireless modem. Feasibility of implementation and outcomes were ascertained after 4 weeks. Ninety-three percent of participants successfully transmitted their data wirelessly to the server. The Game Group transmitted significantly more glucose values than the Control Group (P \u03fd 0.001). The Game Group also had significantly less hyperglycemia (glucose \u054613.9 mmol/L or \u0546250 mg/dL) than the Control Group (P \u03fd 0.001). Youth in the Game Group displayed a significant increase in diabetes knowledge over the 4-week trial (P \u03fd 0.005). Finally, there was a trend for more youth in the Game Group to maintain hemoglobin A1C values \u05458% (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.06). Thus a pediatric population with diabetes can successfully implement new technologies to facilitate BGM. Use of a motivational game appears to increase the frequency of monitoring, reduce the frequency of hyperglycemia, and improve diabetes knowledge, and may help to optimize glycemic control.",

      "text": "I NTENSIVE diabetes management reduces the risk of long-term complications.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  Despite this recognition, diabetes remains a challenging disease requiring complex medical management by both the patient and family for successful outcomes. Essential to optimal management is frequent blood glucose (BG) monitoring (BGM).  [7] [8] 8] [9]  BGM helps with the daily decision-making of diabetes care around insulin dose adjustment, carbohydrate intake, and the safe integration of exercise, along with the means to improve glycemic control to prevent late complications. New technologies can serve as motivators to increase monitoring behavior.  10 For example, recent advances use microliters of blood to obtain glucose readings in seconds and include meters with extended memory capabilities that link to personal computers providing glucose trend data. Other computer-based or telemedicine-directed approaches offer diabetes education and support yielding behavior modification results similar to those found with person-to-person education.  [11] [12] 2] [13]  An interactive educational freeware diabetes simulator, AIDA (Automated Insulin Dosage Advisor), allows patients to graph glucose values, insulin doses, and carbohydrate intake to see how the components interact.  14 Pediatric patients, raised in the current computer era, are likely to adopt such new tools.\n\nUsing handheld technologies, we developed an integrated approach that includes BG data, insulin dosing, and carbohydrate intake to enhance the patient's and the family's understanding of diabetes management. The handheld technology incorporates data acquisition, management, and wireless transmission. Diabetes management remains a challenge because patients must consider prior glucose values, carbohydrate intake, insulin doses, and physical activity in addition to counter-regulatory hormonal fluctuations associated with growth and stress.  15 Although glycemic excursions are often poorly characterized and constantly changing, we chose to harness this randomness for the patients in the form of a predictive game called DiaBetNet\u2122 (Dimagi, Inc., Boston, MA) aimed at increasing understanding and attention to diabetes care. DiaBetNet is a handheld-based application able to integrate BG, insulin dosing, and carbohydrate intake data and provide the patient with an intuitive game to predict the next BG level.\n\nThe primary objective of the DAILY (Daily Automated Intensive Log for Youth) trial was to assess the feasibility of utilizing a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA), equipped with a wireless modem, BG data management software, and the diabetes motivational game DiaBetNet, to assist in the outpatient management of youth with diabetes. The second objective was to increase adherence to BGM aimed at optimizing control. We hypothesized that youth with diabetes would readily accept and utilize this new technology and that the participants randomized to the DiaBetNet game would maintain or increase their BGM frequency compared with a control group."

Youth were eligible if they were routinely monitoring BG levels, were not participating in another trial, and were receiving care at the Joslin Clinic in Boston. The participant and a parent/ guardian expressed a willingness to monitor BG levels three or four times daily, enter data into the PDA for 4 weeks, and agree to be randomized to either the Game or Control Group. The study was approved by the Committees on Human Studies at Joslin Diabetes Center and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and each participant and a parent provided written assent and informed consent, respectively. Eligible patients and families were approached sequentially over an 8-week period until 40 youth and parents agreed to participate."

The Game Group received the BG meter and PDA with data management software and DiaBetNet software, while the Control Group received the meter and PDA with data management software alone. Participants and families received instructions on the use of the meter, the PDA, PDA software, and the wireless modem. All participants were encouraged to check BG levels four times daily, upload their BG data from the meter to the PDA, enter insulin doses and carbohydrate intake into the PDA, and transmit the data wirelessly everyday.\n\nParticipants used the Accu-Chek Active meter and transferred their glucose levels by aligning the infrared port of the meter with the port on the PDA. With each glucose measurement transmitted, the participants could also enter their insulin dose and carbohydrate intake into the Accu-Chek Pocket Compass program where all values were stored on the PDA. Participants randomized to the Game Group were also instructed to access the DiaBetNet game daily.\n\nEach time DiaBetNet was opened, it would count the number of glucose, insulin, and carbohydrate values entered that day. After three BG results were entered and before checking a fourth, participants in the Game Group were prompted by DiaBetNet to predict their upcoming BG. DiaBetNet created a graph depicting the day's earlier glucose levels, insulin doses, and carbohydrate intake (Fig.  1 ), which provided an integrated display upon which to predict the upcoming BG. This prediction was stored in a separate database within DiaBetNet and compared with the actual glucose level after the BG was uploaded to the PDA. As reinforcement, the participant received a fixed number of points for playing the game, as well as a smaller number based on the accuracy of the prediction. This rewarded the monitoring behavior more than the accuracy of the prediction. In this version of DiaBetNet, participants played against themselves."

      "text": "Treatment of diabetes remains challenging and demands vigilance to achieve optimal control in order to reduce the risk of short-and long-term complications.  [1] [2] [3] 18, 8, 19  Recent data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications studies confirm the critical importance of early implementation of intensive therapy in order to achieve the greatest risk reduction in complication occurrence.  6, 20 Furthermore, intensive insulin ther- At study entry, six participants in the Game Group and seven participants in the Control Group checked glucose levels three or fewer times daily, while during the trial, only four participants in the Game Group and six participants in the Control group checked and transmitted three or fewer glucose results daily. b: Comparison of the distributions of glucose readings between the Game and Control Groups. There was significantly greater hyperglycemia (glucose values \u054613.9 mmol or \u0546250 mg/dL) among the participants in the Control Group compared with the Game Group (P \u03fd 0.001). There was no difference in the rate of hypoglycemia noted by glucose readings \u03fd70 mg/dL or \u03fd3.9 mmol between groups: \u03fd50 mg/dL or \u03fd2.8 mmol/L; 50-69 mg/dL or 2.8-3.8 mmol/L; 70-149 mg/dL or 3.9-8.2 mmol/L; 150-249 mg/dL or 8.3-13.8 mmol/L; 250-400 mg/dL or 13.9-22.2 mmol/L; \u03fe400 mg/dL or \u03fe22.2 mmol/L. a b apy with the avoidance of acute complications mandates routine monitoring of BG, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity in order to dose insulin most accurately. Patients with diabetes and their families quickly learn the importance of understanding BG patterns, but ongoing management of such dynamic physiology routinely becomes burdensome. This is compounded by the fact that young patients may not sense the urgency for tight control since significant pathology may take years to develop. Thus, we need approaches that motivate and reinforce with patients and their families the importance of ongoing monitoring and attention to diabetes management.\n\nIn the DAILY trial, we evaluated new PDA software and technology along with a novel predictive game to see if such technology could help children with diabetes and their families to monitor BG levels, better understand glycemic excursions, and adopt healthier behaviors. The system's multiple components integrated data acquisition, management, presentation, and transmission. Participants could wirelessly transfer their BG data from the infrared port of the meter and manually input insulin and carbohydrate data to the Accu-Chek Pocket Compass diabetes management software on the PDA. The DiaBetNet software encoded within the PDA accessed for graphical depiction the BG values, insulin doses, and carbohydrate intake and then captured the participants' guesses as to the next BG level. Finally, via the modem affixed to the PDA, all data were transmitted to the secure central server.\n\nPatients between the ages of 8 and 18 years and their families appeared well suited for wireless, PDA technology solutions, and this pilot confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of such an integrated approach, independent of age and gender. Apart from one participant who lived outside the range of the wireless network, another who withdrew for family reasons, and a third who never attempted transfer, all participants successfully transmitted data wirelessly.\n\nIn our pediatric participants, the DiaBetNet game compared with a control condition appeared to increase the frequency of BGM, decrease the occurrence of BG levels in the hyperglycemic range, provide for a greater ac-quisition of diabetes knowledge, and begin a trend towards more optimal glycemic outcomes. There may be several reasons to account for the increased monitoring and decreased hyperglycemia in the Game Group. The participants in the Game Group had a qualification criterion to check their glucose levels at least three times daily in order to play the game. Then, prior to data transmission, they had to check a fourth BG. Alternatively, frequent BGM might have served as a strategy for more accurate predictions because availability of more BG results may have provided greater opportunity for self-correction. This improved selfcorrection may have helped reduce the occurrence of hyperglycemia in the Game Group.\n\nThe significantly lower carbohydrate intake reported by Game Group participants checking BG four or more times daily compared with Control Group participants checking BG four or more times daily may have also contributed to the lower frequency of hyperglycemia in the Game Group. While both groups could enter carbohydrate intake, only those in the Game Group could view the DiaBetNet graph that displayed BG, insulin doses, and carbohydrate intake together to illustrate the influence of the variables upon one another and their impact upon glycemic excursions to aid in the prediction of an upcoming glucose level. The influence of carbohydrate intake on glucose levels graphically displayed may have prompted participants to alter their eating patterns with the ingestion of fewer carbohydrates. Without baseline information on carbohydrate intake, we were unable to assess change in intake during the trial. In general, carbohydrate intake significantly impacts postprandial glycemic excursions in patients with diabetes and, in turn, contributes to overall control and HbA1C.  17, 21 ogether, the increased frequency of BGM, reduced occurrence of hyperglycemia, and lower carbohydrate intake may have helped to maintain the distribution of HbA1C values in the Game Group compared with a trend towards worsening in the Control Group.\n\nComputer and Internet applications can be responsive as demonstrated in a recent randomized trial of an Internet-based weight loss program in adults at risk for type 2 diabetes.  22 The addition of weekly behavioral counseling and feedback via e-mail resulted in greater weight loss over a 1-year period than the Internet weight loss program without the additional feedback.  22 Other recent Internet-based interventions in adults with diabetes demonstrated equivalent efficacy of Internet-based education applications compared with face-to-face education,  11  as well as equivalent effects of Internetbased diabetes self-management training with and without a behavioral intervention.  12, 13 The latter study highlighted the difficulties in sustaining Internet usage over time.\n\nOur DAILY trial demonstrated how customized PDAs equipped with a wireless modem, data management software, and a BG predictive game could be used as an effective and feasible means of collecting high-quality data over time. The portability of the PDAs and the independence from any required computing infrastructure seems to have supported high usability. On the other hand, a weakness of our study is its brief duration. It is important to assess if the interest expressed in the new technologies by the participants and families wanes over time. The short-term nature of DAILY requires follow-up investigations of longer duration in order to validate and document any sustained impact on adherence, increased BGM frequency, and improved glycemic control. With improvements in wireless access and portable electronic devices, including integrated cell phone technologies, additional opportunities exist to increase interactions between healthcare providers and patients with directed feedback based upon transmitted data. In the future, the richness of such data can drive the development of computer-based algorithms that alert care providers when deviations in observed patterns arise.\n\nIn the current trial, parents of youth with diabetes appeared to appreciate the technologic support. The electronic transfer of data, in particular, may aid the parents' efforts to support diabetes management since parents are generally the ones who tabulate their child's glucose data and insulin dosing. Such technologies would certainly support the recent trend to encourage family-based teamwork in the implementation of diabetes treatment programs in youth throughout childhood and adolescence.  8, 9, 23 The opportunity for these technologies to increase and maintain attention to dia-betes management tasks by pediatric patients and their parents, particularly with respect to adherence to BGM, warrants additional study. Additional studies of longer duration can also aid in the identification of the mediators of improved adherence and glycemic control since the current pilot investigation cannot confirm whether the graphical display of insulin, carbohydrates, and BG levels or the DiaBetNet guessing game, or both, provides the motivation for behavior change.\n\nYouth with diabetes and their families seem eager to try innovative approaches to optimizing control. While acceptance of some interactive technologies have been slow in general,  24, 25  additional opportunities exist, particularly in the realm of mobile phones.  26 In time, the progress of miniature physiological sensors will likely make the accurate prediction of and reaction to glycemic excursions easier. Nonetheless, such innovations will continue to require the engagement of the patient and the family in order to reap the benefits of improvements in care on the reduction in acute and chronic adverse outcomes. Motivational approaches such as the Di-aBetNet game may help to empower patients, families, and healthcare providers."

There was no difference in the rate of hypoglycemia noted by glucose readings \u03fd70 mg/dL or \u03fd3.9 mmol between groups: \u03fd50 mg/dL or \u03fd2.8 mmol/L; 50-69 mg/dL or 2.8-3.8 mmol/L; 70-149 mg/dL or 3.9-8.2 mmol/L; 150-249 mg/dL or 8.3-13.8 mmol/L; 250-400 mg/dL or 13.9-22.2 mmol/L; \u03fe400 mg/dL or \u03fe22.2 mmol/L."
