  "title": "Running Head: Walking-based interventions Can implementation intentions and text messages promote brisk walking? A randomized trial",
  "abstract": "Objective: To test the efficacy in promoting brisk walking of two theory-based interventions that incorporate implementation intentions and text message (SMS) reminders directed at either one\"s walking related plans or goals. Design: Participants (N=149) were randomized to one of three conditions (implementation intentions + SMS plan reminder; implementation intention + SMS goal reminder; control) before completing measures at baseline and follow-up four weeks later. At follow-up, the experimental groups were given a surprise recall task concerning their plans. All participants took an equivalent goal recall task. Outcome Measures: Validated self-report measures of physical activity and measures of implementation intention and goal recall, weight and waist-to-hip ratio. Results: Both intervention groups increased their brisk walking relative to the control group, without reducing other physical activity. The goal reminder group lost most weight. The plan reminder group recalled more of their plans than the goal reminder group but the latter were more successful in goal recall. Conclusion: Both interventions can promote brisk walking in sedentary populations. Text messages aid the recall of, and could enhance interventions that target, implementation intentions and goals.",

      "text": "Being physically active through behaviors that include brisk walking  (Manson et al., 2002) , is associated with potential health (e.g.,  Kohl, 2001)  and psychological (e.g.,  Brownley et al., 2003)  benefits. Consequently guidelines across the world tend to recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most days of the week (e.g., Department of Health  UK, 2004) . However, many adults in Europe (Office for National  Statistics, 2006a ) and the US  (USDHHS, 1996)  have sedentary lifestyles failing to meet these or similar guidelines. There is a need, therefore, to develop effective interventions that can be delivered efficiently across large populations. Within this contribution, we present a test of two technology-based minimal interventions that attempt to promote brisk walking in individuals that were not meeting physical activity guidelines prior to intervention."

      "title": "Theoretical Basis",
      "text": "Ample literature has shown the so-called \"intention-behavior gap\" whereby individuals fail to enact behaviors despite holding positive intentions (e.g.,  Sheeran, 2002) . Sheeran, Milne, Webb, and Gollwitzer (2005)  argue that failing to supplement one\"s intentions (e.g., to walk briskly) along with details regarding when, where and how the intention can be fulfilled (e.g., \"Every weekday morning at 8.30am I will leave my house and walk briskly to work\") contributes to intention-behavior discrepancies. Gollwitzer\"s (1993)  implementation intentions deal directly with this issue by requiring individuals to decide in advance of action, when and where they will act. They have been proposed to influence behavior by, first, increasing the accessibility of the mental representation of the anticipated environmental cue (leaving the house on weekday mornings at 8.30am) so that fewer good opportunities to act pass by unnoticed (see  Aarts, Dijksterhuis, & Midden, 1999) . Second, implementation intentions strengthen the link between the planned situation (leaving the house) and the goal-directed response (walking to work) such that behavior is more likely to be initiated upon encountering the planned situation (see  Webb & Sheeran, 2007) .\n\nAs some studies have reported null effects of implementation intentions, strategies to enhance their efficacy need to be tested. Prestwich, Perugini, and Hurling (2008a)  have demonstrated that pairing implementation intentions with text messages strengthen their effects on physical activity but as the type of text message (plan versus goal reminders) that participants received was not manipulated it is not clear which type of reminder would be the most effective.\n\nIt is likely that, when paired with implementation intentions, reminders of one\"s plans or goals that underlie the particular behavior are likely to both be effective in changing behavior.\n\nPlan reminders should further increase the accessibility of the environmental cue (as the individual is reminded of this cue) or prompt an individual to implement their plan (as the individual is reminded of the association between the cue and their desired action), or both. This is consistent with the role of cues to action in the Health Belief Model (e.g.,  Strecher & Rosenstock, 1997)  as an important modifying factor influencing the likelihood of enacting health behaviors. Literature on automaticity (e.g.,  Aarts, & Dijksterhuis, 2003)  would suggest that text message reminders of one\"s goals can also facilitate action via environmental cues. Within  Kruglanski et al. (2002, p.333 ) Theory of Goal Systems, \"goal systems consist of mentally represented networks wherein goals may be cognitively associated to their corresponding means of attainment and to alternative goals\" and \"typically, facilitative links may exist\u2026between goals and their corresponding means\". Text message reminders of one\"s reasons (goals) for performing a behavior should strengthen the link between goals and behavioral intentions (and their associated plans) within a mental hierarchy (see  Kruglanski et al., 2002; Prestwich et al., 2008b) .\n\nThus, text reminders of one\"s goals, following implementation intention formation, should prompt intention activation and their associated plans via the cognitive hierarchical structure.\n\nWhen brought to mind at an opportune moment, intentions should be particularly predictive of behavior (e.g.,  Cooke & Sheeran, 2004) . Moreover, activating one\"s goals in conjunction with an implementation intention has been shown to be useful in changing health behavior  (Prestwich, Ayres, & Lawton, 2008) . Interestingly, recent evidence has shown that the mechanisms underlying the influence of implementation intentions and goal activation are separable and both contribute additively to action execution  (Miles & Proctor, 2008) . In the present context, this might suggest that reminder cues of one\"s own plans and of one\"s underlying goals can both increase the likelihood of action execution and do so via relatively independent mechanisms."

      "title": "Technology and Health Behavior Change",
      "text": "Using technology such as the internet or mobile phones to deliver behavioral interventions has a number of benefits. The use of mobile phones in young adults is widespread (Office for National Statistics, 2006b) and represents a means through which health behavior can be influenced at any time without the need for face-to-face interaction.\n\nRecently, van den Berg, Schoones and Vliet Vlieland (2007) identified 10 randomized controlled trials that used the internet to try to change physical activity. Of these studies, 3 tested the efficacy of an internet-based intervention against a waiting list or attention-control group and 2 of these 3 studies achieved greater behavior change with the internet-based strategy.\n\nFurther evidence has shown that a combined internet and mobile phone-based intervention, comprising tailored feedback, tailored solutions to perceived barriers, motivational tips, self-monitoring and implementation intentions with SMS text message reminders, significantly increased physical activity relative to a control group  (Hurling et al., 2007) . While effective, the number of techniques utilized within the intervention made it unclear which components are effective. A study by  Prestwich et al. (2008a)  suggested that pairing implementation intentions with text messages represents a key intervention component and consequently that SMS text messages could be useful reminders when paired with plans. Prestwich et al. (2008a)  randomly allocated participants to one of five conditions (implementation intentions + SMS, implementation intention only, SMS only, or one of two control groups). The implementation intention + SMS condition reported the greatest increases in exercise behavior, whereas neither implementation intention only nor SMS only were effective.\n\nWithin the SMS groups, participants were required to receive text messages but they were free to choose their own message content. However, it was suggested that they might choose reminders of their plans. The participants that received these text reminders of their plans increased their exercise more than those that chose different messages. However, without a direct experimental manipulation of the type of message received by those forming implementation intentions, it is difficult to make firm conclusions. First, the participants that followed the request to have texts reminding them of their plans might have been different (e.g., more motivated) than those that did not. Second, text messages cueing implementation intentions were compared against any other type of text messages, not just those cueing one\"s exercise goals. It is not clear, therefore, whether text messages cueing one\"s plans are more effective than texts cueing one\"s goals. A third limitation, like many of the studies included in  Gollwitzer and Sheeran\"s (2006)  review of implementation intentions, key study personnel were not blinded to condition using mechanisms such as sealed envelopes. Methodological limitations regarding blinding, along with insufficient details regarding randomization and concealment methods compromise any conclusions regarding implementation intention effectiveness and some recent rigorous trials have reported null effects (e.g.,  Rutter et al., 2006) . Further rigorous tests are needed. Here, we address these issues through a methodologically rigorous test of implementation intention-based interventions.\n\nThis trial compared interventions incorporating implementation intentions and either text message reminders of plans or brisk walking goals against a control group that were simply asked to try to meet governmental physical activity guidelines."

      "title": "Summary & Objectives",
      "text": "Recent evidence suggests that pairing an implementation intention with reminders delivered using text messages (SMS) is more effective than either implementation intentions or SMS alone, or no intervention  (Prestwich et al. 2008a ) but it is unclear whether the benefits of these interventions vary due to the specific content of the SMS (plans vs. goals). Reminders of implementation intentions might ease the likelihood that the plan is mentally accessible and thus useable  (Prestwich et al., 2008a) . Due to the fusion of goals and means within a mental represented network  (Kruglanski et al., 2002) , reminders of goals should activate the means through which they can be achieved (i.e., behavioral intentions and/or implementation intentions).\n\nThe primary objective was to test whether interventions that paired implementation intentions with text messages cueing plans or goals increased brisk walking in a student-based sample. Effective strategies promoting physical activity in university students are important because at this stage of life, most students have often just moved from a period of structured and supervised exercise in the form of physical education classes at school. A secondary objective was to check that any increase in walking arising from the manipulation did not have a negative compensatory effect on other physical activity. Additionally, we tested whether text reminders of plans and goals aided their recall in a surprise recall task at follow-up. If text reminders strengthen the mentally represented association between the stimulus and response, those receiving text reminders of one\"s plans should be more successful in their recall of plans.\n\nParticipants that formed implementation intentions and were reminded either of their plans or goals should increase their brisk/fast walking (hypothesis 1) and physical activity (of at least moderate intensity, hypothesis 2), lose weight (hypothesis 3a) and reduce their waist-to-hip ratio (hypothesis 3b) significantly more than those in the control group. Moreover, those in the plan reminder condition should recall their plans significantly more than those in the goal reminder condition (hypothesis 4) and those in the goal reminder condition should recall their goals significantly more than those in the plan reminder or control groups (hypothesis 5). While we did not hypothesize differences between the plan reminder and goal reminders in brisk walking/physical activity such differences were explored."

On the basis of this allocation sequence, research staff member 2 placed the relevant study materials in a series of numbered and sealed envelopes.\n\nThese envelopes were passed to research staff member 3 who met the participants. Participants opened the envelopes in individual cubicles away from research staff. Upon completion of the study materials, participants sealed their completed measures in other envelopes. Consequently, research staff member 3 was blinded to condition during the testing phase.\n\nAll participants were asked, in writing, to try to be active (as defined by governmental guidelines). Furthermore, to minimize the risk of contaminating the experimental manipulations, the need to refrain from communicating with other people about the study was stressed to all participants. Participants (by not discussing the trial with others), the persons entering the data (research staff members 5 and 6, by receiving only the dependent measures), and the data analyst (research staff member 7, by receiving information regarding the study groups coded by number rather than name), were blinded to condition."

Furthermore, they were told they did not meet these guidelines. It was suggested that brisk walking was a good means to help them reach these targets and they were then explicitly asked to try to walk for at least 30 minutes on 5 or more days per week (in bouts of at least 10 minutes)."

They then stated the day(s) and time(s) that they would like to receive text message reminders of these plans. They were required to receive at least one text message reminder of each plan. Finally, participants had to note down a username and password that would enable them, if they desired, to log onto a website to change the content of the text message reminders, the number of text message reminders that they receive or when these text messages are delivered.

      "title": "Measurement of Outcomes",
      "text": "All self-report measures were completed within individual cubicles in the laboratory.\n\nParticipants\" physiological measures were taken in the laboratory. Participants in each condition completed the behavior measure pre-manipulation and at 4-weeks follow-up. The physiological measures were also taken at baseline and follow-up. Participants also completed a range of psychosocial measures from the Extended Model of Goal-Directed Behavior (EMGB;  Perugini & Conner, 2000) . Within these measures, all participants were required to identify one goal that would best explain their walking briskly for 5 days/week over the next 4 weeks. These measures are not discussed further.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure. A self-report index of walking was taken from Prestwich, Perugini, and Hurling\"s (2008c) validated Self-report Walking and Exercise Tables  (SWET)  measure. The SWET demonstrated the best predictive validity (r = .52 distance traveled; r = .48 number of steps recorded), in relation to physical activity recorded by a validated pedometer (Yamax SW-200), out of nine measures of physical activity such as the Godin scale  (Godin & Shepherd, 1985 ; average r = .42 across the two criterion outcomes), short-version IPAQ  (Craig et al., 2003 ; average r = .43) and 7-day PAR  (Sallis et al., 1985 ; average r = .07). The Yamax pedometer range has consistently performed favourably against other available pedometers (e.g.,  Schneider et al., 2003; Schneider et al., 2004)  and has been used to validate other pedometers  (De Cocker, Cardon, & Bourdeaudhuij, 2006) . The SWET was also less likely that some alternatives (e.g., LWQ, Stovitz,  Van Wormer, Center & Bremer, 2005)  to produce missing data.\n\nThe walking sub-scale of the SWET requires participants to note in a table the journeys that they had walked during the last week; the days in which they made these journeys, the duration of each journey, and the speed of each walk (categorised as: a=slow pace (i.e. less than 3mph); b=steady average pace; c=brisk pace; d= fast pace (i.e. over 4mph)). In line with the main aim of the research, the frequency of brisk walking was added to the frequency of fast walking to generate an index of walking frequency. In line with government guidelines and the aims of the study, from this table the number of days in a week where a participant did brisk or fast walking for 30 minutes or more (in bouts of at least 10 minutes) was calculated and represented the primary outcome. In the same validation study described above  (Prestwich et al., 2008c) , the walking sub-scale of the SWET also demonstrated predictive validity (being significantly correlated with distance traveled r = .44 and number of steps recorded r = .39).\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures. Total physical activity was assessed using the full-version of the SWET. The full version involves both the walking sub-measure and a second table pertaining to non-walking physical activity. Within this table, participants were required to note the exercise, the days in which they did this exercise, and the duration of each exercise session (in minutes) during the last week. Similar to the primary outcome, the secondary outcome reflected the number of days in which participants exercised (including brisk and fast walking) for at least 30 minutes (in bouts of at least 10 minutes). By measuring this, we could determine whether any increase in brisk/fast walking occurred at the expense of other exercise. Physiological outcomes, while not necessarily indicative of physical activity, were recorded due to their association with health outcomes. Participants\" height, weight, waist size and hip size were measured by a researcher (number 3) blinded to condition. From these measures, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. To measure participants\" height, participants removed their shoes and stood straight, feet together, flush against a wall-chart. A pen was then placed horizontally on the participants\" head to obtain the height reading. Participants then emptied their pockets, removed any excess clothing (e.g., sweatshirt), for their weight and waist/hip size measures. With their shoes still removed, participants stood still on an electronic scale, until a steady reading was shown, to assess their weight. Their waist and hip size were then recorded using a tailors\" tape measure while the participants stood, feet together, with the readings taken at the narrowest (waist) and widest (hips) points. All measures were taken once by a researcher trained beforehand by a researcher experienced in taking these physiological measures. No steps were taken to verify the accuracy of the measures (e.g., a percentage of measures taken by a second researcher and the results compared). However, the researcher was blinded to condition and thus any error in the measures should not have differed across the three conditions.\n\nAt 4-weeks follow-up, participants were given a surprise recall task. Participants in the implementation intention groups were required to list all of the implementation intentions that they had formed 4-weeks ago. Written instructions informed the participants that they should do this without looking at their phone. For each plan that they formed, up to 0.50 points were awarded for correctly recalling the planned situation and 0.50 points for correctly recalling the planned response (0.25 points were awarded where the response was partly correct-e.g., Monday morning in my house vs. Monday morning at work). Failing to recall the plan entirely, or writing new plans at 4-weeks follow-up (time 2), were each scored as zero for that particular plan. These series of scores for each plan were then mean averaged to produce an index reflecting the degree of implementation intention recall. This ranged from 0 (no recall of any plan) to 1 (full recall of all plan/s). This points system was chosen as it was more precise, and thus more powerful, than the alternatives (1. dropping the .25 points aspect; 2. coding each plan simply in terms of whether the participants successfully recalled the full plan (situation and response, or not)). All participants were asked to try to recall their brisk walking goal. For each participant, their goal recall was scored as 0 (did not recall their goal) or 1 (did recall their goal). Two independent raters showed almost perfect agreement on both measures (goal recall: \u03ba = .95; plan recall: r = .93) and any discrepancies were resolved prior to analysis."

      "text": "This study provides preliminary evidence that an intervention using physical activitybased text messages and implementation intentions can increase physical activity. Specifically, implementation intentions paired with SMS that either reminded the individual of their brisk walking plans or their reasons for brisk walking significantly increased, relative to a control group, the number of days that an individual self-reported brisk/fast walking for 30 minutes in bouts of at least 10 minutes (supporting hypothesis 1). This was achieved without significant reductions to other types of physical activity of at least moderate intensity (supporting hypothesis 2). Those receiving text message reminders of their plans did not lose more weight than those in the control group but those receiving goal reminders did lose more weight (reflecting partial support for hypothesis 3a). There were no differences across condition in waist-to-hip ratio (thus hypothesis 3b was rejected). Text messages targeting plans or goals aided the recall of plans and goals respectively (supporting hypotheses 4 and 5).\n\nThe study provides some suggestive evidence that implementation intentions might be incorporated within interventions that significantly change health behavior  (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) . Moreover, by blinding the experimenter and data analyst to condition, the risk of experimenter or interpretational biases are minimized. The significant effect of an implementation intention-based intervention conflicts in some ways with recent studies, of similar methodological rigor, which conferred no benefit of implementation intentions for health behavior change (e.g.,  Rutter et al., 2006) . However, it should be noted that the plans were paired with SMS and the primary outcome was based on a (validated) self-report measure. More research concerning efficacy and mechanisms is needed to build on these preliminary findings.\n\nImplementation intention and relapse prevention interventions  (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985) , also shown to promote physical activity  (Belisle, Roskies & Levesque, 1987) , are similar. Both establish action plans that are conditional on anticipated situational events. However, relapse prevention typically focuses on the maintenance of behavior change via action plans contingent on high-risk situations that could disrupt the desired behavior (problem-solving solutions).\n\nImplementation intentions typically focus on initiation of change via action plans contingent on critical situations that could enhance the likelihood of enacting the desired action. Future research could test whether combining these two approaches produces an additive change effect.\n\nWithout the inclusion of conditions that received only SMS text messages or were only asked to form implementation intentions, it is not possible to determine, solely on the basis of this study, the components of the intervention that caused the significant increase in physical activity. This is a common problem with randomized controlled trials. Health behavior change studies often comprise multiple techniques and are compared against interventions that lack at least two of the intervention techniques (see  Michie et al., 2008) . However, previous research has already suggested that both implementation intention and SMS components contribute to experimental effects  (Prestwich et al., 2008a) . This study reinforces the finding that this combined intervention is effective relative to a control using more methodologically robust controls. Moreover, benefits from combining SMS and planning manipulations can be achieved equally by reminding the individual of their specific plans or the goals underlying the behavior. Prestwich et al. (2008a)  suggested, but did not provide evidence, that text message reminders of implementation intentions might enhance the mechanisms through which implementation intentions change behavior (i.e. the accessibility of the mental representation of the planned situation and the association between the planned situation and response). In the study presented here, text messages aided the recall of implementation intentions. This might reflect that they strengthened implementation intentions by improving the accessibility of the plan and/or strengthening the stimulus-response link. The results are compatible also with additional theoretical mechanisms. Text reminders might act by increasing the likelihood of selfgenerated thoughts concerning the individual plans or goals  (Petty, Ostrom, & Brock, 1981)  that in turn could make them more salient and consequently cognitively accessible.\n\nIt is important to note that the level of plan recall was significantly correlated with changes in self-reported brisk/fast walking suggesting that being able to recall one\"s plan has some importance for behavior change. In this sense, the relatively low-rate of recall in the implementation intention + goal condition (i.e. the group without plan reminders) might explain why implementation intentions sometimes do not work. It could also undermine, somewhat, the mechanisms through which implementation intentions change behavior in real-life settings. The studies that have focused on implementation intention mechanisms have been conducted in the laboratory (e.g.,  Aarts et al., 1999; Webb & Sheeran, 2007)  and thus the generalizability within more real-life settings is not clear. If implementation intentions do increase the accessibility of the planned situation and the link between the stimulus and response to the point that it reflects features of automaticity such as immediacy and efficiency (e.g.,  Brandst\u00e4tter, Lengfelder, & Gollwitzer, 1997)  then people should consistently respond in the same way when encountering the same situational cues. Consequently, recall of their plans should be sound. This does not appear to be necessarily the case. The association between the planned stimulus and response can be strengthened, as indexed by superior recall following relevant reminders.\n\nThe effects of pairing implementation intentions with goal reminders also warrant discussion. Participants in this condition reported walking more than the control group and reduced their weight significantly more than the implementation intention + plan reminder condition. In light of the latter finding, the consequences of the interventions are unlikely to be determined purely by the formation of implementation intentions. Studies suggest that goals and intentions are linked (e.g.,  Kruglanski et al., 2002)  and that goals can moderate intentionbehavior relations  (Prestwich et al., 2008b) . Sending text reminders of one\"s goals at opportune moments should ensure the activation of behavioral intentions and also consequently moderate the likelihood of action (cf. Cooke & Sheeran, 2004) . As well as activating intentions to walk briskly, text messages by reminding individuals of their goals might also have activated other behavioral intentions (e.g., to do vigorous activity; to avoid snacks) that promote actions that indirectly influence weight. Further, activating behavioral intentions can also benefit the impact of implementation intentions as research has shown that for them to effect behavior change they should be supplemented by positive intentions (e.g.,  Prestwich et al., 2003; Sheeran et al., 2005) .\n\nThere are some limitations that should be noted. The study primarily used self-reports.\n\nHowever, to reduce the risk of social desirability or demand effects, all participants were asked to try to meet physical activity guidelines. Furthermore, the behavioral measure has been validated against an objective behavioral measure (i.e., pedometer) in a largely inactive sample that was comparable to the sample recruited in this study. Moreover,  Gollwitzer and Sheeran (2006)  reported that the effects of implementation intentions are similar when self-report or objective measures are employed. We also incorporated physiological measures and achieved significant change in weight though the effect sizes were only small-to-moderate. The data should be viewed as providing only preliminary evidence for the efficacy of this strategy in changing objectively-measured behavior. Although the study was appropriately powered to detect significant differences between groups, the sample size was quite small and consequently the 95% confidence intervals were quite broad. However, the effect size was similar to that obtained by previous research  (Prestwich et al., 2008a)  and employed a rigorous methodology.\n\nThe study was powered to detect significant effects rather than to make strong conclusions regarding null effects. Consequently, the non-significant difference between the two types of text messages should be considered in light of how the study was powered. The sample was mainly students thus the generalizability of findings to the general population is unknown.\n\nPromoting brisk walking produces important physiological benefit (e.g.,  Manson et al., 2002)  thus identifying effective interventions, delivered on a wide scale to increase brisk walking, is important. Some of the behavioral changes achieved from our interventions might require further maintenance to accrue measurable physiological change. However, they require fairly minimal intervention and are potentially deliverable without face-to-face interaction.\n\nTo summarize, we present a methodologically rigorous test of whether combining implementation intentions with text messages cueing plans or goals can significantly increase brisk walking. This study provides preliminary data supporting the efficacy of both strategies as indexed by a validated, self-report measure, relative to a control group. These interventions were quick to administer. These factors, in combination with widespread use of mobile phones, suggest that this approach could be effective and efficiently administered to a wider population of inactive adults. Footnotes 1 The primary outcome was also refined in a second measure where participants were requested to complete the SWET table on the basis of a typical 7-day period over the last 4 weeks. The results were very similar, F(2, 121)=4.01, p = .02. Both intervention groups reported more change in brisk walking than the control group (both p < .05)."

This might have been due to participants, in the written instructions for both implementation intention conditions, being requested to not use their mobile phones during the recall tasks. Even when the first set of participants (n = 3) or the first and second set of participants were excluded (n = 9), the effect remained significant, t(82)=4.82, p < .001, d = 1.06, 95% CI, d = .60 to 1.57, and t(76)=4.23, p < .001, d = 0.97, 95% CI, d = .49 to 1.50, respectively.
