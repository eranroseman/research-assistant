      "text": "Early ambulation is a core tenet of recovery after major surgery to prevent postoperative complications. Patients who maintain their mobility postoperatively have lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and fewer readmissions.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Although wearable activity monitors have been used to measure postoperative mobility,  1, 2  few studies have tested interventions to improve mobility.  4, 5 This randomized clinical trial sought to measure the effects of a gamified text messagebased program to help older adults meet mobility goals following radical cystectomy surgery."

      "text": "The Mobility and Outcomes for Validated Evidence for Urology Patients (MOVE-UP) randomized clinical trial enrolled participants undergoing surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania between November 2019 and September 2021 (protocol in Supplement 1). All participants set daily step goals and wore an activity tracking device (FitBit Inc) for presurgery baseline through 12 weeks after discharge. Following surgery, intervention patients played a mobility game with points for achieving daily goals and levels for weekly goals (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2).\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review board for the University of Pennsylvania. Each patient provided written informed consent. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04314778), and followed Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guidelines (eFigure in Supplement 2). All investigators and data analysts were masked to group assignments until analysis was completed.\n\nOur primary outcome was in-hospital change in mean daily steps after surgery and before discharge. Secondary outcomes were proportion of discharges to postacute care facilities, posthospital change in steps from week 1 to 12 weeks after discharge, and rehospitalizations after discharge. Significance for all analyses was 2-sided P < .05. Further details on analysis are available in eAppendix 2 of Supplement 2."

Forty-six participants (75%) received open approach procedures, and 26 participants (43%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No adverse events were reported.\n\nDuring hospitalization, 23 participants (15 control, 8 intervention) wore the activity tracking device for 2 or more days of step data before discharge; intervention patients had a nonsignificant increase in steps compared with control (adjusted difference, 689 steps; 95% CI, -541 to 1919 steps; P = .27) (Figure). Intervention participants had fewer discharges to a skilled nursing facility or subacute rehabilitation (0 of 8 participants) compared with control (5 of 15 participants)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This pilot study of a text-based mobility game played with a support partner demonstrated feasibility but did not significantly increase steps per day from baseline. Importantly, our results showed intervention participants returned to their preoperative baseline by week 5 postdischarge and continued to increase, whereas control patients had not returned to baseline by 12 weeks. Although we did not prespecify subgroup analyses, these results were particularly obvious for participants who experienced a larger decline from preoperative baseline steps. Future studies may wish to focus on time for return to preoperative baseline as the primary objective and consider targeting individuals with larger postoperative decline from preoperative baseline.\n\nLimitations include limited bedside study support during the in-hospital phase and small sample size. Greater bedside support could increase in-hospital adherence to protocol (wearing the device sooner after surgery) to assess the impact of the intervention before discharge. A larger sample would provide more power to assess significance of trends in postacute outcomes we observed (fewer discharges to postacute facilities and readmissions). Strengths include fully automated delivery of the intervention via text which was acceptable in this older population and feasibility of fully remote monitoring of steps after discharge."
