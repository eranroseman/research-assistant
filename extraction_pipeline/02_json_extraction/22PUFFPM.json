However, more than half of adults in the United States do not attain the minimum recommended level of physical activity to have these health benefits  (6, 7) . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many state public health departments have recommended the workplace as an environment to implement interventions to increase physical activity  (8 -11) . But evidence suggests that most workplace physical activity interventions are not effective, particularly for more sedentary persons  (12) (13) (14) .\n\nWorkplace wellness programs are growing in popularity throughout the United States, and more than 80% of large employers now use some form of financial incentive for health promotion  (15) (16) (17) . Beginning in 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act increased the proportion of employee health insurance premiums that can be used as outcome-based wellness incentives from 20% to 30% and as high as 50% if tobacco use is targeted  (18, 19) . This provides a signifi-cant opportunity to use incentive-based programs to change health behaviors, but the optimal design of financial incentives to increase physical activity has not been well-examined  (20) .\n\nBehavioral economics incorporates principles from psychology to help understand why persons make decisions that are not in line with longer-term health goals. Many persons know physical activity is good for their health but do not do enough of it. Instead, they often deviate from these goals in a predictable manner and from a common set of decision errors  (18, 19, 21) .

This design follows traditional economic principles in that it is largely transactional: A certain constant reward is promised for a predetermined effort.

      "text": "We conducted a 26-week randomized, controlled trial between 6 March and 6 September 2014, consisting of 13-week intervention and follow-up periods. A total of 281 participants gave their informed consent and were randomly assigned to a control group or to 1 of 3 groups with different financial incentive designs, each with the same expected economic value.\n\nAll participants were given a goal of achieving at least 7000 steps per day, and this target reflects several deliberate design elements. First, this level of physical activity is endorsed by the American College of Sports Medicine to be approximately equivalent to meeting the federal guidelines for the minimum recommended levels of physical activity needed to achieve health benefits  (25, 26) . Second, this level is 40% higher than the average daily step count of 5000 among U.S. adults  (27, 28) . Prior studies using an even higher goal of 10 000 steps have found that more sedentary persons may be less likely to participate, and it was a priority in this study to engage as many persons as possible  (12) .\n\nThird, instead of simply asking participants to increase steps, a minimum threshold puts greater emphasis on encouraging more sedentary persons to be physically active and less emphasis on getting highly active persons to be even more active.\n\nStep counts were tracked using the Moves smartphone application (ProtoGeo Oy), which uses accelerometers within the phone and has been shown by our prior work to be accurate  (29) . Each participant was given a unique personal identification number to enter into the smartphone application and verify permission that the study team could access step-count data. Once the application was installed on the phone, the participant never had to reopen it, although they could as often as they wished. Instead, participants had to allow the application to run passively on the phone, have the phone powered on, and carry it with them (for example, in a pocket or on a belt clip or arm band) while they were active. The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved this study."

For 26 weeks, participants in all 4 groups received daily feedback on whether they had achieved the 7000-step goal in the prior day. The control group received no other intervention aside from daily feedback. For the 13-week intervention, the intervention groups included a gain incentive in which participants received $1.40 for each day they met the goal, a loss incentive in which $1.40 was taken away from a monthly incentive ($42 allocated upfront) each time the daily goal was not met, or a daily lottery incentive. Persons in the lottery-incentive group selected a 2-digit number between 00 and 99. One winning number was randomly selected daily during the intervention period. If a participant's number had a single-digit match (an 18% chance), he or she won $5. If the participant's number had a 2-digit match (a 1% chance), he or she won $50. Participants were eligible to collect the reward only if the 7000-step goal was achieved on the prior day. Ineligible participants were informed what they would have won if they had achieved the goal, drawing on evidence that the desire to avoid regret can be motivating  (23, 24, 35, 36) . Incentives were offered only during the 13-week intervention, but daily performance feedback was delivered for the entire 26 weeks."

      "text": "One participant randomly assigned to the gainincentive group was later found to be ineligible because of enrollment in another physical activity study. One participant randomly assigned to the lotteryincentive group switched to a phone that was not eligible for use before the study began and therefore did not receive the intervention. Both of these participants were excluded from the analysis. All other randomly assigned participants were included in the intention-totreat analysis.\n\nFor each participant on each day of the study (participant-day level), we obtained the number of steps achieved as a continuous variable. Data could be missing for any day if a participant turned off the smart-phone or the application, disabled the study team's permission before data were accessed, or did not carry the smartphone at all. For the main analysis, we used only collected data (a step-count value was received). This approach is based on the assumption that missing data occur at random and do not bias outcomes for groups with differing levels of missing data. Using the continuous steps data, we estimated the mean daily steps among participants in each group during the intervention and follow-up. We dichotomized the data at the participant-day level to create a binary variable indicating that the participant achieved the 7000-step goal (value, 1) or did not achieve it (value, 0). Using this binary variable, we estimated the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal for the group of participants in each group during the intervention and follow-up and for each week during the study.\n\nFor adjusted analyses, we used PROC GLIMMIX in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), to fit a generalized linear model with participant random effects, a random intercept, time-fixed effects (at the weekly level), and treatment-fixed effects (by study group)  (37) (38) (39) (40) . We assumed a normal distribution for models using the continuous outcome and obtained the difference in steps among groups using the least-squares means (LSMEANS) command. We assumed a binomial distribution with logit link for models using the binary outcome to estimate adjusted difference in the proportion of participant-days achieving the goal and used the bootstrap procedure, resampling participants, to obtain 95% confidence intervals and P values  (41, 42) . We used a pseudolikelihood method  (38)  but also performed a sensitivity analysis for the main models using the quadrature approximation with 12 nodes specified  (43) .\n\nSeveral sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of our findings. For the primary and secondary outcomes using the binary and continuous variables, respectively, the main model was further adjusted by using device-fixed effects for smartphone type (iPhone or Android). The model was also evaluated by using all data and coding missing data (when a step value was not received) as \"not achieving the goal\" (in contrast to using only collected data), which is a method used in prior work  (33) . Further, evidence suggests that step-count values less than 1000 are unlikely to represent accurate data capture of actual activity  (27, 44, 45) . Therefore, to avoid these observations from downward biasing mean daily step outcomes, we did a sensitivity analysis using the model with values less than 1000 excluded from the sample.\n\nA priori, we estimated that a sample of at least 260 participants (65 per group) would ensure 80% power to detect a 0.20 difference between each intervention group and the control group. We used a conservative Bonferroni adjustment of the type I error rate with a 2-sided \u2423 value of 0.017. This calculation assumed that the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal in the control group would be 0.40. We increased Financial Incentives for Physical Activity in Overweight and Obese Adults ORIGINAL RESEARCH the participant enrollment target to 280 to account for a potential 8% dropout rate."

In all 4 groups, at least 95% of the participants completed the 13-week intervention and at least 92% completed the entire 26-week study. Participants had a mean age of 39.7 years (SD, 11.6) and a mean BMI of 33.2 kg/m 2 (SD, 5.6); 78% were women. Participant baseline characteristics were generally well-balanced across the 4 study groups (Table  1 ), with 183 participants (65.6%) using an iPhone and 96 (34.4%) using an Android. The percentage of participant-days on which step-count data were missing during the intervention was 15% for the control group, 10% for the gainincentive group, 18% for the lottery-incentive group, and 13% for loss-incentive group.\n\nThe mean proportion of participant-days that the 7000-step goal was achieved at the weekly level peaked at about 0.48 in the loss-incentive group, 0.42 in the lottery-incentive group, and 0.41 in the gainincentive group, but it was never greater than 0.33 in the control group (Figure  2 ). These levels decreased slightly toward the end of the intervention for all groups. Unadjusted mean estimates are displayed by group for the intervention and follow-up in Table  2 .\n\nAdjusted differences in the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal are displayed in Table 3.

For all outcomes, results of sensitivity analyses adjusted by device and using different methods of accounting for missing data were qualitatively similar to those of the main model (Tables  3  and  4 ).\n\nSensitivity analyses using the quadrature approximation supported the findings of the main models using the pseudolikelihood method for both mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal and mean daily steps (Appendix Tables  1  and  2 , available at  www.annals.org ).\n\nNo adverse events were reported during the entire study."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Employers are increasingly using workplace wellness programs to target health outcomes. Although the popularity of these programs is growing, the optimal design of financial incentives to change health behav-iors is uncertain. In this randomized, controlled trial using financial incentives to increase physical activity, we found that the design of the incentive significantly influenced outcomes. The gain incentive, in which an employee received a fixed amount each day he or she met goal, was no more effective than control. In comparison, a loss incentive, in which rewards were allocated upfront and taken away each day the goal was not achieved, resulted in a 50% relative increase in the mean proportion of time participants achieved physical activity goals.\n\nThese findings expand our understanding of using financial incentives to increase physical activity. A study by Finkelstein and colleagues (46) enrolled 51 adults and randomly assigned them to a control group in which each participant received $75 to participate or an intervention group in which each participant received $50 to participate plus $10, $15, or $25 more per week depending on their level of physical activity. The intervention group achieved 1.8 more hours of physical activity per week at an average cost of $17.50, but the study duration was only 4 weeks and there was no follow-up without incentives.\n\nA meta-analysis (20) evaluated the use of financial incentives to increase exercise adherence. Seven randomized, controlled trials were included in the final analysis. Although pooled results indicated that incen- Financial Incentives for Physical Activity in Overweight and Obese Adults ORIGINAL RESEARCH tives were effective, the optimal design of incentives was not well-evaluated. The weekly incentive ranged from $2.79 to $46.82, but most studies delivered incentives only at the end of the study. The authors of the meta-analysis concluded that the quality of existing evidence was poor and that they could not draw reason-able conclusions about the effect of incentive design on physical activity outcomes.\n\nIn comparison, our study had an expected value of $9.80 per week and incentives were designed to be delivered daily because persons tend to prefer immediate gratification rather than delayed rewards  (22) . 0.50 0.45 0.40 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 Week Intervention Control Gain-incentive group Lottery-incentive group Loss-incentive group Mean Proportion of Participant-Days Achieving the Goal Follow-up 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 * Participants in all groups received daily feedback through the entire 26 wk.

      "title": "ORIGINAL RESEARCH",
      "text": "Financial Incentives for Physical Activity in Overweight and Obese Adults Our findings add new insight and indicate that the same magnitude of incentives can have a significantly different effect on outcomes depending on how the incentive is designed. Specifically, financial incentives might be more effective if their design moved beyond a mere transaction and instead reflected predictable opportunities to enhance behavior change  (18, 19, 21) .\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that the workplace may be a good environment to implement wellness programs to target changes in health outcomes, such as increasing physical activity  (8) . However, there is some concern that these programs are not benefiting less healthy employees and instead simply increasing their cost burden  (47) . For example, programs that have been shown to be effective at changing behaviors among more seden-tary persons are lacking  (48 -50) . Evidence suggests that workplace interventions tend to better engage more motivated persons with higher baseline physical activity levels  (12) . However, those who may benefit more from these interventions probably have less motivation and lower baseline physical activity levels. In our study, employees had a mean BMI of 33.2 kg/m 2 , which is one indication that these participants may be more sedentary  (51) . Among the 279 participants who received the intervention, 269 (96.4%) remained in the study at 13 weeks. No financial incentives were provided during follow-up, but participants continued to receive daily performance feedback. By 26 weeks, 267 participants (95.7% of those who started; 99.3% of those who reached 13 weeks) remained in the study. These high engagement rates may indicate that the  Many employers have become more interested in using wearable and mobile devices in wellness programs  (52) . Based on our findings, a smartphone-based approach to data collection resulted in high engagement probably because it required little additional effort from the participants other than carrying the device (which they may already be accustomed to doing). Because more than two thirds of adults in the United States have a smartphone  (53, 54)  and these devices are accurate for tracking step counts  (29) , smartphones may be a more scalable method to deploy interventions that track physical activity. Although our findings show promise for the role of smartphones in monitoring behaviors, they also confirm the notion that these technologies must be combined with carefully tested behavior change strategies to effectively improve health outcomes  (52) .\n\nFuture studies might compare alternate methods of using loss aversion to design incentives and could further test the optimal magnitude and frequency. Insights from this study should be incorporated into evaluations of longer-term sustainability and may benefit from opportunities to incorporate social incentives, such as team-based designs that focus on peer support, teammate accountability, and unity toward a common goal  (52) .\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, participants were from a single employer in Philadelphia, which may limit generalizability because physical activity is harder in some regions with different climate, outdoor space, and culture. Second, participants needed a smartphone, which potentially makes participation less likely for those without such a device. Third, participants' physical activity was not tracked when they were not carrying their smartphones; thus, the captured physical activity levels may be lower than their actual activity. At the end of the intervention, however, about 93% of respondents stated that they carried their smartphone most or all of the time. Fourth, we did not obtain data on baseline step counts, but randomization resulted in well-balanced study groups. Therefore, outcomes among groups may reflect the differential effectiveness of interventions. In addition, self-reported physical activity did not differ among groups; however, these data seem to reflect overestimates of baseline activity because step-count data indicate that our population may be less physically active than they initially reported. Finally, our study was not well-powered to detect smaller differences or do comparisons among the intervention groups. In addition, the continuous outcome measure had a wider distribution than anticipated and we did not have enough statistical power to adequately detect differences among study groups.\n\nIn summary, more than half of adults in the United States do not attain the minimum recommended level of physical activity to achieve health benefits. Although the popularity of wellness programs and the use of mobile technologies to monitor health outcomes are rising, there has been a lack of rigorous study evaluat-ing their effectiveness and the optimal design of financial incentives had not been well-examined. Our findings suggest that the design of financial incentives is important and that incorporating insights from behavioral economics may significantly improve their effectiveness.
