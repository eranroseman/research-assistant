  "title": "Effect of gamification with a support partner to increase physical activity in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease: The STEP 4Life randomized clinical trial",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Physical activity is associated with reduced risk of cognitive and functional decline but scalable, sustainable interventions for populations at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD and related dementias (ADRD) are lacking. \n METHODS: A 12-week randomized-controlled trial was conducted with a 3-week follow-up using a national AD prevention registry (GeneMatch). The control group (n = 50) set step goals and received daily feedback. The intervention group (n = 44) also received a behaviorally designed game based on achieving step goals and reinforced by a support partner. \n RESULTS: Intervention participants (94 participants, mean age 70, 78% female) had greater change in mean daily step count than control of 1699 steps/day (95% confidence interval [CI], 1149-2249), P < 0.0001, which was sustained in the follow-up period at 1219 steps/day (95% CI, 455-1983), P = 0.0018. Carriers of the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 gene (high risk) did not perform differently than non-carriers; however, high self-reported risk perception was associated with higher activity. DISCUSSION: A gamified intervention was effective in promoting and sustaining higher physical activity in older adults at genetic risk for AD/ADRD.",

[1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  Unfortunately, population-level data from the last decade shows most adults in the United States do not achieve enough physical activity to obtain preventative health benefits.  7, 8 Innovative and scalable approaches that achieve sustained increases in physical activity have great potential to impact prevention of AD/ADRD.\n\nGamification is the application of game design elements in nongame contexts and is increasingly being used in digital health interventions to promote changes in health behaviors such as physical activity.  [9] [10] 0] [11] [12]  Behavioral economic (BE) principles can be used to design effective gamified interventions to facilitate behavior change  13, 14  including sustained increases in physical activity.  [15] [16] 6] [17]  BE principles include precommitment,  18, 19  loss aversion,  [20] [21] [22]  goal gradients,  23  and anticipated regret.  [24] [25] 5] [26] [27]  BE methods have been shown to increase physical activity in a wide range of at-risk groups including older adults  28, 29  and patients at risk for functional decline.  30 These principles, however, have not yet been applied to populations at risk for AD/ADRD.\n\nIn this study, we tested a behaviorally designed gamification intervention with adults at risk for AD/ADRD based on their age and genetic risk factors. We recruited participants from GeneMatch, a national registry for AD prevention research  31  and selected only those who already knew the results of their genetic testing (apolipoprotein E\n\n[APOE] \u03b54 status) to create a sample with 50% who have elevated genetic risk (APOE \u03b54 carriers) and 50% who do not have elevated genetic risk (APOE \u03b54 non-carriers). We hypothesized that participants who received the intervention would show increased physical activity during the 12-week intervention and that this benefit would be maintained during a follow-up period with passive monitoring. We also hypothesized that APOE \u03b54 carriers would have greater intervention uptake (greater change in physical activity during intervention and follow-up periods)."

Intervention participants received the same feedback from the FitBit device/application and also entered into an activity game with points and levels that was run automatically such that participants need only strive for step goals to play the game.\n\nThe entire game is delivered via text messages. Each day, intervention participants received text notifications from WTH on whether they met the step RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 1. Systematic review: Higher levels of regular physical activity among older individuals are associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD and related dementias (ADRD)-but sustainable, scalable approaches to increasing activity in this population are lacking. 2. Interpretation: A simple physical activity game using wearable activity monitors and text messages, informed by behavioral science, and played with a support partner, can significantly increase steps per day as well as brisk walking. Increased activity was sustained after the game ended and participants who perceived elevated risk of developing AD/ADRD had especially robust response. 3. Future directions: Larger studies with longer intervention and follow-up periods are needed to confirm the efficacy of gamification to increase activity in older adults at risk for AD/ADRD. goal and points gained or lost. At the end of the intervention period, text messages are stopped and participants no longer play the game.\n\nDuring the follow-up period, all participants (intervention and control) are passively monitored for FitBit step data via the WTH platform and at the end of the follow-up period, the connection with WTH is stopped.\n\nAdditionally, to increase participant accountability, sense of accomplishment, and overall engagement in this game we leveraged social networks. Participants in the intervention group only identified a family member or friend to be a support partner who was asked via e-mail at the start of the study to provide support and encouragement to the participant to help them achieve their activity goals. This partner received a weekly e-mail update report on participant performance including points and level. The effectiveness of gamification and social support to change behavior can be enhanced by leveraging behavioral concepts.\n\nGamification in this study was designed using several core principles from BE.  16, 17  First, participants in the gamification arm signed a precommitment pledge to strive to achieve their step goal during the study. Precommitment is a foundational concept for effective behavior change.  18, 19 Second, every Monday, the participant received 70 points (10 for each day of the week) which leverages the \"fresh start effect\"-the tendency for aspirational behavior around temporal landmarks such as the beginning of the year, month, or week.  36 On days when participants met their step goal, they received a congratulatory message the following morning, which provides immediate gratification. On days that participants do not meet their step goal, they receive a message on the following morning that they lost 10 points from their balance. This leverages prospect theory,  20  which asserts that loss aversion provides more sustainable motivation for behavior change than gain-framing.  20, 22 To avoid discouragement, messages about points lost end with an encouraging statement reminding them that today is a new day and a fresh opportunity to meet their activity goals. Third, at the end of each week, participants could move up a level (from lowest to highest: blue, bronze, silver, gold, platinum) if they retained 40 points\n\nor move down a level if they did not. This design creates achievable goal gradients (the notion that the next highest level is attainable), a sense of status with accomplishment, and progression through the game.\n\nFourth, participants started at the silver level so they could experience either the accomplishment of rising to gold or the loss of dropping to bronze upon completing the first week of the intervention."

      "title": "2.8. Statistical analysis",
      "text": "Previous studies have suggested that a small difference in daily activity (500-1500 steps/day) can have an impact on clinical outcomes including function, hospital admission, and mortality.  39, 40 A priori power calculations estimated that a sample of 100 participants allocated in a 1:1 distribution (50 in each arm), would ensure at least 80% power to detect a 1000 step difference. This assumed a baseline mean step count of 5000 steps with a standard deviation of 2500 steps, a 10% dropout rate, and a conservative Bonferroni adjustment of the type I error rate with a two-sided alpha of 0.017.\n\nNine participants were randomized to the intervention (gamification) arm but were not started in the intervention. These participants did not withdraw; rather, they got \"stuck\" at a protocol step between randomization and start of the intervention which was intended to be a \"pause\" for staff to check in with participants who did not complete a requested survey but instead was mistakenly coded a \"stop\" in the online research platform we used (WTH). Our protocol was for participants to start the intervention even if they did not complete all forms requested but this stop error in our platform was not recognized until after the study ended. All other randomized participants (including four who started the intervention period but dropped out) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. We also performed a per protocol analysis restricted to only the 90 participants who completed the entire intervention period (Appendix S3 in supporting information). For each participant on each day of the study (participant-day level), the number of steps achieved was obtained as a continuous variable. Data can be missing for any day if the participant did not use the wearable device or did not upload data. In previous work by our group,  16, 17, 22, 33  we have used imputation when missingness exceeds 15%. In this study, missingness was limited to 3.9% so we used original data and no imputations were performed. In addition to missingness, participant days with step values \u2264 1000 are often excluded from analyses (or imputed values used instead);  41, 42  however, in this study, we took a more conservative approach and used original data as only 1.3% of participant days were \u2264 1000 steps.\n\nSimilar to prior work,  16, 17, 33  adjusted analyses used PROC GLIM-MIX in SAS (version 9.4) to fit linear mixed effects models with a random intercept to adjust for participant random effects and to account for the repeated measures of daily step counts. Linear mixed models is an extension of linear regression, which allows us to model data with correlated observations such as repeated measures. It provides us with the ability to model within-participant and betweenparticipant variability and the deviation of participant-specific intercept (or participant-specific slopes) from the overall intercept (or overall slope). We applied this approach to model steps using the equation below:\n\nwhere Steps ij refers to Steps > 0 recorded for participant i at day j, i =\n\n) where b i refers to the participant random effect, which is the participant specific random intercept and\n\ne ). In the main adjusted model, we included baseline step count and fixed effects for calendar month and study arm. We assumed a normal distribution and obtained difference in steps between arms for the intervention and follow-up periods using the least squared means (LSMEANS) command.\n\nFinally, we performed analyses to explore the impact of risk perception on study outcomes. First, we conducted a priori subgroup analyses with a subgroup restricted to participants who are carriers of the APOE \u03b54 gene (both homozygous and heterozygous included). Second, we created a variable to capture participant perceptions of risk for developing AD based on their response to the question \"On a scale of 0-100, what do you believe is your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia by age 85?\"  43  We operationalized responses to this perceived risk question as an ordinal, three-level variable (low, medium, high). We repeated our main analyses with this variable as an interaction term. Given that age and retirement status varied significantly across these three levels of risk, we added age and retirement status to the main model described above."

These results from the APOE \u03b54+ subgroup (n = 50) were not significantly different from the results of the entire sample (N = 94). To further explore possible effects of APOE \u03b54+ status across the entire sample, we used APOE \u03b54 carrier status as primary independent variable in the same model used for the primary analysis. There was no significant difference in APOE \u03b54 carriers versus non-carriers in this model.\n\nWe also explored the impact of perceived risk of developing dementia independent of APOE \u03b54 carrier status. All participants were asked to rate their perceived risk of developing dementia by age 85 on a scale of 0 to 100. We grouped responses into low (score < 20, n = 19), medium (score 20-79, n = 69), and high (score \u226580, n = 6) categories of risk perception and applied as a categorical independent variable in the same adjusted model as the primary analysis (low risk as reference category). Intervention participants with medium risk perception had higher step increases compared to lower risk but this was not statistically significant (+647 steps, P = 0.064) while participants with high risk perception had significantly higher step increases compared to low risk (+1518 steps, P = 0.018). These effects persisted in the followup period for medium risk (+784 steps, 0.051) and high risk groups (+1831, P = 0.010). High risk perception participants were statistically different from participants in medium and low risk perception in the following ways: younger (68.3) compared to low risk (P = 0.03) but not medium risk (P = 0.2); higher baseline steps (6900) compared to low risk (4521) and medium risk (5470); and less likely to be retired (3 or 50%) compared to low risk (14 or 74%) and medium risk (58 or 84%)."

We also found that MVPA increased significantly from baseline for intervention group compared to control and persisted during follow-up. Finally, we found that participant knowledge of their APOE \u03b54 status did not appear to impact intervention uptake. Instead, participant perception of risk of developing dementia moderated higher performance for both steps per day and minutes of MVPA per day.\n\nPrevious trials using gamification and social support have successfully increased daily activity with the goal of reducing 10-year risk for cardiovascular events.  16, 17, 22, 33 To our knowledge, this is the first application of this method in a population at risk for AD/ADRD in the context of reducing risk of functional and cognitive decline. Given the older age (mean 70 years) of our population and lower baseline activity compared to prior studies using these methods in younger populations, the response to intervention in this study was robust and included signif-icant change in MVPA, which is not often present in other populations."

There is still uncertainty about which types of activity and what duration are most effective but it is clear that aerobic exercise with daily frequency is beneficial.  44 re recent studies have suggested that higher daily steps (9000-10,000 per day) and greater peak intensity (50-100 steps/minute) are associated with significantly lower incident dementia. While the Centers for Disease Control  37  and National Institute on Aging 45 recommend some degree of higher intensity exercise for older adults, they do not provide specific definitions for MVPA. We used a definition of 100 steps/minute to define MVPA, which is well established in a general adult population but may be a high bar for older adults, so the increase in MVPA we observed in our study may underestimate effort and health benefits. However MVPA is defined, implementation and sustainability will remain key challenges to increasing daily aerobic exercise at scale on a population level for older adults.

Again, the subfocus within our study on MVPA is particularly noteworthy as evidence continues to grow that a mix of aerobic and higher-intensity exercise may be even better than consistent daily aerobic exercise. Longer passive monitoring is needed to see if steps/MVPA persist but what is more important are long-term follow-ups on activity, function, cognition, and development of ADRD. This will be the focus of future study.\n\nThis trial leveraged a national registry of participants with knowledge of their genetic risk for AD. We required participants to know their APOE \u03b54 status specifically to enroll and reminded participants that APOE \u03b54 is a risk-increasing genotype upon enrollment. Our results did not support our hypothesis that APOE \u03b54 carriers would have greater intervention uptake than non-carriers, which may be explained by several factors. First, it may be that all participants in this cohort have elevated concern for developing AD/ADRD compared to the general population and thus APOE \u03b54 status did not impact behavior.\n\nSecond, there could also be ceiling effects given robust intervention uptake by all participants.\n\nOn the other hand, we observed significant within-group differences between intervention participants based on their perceived risk of developing AD. Those who perceived the highest perceived risk (> 80 on a scale of 0-100) had significantly greater intervention uptake (increase in steps per day) compared to those with intermediate risk perception (20-70) or lowest perceived risk (< 20). There were no high risk perception participants who reported living alone and the overall frequency of low income (< $50k), diabetes, or hospitalization in the last 6 months was low for the entire study population, which limits the ability to detect statistical significance between subgroups.\n\nTaken collectively, results from this exploratory subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution and viewed as hypothesis generating. It may be that high risk perception is more important than genetic risk (APOE \u03b54 status) for understanding responsiveness to interventions such as ours. High risk perception likely assembles a variety of factors such as age, retirement status, income, living alone, and health conditions. These hypotheses should be tested a priori in future studies with large and diverse sample sizes to investigate how comprehensive risk education including genetic and AD/ADRD biomarkers impacts participant engagement and sustained behavior change."

Strengths include novel application of gamification and social incentives approach to older adults at risk for AD/ADRD using a virtual platform with automation, which limits need for personnel costs and enables scalability on a national level.

See the Terms and Conditions ( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions ) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License This study also has several limitations. First, while participants were recruited from a national AD registry (GeneMatch), the demographics of this registry overrepresent White, female, and married individuals compared to the general US population in this age range, which may limit generalizability of our findings. Second, although we collected measures of functional and cognitive performance at the beginning and end of the study, the intervention period was not long enough to observe significant changes. Third, the brief follow-up period in this study (3 weeks) offers limited insight into long-term sustainability of physical activity gains made during the intervention. Fourth, although our analysis included all participants that started the intervention in our analysis (including four who dropped out), we did not include nine participants that were randomized but never started the intervention because no intervention data were collected from them. These participants were not significantly different than those included in the analysis but we cannot rule out that results may have been different had these participants been started and contributed intervention data for analysis. Future studies should include intervention periods with enough time to observe some degree of functional and cognitive decline in the study population that could be consistent with the development or progression of ADRD and should include longer follow-up."

      "title": "5. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "A remotely deployed, randomized trial of a gamified intervention played with a support partner was effective in promoting and sustaining higher physical activity in a national cohort of older adults at risk for AD/ADRD. In addition to increased steps per day from baseline, intervention participants also increased minutes of MVPA during and after the intervention. Participant knowledge of their genetic risk for developing AD (APOE \u03b54 carrier status) did not appear to impact intervention uptake; however, participants with higher overall risk perception for developing AD did have greater uptake compared to those with lower perceived risk. Future study of longer intervention and follow-up periods for gamified interventions with social support will be important to test scalability and sustainability at the population level. Risk education to motivate and sustain increased physical activity in populations at risk for AD/ADRD also merits future study."
