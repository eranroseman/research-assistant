  "abstract": "Question: Do text messages with or without financial incentives promote weight loss in men with obesity? Findings: In this randomized trial that included 585 men with obesity, text messaging with behavioral messages combined with a financial incentive resulted in a 5% weight loss at 12 months, compared to weight loss of 3% for text messaging alone and 1% for the control group. The difference in weight loss was statistically significant for the comparison between text messaging with financial incentives and the control group, but not between the text messaging alone and the control group. \n Meaning: In men with obesity, a 12-month intervention consisting of text messaging with financial incentives resulted in modest but statistically significant weight loss, compared to control.",

      "text": "Among men with obesity, a text-messaging with financial incentive intervention significantly improved weight loss, compared to a control group, while text messaging alone was not significantly better than control. These findings support text messaging combined with financial incentives to attain weight loss in men with obesity.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN91974895  https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN91974895 BACKGROUND Obesity increases rates of Type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, mobility problems and some cancers, and affects approximately 800 million people worldwide.  1, 2 Approximately 26% of UK adult men have obesity.  3 However, men are less likely than women to participate in weight loss interventions.  4, 5 Effective interventions to attain weight loss in men are needed.  6 havior change interventions delivered with text messaging can be effective and scalable components of weight loss programs. A systematic review that included 12 randomized clinical trials reported that text messaging-based weight loss interventions were associated with a mean weight change of -2.3 kg (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.2 to -1.4kg), compared to control.  7 However, in this systematic review, only three clinical trials reported weight loss at 12 months (mean intervention duration 6 months), and no trials included a large proportion of men. Financial incentives can help men with overweight and obesity to lose weight  8, 9  and adding behavior change techniques and economic theory can enhance effectiveness.  [10] [11] [12]  The Game of Stones clinical trial was designed to assess whether text messaging combined with financial incentives could help men with obesity lose weight at 12-month follow-up, compared to a control group. This clinical trial also evaluated whether text messaging alone could attain significant weight loss at 12month follow-up, compared to a control group."

The P value for statistical significance was defined as P<0.025. The imputation model used: baseline weight, recruitment method, area deprivation quintile using country-specific Index of Multiple Deprivation (eMethods in supplement 3), recruitment area, height, and age to impute missing weights at 12 months for each group. In sensitivity analyses, analyses were repeated among people with 12-month weight values obtained in person (including video) if on study scales within 23 days of target date, with missing data imputed using the model above. Additional sensitivity analyses used the same analysis model on all observed data (a missing completely at random assumption) and two missing-not-at-random models with either baseline observations carried forward or last observation carried forward (for the intervention groups only).

This study included 39% of men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, who have typically been under represented in clinical trials of weight loss in people with obesity.  23 ile five percent weight loss is typically considered clinically meaningful, some evidence has suggested that weight loss of less than five percent may be clinically important.  24, 25 Providing participants with cash that they could retain if they met study goals allowed participants on low incomes to enrol, unlike deposit contract financial incentives where participants risk losing their own money.  10, 11 The inclusion of men with obesity living in disadvantaged areas in decisions about the design of the incentives, number of assessments, goals and text messages  16, 17  may have contributed to the effectiveness of the text messaging with financial incentives intervention. Twelve in person contacts are recommended to deliver individual or group behavioural weight management interventions in primary care compared to four weight assessments in this trial, which is important for time-poor participants and staff workload.  26 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend lifestyle weight management programmes that last at least 3 months, and that sessions are offered at least weekly or fortnightly and include a 'weigh-in' at each session.  27"

Fourth, because the clinical trial did not include a two-by-two factorial design, it is not possible to know whether text messaging with financial incentives were more effective than financial incentives alone in this population.\n\nFifth, harms were collected more frequently in the intervention groups compared to the control group and might have influenced rates."
