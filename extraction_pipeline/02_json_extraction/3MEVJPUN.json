      "title": "I. INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "In control context, stability is one of the most important topics for design and analysis. For the fractional control based on the fraction calculus, there are several approaches for stability analysis of the fractional-order linear time invariant (FOLTI) systems  [1] ,  [2] , for example, robust stability  [3] , bounded input-bounded output (BIBO) stability  [4] , internal stability  [5] , root-locus  [6] , robust controllability  [7]  and robust observability  [8] . For fractional nonlinear systems, Mittag-Leffer stability  [9]  and Chaotic attractors  [10]  can be utilized for stability analysis. By literature reviews, one of the most efficient and easiest approaches for stability analysis of the FOLTI systems is the Matignon's stability theorem  [4] ,  [8] ,  [11] . Associated with the Riemann surface and Riemann sheets  [12] , Matignon's stability conditions can easily utilized for stability analysis of the FOLTI systems.\n\nFrom our previous work, the optimal fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID or PI \u03bb D \u00b5 ) controller of the three-phase induction motor speed control system has been optimized by the cuckoo search (CS)  [13] . However, the stability of such the system does not be analyzed yet. In this paper, the stability analysis of the three-phase induction motor speed controlled system with the FOPID controller designed by the CS is thus presented based on the Matignon's stability theorem associated with the Riemann surface and Riemann sheets. This paper is organized as follows. After an introduction is given in section I, the fractional control system is described in section II. Matignon's stability is illustrated in section III. Results and discussions of the stability analysis of the three-phase induction motor speed controlled system with the FOPID controller is provided in section IV. Finally, conclusion is followed in section V."

      "title": "C. FOPID Controller",
      "text": "The FOPID (or PI \uf06c D \uf06d ) controller was firstly proposed by Podlubny in 1994  [15] ,  [16] . It possesses five tuning parameters: proportional gain (K p ), integration gain (K i ), derivative gain (K d ), integration order (\uf06c) and derivative order (\uf06d). The FOPID can be described by the differential equation as expressed in  (6) , where e(t) is the error signal regarded as controller input, u(t) is the control signal regarded as the controller output and fractional-orders \uf06c and \uf06d \uf0b3 0. By taking the Laplace transform, the FOPID can be rewritten as expressed in  (7) .\n\nIII. MATIGNON'S STABILITY By using the branch point and the branch cut in complex plane, the Riemann surface of multi-valued function w = s 1/v in Fig.  1(a) , where v \uf0ce N (v = 1, 2, 3,\u2026), can be transformed into the v Riemann sheets in Fig.  1(b) , where sector -\uf070/v < arg(w) \uf0a3 \uf070/v corresponding to the first (or principal)\n\nRiemann sheet  [1] ,  [4] ,  [8] ,  [11] . The stability region of the fractional-order system can be performed by the first Riemann sheet on the complex wplane. In the fractional case, the stability is different from the integer one. Interesting notion is that a stable fractional system may have roots in right half of complex w-plane as visualized in Fig.  2 . For the case of commensurate order systems, whose characteristic equation is a polynomial of the complex variable \uf06c = s \uf061 , the stability condition is expressed in  (8) , where \uf06c i are the roots of the characteristic polynomial P(s \uf061 ) = 0. A commensurate order system, described by a rational transfer function in  (9) , where w = s q , q \uf0ce \uf0c2 + , (0 < q < 2), is stable if and only if the stability condition stated in (  10 ) is satisfied, where w i are the roots of the characteristic polynomial P(w) = 0.\n\nReferring to (4), the characteristic equation of the fractional order system can be formulated in  (11) . It may be rewritten as  (12) , where u i and v i are the integer numbers. Then, it can be transformed into the w-plane as  (13) , where w = s 1/m and m is the least common multiple (LCM) of v i .\n\nLet |arg(w i )| be the absolute phase angle of all roots w i . Roots in the s-plane have corresponding roots in the w-plane by the transformation s = w m . The condistion for stability is \uf070/2m < |arg(w i )| < \uf070/m. Condition for oscillation or undamped response is |arg(w i )| = \uf070/2m, otherwise the system is unstable. This means that if there is not root in the unstable region of the w-plane, the system will always be stable  [1] ,  [4] ,  [8] ,  [11] ."

It means that the considered threephase induction motor speed controlled system with the FOPID controller designed by the CS is stable.

The considered system has been classified as the FOLTI system. By utilizing the Matignon's stability theorem associated with Riemann surface and Riemann sheets, the fraction (incommensurate) order system model could be transformed into the commensurate order model by using the multi-valued transfer function. With this approach, the stability of any FOLTI system could by effectively and easily analyzed.

This stability has been assured by the responses of the controlled system according to the BIBO stability."
