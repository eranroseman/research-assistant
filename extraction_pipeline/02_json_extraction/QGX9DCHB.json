  "abstract": "Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is a complex approach increasingly used worldwide to make transparent and evidence-based reimbursement decisions for health technologies. This study aims to describe the present environment and future prospects of HTA implementation in Romania based on the opinion of a wide range of national stakeholders. A survey was conducted using a questionnaire already applied previously to design HTA roadmaps for middle-income countries. Survey responses were collected from two sites. First, responses were collected among the participants of the National Conference of Pharmacoeconomics and Health Management in October 2017 at Brasov. Second, a purposive sampling was applied to contact HTA professionals from public organizations from October 2017 to February 2018. According to the respondents there is need for HTA capacity building by establishing postgraduate trainings in Romania. The funding for HTA should be a delicate balance between public and private resources. A national HTA body with the involvement of academic institutions was the preferred organizational structure. Results indicate that the quality assurance tools such as a methodological guideline or a critical appraisal checklist should be applied and the HTA process should be transparent. Respondents emphasized the importance of using primarily local data in certain categories for developing HTA evidence for decision-making. Our study indicates the need to improve the educational and methodological framework of HTA activities and to consider the transferability of international evidence in Romania, which can contribute to improve the efficiency of the health system.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "In an era where various chronic diseases result in large burden for the patients, there is a great need for innovative health technologies that can extend life, improve the quality of life of patients, reduce the symptoms or provide a viable cure. In order to find an optimal balance between the increasing costs of such innovative technologies and the limited healthcare budgets, many countries have introduced health technology assessment (HTA) to ensure evidence-based healthcare decisions  [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . HTA assembles modern methods and instruments reflecting on countries' characteristic (i.e. economical, demographical, cultural and socio-economic determinants) and provides stakeholders with objective, verifiable and evidence-based information that can be used in reimbursing, pric-ing and purchasing health technologies or even investing in longterm healthcare decisions  [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . The main objective of HTA is attaining an efficient allocation of resources. This study investigates the implementation of HTA in Romania, a European Union (EU) member state with over 20 million inhabitants.\n\nThe Romanian healthcare system is mostly publicly funded as more than 80% of the total health expenditure covered by health insurance contributions by the population. The share of out-ofpocket payment account for approximately 19% of the expenditure leaving a very marginal role for voluntary private health insurance (less than 1%). In Romania mainly public but also a notable number of private providers under contract with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) provide medical services to the insured individuals. Inpatient care costs account for approximately 40% of the NHIF's expenditure, while the cost of pharmaceuticals represent around 25%  [8]  . In order to control drug prices Romania introduced external price referencing (EPR) in 2009  [9]  . EPR is used to determine the list price for all prescription drugs by referenc-ing 12 European countries and taking the lowest price from the basket  [10]  . In 2018 there were four reimbursement levels for the publicly funded medicines: 100% 90%, 50% and 20% set by the Ministry of Health. For drugs dispensed in hospitals the law does not allow patient co-payment  [9]  . Apart from EPR, claw-back taxation paid by the pharmaceutical manufacturers to the NHIF was also introduced first as a temporary measure in 2009, however it has gone through several changes since then. As of 2017 the percentage of the claw-back taxation was quarterly adjusted according to the potential overspending of the budget  [9]  .\n\nAs an attempt to inform decision makers about the potential value of the pharmaceuticals, a new scorecard-type HTA system was started in Romania in 2013 and was finally implemented in 2014  [11]  . The implementation process of HTA represents an important initiative taken by the Ministry of Health to better justify the high opportunity costs of medicines and other health technologies versus their benefits and the available treatment alternatives  [ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ] . Healthcare policymakers in Romania acknowledged the importance of HTA and began developing and applying this system centrally at national level  [ 17 , 18 ] . Education and training of professionals in health economics was stated early as an important objective related to this policy  [ 19 , 20 ] . Currently HTA procedures are conducted at National Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices of Romania (NAMMDR), a public institution financed by the Ministry of Health. In 2014 Ministry of Health published an HTA scorecard with six criteria including the results of assessments of technologies done by other countries' HTA organizations (i.e. France, Germany and UK or Scotland), number of EU countries that reimburse the technology and the expected budget impact  [11]  . The score obtained after appraisal consists of points awarded if the medicine is already reimbursed in the EU member states (maximum, 25 points, if it is on the positive list in at least 14 countries), and if according to competent authorities in France, UK or Scotland and Germany the drug has a proven therapeutic benefit and it was considered to be cost-effective compared to the standard treatment in these countries. If the technology generates more than 5% savings in the Romanian health budget allocated for the year of the assessment it receives an additional 30 points. The budgetary impact is calculated by a comparison to a relevant comparator (a technology which is already on the positive reimbursement list, has the same indication, targets the same patient population as the new technology and has the same pharmacodynamic properties as the new technology). Further details on the calculation method can be found elsewhere  [11]  .\n\nAccording to the legislation, to receive a positive decision for public reimbursement, the technologies require a score of minimum 60 points. If it receives at least 80 points, the technology will be reimbursed unconditionally, which means that patients will be able to receive the medicine as soon as it is included to the positive list (i.e. the Ministry of Health announces the result of the scorecard evaluation). Technologies who score between 60 and 80 can be reimbursed only after a confidential negotiation between the NHIF and the manufacturer. Companies may follow different approach in such negotiations such as proposing a costvolume based negotiation. These confidential contracts are valid only for one year, and they have to be re-negotiated to evaluate whether the technology can remain on the list  [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] . In these instances the patients need to wait until the negotiation procedure is completed before they can receive the treatment. However, these agreements generally does not impact their level of co-payment.\n\nSince 2014 the HTA system had been refined several times with some adjustments. Medicines already reimbursed before the scorecard system were re-evaluated according to the abovementioned approach, and the scoring system was revised in 2015 by including evaluation criteria for medicines used in infectious and communicable pathologies with a major impact on public health. Two years later the Ministry of Health also approved the conditions for compensating orphan medicines used in rare diseases. From the structural point of view of the HTA system, a new department at NAM-MDR was established in July 2014, called the HTA Department.\n\nIn January 2017 the Romanian Ministry of Health together with international experts from England and USA have started an ongoing project, with the title of \"Technical Assistance for institution building of Health Technology Assessment structure, including training for the NAMMDR\" to optimize the institutional HTA framework, assist capacity building and support cooperation with HTA agencies worldwide. For an efficient collaboration between the NAMMDR, other stakeholders in healthcare and patients, the Ministry of Health agreed to organize the HTA system as a 'hub and spoke' structure. In the proposed design, Ministry of Health remains the central authority that coordinates processes and HTA appraisals. The novelties relate to moving the evaluation activities of non-drug interventions (medical devices) and future healthcare programs from the NAMMDR to the Ministry of Health where special experts perform evaluations. In the new structure the NAM-MDR has more concentrated work and continues to evaluate and issue decisions for the reimbursement of medicines and vaccines. In general the assessment of technologies is not outsources but if necessary the Ministry of Health and the NAMMDR can invite academic groups or consultants contribute to the appraisal process with their expert knowledge.\n\nAlthough the introduction of HTA system in Romania and the characteristics of the implemented scorecard were previously debated in different research papers  [ 11 , 17 , 18 ] , further analysis is still needed to better understand how the current Romanian HTA system should be further developed to serve the needs of evidence based decisions. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the current and future preferred status (i.e. in 10 years) of HTA implementation in Romania."

      "text": "To assess the current and the preferred status of the development in HTA a survey template was used, which was developed and published earlier  [7]  . The questionnaire had already been applied in Central and Eastern European countries  [ 21 , 22 ]  and in Latin America  [23]  . The questionnaire focuses on the following eight areas of HTA implementation: 1) capacity building, 2) HTA funding, 3) legislation on HTA, 4) scope of HTA, 5) decision criteria, 6) quality and transparency, 7) use of local data, 8) international collaboration. The questionnaire included single or multiple-choice questions depending on the nature of the investigated area. Participation at the questionnaire was voluntary and participants were informed that only aggregated results will be presented and the individual results will be kept confidential. The answers were collected from two sources and a standardized template was used to aggregate the survey results.\n\nFirst, the survey was applied among participants at the National Conference of Pharmacoeconomics and Health Management held in Brasov, Romania in October 2017. The conference is organized annually and it aims to train health professionals and national decision-makers about methodologies of pharmacoeconomics and health management. During the conference, the structure of the questionnaire was presented to the audience and the purpose of data collection was explained. Conference participants had the opportunity to complete the survey by distributing a paper-based version of the questionnaire. Initial results based on the collected completed surveys were presented and discussed at the end of the conference.\n\nSecond, a purposive sampling was applied in order to identify more national stakeholders from those public organizations that were involved to HTA. Individuals were identified, contacted and Received surveys were considered valid when not more than three answers were missing or not more than three inconsistent answers were given (for example providing multiple answers for a single-choice question). Missing or inconsistent answers of the included surveys were removed from the aggregated results and had no influence on the findings presented in this paper. The distribution of survey answers was calculated as percentages from the total sample with valid answers."

The majority of participants indicated that there is a great need for a more specific higher level HTA education. 61% of the participants advocated that a permanent postgraduate training program will be necessary in the future, while 26% of respondents still indicated their preference to project based trainings.\n\nHTA funding 74% of survey participants reported that the critical appraisal of HTA evidence by the HTA body is currently funded from private sources. Dominantly public funding was reported by 11% of the participants and 15% considered that there is no funding for critical appraisals. About half of the participants, 52% preferred having public financing sources for critical appraisal, while 48% preferred having private sources (e.g. from submission fees by manufacturers). More than one third of the respondents reported lack of financing for the research part of HTA. However, 72% indicated that apart from allocating sufficient public funding for these activities the involvement of private resources could also be expected."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The fairly large number of respondents who were willing to fill in the survey indicated that HTA is an important topic in Romania and as it was discussed at the introduction of this paper, the country has already few years of experience regarding HTA implementation. Despite early implementation of HTA in Romania, local cost-effectiveness evidence was not utilized for the decision making. Results from our survey on the future perspectives of HTA implementation in Romania are mainly in agreement with the results published from other countries in Central and Eastern Europe  [ 6 , 7 , 21 , 22 ]  and in Latin America  [23]  . Survey respondents confirmed that more reliance on local evidence would be needed in the future and cost-effectiveness evidence is even more important than budget impact of new technologies. This necessitates changes in future strategies of HTA implementation of Romania.\n\nRegarding the capacity building for HTA, according to the information presented on the site of the Ministry of Health, some public or private universities in Romania provide HTA related modules for medical, pharmacy and other postgraduate students. However, health economist specialization is not yet officially recognized in any postgraduate programs. In several general graduate and postgraduate programs students can attend various courses related to HTA, which manifest in an increased interest for learning more advanced HTA skills compared to what is currently available. However, a limited number of persons are aware of these programs or can access them (mostly medical students in specific residency programs). Current HTA specialists are often improving their skills by participating at international courses organized for instance by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and by attending postgraduate programs in other European countries (e.g. the Netherlands, United Kingdom or Hungary). Studying abroad is a very costly process for students, and trained HTA experts often stay in the host country, therefore developing such programs in Romania has the potential to decrease cost of postgraduate HTA training and to reduce the brain drain of Romanian HTA experts to higher income EU member states.\n\nFinancing the HTA process is important both for the assessment and the appraisal phases. Survey respondents reported insufficient funding for the assessment (i.e. research) part of the HTA process. Most of the respondents preferred ensuring a significant increase in the public budget for HTA research. Although the public funding is considered insufficient, similarly to neighboring countries  [ 21 , 22 ] , the Ministry of Health allocates some funding for systematic reviews and establishing of technology assessment standards. However, budget has not yet been considered for the revision of previous HTA recommendations and reimbursement decisions, for improving the HTA methodologies or for performing assessment for health technologies without industry submissions (e.g. surgical procedures or public health programs). Resources could also be allocated for the establishment of public databases for the assess-ment reports, which may foster transparency, ensure stakeholder engagement and eventually lead to the translation of findings to policy decisions  [7]  .\n\nThe international recommendation, which already applied in Poland, Slovakia and Hungary from the Central and Eastern European region highlights the importance of making decisions on health technologies based on the local data in certain categories (e.g. resource utilization and unit costs) for HTA evidence  [24]  or to assess the transferability of international evidence whether it can be used in the local practice  [6]  . There is no point in redoing relative effectiveness assessment, when such study is available with the same comparator  [24]  . Similar recommendation can be made based on the survey results for Romania and such proposals were already debated at national pharmacoeconomics conferences  [25]  . However, regardless of the legislation framework, the role of HTA in providing information for health policy decision-makers has increased considerably in Romania  [ 11 , 17 ] . HTA can influence the reimbursement process as the Romanian Government tries to find solutions to respect the patients' constitutional rights to equitable access and better coverage while facing the rising healthcare costs.\n\nRegarding the process of such decision-making, every component of the HTA could be an important decision criterion. In Central and Eastern European countries, the budget impact is generally the most frequently used criterion  [ 6 , 7 ]  while cost-effectiveness analyses are generally required for more advanced HTA systems. If budget impact is taken into account without considering the cost-effectiveness criterion in the local context, medical technologies may be overpriced, and volume restrictions would be needed to keep the budget. Currently, in Romania there are some other criteria considered in the HTA evaluation (unmet medical needs, healthcare priority and the therapeutic value), however these are used indirectly (implicitly) as they are difficult to use explicitly when public resources are limited. Survey respondents emphasized the importance of cost-effectiveness criterion implemented in a flexible way by applying explicit soft thresholds. However, conclusion of economic evaluations in other countries (e.g. NICE recommendations) with potentially confidential prices are not meaningful to judge cost-effectiveness in Romania.\n\nSimilarly to most middle-income European countries, Romania has limited capacity for HTA, which affects the scope of HTA implementation as well. HTA is mainly used for pharmaceuticals to prioritize in the decision-making process with the exception of few medical prevention technologies. The example of other countries show that the scope of HTA can be extended for high-cost medical technologies, including diagnostics, or even surgical procedures  [23]  .\n\nEuropean countries use different instruments for quality assurance of HTA among which the most important are the published methodological guidelines  [24]  and the critical appraisal checklists  [26]  . Survey respondents emphasized the importance of quality improvement initiatives in Romania as well. Concerning the transparency of HTA, international experience shows that assessment reports accompanied by appraisal of national HTA agencies could be published, which enables researchers to review previous HTA reports, harmonize methodologies, assumptions and input data  [ 27 , 28 , 29 ] . In Romania the appraisal reports are published, nevertheless, there is still room for improvement. In fact, survey respondents preferred publishing HTA reports and the corresponding appraisal reports and final policy recommendations.\n\nInvestment in patient registries and access to payers' databases is highly required due the current limitations of accessibility to local data. These should be accessible for the main stakeholders involved in the assessment and appraisal processes to support the decision-making and enhance the accuracy of predicted value and budget impact calculations. The active collaboration between man-ufacturers' representatives and decision-makers should be encouraged even if it requires a certain degree of trust on all sides  [5]  . Widespread use of economic evaluations may increase the confidence level and the quality of evaluations and reduce heterogeneity of methods.\n\nAccording to the survey results the active involvement into joint international work and looking for harmonization with other European HTA organizations should be continued. In the future continuous participation at joint work may advance timely dissemination of scientific outputs and continuity of HTA activities. HTA doers, like the NAMMD in Romania, may regularly join specific consultations (organized by a coordination group) to explore data and evidence requirements in joint clinical assessments. Another potential field for joint work is to take part in early horizon scanning activities, which can facilitate better understanding of the impact of future technologies on patients, public health and healthcare systems."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "The ultimate aim of HTA implementation in Romania is to improve the evidence base and transparency of health policy decisions, which is currently supported by healthcare policy-makers. Since 2014, significant improvements have been made in the institutionalization, legislation and methodologies of HTA. Additional effort s should focus on capacity building, use and accessibility of local data and widening the scope of HTA to non-pharmaceutical technologies. Increase in public financial resources for HTA may create room for continuous revision of previous HTA recommendations. Explicit soft thresholds potentially with multi-criteria decision analysis may create the opportunity for more sophisticated managed entry agreements in order to improve patient access to high-cost technologies without compromising value judgements and affordability constraints. Our survey results are important to explore general directions based on the consensus of local stakeholders, which can help to develop a more detailed action plan for improving HTA implementation. An optimized HTA process eventually should contribute to a more sustainable healthcare system in Romania."
