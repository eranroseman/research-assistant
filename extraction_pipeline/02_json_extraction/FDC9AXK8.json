  "title": "Effectiveness of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity and improve health: a systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses",
  "abstract": "Wearable activity trackers offer an appealing, low-cost tool to address physical inactivity. This systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (umbrella review) aimed to examine the effectiveness of activity trackers for improving physical activity and related physiological and psychosocial outcomes in clinical and non-clinical populations. Seven databases (Embase, MEDLINE, Ovid Emcare, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched from database inception to April 8, 2021. Systematic reviews of primary studies using activity trackers as interventions and reporting physical activity, physiological, or psychosocial outcomes were eligible for inclusion. In total, 39 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified, reporting results from 163 992 participants spanning all age groups, from both healthy and clinical populations. Taken together, the meta-analyses suggested activity trackers improved physical activity (standardised mean difference [SMD] 0\u20223-0\u20226), body composition (SMD 0\u20227-2\u20220), and fitness (SMD 0\u20223), equating to approximately 1800 extra steps per day, 40 min per day more walking, and reductions of approximately 1 kg in bodyweight. Effects for other physiological (blood pressure, cholesterol, and glycosylated haemoglobin) and psychosocial (quality of life and pain) outcomes were typically small and often non-significant. Activity trackers appear to be effective at increasing physical activity in a variety of age groups and clinical and non-clinical populations. The benefit is clinically important and is sustained over time. Based on the studies evaluated, there is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of activity trackers.",

      "text": "Insufficient physical activity is a major threat to population health. Worldwide, physically inactive lifestyles are common in modern life, partly caused by labour-saving devices and transportation advances, combined with the busy pace of life. Physical inactivity is a key contributor to premature mortality and morbidity, increasing the risk of major non-communicable diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancers, and mental illness.  1  The estimated cost to health-care systems worldwide as a result of these morbidities was US$53\u20228 billion in 2013.  2  Low-cost interventions to address physical inactivity in clinical and non-clinical populations that are suited to the demands of modern lifestyles are needed.\n\nWearable activity trackers (consumer devices that provide feedback to the wearer, such as fitness trackers, activity-tracking smartwatches, and pedometers) could meet this need. These devices are affordable (costing from $30),  3  visually appealing and user-friendly,  4  and encourage lifestyle physical activity (ie, accrual of physical activity through everyday activities), reducing the barriers associated with more structured forms of physical activity.  5 Wearable activity trackers promote behaviourchange techniques, such as self-monitoring and goal setting,  6  and their use has been associated with increased physical activity.  [7] [8] 8] [9]  Additionally, using wearable activity trackers has been shown to be associated with improved physiological outcomes, such as reduced BMI, 10,11 reduced blood pressure,  10  and increased aerobic capacity,  9  which might occur via increases in physical activity. Wearable activity trackers also have the potential to improve psychosocial outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, through increases in physical activity, as physical activity is shown to have anti depressant  12  and anxiolytic  13  effects.\n\nThe global wearable activity-tracker market has grown tremendously over the past decade. Between 2014 and 2020, the number of wearable activity trackers shipped worldwide increased by an estimated 1444%.  14 n 2020, approximately $2\u20228 billion was spent on wearable activity trackers globally.  15 Accordingly, the body of research examining the use of wearable activity trackers for measuring and intervening on physical activity has expanded rapidly.\n\nDespite their prima-facie promise, there is widespread scepticism about the effectiveness of wearable activity trackers within the scientific, medical, and general community.  [16] [17] 7] [18] [19]  Such articles cite scientific studies and experts to highlight concerns about the accuracy of wearable activity trackers,  20  fuelling of obsessive behaviours and eating disorders,  21  exacerbation of health inequities,  22  and being simply ineffective for changing physical activity.  23 Such studies, however, represent the tip of a now voluminous body of evidence regarding wearable activity trackers and physical activity.\n\nHierarchies of evidence rank the strength of health evidence.  24 At the pinnacle of contemporary hierarchies are systematic reviews of systematic reviews and the gold standard, systematic reviews of meta-analyses.  25 As of 2021, it appears that there are hundreds of randomised controlled trials of wearable activity trackers, and numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused Review on activity trackers in various clinical and non-clinical populations. Now is a good time to amass the highestquality evidence and consolidate understanding of the effectiveness of using activity trackers to intervene on physical activity. Specifically, we aimed to do a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (an umbrella review) examining the effectiveness of wearable activity trackers for increasing physical activity, and for affecting physiological and psychosocial outcomes that might arise from a change in physical activity."

The systematic reviews that used meta-analytic analyses, narrative analyses, or both, were eligible. Systematic reviews were excluded if they had the following characteristics: the wrong population (ie, non-human population); the wrong intervention, because either activity trackers were used only to monitor outcomes rather than being used as an intervention, or activity trackers were not the key intervention of interest (eg, a review exploring physical activity interventions with a subgroup of studies that used activity trackers); the wrong comparator-eg, systematic reviews were excluded if more than a third of the original studies in the review used a design that was inappropriate to address the research question of our meta-analysis (ie, they included activity trackers in both the intervention and control conditions, or activity trackers were used for the control condition in a study of an alternate, more intensive intervention); the wrong outcome, meaning there were no physical activity or downstream outcomes; the wrong study design, such as scoping reviews, literature reviews, or primary research (eg, randomised controlled trials); not published in a peer-reviewed journal or database; or they were a conference abstract (however, full-length conference articles were included)."

Seven items that can affect the validity of a review are deemed to be critical and nine non-critical, although these ratings can be altered depending on the context of the review.  31 For the current Review, we deemed one of the critical items to be non-critical (item 7-justification for excluding individual studiesthe team agreed that since this was not required in PRISMA reporting guidelines, it should not be considered a critical weakness). The remaining six critical domains were therefore protocol registration, adequacy of search strategy, risk-of-bias assessment, appropriateness of meta-analytical methods, use of risk of bias during inter pretation, and assessment of publication bias. Reviews were rated as high confidence (0 critical weaknesses and <3 non-critical weaknesses), moderate confidence (1 critical weakness and See Online for appendix <3 non-critical weaknesses), low confidence (>1 critical weakness and <3 non-critical weaknesses), or critically low confidence (>1 critical weakness and \u22653 non-critical weaknesses)."

Following team discussion, we decided that systematic reviews that met all other inclusion criteria should be included in the Review, provided no more than a third of studies used an inappropriate design for our research question.\n\nAfter study registration, we opted to use the AMSTAR 2 risk-of-bias tool instead of the Joanna Briggs tool, because it was more detailed and therefore appeared to be more sensitive in differentiating the methodological quality of systematic reviews.\n\nFollowing feedback from our peers, we also performed an additional analysis presenting the findings disaggregated by device type."

      "title": "Umbrella review synthesis methods",
      "text": "We wanted to understand the degree of overlap in component studies (eg, the original randomised controlled trials) captured in the various systematic reviews and meta-analyses that were included in this umbrella review. The degree of overlap was quantified using the corrected covered area (CCA) method,  32  whereby a CCA of 100% indicates that every systematic review and metaanalysis identified in this umbrella review comprised exactly the same component studies, whereas a CCA of 0% indicates that every systematic review and metaanalysis in this umbrella review included entirely unique studies. A CCA of 0-5% is said to indicate slight overlap, 6-10% moderate overlap, 11-15% high overlap, and more than 15% very high overlap.  32 ecause of the overlap in some of the component studies included in the various meta-analyses captured in this umbrella review, a meta-analysis of the results of the meta-analyses was not appropriate, given that it would count results from some component studies several times, violating meta-analysis principles.  33 Rather, a narrative synthesis was used,  34  in which meta-analyses were grouped by outcome measure and presented using forest plots that summarised the effect size, population, sample size, and heterogeneity (eg, I\u00b2) of each metaanalysis. Effect sizes are presented as originally reported by each systematic review. For each outcome, results from meta-analyses reporting standardised effect sizes (ie, standardised mean difference [SMD] and Hedge's g) were presented separately from results from metaanalyses reporting unstandardised effect sizes (ie, mean difference, weighted mean difference, and ratio of means).\n\nFor systematic reviews using narrative synthesis, we calculated the number of outcome-specific studies that found significantly favourable differences (ie, differences that the systematic reviews reported as being statistically significant-eg, with CIs that did not overlap with 0and which were favourable for health and wellbeing). These totals were expressed as a percentage of the total number of studies. Findings were summarised by plotting the relationship between the percentage of studies showing significant favourable associations and the total number of studies reporting the outcome.\n\nSensitivity analyses were undertaken descriptively to examine whether findings were consistent when low-confidence and critically low-confidence systematic reviews were excluded. In addition, narrative subgroup analyses were done to examine whether results varied on the basis of age group (child vs adults vs older adults), clinical characteristics (ie, healthy and various clinical populations), and device type (pedometers vs consumer activity trackers such as smart watches and fitness trackers). We considered results to be consistent if the effect sizes were of the same category according to Cohen's d (d=0\u20222 was considered to be a small effect size, d=0\u20225 a medium effect size, and d\u22650\u20228 a large effect size). A funnel plot was created as a visual aid to detect reporting bias (ie, missing results). Finally, the certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence was compiled in a figure summarising the findings, with a red, orange, and green colour-coding system used to aid visual interpretation.  34"

When the results for physical activity meta-analyses were presented in mean differences and ratio of means (appendix pp 35-36), interventions using wearable activity trackers increased step counts on average by around 1800 steps per day, walking time by approximately 40 min per day, and MVPA by around 6 min per day."

This study analysed 39 systematic reviews of experimental studies on the effectiveness of wearable activity trackers. A large number of meta-analyses and narrative syntheses addressed physical activity outcomes, and found that wearable trackers consistently outperformed controls for physical activity outcomes with moderate effect sizes. Fewer systematic reviews addressed physiological outcomes, and the effect sizes were smaller, and often non-significant. Only seven meta-analyses addressed psychosocial outcomes, finding small effect sizes for quality of life, whereas those for pain and disability were moderate. These patterns were consistent across all ages and disease states, and the gains appeared to be retained to at least 6 months' follow-up.\n\nTogether, the results from this umbrella review suggest there is consistent evidence that wearable activity trackers affect physical activity across a wide range of metrics.

      "text": "Given the magnitude of change in physical activity found in this umbrella review, it might seem surprising that more compelling evidence for the effect of wearable activity-tracker-based interventions on physiological outcomes was not found. For many of these outcomes, the effect sizes were small to very small, and often statistically non-significant (except for weight-loss outcomes, which showed moderate effects, equating to a reduction in weight of about 1 kg or in BMI of 0\u20225 kg/m\u00b2, and a reduction of 1\u20225 cm in waist circumference). One possible explanation is that many studies of physical activity interventions are reasonably short in duration (eg, up to 3 months), in which case measurable physiological benefits of sustained physical activity behaviour change might not have had time to fully manifest. Secondly, we applied the conventional definitions for interpreting effect sizes, by which an SMD of 0\u20222 is considered a small effect. However, effect sizes typically seen in different fields of research vary; in medical research, effect sizes in the range of 0\u202205 to 0\u20222 are common and sufficient to meaningfully affect health.  72 In this umbrella review, results for physiological outcomes were generally in a favourable direction, with effect sizes suggestive of small improvements (eg, an SMD of approximately -0\u20221 for blood pressure, -0\u202206 for cholesterol, and -0\u202216 for glycosylated haemoglobin), with a mix of significantly favourable and non-significant results (and an absence of significant, unfavourable results). Given these findings, some readers might consider our interpretation of findings for physiological outcomes as being overly conservative.\n\nThis umbrella review focused on intervention studies to capture the highest level of evidence. It embraced a wide range of physical activity, physiological, and psychosocial outcomes. A comprehensive search strategy was used, with study selection and data extraction processes completed in duplicate. There was only 2% overlap (a slight overlap) in studies between reviews. Additionally, we could locate no previously published umbrella reviews on this topic to which this umbrella review can be compared.\n\nAny umbrella review is limited by constraints of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses it captures. Although the systematic reviews captured here together covered a wide range of clinical populations, these populations were not exhaustive. Most reviews were graded as low or critically low in confidence, using the AMSTAR 2 instrument, although this finding is similar to reports from other domains of medicine.  [73] [74] 4] [75]  Results were similar across reviews with different risk-of-bias ratings, suggesting that the findings are robust. Although we subjectively grouped outcomes into broad domains and subcategories, a wide range of specific metrics were used in the reviews. For example, physical activity was variously operationalised as steps per day, meeting step goals, walking time or metabolic-equivalent minute, energy expenditure, accelerometer counts, time spent in moderate physical activity or MVPA, or exercise frequency. Nonetheless, results were quite robust across different metrics.\n\nThe reviews included a wide range of study designs. Although we excluded reviews with more than a third of studies with inappropriate designs (eg, studies including a wearable activity tracker in both the intervention and control conditions), some systematic reviews included some studies of these designs. The probable net effect of these inclusions would be to underestimate effect sizes.\n\nAlthough this umbrella review provides strong assurance of the efficacy of wearable activity trackers in increasing physical activity, few of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses examined the effectiveness of wearable activity trackers alone. Brickwood and colleagues did in 2019, 8 separately meta-analysing 16 studies that used multifaceted interventions and seven that used wearable activity trackers alone. They showed that the multifaceted interventions yielded effects around 50% larger than those using wearable activity trackers alone.\n\nFewer reviews addressed physiological outcomes than those assessing physical activity, and fewer still a small range of psychosocial outcomes (mainly quality of life). These reviews included fewer studies and yielded mainly non-significant findings. These outcomes are probably downstream of changes in physical activity and might require longer follow-up to manifest.\n\nThe volume of included studies investigating the efficacy of wearable trackers is large-39 systematic reviews and 390 component experimental studies covering 163 841 participants (not accounting for overlap). The studies spanned a wide variety of subpopulations (populations with overweight or obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, musculoskeletal pain, and Parkinson's disease) and a wide range of age groups from across the lifespan. Some limitations of the current body of evidence emerged. For example, the majority of component randomised controlled trials were done in high-income countries, and no systematic reviews addressing the activity-trackerbased interventions in populations with mental health illnesses were included in this umbrella review. Further research addressing these research gaps would be beneficial. Longer-term studies examining physiological, and a wider range of psycho social, outcomes would add to the scientific record. Studies focusing on the efficacy of activity trackers used alone (or if being used as part of a multifaceted intervention, which features of multifaceted interventions work most effectively in combination with activity trackers), would also be valuable.\n\nWearable activity-tracker interventions are effective in increasing physical activity and supporting modest weight loss in a wide variety of clinical and non-clinical populations and age groups. The magnitude of benefit is of clinical importance, and gains appear to be durable for at least 6 months. Effects on other physiological and psychosocial outcomes are small and often nonsignificant. There is sufficient evidence to recommend"
