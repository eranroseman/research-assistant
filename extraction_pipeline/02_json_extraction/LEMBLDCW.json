  "title": "Almost one in five physiotherapy trials excluded people due to lack of language proficiency: A meta-epidemiological study",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The objective of the study was to examine the characteristics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating physiotherapy interventions for low back pain (LBP) that specified a language-grounded eligibility criterion and the proportion of people being excluded consequently. Study Design and Setting: This is a meta-epidemiological study of RCTs evaluating at least one type of physiotherapy intervention for treatment or prevention of LBP. Records were retrieved from Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), LILACS, and SciELO from inception to May 2021. We retrieved metadata of each record from PEDro and extracted from included studies: country of recruitment, language-grounded eligibility criterion, and the number of consequent exclusions (if specified). Results: This study included 2,555 trials. A language-grounded eligibility criterion was specified in 463 trials (18.1%); the proportion was higher in trials conducted in North America and Europe, published after 2000, investigating cognitive and behavioral interventions, and including large sample size. Of these 463 trials, 75 trials (16.2%) reported a total number of 2,152 people being excluded due to lack of language proficiency, equivalent to 12.5% of randomized participants. Conclusion: Nearly one in five physiotherapy clinical trials on LBP excludes people based on language proficiency, compromising the evidence to manage LBP in minority populations.",

      "text": "Low back pain (LBP) ranks ninth in overall disease burden (i.e., counting both death and disablement) and is highly prevalent across all age groups, especially among females  [1, 2] . LBP had a global point prevalence of 7.0% in 2019, which means 568 million people were suffering at any time worldwide  [2, 3] . The prevalence is higher in countries with high-income economies than countries with medium-or low-income economies  [4, 5] .\n\nMost published studies on LBP were conducted in highincome countries  [6, 7] . These countries are highly culturally and linguistically diverse, where minority populations may be prevented from participating in clinical trials due to language barriers  [8] . For instance 14% of the population of the United States and 26% of Australians were born overseas, 80e85% of whom preferred to speak a language other than English at home  [9e11] . Previous reviews  [12, 13]  found approximately 20% of clinical trials conducted in these two countries excluded people based on language proficiency, and the proportion may have increased over time  [14] . Exclusion of people from linguistically diverse backgrounds may limit the external validity of the intervention across populations  [15] .\n\nPhysiotherapy interventions are frequently recommended in clinical guidelines for LBP management [16e18]. However, there is a dearth of research analyzing the extent to which people with limited language proficiency have What is new?"

      "text": "The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro)( www.  pedro.org.au ) is a pre-eminent global database indexing up to 99% of physiotherapy clinical trials, reviews, and guidelines  [20, 21] . To locate RCTs evaluating physiotherapy interventions, the PEDro developed broad inclusion criteria to perform monthly optimized searches in Medline, PsycINFO, AMED, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL  [22] . We searched in PEDro from inception to 4 May, 2021, for RCTs evaluating physiotherapy interventions for LBP written in any language. Our search strategy included the term ''low back pain'' and a combination of PEDro codes for body part ( ''the lumbar spine, the sacroiliac joint or the pelvis''), problem (''pain''), subdiscipline (''musculoskeletal''), and study method (''clinical trial'').\n\nWe requested the full text and the following metadata  [23]  of each record from PEDro: year and language of publication, age groups (pediatrics !18 years; adults 18e70 years; geriatrics O70 years), physiotherapy intervention, and the ratings of 11 PEDro criteria. We collapsed the 14 categories of physiotherapy intervention into four groups: cognitive and behavioral interventions (e.g., ''behavior modification''), passive treatments (e.g., ''massage'' and ''taping''), skill training and exercises (e.g., ''strength training'' and ''fitness training''), and other interventions (e.g., ''respiratory therapy''). The PEDro scale  [24]  includes 11 criteria: criterion 1 relates to the external validity, criteria 2e9 appraise internal validity, and criteria 10e11 examine the statistical reporting of RCTs.\n\nIn addition, we searched in LILACS and SciELO from inception to 16 May, 2021. These two databases focus on publications from Latin America and the Caribbean countries and are not routinely searched by PEDro. We used Health Sciences Descriptors  [25]  to make accurate translation of English terms and create identical search strategies in Spanish and Portuguese (see Appendix File A)."

LBP related to any cause of any duration and RCTs focusing on either LBP only or mixed musculoskeletal conditions (e.g., LBP and neck pain) were included. We excluded RCTs that were not rated on PEDro due to the lack of bilingual PEDro raters or where full-text copy of the trial could not be retrieved.\n\nRecords retrieved from LILACS and SciELO were imported to EndNote X9 (Clarivate Analytics Pty Ltd); and records written in English, Spanish, and Portuguese were independently screened by three pairs of reviewers (Q.C. and C.M., V.V. and A.F., A.O. and G.F.) against the selection criteria.

Therefore, we adopted the extracted data by Cashin et al.  [18]  and developed an extended data extraction form with additional variables added. To ensure consistency, this extended form was calibrated by three iterations of pilot testing among three reviewers (Q.C., C.M., and G.F.), with a detailed guide (see Appendix File B) created to specify the definition of each variable and the coding. We compared the retrieved records from PEDro between these two studies by PEDro ID to check the eligibility of previously screened records in Cashin et al.'s review and identify newly indexed records. The extended data extraction form included the following: research question (effectiveness, efficacy, effectiveness/efficacy, or economic); intervention aim (prevention, treatment, or mixed); duration of pain (acute !6 weeks; subacute 6e12 weeks; chronic O12 weeks; mixed duration; not reported); diagnosis of LBP; whether participants with other musculoskeletal condition(s) were included (yes or no); country of recruitment (coded as 194 member states of World Health Organization (WHO))  [26] ; country of the corresponding author; sample size (total number of participants who were randomized); whether a language-grounded eligibility criterion was specified (yes or no); description of the criterion; the language specified in the criterion; number of people excluded due to lack of language proficiency (if reported).\n\nWe collapsed LBP diagnosis into five groups: nonspecific LBP, radiculopathy, LBP related to serious pathology (e.g., fracture and cancer), pregnancy-related LBP, and other or mixed-diagnoses. If country of recruitment was not reported or name of the language was not specified in the criterion, we coded them as the country of the corresponding author and the official language of the country of recruitment. Eight reviewers were divided into four pairs for independent data extraction (Q.C. and C.M., V.B. and S.V., V.V. and A.F., A.O. and G.F.). Conflicts were resolved by consensus. We also recruited 33 bilingual or trilingual volunteers worldwide who were qualified PEDro raters or their colleagues with a physiotherapy background to assist with screening and data extraction from studies written in 12 languages (other than English, Spanish, and Portuguese)."

For categorical variables, comparisons of studies with and without a language-grounded eligibility criterion by category of characteristics were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test; if there were less than five studies in a certain category, Fisher's exact test was used for comparison instead. Continuous variables were compared between studies with and without a language-grounded eligibility criterion using Student's t-test. The year of publication was collapsed into three periods: before 1999, 2000e2009, and 2010 or later. We computed the number and proportion of studies with a languagegrounded eligibility criterion by the country of recruitment and WHO region  [26] . The WHO grouped its 194 member states into six regions according to regional distribution. For studies in which the number of excluded people due to lack of language proficiency was reported, we summed the total number of people excluded from these studies and the total number of participants being randomized into study groups by country of recruitment.

      "text": "We examined the characteristics of physiotherapy clinical trials for LBP where language proficiency was specified as an eligibility criterion and determined the number of people excluded from these trials due to limited language proficiency. We identified 463 out of 2,555 included studies (18.1%) which explicitly required language proficiency, and 75 of these 463 studies (16.2%) reported a total number of 2,152 people excluded due to lack of language proficiency, equivalent to 12.5% of randomized participants. This study found that trials conducted in North America and Europe, published from 2000 onwards, investigating cognitive and behavioral interventions, and including large sample size had higher proportion of specifying a languagegrounded eligibility criterion.\n\nWe found studies evaluating cognitive and behavioral interventions had a significantly higher proportion of trials (35.9%) excluding people based on language proficiency than other interventions. A previous review evaluating telehealth for type 2 diabetes identified 29 out of 58 RCTs (50%) that included language proficiency as an eligibility criterion  [27] . These relatively high proportions may be  d The 14 categories of physiotherapy intervention indexed on PEDro were collapsed into four groups in this review. Each study indexed on PE-Dro can be selected for up to three categories of intervention; therefore, the sum of studies evaluating each category of intervention was larger than the total number of included studies.\n\ne Trial characteristics (i.e., design, conduct, and reporting) were measured using the 11 criteria of the PEDro scale.\n\nattributed to the necessity and importance of communication, either verbal or written, between participants and investigators when delivering cognitive and behavioral interventions and telehealth interventions  [13, 27] . This study found that more recent trials published after 2000 predicted exclusions from clinical trials based on language proficiency. Similarly, a review of studies on emergency medicine also reported an increased proportion of research excluding non-English speakers from 6.2% in 2004 to 14.5% in 2014  [14] . Meantime the proportion of physiotherapy clinical trials satisfying each criterion of the PEDro scale increased over time  [18] . However previous reviews evaluating the quality of clinical trials mainly focused on blinding, concealment, and the intention-totreatment principle  [18,28e31] , whereas none of these reviews paid much attention to the quality of reporting of eligibility criteria and what the criteria were.\n\nMore than 20% of the physiotherapy clinical trials conducted in North America and Europe excluded people based on language proficiency. A recent review screened 14,367 clinical trials registered in the United States in 2019e2020 and identified 19.0% of those required English proficiency  [13] . Another review of clinical trials in Australia reported trials evaluating treatments for pain were nearly three times more likely to exclude people with low English proficiency than other trials  [12] . The large number of immigrants in these countries and regions may be the main reason for investigators to require language proficiency during recruitment. The migration rate in Australia and the United Sates was 30.1% and 15.3% respectively [32], indicating large linguistic diverse populations. Based on the World Migration Report  [33] , 21.1% of the total population of Oceania in 2020, 14.5% in North America, and 10.9% in Europe were international immigrants, whereas proportions of the other regions were below 2%.\n\nLanguage proficiency plays a crucial role for a participant to accomplish a physiotherapy intervention as expected. For instance, interventions related to behavior modification or health promotion require high-level language proficiency for participants to comprehend instructions of functional activities or healthful lifestyles and regularly provide verbal or written feedback to instructors [34e36]. Of the 41 included studies where a reason for a language-grounded eligibility criterion was specified, language proficiency was necessitated for informed consent, completing questionnaires, reading the information or materials, participating in interviews or group discussions, following treatment instructions, and communicating with therapists.\n\nLinguistically diverse populations should not be deprived of the opportunity to participate in clinical trials. As examples of inclusive trials, we noticed a few trials which clearly specified the inclusion of participants with all levels of language proficiency by implementing strategies to address potential language barriers, such as recruiting interpreters or multilingual staff and providing validated questionnaires in other languages. In the stage of study design, investigators should delineate the demographic characteristics of the target population, especially linguistic backgrounds, to translate informed consent forms and study materials and provide access to interpreter services as required. Funders, sponsors, and governments should take the initiative to cover the additional costs of these linguistic-related adaptations in clinical trials to enhance inclusiveness and generalizability of trials in multilingual communities. a There were 11 studies in which language proficiency was specified as an eligibility criterion without the name of language reported.\n\nDespite translation of trial materials and provision of interpreter services, the inclusion of participants from linguistically diverse backgrounds may still lower the reliability of informed consent and result in a loss in quality of treatment delivery  [8, 15] . For example, it may be feasible to resort to the aid of an interpreter when implementing passive physiotherapy treatments for LBP, such as spinal manipulation; but treating via an interpreter may downgrade the quality of pain education, for instance, which entails extensive use of language for interaction and feedback and requires culture-specific adaptations. In such cases quality of treatment needs maintaining by recruiting a Fig.  2 .

Future research could evaluate strategies specially tailored for the characteristics of physiotherapy interventions to minimize exclusion of people lacking in language proficiency in clinical trials. Understanding these issues is of great significance when planning for the delivery of linguistically validated physiotherapy services to culturally and linguistically diverse communities.\n\nIn this study we evaluated reports of 2,555 RCTs conducted in 67 countries written in 15 languages, enabling a comprehensive summary of recruitment decisions based on language proficiency in physiotherapy clinical trials on LBP worldwide since 1955. This review has some limitations. To identify whether a trial excluded people based on language proficiency, we had to rely on the reporting of study methods. It is possible that some trialists excluded participants based upon language proficiency by default, for example, by providing information and outcome measures exclusively in one language; but failed to report this in the manuscript. This neglect in reporting was noted in a previous review that collected information on languagegrounded exclusions in trials by mailing questionnaires to corresponding authors and found 68 out of 172 respondents (39.5%) excluded non-English-speaking people from trials, but only 18% of them specified this requisite in the published manuscript  [37] . Accordingly the magnitude of exclusions could have been underestimated in our study. There has also been concern about the overall suboptimal completeness of the reporting of rehabilitation clinical trials. A study  [38]  assessed 200 RCTs published in rehabilitation journals from 2011 to 20, and found that the mean rate of individual trials adhering to the items of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials checklist was only 65%; 97% of trials reported eligibility criteria and 67% reported the settings and locations of data collection. Our study identified 21.5% of included RCTs (550 of 2,555 trials) which did not report the list of eligibility criteria and/or the source of participants. Another limitation is the great variation in the language-grounded eligibility criterion in each trial, ranging from requirements for language skills (e.g., writing and speaking) to general requisites (e.g., fluent English and adequate comprehension) and to the inclusion of native speakers only. Despite our searches in three large databases, we acknowledge that some physiotherapy clinical trials on LBP may have been missed in this study. Since PEDro raters spoke 15 languages, we were also unable to include studies published in other languages by retrieving indexed trials from PEDro."

      "text": "Nearly one in five RCTs evaluating physiotherapy interventions for LBP had a language-grounded eligibility criterion specified. These trials were more commonly identified over the last 2 decades in Europe and North America, especially those investigating cognitive and behavioral interventions. The number of people excluded based on language proficiency was equivalent to one-eighth of participants randomized. This study examined trials based on the reporting of eligibility criteria in publications which may involve a considerable deficit of information. Linguistically adaptive strategies should be widely adopted in physiotherapy clinical trials to prevent people from being excluded merely due to language barriers."
