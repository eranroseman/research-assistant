  "title": "mHealth prompts within diabetes prevention programs: a scoping review",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile health (mHealth) prompts (e.g., text messaging, push notifications) are a commonly used technique within behaviour change interventions to prompt or cue a specific behaviour. Such prompts are being increasingly integrated into diabetes prevention programs (DPPs). While mHealth prompts provide a convenient and cost-effective way to reinforce behaviour change, no reviews to date have examined mHealth prompt use within DPPs. This scoping review aims to: (I) understand how mHealth prompts are being used within behaviour change interventions for individuals at risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D); and (II) provide recommendations for future mHealth prompt research, design, and application. Methods: The scoping review methodology outlined by Arksey and O'Malley were followed. Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and SportDiscus were searched. The search strategy combined keywords relating to T2D risk and mHealth prompts in conjunction with database-controlled vocabulary when available (e.g., MeSH for Medline). Results: Of the 4,325 publications screened, 44 publications (based on 33 studies) met the inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. Text messaging was the most widely used mHealth prompt (73%) followed by push notifications (21%). Only 30% of studies discussed the theoretical basis for prompt content and time of day messages were sent, and only 27% provided justification for prompt timing and frequency. Fourteen studies assessed participant satisfaction with mHealth prompts of which only two reported dissatisfaction due to either prompting frequency (hourly) or message content (solely focused on weight). Nine studies assessed behavioural outcomes including weight loss, physical activity, and diabetes incidence, and found mixed effects overall. Conclusions: While mHealth prompts were well-received by participants, there are mixed effects on the influence of mHealth prompts on behavioural outcomes and diabetes incidence. More thorough reporting of prompt content development and delivery is needed, and more experimental research is needed to identify optimal content, delivery characteristics, and impact on behavioural and clinical outcomes.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing public health concern due to the devastating impact it has on the individual diagnosed, and the associated economic costs  (1) . T2D affects an individual's quality of life  (2) , leads to increased depression and anxiety  (3) (4) (5) , and is among the leading causes of cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower limb amputations (6). In 2017, T2D was ranked as the ninth leading cause of death worldwide with greater than one million deaths attributed to T2D, and the seventh leading cause of disability and suffering as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)  (7) . Despite the substantial investments made in clinical care, public health initiatives, and research, T2D prevalence and burden continue to increase  (7) . A considerable body of research has shown that up to 60% of T2D cases can be prevented through structured dietary and physical activity (PA) programs  (8) (9) (10) (11) ; however, when translated into public health initiatives, the effects of such diabetes prevention programs (DPPs) are diluted  (12) . This is likely because translational studies have not considered the adaptability and scalability needed for public health interventions resulting in inequitable access to such programs  (13) . Rates of T2D are higher among individuals with lower income and education levels, those who are unemployed, and certain ethnic minorities  (14) (15) (16) ). Additionally, these individuals at highest risk must also overcome other barriers to accessing healthcare systems to prevent and manage T2D, such as language barriers, lack of culturally tailored information, and the cost associated with treatments  (16, 17) . Given the increasing prevalence of T2D, lack of scalable community based DPPs, and inequitable access to healthcare resources, there is a need for diabetes prevention programming that can provide care to assist those at highest T2D risk.\n\nIn 2020, it was noted that approximately 85% of the global population was covered by a 4G network, with 93% of the world having access to a mobile-broadband network (i.e., access to wireless internet via a mobile device)  (18) . Further, health-related technological development is at an all-time high  (19, 20) . This rapid adoption of technology and wide acceptability of remotely delivered health-related programs has shifted diabetes programming towards electronic and mobile health (eHealth and mHealth respectively) solutions as a way to augment DPPs and improve access to care. In the past five years, there have been a host of reviews discussing eHealth and mHealth DPPs and the use of different technologies to amplify in-person DPP delivery  (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Meta-analyses of DPPs incorporating eHealth and mHealth components report clinically significant weight loss  (23, 27)  which is comparable to reviews of solely in-person DPPs within the community which report an average weight loss of 3-5%  (28, 29) .\n\nFor example, Bian and colleagues  (27)  conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 mHealth mediated DPPs. Meta-analyses on weight outcomes found that mHealth mediated DPPs lead to clinically significant weight loss of 4.46% (a mean 3.75 kg weight loss) in those at risk for developing T2D. Further, they found that eight of the 18 intervention arms included in their review reported sustained weight loss for one or more years post intervention. Similarly, Joiner and colleagues  (23)  conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of 22 DPPs which were either delivered as fully mHealth or included mHealth components. At the interventions' final timepoints, mHealth (and mHealth augmented) DPPs result in mean weight loss of 3.98%. Further, interventions were sorted based on the provision of behavioural supports into three categories: (I) standalone interventions in which participants were not offered ongoing support from a counsellor; (II) remote support in which participants were provided with behavioural support via mHealth technologies (e.g., online messaging communications, emails, text messaging prompts, video conferencing or phone calls with a counsellor); and (III) in-person support in which participants received support from a counsellor face-to-face. Authors found that standalone interventions had an associated weight loss of 3.43%, remote support interventions had an associated weight loss of 4.31% and in-person support resulted in an associated weight loss of 4.65%. Based on these results, authors concluded that behavioural support (through mHealth or in-person communication) from a diabetes prevention counsellor is an important aspect of mHealth DPP delivery.\n\nDespite promising results from mHealth and mHealth augmented DPPs, authors consistently report heterogeneity in what digital components are being used (e.g., DVDs, web-based interventions, mobile phone applications, text messaging, etc.) and state that future research should focus on ways to optimize behavioral supports  (22, 23) . One way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of DPPs is to understand how to best integrate specific mHealth components. By  breaking down behavioural supports offered by DPPs into individual behaviour change techniques (BCTs), researchers can delineate which components are most impactful within these interventions \u00a9 mHealth.

      "title": "BCTs",
      "text": "BCTs are the smallest \"active ingredients\" within a behaviour change intervention which can be easily observed and replicated  (30) . Michie and colleagues BCTs taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1)  (30)  provides researchers with a list of 93 BCTs grouped into 16 distinct BCT categories. For both in-person and mHealth DPPs, self-regulatory techniques (e.g., goal setting, self-monitoring, action planning, problem solving) have been recommended as effective components to improve intervention efficacy  (25, 31) . In addition to self-regulatory BCTs, use of the BCT prompts/ cues is commonly cited within effective mHealth behaviour change interventions  (25, (32) (33) (34) (35) ."

      "title": "mHealth prompts",
      "text": "As per Michie and colleagues, the BCT \"prompt\" is defined as the introduction of an environmental or social stimulus with the purpose of prompting or cueing a target behaviour (e.g., a sticky note on door reminding you to take the stairs)  (30) . Prompts are one of the most frequently cited BCTs within mHealth PA, weight loss, and DPP reviews  (25, (32) (33) (34) (35)  and mHealth prompts (e.g., text messaging, push notifications) are one of the most commonly cited program components within mHealth DPPs  (23, 27) . mHealth prompts are a convenient and cost-effective way to reinforce behaviour change  (36, 37)  and have been shown to improve self-monitoring and adherence to PA goals  (38, 39) . Further, there is a growing body of evidence to support the use of mHealth prompts within behaviour change interventions  (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . For example, Whittemore and colleagues published an umbrella review to synthesize evidence from nine existing systematic reviews (representing 72 unique studies) assessing effectiveness of text messaging prompts for adults with T2D on haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Five of the included reviews conducted meta-analyses examining the impact text messaging has on HbA1c and found clinically and statistically significant results ranging from -0.38% (95% CI: -0.53 to -0.23; P<0.01) to -0.8% (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.5; P<0.01). Moderator analyses within these reviews highlighted that adults with more recent T2D diagnoses (<7 years) and lower baseline HbA1c have better outcomes associated with the text messaging programs. Providing early intervention via text messaging upon T2D diagnosis (or perhaps even when a diagnosis of prediabetes-the precursor to T2D-is made) may therefore optimize improvements in HbA1c. Despite this notion, no reviews to date have examined the use of mHealth prompts within DPPs. A summary paper which synthesizes what is currently known about mHealth prompts within DPPs is an important step towards understanding how to optimally develop and deliver effective digital interventions to improve diabetes prevention outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review was to identify and describe the ways in which DPPs are using mHealth prompts. We present the following article in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR reporting checklist (available at  https://mhealth.amegroups.  com/article/view/10.21037/mhealth-21-22/rc )  (46) ."

Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions: (I) what were the behavioural targets of mHealth prompts; (II) how was content developed (what theoretical basis is identified); and (III) how were prompts delivered (who delivered them, how long prompts were received for, what time prompts were sent, and how frequently prompts were sent) within DPPs?\n\nIn order for an mHealth prompt to act as a mechanism of action as defined by Michie  (30) , mHealth prompts were operationalized as any web-or mobile phone-based communication in which individuals receive a written \"notification\" (e.g., text messages or push notifications) on the home screen of their device without needing to take action first (i.e., if a participant is required to log into a program-related app or website in order to be prompted, that would make the cue to action obsolete). This definition excluded in-app messaging and emails unless it was stated that participants were required to have notifications turned on for these applications for the duration of the study. This ensures they will receive the prompt regardless of whether the participant is engaging with program related mobile phone or web-apps."

The majority of studies (n=24, 73%) did not provide any justification for why they chose a specific prompting frequency. Those that did often cited that the timing or frequency of prompts was based on participant preferences  (51, 59, 70, 71, 84) . One study tailored prompt timing and frequency through use of algorithms to optimally influence behaviours  (66) . Everett and colleagues  (66)  used machine learning to translate information originating from participants mobile phone and digital body weight scale into insights about that persons physical activity habits and schedule. From that information, participants were sent just-in-time recommendations to guide them to achieve the daily physical activity and dietary recommendations. Advanced algorithms were then used to learn which message types resulted in better compliance for a specific user based on their specific context."

Twelve of the studies reporting on acceptability found that prompts were well-received by participants; the remaining two studies found that prompts were not acceptable to participants. Specifically, participants in Whelan and colleagues study  (53)  felt that the hourly prompts to move were too burdensome, and they found the additional motivation prompts to be childish and not appropriate for an adult population at risk for developing T2D. Rollo and colleagues study  (64)  found that while 84% of participants agreed that the prompts provided useful information, only 22% felt that the prompts improved their self-efficacy, and only 8% felt it helped them achieve their goals. Further, participants noted that the primary focus on weight found in the prompts was not favourably received, and one participant suggested that motivational messages and informational messages on how different behaviours could reduce risk may be more appropriate  (64) ."

Studies which assessed both dietary and physical activity or exercise behaviours found that the prompts were associated with improved diet, but not physical activity or exercise behaviours  (60, 71) . MacPherson and colleagues  (54)  found that prompts had an acute effect on exercise, and that a prompt resulted in increased exercise in the 3-day following a prompt. In terms of diabetes progression, one study demonstrated that diabetes incidence was significantly reduced by the prompting intervention 5-year post program  (71) . In contrast, Wong and colleagues  (74)  found that prompts were effective in reducing diabetes incidence during the 2-year program, but there were no significant differences between the prompting and control group three years post trial.

      "text": "This scoping review summarizes the literature regarding use of mHealth prompts within DPPs. Our analysis highlights substantial heterogeneity coupled with a lack of reporting on the intervention duration, prompt delivery characteristics, prompt content, and fidelity. The majority of mHealth prompt literature to date has assessed feasibility or acceptability of mHealth prompts and has found that prompts are generally well-received by program participants. Interestingly, 36 studies that were excluded at the fulltext level identified that mHealth prompts were likely used in the intervention but provided insufficient information regarding the prompts to warrant inclusion. For example, Sweet and colleagues  (86)  provide only a single statement that participants are assigned to a lifestyle coach who can communicate with them through online messaging, with no indication of if the messages were pushed to their home screen, the number of messages that are sent by the coach, what the content is, how long the coach will continue to send messages, etc. This lack of reporting on key mHealth intervention components used within DPPs hinders such programs from being translated into practice due to a lack of transparency about mHealth prompt use and how prompts may be influencing intervention effectiveness.\n\nBeyond these 36 studies which were not included in this report due to their lack of information pertaining to prompts, the 33 studies that were included also consistently underreported on key delivery characteristics. Such underreporting may impede replication and translation of such interventions into practice. While it has been suggested that time of day and frequency in which prompts are sent can influence health behaviours  (41) , only seven studies (21%) reported prompt timing and 27 studies (82%) reported on prompt frequency, with 24 not providing any justification for why that frequency was chosen. Clearly, more thorough reporting is needed within mHealth prompt use in DPPs to allow for future meta-analyses to rigorously answer such questions."

      "text": "mHealth is a broad and heterogeneous field which is often assessed in its entirety and the impact of individual mHealth components not often teased apart. Assessing mHealth programs as an intervention package (e.g., assessing an app vs assessing those specific components within the app such as prompts and rewards) limits researchers abilities to identify which specific components (e.g., prompts) may be driving behaviour change  (23, 27, 87) . A strength of this review is that a single mHealth component, prompts, was singled out to provide a comprehensive overview of usecases to date, and to provide concrete recommendations to further the field of mHealth within DPPs. This scoping review is the first to provide a summary of available evidence on mHealth prompts with DPPs. A key strength of this review is its inclusion of a range of study designs, and mHealth prompt delivery (either as a stand-alone intervention or to augment larger DPPs) allowing for a more robust overview of the scope of the literature. Additionally, by reporting on a variety of characteristics associated with prompts within DPPs (content, delivery mode, delivery schedule, theoretical underpinning, etc.) this review was able to identify gaps in the literature and avenues for future mHealth prompt researchers.\n\nLimitations for the current review include confining the search to only English language publications. Further, some studies using mHealth prompts may have been missed in the search if the manuscript did not state that an mHealth prompt derivative was used somewhere within the title or abstract, or if the full text did not explicitly state that the potential prompt would land on the participants home screen of their device. Additionally, there may be studies included in the current review in which participants were able to turn off push notifications at the app level, or blocked study related phone numbers sending text messages, suggesting that measures of mHealth prompt fidelity are needed (e.g., read/send reports). Lastly, due to the nature of scoping reviews coupled with the heterogeneity of included studies, we were unable to comment on the effectiveness of different prompt content and delivery characteristics."

While there were mixed results of mHealth prompts on exercise behaviours and overall reduction in T2D incidence, it is unclear if prompting content or delivery may be driving these differences. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, coupled with the overall acceptability of mHealth prompts within the context of diabetes prevention, future research should be conducted to determine how to optimally engage clients in the behaviour change process through mHealth prompts.\n\nTo understand why prompts may be facilitating behaviour change in some studies, but not others, mHealth prompting content and delivery should be systematically developed, evaluated, and transparently reported."

      "title": "mHealth prompt development",
      "text": "Use of behaviour change frameworks such as the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW)  (88)  should guide the design of mHealth prompting interventions and provide structure when describing active intervention content. The BCW encourages intervention developers to use multiple data sources including previous literature, focus groups, surveys, and interviews with end users when developing an intervention. Regarding mHealth prompts, the BCW can be used to systematically develop theory-based prompt content in collaboration with end users, and to identify mechanisms of action by detailing BCTs within each message.\n\nAs the purpose of mHealth prompts is often to cue a target behaviour within an individual's own environment, contextual factors pertaining to mHealth prompt implementation should be accounted for during the development phase. The BCW advises researchers to thoroughly identify and understand a target behaviour within a given context  (88)  and to take into account intervention Effectiveness, Affordability, Scalability, and Efficiency (EASE) (89). Intervention EASE is achieved by balancing the efficacy of an intervention with other contextual aspects (affordability, scalability, and efficiency) which may impact the ability of an intervention to be effectively implemented into a community setting  (89) .\n\nOne key factor which may influence mHealth prompting in DPPs is the reach and accessibility of prompts by target populations. The most frequently used mode of delivery for mHealth prompts in the current review were text messaging (73% of studies) and push notifications (21%). While both mHealth prompt types have broad reach, text messaging may be a more accessible and affordable mode of delivery among those most at risk for developing T2D."

      "title": "Push notification reach",
      "text": "Despite similar levels of access to mobile broadband  (18) , mobile internet usage varies substantially between developed and least developed countries due to unaffordable broadband cost within developing counties  (18) . For example, 19% of individuals use internet in the 47 least developed countries compared to 87% of individuals using the internet in developed countries. The United Nations Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development set a target for what constitutes \"affordable\" broadband services; the least developed countries mobile broadband prices are six times higher than the broadband commissions affordability target compared to developed countries which cost less than half of the affordability target  (18) . This makes cost a potentially significant barrier to internet uptake. Discrepancies in uptake and subscriptions seen in internet use between developed and least developed countries may make mHealth prompts requiring internet enabled devices (e.g., push notifications) less accessible."

    {
      "title": "Text messaging reach",
      "text": "As cell phones do not require a mobile broadband connection to send and receive text messages, text messaging is one of the widest reaching and most accessible mHealth prompting interventions  (90, 91) . The gaps in mobile broadband adoption and usage between the developed and least developed countries are much larger than the gap in cellular phone uptake which enables text messaging use (129 cellular telephone subscriptions in developed and 75 in least developed countries per 100 inhabitants)  (18) . There are more than five billion mobile phone users worldwide  (91)  with greater than 18 billion text messages sent every day  (92) . Further, text messaging has been noted as the most popular non-voice application on mobile phones among American adults  (93) , and a survey conducted in 2011 with 21 counties found that 75% of cell phone owners report regularly sending and receiving text messages  (94) .\n\nBeyond cell phones accessibility, text messaging may be a more impactful delivery mode for mHealth prompting interventions due to its acceptability among patient groups who have limited access to healthcare resources (e.g., those in remote and rural locations)  (95) . In a review conducted by Wali et al.  (95) , 11 articles were assessed to summarize the literature on the use of mHealth interventions targeting cardiovascular disease management in Indigenous communities and low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). It was noted that the majority of Indigenous communities and LMIC populations reside in remote or rural areas with limited access to traditional Western health resources. Of the included studies, it was found that mHealth interventions resulted in positive behaviour change, including improved medication adherence, blood pressure monitoring and control, and self-care. Additionally, it was noted that within 83% of the studies in which text messaging was used, patients explicitly stated a preference for text messaging as a reminder system. In addition to rural and remote populations, text messaging usage is becoming more ubiquitous in older adults. While teens and younger adults reportedly send the greatest number of daily text messages (an average of 50 text messages per day in 2010)  (93) , cellular phone ownership and text messaging use has increased among older adults  (96) .\n\nAs risk of developing T2D is higher among lower socioeconomic groups and increases with age  (97) , text messaging has the capacity to reach and engage with the largest amount of potential participants compared to mHealth prompts which rely on internet enabled devices (i.e., push notifications send via smartphone applications). As such, we recommend that future mHealth prompting research target the comprehensive development and evaluation of text messaging prompts to allow for more scalable and inclusive mHealth DPP programming."

      "title": "mHealth prompt evaluation",
      "text": "Once an intervention has been systematically developed and all active intervention components within the messages have been identified, they should be rigorously tested to ensure they are effective within a given context. By understanding what specific BCTs are used within each prompt, researchers can not only test whether prompts in general are effective in enacting behaviour change, but also what specific techniques and mechanisms of action may be driving the effect. This can improve future uptake by ensuring that those prompts which are most impactful are translated into practice following rigorous testing within research facilities.\n\nBeyond content, prompt delivery is also a key characteristic which has been underreported. Future research is needed to identify not only which BCTs are most influential, but also what prompt 'dose' (i.e., frequency, timing, intervention duration) may reduce T2D incidence the most by improving PA, and dietary behaviours. While previous research has postulated that prompt dose may influence behaviours  (41) , DPPs have relied primarily on user preferences and observational research to justify prompt timing and frequency. More rigorous experimental evidence regarding the impact of prompt timing and frequency on behaviour change is needed to advance the field of mHealth behaviour change. Factorial experiments, sequential multipleassignment randomized trials (SMARTs), and microrandomized trials are potential trial designs appropriate to examine the dose-response relationship between prompts and behaviour change."

      "title": "mHealth prompt reporting",
      "text": "Findings from mHealth diabetes prevention programming are important to many groups from researchers to clinicians and patients, and public health diabetes prevention programmers. As such, research studies should be written in a way to increase their usability by including all relevant information pertaining to the study protocols and results so readers can judge the validity and relevance of the study, and if desired, use its findings to translate the project into other contexts  (98) ; however, this review found that authors consistently underreport on the content, delivery, and fidelity of mHealth prompts within the context of DPPs. Transparent reporting is necessary to improve the translation of effective interventions into practice. If a complete description of an intervention is not available, clinicians, patients, and DPP developers are unable to reliably implement mHealth prompting interventions into different contexts, and other researchers are unable to replicate or build on a study's findings  (99) .\n\nTo improve the quality of reporting within mHealth programming, future researchers should use standardized checklists to ensure that all relevant information is reported, and they should use a common language when describing intervention components. One tool which encourages and facilitates the reporting of key intervention details is the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR)  (99) . The TIDieR provides a standardized checklist for researchers to follow to ensure that details regarding what was delivered, why those components were chosen, who delivered the intervention, mode of delivery and intervention dose, if the intervention was tailored or modified, and what fidelity checks were in place  (99) .\n\nFurther, using a common language across behavioural domains through standardized description of BCTs can allow for more comprehensive intervention development, more accurate replication of interventions, and improved translation of effective interventions into real-world settings  (30) . If BCTs are consistently and thoroughly reported (e.g., through the use of the BCTTv1), the opportunity for evidence synthesis within behaviour change science is increased thereby allowing for meta-analyses to comment on which BCTs or combination of BCTs may be most effective at enacting behaviour change. mHealth prompting interventions reporting their methods using standardized tools such as the TIDieR and BCTTv1 help future researchers know what intervention components make up an effective intervention and can allow for the replication or building on previous work. Understanding which BCTs make up an intervention, and how they were delivered is critical for effective mHealth scale-up and implementation (100).\n\nThese comprehensive and transparent reports are well situated within protocol papers and can be deposited to data repositories such as the Open Science Framework ( https://  osf.io ). Beyond strictly reporting, possible interactions between these characteristics and BCTs should be assessed towards optimizing the effects of mHealth prompts on behaviour change."
