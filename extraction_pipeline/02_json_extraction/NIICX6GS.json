  "title": "Investigating racial and gender disparities in virtual randomized clinical trial enrollment: Insights from the BE ACTIVE study",
  "abstract": "Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) often suffer from a lack of representation from historically marginalized populations, and it is uncertain whether virtual RCTs (vRCTs) enhance representativeness or if elements of their consent and enrollment processes may instead contribute to underrepresentation of these groups. In this study, we aimed to identify disparities in enrollment demographics in a vRCT, the BE ACTIVE study, which recruited patients within a single health system. We discovered that the proportions of eligible patients who were randomized differed significantly by gender and race/ethnicity (men 1.2%, women 2.0%, P < .001; White 1.8%, Black 1.3%, Hispanic 0.7%, Asian 0.9%; P < .001), and compared with White patients, non-White patients were less likely to have a valid email address on file and were less likely to click on the email link to the study webpage and begin enrollment.

Behavioral Economics Approaches to Increase Physical Activity Among Patients with Elevated Risk for Cardiovascular Disease (BE ACTIVE) was a vRCT testing the effectiveness of gamification, financial incentives, or both to increase physical activity among individuals at risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. With approximately 90% of participants enrolled, we examined the study population's representativeness to determine if changes were needed during the remainder of recruitment. In this repor t, we descr ibe demographic characteristics along each step in the enrollment process to identify features of vRCTs that may contribute to lack of representativeness."

      "text": "The total UPHS population comprised 358,621 patients, of whom 239,305 identified as White (66.7%), 74,691 Black (20.8%), 8,189 Hispanic (2.3%), and 7,695 Asian (2.1%); 199,115 (55.5%) were male. Overall, 60,548 patients (16.9%) were eligible and emailed, of whom 41,097 identified as White (67.9%), 13,842 Black (22.9%), 5,939 Hispanic (2.3%), and 1,592 Asian (2.6%); 31,980 (52.8%) were male ( Figure  2  ). Compared with White patients, non-White patients were similarly likely to have a 10-year risk of major cardiovascular events \u22657.5%, less likely to have a valid email address on file, and more likely to have an internal PCP; ultimately, the racial and ethnic composition of the eligible population was similar to the overall UPHS population.\n\nAmong patients contacted during the initial na\u00efve period of recruitment, 2,505 (4.1%) clicked the link to the study platform and completed the eligibility survey and informed consent. Of these, 1,940 (77.4%) identified as White, 452 (18.0%) Black, 19 (0.8%) Hispanic, and 48 (1.9%) Asian; 1,217 (48.6%) were male. Ultimately, 946 patients were randomized, of whom 735 (77.7%) were White, 179 (18.9%) Black, 7 (0.7%) Hispanic, and 14 (1.5%) Asian; 387 (40.9%) were male. There were significant differences in the proportions of eligible patients who were randomized by race/ethnicity and gender ( P < .001) ( Figure  3  ). Compared with White patients, non-White patients were less likely to click the link and begin enrollment and less likely to complete all surveys, but equally likely to activate their Fitbit and more likely to take < 7500 steps per day at baseline. Men were less likely than women to click the link and begin enrollment and less likely to take < 7500 steps per day at baseline."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this analysis of the initial na\u00efve recruitment period of the BE ACTIVE vRCT, we found that non-White and male patients were underrepresented relative to White and female patients. Key barriers to representativeness included availability of valid email addresses and willingness to click on a link in an unsolicited email and provide potentially sensitive personal information. By contrast, availability of data in the EHR to identify eligible patients and independent completion of study tasks did not appreciably affect representativeness. This experience highlights the pitfalls of a recruitment strategy that does not explicitly consider participants' race/ethnicity in achieving representativeness in vRCTs.\n\nIt has been 3 decades since the NIH provided guidelines calling for increased representation in RCTs, but researchers still struggle to recruit patients from historically underrepresented populations.  4 , 5 Some have highlighted the possibility that vRCTs could overcome geographic barriers to clinical trial participation.  1  Likewise, direct-to-patient recruiting can counter implicit bias that leads clinicians to less frequently offer participation in clinical trials to certain groups.  6 Our experience challenges this idea, indicating that these potential facilitators of representativeness in vRCTs are counterbalanced and may be outweighed by detrimental factors. In other studies, our group has used higher-touch recruitment strategies-including phone calls and in-clinic recruitment-and enrolled a more representative sample than in the na\u00efve recruitment period of BE ACTIVE. In a clinical trial of financial incentives to increase physical activity among individuals with ischemic heart disease, 29 of 105 participants (27.6%) were non-White.  7 In another clinical trial of remote monitoring for patients with heart failure, 277 of 522 participants (50.2%) were either non-White or Hispanic.  8 istorically underrepresented groups' distrust in the medical system may create a significant barrier to achieving representativeness within vRCTs.  9 , 10 The largest drop-offs in non-White individuals' progression through enrollment occurred between initial email outreach and navigation to the study website to consent, and between consent and provision of sensitive personal information.\n\nWhile the likelihood of any potential subject replying to an unsolicited email was very low, clicking a link in an unsolicited email and providing sensitive personal information were the 2 steps in the BE ACTIVE consent process that most required participants' trust that the offer to participate in the study was legitimate, and that the research team would protect their sensitive information. The fact that participants were most likely to \"fall off\" the path to consent at these trust-requiring steps suggests that vRCTs low-touch approach to recruitment may fail to create the trust that many potential participants require to enroll, and that this failure disproportionately affects non-White individuals, decreasing representativeness.\n\nWhereas traditional RCTs recruit in-person, often at clinic visits with a provider the potential participant knows, vRCTs recruit through less personal channels, a distinction particularly relevant for non-White individuals. In 1 study, 54% of Black respondents thought it was very or somewhat likely that they or someone like them \"would be used as guinea pigs\" by medical researchers, but just 13% believed their doctor would ask them to participate in potentially harmful medical research.  11 The requirement to provide a SSN to receive compensation for trial participation presents another barrier, for several reasons. Many phishing scams target patients by attempting to procure sensitive personal information, so this re-Figure  3 . Proportion of eligible patients who were randomized by race/ethnicity and gender. Eligible men and non-White individuals were less likely to be randomized than woman and White individuals. P < .001 for men vs. women, P < .001 for White vs. Black, P = .006 for White vs. Asian, P = .007 for White vs Hispanic, and P = .001 for White vs. Other. quirement may alarm potential patients that are vulnerable to having their identity stolen. This requirement also completely excludes undocumented individuals.\n\nUltimately, when we found that our na\u00efve recruitment strategy led to underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities, we altered our recruitment strategy to recruit only non-White individuals and to reach out by text message in addition to email. Using this race-conscious approach to enrollment, we ultimately enrolled a population representative of the UPHS patient population.  2 , 3  Limitations Our data come from 1 study conducted in a single health system and may not be representative of all vRCTs. In particular, the population of patients seen at UPHS includes relatively few Hispanic and Asian indivduals, due in large part to the demographics of Philadelphia and its suburbs. We are therefore limited in our ability to draw conclusions about determinants of participation of Hispanic and Asian individuals in vRCTs. We did not interview patients who did not participate in BE ACTIVE to identify reasons for non-participation and can only infer potential reasons based on behavior. In addition, our analysis is descriptive and does not consider potential interactions among age, gender, and race which may determine participation. Finally, our analysis does not assess representativeness by socioeconomic status (SES). We chose to focus on race, ethnicity, and gender as these axes have been the focus of efforts by the NIH, Food and Drug Administration, and other stakeholders to improve representativeness in clinical trials,  4 , 5  but SES is an important determinant of clinical trial participation. Understanding how vRCTs affect participation by individuals of different SES is a critical question for future study."
