  "title": "Behavioral Interventions to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Outreach Two Randomized Clinical Trials",
  "abstract": "Despite public health efforts, breast cancer screening rates remain below national goals. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether bulk ordering, text messaging, and clinician endorsement increase breast cancer screening rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two concurrent, pragmatic, randomized clinical trials, each with a 2-by-2 factorial design, were conducted between October 25, 2021, and April 25, 2022, in 2 primary care regions of an academic health system. The trials included women aged 40 to 74 years with at least 1 primary care visit in the past 2 years who were eligible for breast cancer screening. INTERVENTIONS Patients in trial A were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a signed bulk order for mammogram or no order; in a factorial design, patients were concurrently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive or not receive text message reminders. Patients in trial B were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a message signed by their primary care clinician (clinician endorsement) or from the organization (standard messaging); in a factorial design, patients were concurrently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive or not receive text message reminders. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who completed a screening mammogram within 3 months. RESULTS Among 24 632 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 60.4 (7.5) years. In trial A, at 3 months, 15.4% (95% CI, 14.6%-16.1%) of patients in the bulk order arm and 12.7% (95% CI, 12.1%-13.4%) in the no order arm completed a mammogram, showing a significant increase (absolute difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.6%; P < .001). In the text messaging comparison arms, 15.1% (95% CI, 14.3%-15.8%) of patients receiving a text message completed a mammogram compared with 13.0% (95% CI, 12.4%-13.7%) of those in the no text messaging arm, a significant increase (absolute difference of 2.1%; 95% CI, 1.0%-3.0%; P < .001). In trial B, at 3 months, 12.5% (95% CI, 11.3%-13.7%) of patients in the clinician endorsement arm completed a mammogram compared with 11.4% (95% CI, 10.3%-12.5%) of those in the standard messaging arm, which was not significant (absolute difference, 1.1%; 95% CI, -0.5% to 2.7%; P = .18). In the text messaging comparison arms, 13.2% (95% CI, 12.0%-14.4%) of patients receiving a text message completed a mammogram compared with 10.7% (95% CI, 9.7%-11.8%) of those in the no text messaging arm, a significant increase (absolute difference, 2.5%; 95% CI, 0.8%-4.0%; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings show that text messaging women after initial breast cancer screening outreach via either electronic portal or mailings, as well as bulk ordering with or without text messaging, can increase mammogram completion rates.",

Patients in the no order arms received either a patient portal message or a mailed letter indicating that they were overdue for mammography screening, with instructions to request an order from their primary care clinician. Patients randomized to the bulk order arms received an order for a bilateral screening mammogram (with diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound as needed), with the patient's primary care clinician included as the accountable clinician to receive the results. Orders were placed via a bulk ordering process by a designated practice physician based on region or department at the beginning of the trial. Electronic portal patients received a message and scheduling ticket through their portal, while letter patients received a printed order with the mailed letter. A follow-up message was sent to those who did not schedule or complete their mammogram 1 month after initial outreach in both arms via patient portal message or letter. In a 2-by-2 factorial design, patients were concurrently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to additionally receive or not receive text message reminders, resulting in arm A1, no order and no text message; arm A2, no order and text message; arm A3, bulk order and no text message; and arm A4, bulk order and text message. Patients in the text messaging arms (A2 or A4) received a series of 3 text messages, including an anticipatory text message and reminders at 2 weeks and 2 months. Patients had the option to reply \"Done\" if they had already completed their mammogram elsewhere or \"Support\" if they had questions. Date and location information submitted about prior screening was forwarded to a population health coordinator for follow-up. Patient questions were manually reviewed and responded to by research staff (E.O. and A.A.) or routed to the clinician if necessary. Text messaging was conducted using Way to Health, a National Institutes of Health-funded software platform that facilitates and automates many aspects of study design and intervention implementation.  23 Patients were excluded from reminder messaging if they were discovered to be currently in hospice, if they had metastatic cancer, or if another change in the health maintenance section of the EHR had occurred."

For trial A, we estimated a 7% response rate in the standard messaging arm (no bulk order, no text message) based on a prior pilot study (unpublished) and findings from other outreach activities.  21, 24 e estimated 27 335 eligible patients, with 10% attrition for screening obtained outside the system or additional exclusions, resulting in 24 602 trial patients. For the bulk order comparison, an estimated 12 301 in each arm would provide 99% power to detect a 1.5-percentage point increase in response rate in the bulk order arm compared with the no bulk order arm using the \u03c7 2 test of proportions, intention-to-treat protocol, and a 2-sided P < .05 as statistically significant. In a prespecified subgroup analysis, we analyzed patients who self-reported as Black, since there are known disparities in outcomes in this patient population. We anticipated a baseline response rate of 7% among Black patients. With 6944 Black patients in the trial (after 10% attrition), we estimated 87% power to detect a 2-percentage point increase in the bulk order arm.\n\nFor the text messaging comparison in trial A, we estimated a 10% response rate in the no text messaging arm. The eligible population of 24 602 would provide approximately 97% power to detect an increase in response rate of 1.5 percentage points in the text messaging arm. We did not anticipate an interaction between bulk ordering and text messaging. In a subgroup analysis of Black patients, we anticipated a baseline response rate of 10%. With 6944 Black patients in the trial, we estimated 98% power to detect a 3-percentage point increase in the response rate in the text messaging arm.\n\nFor trial B, we estimated a 5% response rate in the standard messaging arm (no clinician endorsement, no text message). We estimated 8482 eligible patients, with 10% attrition for screening obtained outside the system or additional exclusions, resulting in 7634 trial patients. For the clinician endorsement comparison, this estimate provided 96% power to detect a 2-percentage point increase in the clinician endorsement arm compared with the standard messaging arm.\n\nFor the text messaging comparison in trial B, we estimated a 6% response rate in the no text messaging arm. The estimated eligible population of 7634 would provide approximately 93% power to detect an increase in response rate of 2 percentage points in the text messaging arm compared with no text messaging. We did not anticipate an interaction between clinician endorsement and text messaging.\n\nFor the main comparisons (bulk ordering and text messaging in trial A and clinician endorsement and text messaging in trial B), we used the \u03c7 2 test for 2 proportions to calculate the difference in response rate and the 95% CI, along with a 2-sided P < .05 as statistically significant. Our hypotheses were that bulk ordering, text messaging, and clinician endorsement would increase response rates. We conducted similar analyses for the secondary outcome of mammogram completion at 6 months. We also performed subgroup analyses for the primary outcome using multivariable logistic models with treatment arm, age, race, ethnicity, income, patient portal status, and 1 treatment-bycovariate interaction at a time. We conducted likelihood ratio tests to examine significance of the interaction term in each model. We report the estimated log odds ratio along with the 95% CI for each interaction, which quantifies the differential effect of treatment between subgroups (relative to a reference group for categorical covariates), adjusting for all other covariates in the model. We also conducted a pooled analysis for text messaging response rate across both trials, adjusting for primary care region (region A vs region B). All analyses were performed using Stata, version 16.0 software (Stata Corp LP)."

      "text": "In these trials, we found that bulk ordering and text messaging significantly increased patient response to breast cancer screening outreach. There was a similar response to bulk ordering among women identifying as Black but no effect from an additional text message. Additionally, we did not find a statistically significant effect when the outreach was signed by the primary care clinician.\n\nThe bulk signed order resulted in a small but significant increase in response rate of 2.7 percentage points. There may be a few reasons for this finding. First, bulk ordering framed participation as opt-out, as participation was implied. Second, bulk ordering reduced effort for both clinicians and patients, as it reduced the number of steps toward completing the mammogram. Third, for patients with an active patient portal, bulk ordering also initiated a ticket for online scheduling.\n\nThese bulk order findings are consistent with literature on opt-out framing, but prior studies have shown larger effect sizes of 12 percentage points for influenza vaccination,  17  19 percentage points for mailed colorectal cancer screening,  15  and 24 percentage points for hepatitis C screening.  18 The majority of women across all arms in our study still did not undergo mammography during the trial time frame. Our modest finding may have resulted from the scheduling process, the need for a radiology procedure, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The influenza vaccination study was embedded in an onsite occupation health effort, colorectal cancer screening was a mailed home testing kit, and hepatitis C screening was a simple blood test. A study of opt-out framing for breast cancer screening at a Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic did not show effectiveness, potentially due to the need to schedule outside of the VA system.  25, 26 The findings of our study may be more similar to the VA study than to other preventive clinical areas, which focused on different behaviors.\n\nAdding text message nudges to the existing outreach messaging was associated with a 2.1-and 2.5-percentage point increase in trials A and B, respectively. The text message served as an additional nudge and allowed for bidirectional communication to respond if patients had already completed screening or if they needed additional support. Our findings are consistent with other text messaging studies for preventive health activities.  21, [27] [28] ] [29] [30]  We did not find an increase in obtaining a mammogram from text messaging among Black women, which is surprising as qualitative studies have shown acceptability and potential in the use of text messaging in this population.  31, 32 n trial B, there was a 1.1-percentage point higher response to the clinician endorsement letter that was not statistically significant. There are a few reasons that might explain this finding. First, patients may already have believed that the outreach was sanctioned by the primary care clinician due to the patient portal or health system letterhead. Second, these electronically produced signatures may not have invoked the same trust as a document that was manually signed by the primary care clinician. Third, we only had power to detect an approximately 2-percentage point increase in response, so there may have been a smaller effect size, which aligns with prior research on language or messaging content.  21, 28"

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "A key strength of this trial was the prospective individual-level randomization and close partnership with clinical operations. We used tools that are readily available to health systems, making the findings more scalable as part of routine practice. As there are known disparities in breast cancer outcomes, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis among the large proportion of patients who self-identified as Black.\n\nThere are also some limitations. The trial was a singlecenter study among mainly insured patients who reflected the demographics of the health system, but the primary care network included a wide range of practice types across a large region, and we conducted subgroup analyses by race and ethnicity and income. We were not able to evaluate the qualitative experiences of patients or the long-term effect on repeated breast cancer screening. In addition, we did not enroll as many patients as anticipated in the power calculations due to increases in screening through routine practice, better ascertainment of patients screened through health system efforts, and the decision to only include patients aged 40 to 49 years who had a shared decision-making discussion with their primary care clinician. However, we still had reasonable power to detect the differences we hypothesized."
