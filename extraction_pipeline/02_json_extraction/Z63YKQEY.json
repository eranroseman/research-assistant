  "title": "Does home blood pressure monitoring improve patient outcomes? A systematic review comparing home and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure control and patient outcomes",
  "abstract": "Objective: Our objective was to compare the clinical effectiveness of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on blood pressure (BP) control and patient outcomes. Design: A systematic review was conducted. We also appraised the methodological quality of studies. Data sources: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials (CENTRAL). Inclusion criteria: Randomized control trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, observational studies, and case-control studies published in English from any year to present that describe HBPM and 24-hour ABPM and report on systolic and/or diastolic BP and/or heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and/or all-cause mortality for adult patients. Due to the nature of the question, studies with only untreated patients were not considered. Results: Of 1,742 titles and abstractions independently reviewed by two reviewers, 137 studies met predetermined criteria for evaluation. Nineteen studies were identified as relevant and included in the paper. The common themes were that HBPM and ABPM correlated with cardiovascular events and mortality, and targeting HBPM or ABPM resulted in similar outcomes. Associations between BP measurement type and mortality differed by study population. Both the low sensitivity of office blood pressure monitoring (OBPM) to detect optimal BP control by ABPM and the added association of HBPM with cardiovascular mortality supported the routine use of HBPM in clinical practice. There was insufficient data to determine the benefit of using HBPM as a measurement standard for BP control. Conclusion: HBPM encourages patient-centered care and improves BP control and patient outcomes. Given the limited number of studies with both HBPM and ABPM, these measurement types should be incorporated into the design of randomized clinical trials within hypertensive populations.",

It has been shown that HBPM correlates with ABPM,  [6] [7] [8]  and cost and inconvenience are reasons why ABPM is not routinely recommended for the evaluation of patients with essential hypertension. 9, 10  HBPM is \"easy to perform, reliable, reproducible\",  [11] [12] [13]  and has the potential to reduce treatment costs, office visits, and the number of medications. 12, 14, 15  Furthermore, HBPM independently predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 16, 17  To date, it is unknown whether physicians can target HBPM for hypertension treatment. Few studies have examined the use of medication intensification guided by HBPM. 18  However, the current clinical standard of OBPM is less likely related to target organ damage and may have less prospective value than HBPM. 19, 20  This review summarizes available data to answer the following question: \"How does HBPM compare with ABPM as a measurement standard for determining BP control and patient outcomes?\""

Studies were grouped into three main categories by study outcome: mortality, target organ damage, and BP control (Table  1 ). Five studies investigated associations between BP measurement type (eg, OBPM, HBPM, and ABPM) and mortality. These studies consisted of observational analyses in distinct populations, including patients with CKD or end-stage kidney disease in the United States,  22, 23  patients $60 years of age from a single primary care practice in Belgium,  24  and the general populations in Japan  25  and Italy.  26 Sample sizes ranged from 210 to 2,051 participants with median follow-up times between 2.4 and 12.3 years (Table  1 ).\n\nFour studies compared target organ damage between the different BP measurement types. Target organ damage was measured as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, left ventricular hypertrophy by either electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, pulse wave velocity, or flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery.

In patients with CKD or end-stage kidney disease, ABPM is a superior predictor of mortality.  22, 23 For persons $60 years of age, HBPM is as good or better than ABPM when predicting mortality in older patients.  24 In the general population, additional BP information regardless of measurement type (OBPM, HBPM, and ABPM) contributes to cardiovascular risk.  26 However, only BP assessed by HBPM and ABPM is associated with all-cause mortality.  25 ata describing associations between BP measurement type and target organ damage are limited with only four studies meeting inclusion criteria. In general, arterial stiffness (measured by pulse wave velocity), albuminuria, and left ventricular mass were associated with changes in BP regardless of measurement type.  18, 28 egarding BP control, benefits emerge when including HBPM.

Correlation of \u2206SBP between HBPM and ABPM was 0.14 low sensitivity of office BP to detect optimal BP control by ABPM  30  and the added association of HBPM with cardiovascular mortality  26  all support the use of HBPM when treating hypertension. It is not surprising that routine use of HBPM has been recommend for almost a decade.  40 Currently, the American Heart Association, the American Society of Hypertension, and the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association suggest that HBPM be incorporated into usual care.  41 y comparison, HBPM has some advantages over ABPM. The availability of affordable BP monitoring devices has allowed individuals to measure and record BPs repeatedly throughout their course of treatment. In contrast, ABPM is not directly available to patients, and its high cost presents a barrier to initial and repeated testing. By requiring the individual to wear the cuff and monitor continuously, ABPM does interfere with daily activities and sleep. Although, any advantage in convenience or comfort with HBPM is weighed against the superior standardization of BP measurement and the acquisition of sleep-time BP data by 24-hour ABPM.\n\nIt is important to note that large randomized trials investigating hypertension treatment have targeted BP measured during study visits, similar to OBPM, when evaluating medication efficacy and participant outcomes. For this reason, HBPM should not supplant OBPM. While the addition of HBPM will help physicians to identify patients with maskeduncontrolled hypertension (ie, individuals controlled in the office yet uncontrolled at home), in patients with low home BPs, HBPM data can adversely affect treatment decisions. The study by Bailey et al offers a reminder to physicians that care must be taken when incorporating HBPM data into treatment strategies. Physician behavior was influenced by HBPM readings and resulted in fewer prescribed medications; systolic BP by 24-hour ABPM was 137\u00b13 mmHg for the group randomized to HBPM compared with 130\u00b13 mmHg in the usual care group.  37 owever, HBPM can improve BP control through its indirect effects on patients. HBPM encourages patient-centered care. Self-monitoring of BP reminds patients of the importance of medication adherence and healthy lifestyle factors. The study by Fuchs et al supports these indirect effects of self-monitoring. Participating in HBPM alone improved BP control.  38"

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "In the review process, we identified numerous studies with both HBPM and ABPM data that were designed as validation studies for BP monitoring devices. While these studies do contain information regarding BP control, they did not align with our interpretation of the outcome of BP control. Variability existed in the timing of HBPM both in the length of monitoring time (2-14 days) and in the frequency of measurement (two to six times per day). On the other hand, ABPM was more consistent with measurements every 15-20 minutes while awake and 15-30 minutes while asleep for a total of 24-44 hours.\n\nAn important distinction between HBPM and ABPM is the inclusion of nocturnal measurements with ABPM. We did not pursue outcome associations with isolated nocturnal hypertension. Furthermore, this study examined the effect of BP measurement type on BP control and clinical outcomes, yet did not attempt to answer the question of what is the goal BP."
