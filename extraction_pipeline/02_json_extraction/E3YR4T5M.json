      "text": "J ust-in-time adaptive interventions ( JITAIs), also known as dynamic tailoring,  1  ecological momentary interventions,  2  and intelligent real-time therapy,  3  represent an intervention design that adjusts the provision and type of support over time to deal with an individual's changing status and contexts, which intend to deliver the most appropriate support on the right occasion.  4, 5 The microrandomized trial (MRT) design has been proposed in recent years as a novel experimental design to construct evidence-based JITAIs. According to this design, participants are sequentially randomized to different intervention options (e.g., whether to send a text message).  6, 7 iefly speaking, JITAIs involve strategies that determine when to intervene and which intervention to provide, while MRTs focus on the optimization of such strategies by selecting and optimizing intervention components for use in a JITAI.\n\nThere are 2 key concepts that distinguish JITAIs from standard interventions: just-in-time and adaptive.  5 By just-in-time, JITAIs intend to intervene only when needed to alleviate the intervention fatigue and low engagement problems. On the other hand, adaptive refers to the strategy employed by the intervention design to determine which intervention to provide and when to intervene according to the user's ongoing information. To capture the right timings, JITAIs require continuous monitoring of the user's internal state and contexts, typically via sensors in mobile phones or wearable devices. As a result, delivering just-in-time interventions face to face is not feasible in practice; JITAIs heavily rely on the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies.  5 e JITAI in mHealth has the potential to enhance health care and reduce health disparities,  8, 9  benefiting various domains of public health research and practice.\n\nThe MRT has been deliberately introduced to assist with developing these interventions, which can provide information about the dynamics of the best intervention beyond theories and directly inform the construction of JITAIs.  6 Nevertheless, JITAIs and MRTs have not yet been widely adopted in public health, partly because of the unfamiliarity with the concepts, designs, and analysis methods.\n\nWith this article, we aim to introduce key ideas in JITAIs, especially focusing on the novel experimental design of MRTs, covering both classical MRT design and its outcome-adaptive counterpart. We discuss the main characteristics of JITAIs along with their potential in public health by relating to 2 mHealth studies with embedded MRT design. We also highlight statistical considerations when designing and analyzing MRTs."

      "text": "The JITAI is an intervention design aiming to deliver adaptive and personalized support only at the time when needed.  4, 5 JITAI consists of 6 key components: decision points, tailoring variables, intervention options, decision rules, proximal outcomes, and distal outcomes. 5  The specific definitions are summarized in Box 1. A  intervention option is selected at each decision point based on the values of tailoring variables via a predefined decision rule. The intervention is expected to achieve the distal outcomes by directly impacting the proximal outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, the MRT is an experimental design that provides evidence for building JITAIs. It involves the serial randomization of individuals to different intervention options at each decision point.  5 In general, they can answer several essential research questions arising from the construction of JITAIs:  6, 7  1.

The collected data allowed for pre-post analysis (i.e., the difference in depression and anxiety levels before and after receiving Stay-Well messages and the differential effects on mood ratings for the 2 categories of messages and different timings). The pre-post analysis has already been published, 11 while the analysis of MRT data is still underway. Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation. The DIAMANTE trial aimed to evaluate the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application targeting diabetes and depression management through an intermediate outcome representing physical activity. 12 This 6-month MRT study consisted of patients aged 18 to 75 years being treated at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital who had been diagnosed with diabetes and documented depressive symptoms. Figure 2 presents an overview of the design of this study. The distal outcome was the improvement of clinical outcomes for comorbid diabetes and depression among lowincome, low-health literacy, and ethnic minority individuals. Because lack of physical activity is an overlapping risk factor for these diseases, the embedded intervention was focused on improving an easy-to-measure proximal outcome (i.e., changes in daily step count). A multicomponent intervention consisting of motivational messages (4 categories) and feedback messages (5 categories) were adopted in DIAMANTE. Many contextual variables were collected during the study, including time-independent variables such as demographics, mobile technology familiarity, and other engagement measures, and time-varying variables such as study day and day of the week. The decision point was determined either by uniform randomization or some algorithm among 4 time-frames-that is, 9 AM to 11:30 AM, 11:30 AM to 2 PM, 2 PM to 4:30 PM, and 4:30 PM to 7 PM. At the macro level, this study is a randomized controlled trial with 3 groups, including a uniform random messaging group, an outcome-adaptive messaging group operationalized through reinforcement learning (RL), and a control group. Participants in the control group received no intervention during the study. With 3 groups, it enables the comparison of adaptive messaging to uniform messaging and no intervention. In the initial 2 weeks, uniform randomization was employed in both the uniform random messaging group and the adaptive messaging group to speed up algorithm learning. After that, the uniform random messaging group used a classical MRT design. Patients received up to 2 randomly selected messages per day within 4 randomly selected timeframes. For the adaptive messaging group, the message categories and timing were chosen by a reinforcement learning algorithm (i.e., linear Thompson sampling). 13 During the conduct of the trial, a JITAI is constructed concurrently, and its characteristics are summarized in Box 1. Data collection for this MRT is currently under way."

      "title": "Key Design Elements",
      "text": "As an experimental design for empirically informing the construction of JITAIs, the design elements of an MRT study should be tightly connected with JITAI components. The intervention and tailoring variables included in a JITAI are usually supported by theoretical and empirical evidence. An intervention may consist of several components, and each of them may have multiple options. MRTs can be used to assess the proximal effects of 1 or more components simultaneously (e.g., motivational and feedback messages in DIAMANTE).\n\nDuring an MRT, it is essential to collect potential tailoring variables, including individual information and external contexts. These variables can serve as an indicator of individual availability.  14 In the HeartSteps I study, if a participant was driving or already walking, it was considered inappropriate to deliver an activity suggestion, and, thus, the participant was considered unavailable.  15 tential moderation effects can also be investigated by collecting these In some cases, the distal outcomes are sustainable behavior change with limited knowledge of corresponding mediators; hence, proximal outcomes can also be short-term measures of the distal outcome.  5 For example, daily mood rating is an intermediate measure of depression and anxiety and can be an appropriate proximal outcome.  10 te that the distal outcome can be affected by the intervention through multiple causal pathways, leading to a multivariate proximal outcome at each decision time in practice. 5 For example, the proximal outcomes in DIAMANTE and StayWell at Home concern the mechanism lying behind the clinical condition. However, the engagement with intervention may also affect the distal outcome and can be targeted by a JITAI. 5 During an MRT, each participant may be randomized hundreds or even thousands of times (e.g., 180 times in DIA-MANTE and 60 times in StayWell at Home). Randomization permits valid estimation of the intervention's timevarying proximal effects, as it balances unobserved covariates between the intervention options. An important design element of an MRT is randomization probability-that is, the probability of assigning participants to each option of the intervention component. They are motivated by both scientific and practical considerations. For example, assigning higher probabilities to less-demanding options may reduce participant burden. According to whether the randomization probabilities are updated to prioritize the intervention appearing to be optimal, MRTs can be further categorized as classical (e.g., in StayWell at Home) or outcome-adaptive (e.g., in DIAMANTE). 16 We will illustrate these 2 versions of MRTs in the next section. Classical Vs Outcome-Adaptive Trial Design Within the classical MRTs, participants are repeatedly randomized to different intervention options according to a fixed time-invariant scheme (i.e., a scheme wherein the probabilities of being allocated to each intervention option remain uniform over time) or a time-varying allocation strategy, (i.e., a strategy wherein the randomization probabilities depend on the individual's previous observations). 17,18 Specifically, the latter seeks to avoid excess burden by constraining the number of interventions per day and to spread the interventions uniformly across different strata of decision points (e.g., stressed minutes or nonstressed minutes). 19 However, classical MRTs focus on post-data-collection JITAI optimization (i.e., data analysis is conducted at the end of the trial [known as \"offline\" learning in the computer science literature]). Such classical MRTs share similarities with the traditional fixed design (with fixed randomization probabilities) or the biased coin design (with time-varying randomization probabilities) of randomized clinical trials, 20 where interventions appearing to be desirable for users (i.e.,\n\nshowing better effectiveness) cannot be prioritized during the trial. The goal is to collect high-quality data that may inform practices for future patients, while participants of the current trial cannot benefit from the new findings.  16 r outcome-adaptive MRTs, the randomization probabilities are adaptively changed in favor of intervention options with superior performance or the highest expected proximal outcome.  16 An essential feature of outcome-adaptive MRTs is that the randomization probabilities are continually adjusted so that the user is assigned to an intervention appearing to be optimal with a higher The outcome-adaptive MRT design is more ethical and efficient when compared with its classical counterpart.\n\nFirst, it can benefit current participants as the intervention delivery is continually optimized to their current context,  16  intending to maximize the cumulative proximal outcomes. The design algorithm can also uncover effective predictors of the right timings when users are more likely to benefit from support and can monitor changes in these predictors, triggering appropriate interventions when needed.  16 Furthermore, the outcome-adaptive MRT may save money by avoiding the collection of useless covariates (i.e., covariates not moderating the intervention effects).\n\nMore importantly, data collected from outcome-adaptive MRTs can also be used for deriving causal effects and informing offline JITAI construction.\n\nBoth mHealth and reinforcement learning literatures have provided ways for the analysis of MRTs with time-varying randomization probabilities.  21, 22 spite that, some drawbacks, such as the increase in trial complexity and the statistical inefficiency caused by unequal allocation,  23"

These populations may experience higher prevalence and worse outcomes for both diabetes and depression, and, at the same time, they may lack access to health care. Because of the demonstrated effectiveness of DIAMANTE messages, 28 deploying these mHealth interventions can potentially decrease disparities in health care by reaching vulnerable populations. More importantly, JITAIs have a distinct advantage in capturing the exact moment of users' needs and providing just-in-time support only when it is more likely to benefit the user. As a result, JITAIs may alleviate the practical issues of low engagement and declining effectiveness over time faced by many conventional mHealth interventions, which are delivered uniformly to users without taking into account the contexts and individual information.
