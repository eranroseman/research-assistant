  "abstract": "Background: Implementation of digital health technologies has grown rapidly, but many remain limited to pilot studies due to challenges, such as a lack of evidence or barriers to implementation. Overcoming these challenges requires learning from previous implementations and systematically documenting implementation processes to better understand the real-world impact of a technology and identify effective strategies for future implementation. Objective: A group of global experts, facilitated by the Geneva Digital Health Hub, developed the Guidelines and Checklist for the Reporting on Digital Health Implementations (iCHECK-DH, pronounced \"I checked\") to improve the completeness of reporting on digital health implementations. Methods: A guideline development group was convened to define key considerations and criteria for reporting on digital health implementations. To ensure the practicality and effectiveness of the checklist, it was pilot-tested by applying it to several real-world digital health implementations, and adjustments were made based on the feedback received.

      "text": "In recent years, we have seen an exponential increase in the implementation of digital health technologies, as more and more health care organizations, providers, governments, and users recognize the benefits they can bring. From improving access to care and reducing costs to enhancing the patient experience and enabling more personalized care, the potential of digital health is vast and continues to grow.\n\nA major challenge in digital health is that despite the rapid growth of digital health solutions, many of these implementations remain limited to pilot studies and fail to achieve widespread adoption. This phenomenon, known as \"pilotitis\" or \"pilotitis syndrome,\" refers to the tendency to focus on small, short-term pilot projects rather than implementing health technologies at scale.\n\nThere are several reasons digital health implementations may not progress beyond the pilot stage: The pilot does not provide sufficient evidence of effectiveness or value to justify a wider rollout  [1] , or there are challenges or barriers to implementation that are not addressed or resolved during the pilot phase, such as resistance from health care providers, a lack of stakeholder engagement, or policy-level barriers  [2] [3] [4] . However, moving to widespread adoption of digital health technologies is critical to realizing their full potential. This means carefully assessing the evidence for the effectiveness and value of a technology, understanding and addressing the challenges or barriers to implementation, and developing strategies for scaling up successful pilots.\n\nOvercoming implementation challenges in digital health requires learning from previous implementations, for example, by documenting implementation processes in a standardized format using reporting guidelines. Systematically learning from implementations enables a better understanding of the real-world impact of a technology, including its long-term effectiveness and unintended consequences. This can inform the development and implementation of future digital health implementations by identifying effective strategies and areas for improvement."

      "title": "Digital Health Implementations and Interventions",
      "text": "For this paper, intervention refers to the deliberate effort to change a situation or modify behavior, and implementation refers to the process of achieving the goal (how the intervention was carried out). Digital health is defined as the use of information and communication technologies for health. As with this definition, the scope is broad, and interventions can range from targeting an individual to strengthening components of health systems. Examples include tracking individual parameters, managing logistics for vaccine delivery, or conducting advanced data analytics for precision medicine. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Classification of Digital Health Interventions provides a good overview of the potential range of applications by organizing them into 4 umbrella groups based on the target primary user: (1) interventions for clients, (2) interventions for health care providers, (3) interventions for health system or resource managers, or (4) interventions for data services  [5] ."

      "title": "Existing Guidelines",
      "text": "The value of standardized guidelines is well recognized. Various guidelines and tools exist for reporting scientific evidence, such as the Preferred Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  [6] , the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for randomized controlled trials  [7] , the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR)  [8] , the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)  [9] , the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR)  [10] , or the Case Report (CARE) statement and checklist  [11] .\n\nIn the field of digital health, the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online Telehealth (CONSORT-EHEALTH)  [12]  is an extension of the CONSORT statement that provides guidance on reporting trials of web-based interventions (eHealth) or mobile health (mHealth). It consists of 17 essential subitems. Notably, there are 4 subitems that relate to the important issue of attrition (not using) and use (engagement, dosage, adherence) of the intervention, which are often underestimated, even though they are critical factors in influencing the future impact of an intervention. There is further potential to use the checklist beyond web-based and mobile interventions and in settings where a lack of internet connectivity would not be a limiting factor. This will require further research into the specifics of such cases.\n\nFinally, the mHealth Evidence Reporting and Assessment (mERA) checklist  [13] , developed by the WHO-led mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group (mTERG), aims to improve the completeness of reporting of mHealth interventions. The checklist seeks to identify \"a minimum set of information needed to define what the mHealth intervention is (content), where it is implemented (context), and how it has been implemented (technical features) to support replicating the intervention\"  [13] . In its conclusions, mTERG clearly emphasized that the mERA checklist \"is intended not only to assist authors in reporting mHealth research, but also to guide reviewers and policy makers in synthesising high-quality evidence, and finally to guide journal editors in critically assessing the transparency and completeness of reporting of mHealth studies\"  [13] . These guidelines are unique in that they are specific to 1 type of digital health intervention, but they also provide practical information about how to report technical details that go beyond simply reporting the design of a study and its scientific protocol. Lessons should then be learned to replicate the specific mHealth intervention described in the report.\n\nAlthough both CONSORT-EHEALTH and mERA address reporting, the Guidelines and Checklist for the Reporting on Digital Health Implementations (iCHECK-DH, pronounced \"I checked\") focus on the standardization of implementation reporting. CONSORT-EHEALTH is designed for reporting trials and provides a basis for improving transparency and consistency in the presentation of research on eHealth interventions, while mERA is tailored to mHealth interventions and provides a framework for assessing and reporting the evidence generated by these studies.\n\nThe literature review highlights the existence of various standards and guidelines for reporting scientific evidence and interventions; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no guidelines supporting the reporting of digital health implementations and processes. Therefore, a global expert review panel was convened to fill this gap, resulting in the guidelines for the reporting of digital health implementations (iCHECK-DH). iCHECK-DH aims to improve our understanding of the intricacies of implementing digital health interventions in real-world settings by streamlining the documentation of implementation processes and contextual factors surrounding the use of digital health interventions.\n\nThis paper aims to describe the objectives, development process, and items of iCHECK-DH."

      "title": "Methodology",
      "text": "The methodology outlined by Moher et al  [14]  was used to develop iCHECK-DH.\n\nTo define the initial draft list of reporting items, we conducted a literature review that included searching multiple databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) for papers describing digital health implementations in different settings. Papers that focused on digital health technologies but did not discuss implementation were excluded. A set of 10 selected papers from different settings (eg, primary care, community care) were reviewed for common reporting elements as input for the first draft checklist. This initial draft checklist was developed by a team of 2 researchers and reviewed for completeness by a range of global stakeholders with different backgrounds and roles (researchers, implementers, technical experts). This resulted in a preliminary list of 27 reporting items.\n\nA guideline development group of 18 experts was then established in September 2022 to support the development of the guidelines and checklist. The group includes experts from different areas of digital health, such as policy experts, funders, researchers, and implementation stakeholders. A 3-step modified Delphi method was used to review the checklist and reach a consensus on the items and whether they should be mandatory (see Figure  1 ). In round 1, participants in the guideline development group reviewed the draft checklist and got an opportunity to add additional items. In round 2, the completed checklist was circulated to the experts, and they were asked to rate each item in terms of importance and whether it should be mandatory. Rankings were summarized using the median (IQR) and included in a repeat version of the questionnaire. The IQR is a measure of statistical dispersion and can be used as a measure of consensus among specialists, defined as a difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles or a range between upper and lower quartiles.\n\nIn round 3, the experts reranked their agreement with each statement, with the option to change their score in the light of the group response. Round 3 rankings were summarized and assessed for consensus using IQRs for continuous numerical scales and were accepted if the IQR was 2 or less. The result was a preliminary checklist, which was presented to the expert group in the consensus meeting.\n\nIn November 2022, the Geneva Digital Health Hub (gdhub) at the University of Geneva, initiator of the guidelines process, convened 2 different consensus expert meetings in Geneva and online. During these meetings, each item was discussed and some items were reorganized and regrouped, resulting in a final list of 20 items, the content and structure of which was agreed upon by all members of the guideline development group.\n\nSelected items from the final checklist were tested in 2 workshops at international digital health conferences (Kathmandu, November 2022; Washington, December 2022). The full checklist was then applied to report on implementations (with different scales, contexts, and settings) to test its applicability and comprehensiveness. An implementation report for 3 of these was submitted for publication  [15] [16] [17] ."

Mandatory items were assessed as essential information to be provided by the authors of the intervention.\n\nThe format of the checklist may be used for reporting. However, authors can change the order of the items if they keep the items under the subheadings. Authors should report on all mandatory items, and if they do not report on a mandatory item, an explanation should be provided (eg, if there is no evaluation, provide a detailed explanation of the reasons)."

Concerto is a mobile application designed to promote patient empowerment in an in-patient setting. Methods: The application was designed and prototyped during a hackathon. It uses data from the hospital information system to provide key functionalities: a care plan, access to targeted medical information, practical information, information about the nursing team on duty, and a medical round preparation module. Following a feasibility study, funding was obtained, and the application developed using an agile methodology and deployed in 4 pilot divisions, using institution-owned iPads. Results: The project lasted for two years with effective implementation in the 4 pilot divisions, within budget. The induced workload on caregivers was a key challenge that warranted a change in our implementation strategy. The presence of a killer-function would have facilitated the deployment. Furthermore, our experience is in line with the well-accepted need for both a high-quality user-training and a good selection and engagement of super-users. By presenting Health Information System data directly to the patient, Concerto has highlighted them to be not fit-for-purpose and has triggered data curation initiatives. Finally, connecting the application to the HIS has promoted the usage of standards, both on the HIS and mobile applications side, that should facilitate future initiatives. Discussion: This implementation report presents a real-world example of implementing a patient-empowering mobile application in an in-patient setting of a University Hospital.

This will help improve the systematic documentation and transfer of knowledge about digital health implementations, enabling lessons learned in one context to be applied in another. The use of these guidelines will also support the development of a body of evidence on digital health implementations that can be used to inform the effectiveness of digital health interventions and inform decision-making by researchers, practitioners, and policy makers.\n\nIt is important to note that iCHECK-DH is likely to evolve over time to reflect changing ecosystems as new technologies and implementation strategies will emerge. For example, they may need to be updated to address emerging issues or new types of digital health interventions. In addition, these guidelines will be applied to the Implementation Report section of the JMIR Journal of Medical Informatics  [42] . Feedback from the application of these guidelines to a wider range of implementations may lead to modifications.\n\nBy following these guidelines, researchers and practitioners can ensure that their implementation reports are complete, accurate, and consistent, thereby facilitating understanding and learning from their work. This can ultimately lead to the development of more effective digital health interventions and better health outcomes for the populations served. In addition, the use of these guidelines can help promote transparency and accountability in digital health, allowing stakeholders to better understand the successes and challenges of different implementations."
