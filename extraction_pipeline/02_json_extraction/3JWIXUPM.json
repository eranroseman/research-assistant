  "title": "Collection of patient-reported outcomes; -text messages on mobile phones provide valid scores and high response rates",
  "abstract": "Background: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases have expressed a need for more frequent measurement of relevant outcomes, due to the variations in their symptoms during the day and from day to day. At present, patient-reported outcomes are extensively collected with questionnaires completed with pen and paper. However, as a measurement tool in frequent data collection the questionnaires are impractical. In contrast, text messages on mobile phones are suitable for frequent data collection. The aim of this study was two-fold; to compare daily registrations of patient-reported outcomes assessed with text-messages on mobile phones (SMS) or with questionnaires completed with pen and paper (P&P), with regard to scores and variation of scores, and to examine feasibility of the SMS method in a multicentre clinical study. Methods: To compare scores, 21 patients with an inflammatory, rheumatic disease performed daily assessments of pain, fatigue, stiffness and ability to carry out daily activities on a numeric rating scale (NRS). The patients were asked to assess the variables every other day with the SMS method and every other day with the P&P method for 28 consecutive days. In total each participant had to answer 14 P&P forms and 14 SMS messages. Mean scores and variation, expressed as the pooled standard deviation or as the average range between the maximum and minimum scores for the two methods, were compared using paired sample t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. To examine feasibility, 36 patients with an inflammatory, rheumatic disease assessed the same four variables with SMS twice a week for 35 weeks. Feasibility of the SMS method was expressed as mean response-rate (%) in the total group and per centre. Results: Mean scores, standard deviation of mean scores and mean range scores did not differ significantly between the two methods (p > 0.05). Response-rate with the SMS method was 97.9% for the whole group and for the three centres 97.1%, 98.3% and 98.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Outcomes assessed on numeric rating scales and reported with text-messages on mobile phones or with questionnaires completed with pen and paper provide comparable scores. Further, the SMS method provided high response rates (> 97%) in a multicentre setting. Our results encourage the use of text messages on mobile phones in studies requiring frequent data collection and real-time assessment, as in fluctuating diseases such inflammatory, rheumatic diseases.",

      "text": "Inflammatory rheumatic joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are chronic and often disabling diseases causing pain, fatigue and functional limitations. Symptoms can vary both during the day and over time, even in patients with a stable disease  [1] . In fact, the daily variation in pain, fatigue and global disease activity has been shown to be substantial  [2] .\n\nPatient-reported health status is considered a key element in the assessment of rheumatic diseases and is part of the recommended core measures in clinical studies  [3] . Patients have expressed a need for more frequent measurement of relevant outcomes, due to the variations in symptoms during the day and from day to day  [4, 5] . In rheumatologic practice and research patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are extensively collected with questionnaires completed with pen and paper (P&P). However, as a measurement tool in frequent data collection the P&P method is impractical and partly unreliable as the registrations are not always filled in at the intended time  [6] . In contrast, text messages on mobile phones (SMS) are suitable for frequent data collection. Further, the messages are time stamped and thus real-time assessments, a feature precluding retrospective data reporting.\n\nIn a review addressing whether computer-administered methods were comparable to their P&P forms, 12 studies within rheumatology were identified  [7] . All studies concluded that scores obtained via computer-administered methods and P&P forms were comparable, but none of the studies applied the SMS as a data collection method. To our knowledge, the SMS format has not been compared to the established method of P&P forms in frequent data collection or been evaluated for feasibility in clinical studies in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.\n\nThe aim of this study was two-fold 1. To compare daily registrations of patient-reported outcomes assessed with text-messages on mobile phones (SMS) or with pen and paper (P&P), with regard to scores and variation of scores. 2. To examine feasibility of the SMS method in a multicentre clinical study."

      "text": "Every day the patients reported pain, fatigue, stiffness and ability to carry out daily activities on four numerical rating scales (NRS) ranging from 0 -100 (0 = no pain/fatigue/ stiffness/my disease do not hinder daily activities, 100 = worst possible pain/fatigue/stiffness/my disease completely hinder daily activities). Every other day the four variables were reported with SMS and every other day with P&P for 28 consecutive days. In total each patient had to complete 14 questionnaires (P&P) and 14 text messages (SMS).\n\nThe SMS method has a 160 characters limit per message, thus the text on the questionnaires was abbreviated to the following text:\n\nState degree of pain, fatigue, stiffness and how the disease affects your ability to conduct daily activities at present. 0 = best possible, 10 = worst possible. Remember full stop separating the numbers. Thank you! This text is 160 characters in Norwegian. Complete text, equal to the text on the questionnaires, was printed on small cards that the patients could carry with them. When receiving the SMS message, the patients scored each of the four variables and separated the scores with a period. A correct SMS response could for instance be: \"1.5.7.3\". If no SMS response to the initial message was returned within 24 hours, it was recorded as missing. Data from the SMS were directly transferred electronically via the mobile phone network to a central, secure server. Through a secure website, the researcher could check the status of the responses and download the data for analysis into the statistical software package (Figure  1 ).\n\nCompleted P&P forms were put in postage prepaid envelopes and returned to the researcher at end of each week. Data from the paper forms were entered manually into the statistical software package (SPSS, version 20)."

All 21 patients reported disease duration >1 year, of which 90% (18 patients) reported disease duration >6 years. All patients included in the analysis had three or less missing paper questionnaires or text messages.\n\nThere was no significant difference in mean scores reported with the SMS method compared to the mean scores reported with the P&P method (Table  1 ).\n\nThe variations in the four variables, expressed as the pooled standard deviation of the mean scores (SD) or as the mean range scores were comparable between the two methods (Table  1 ). In total 2508 SMS were sent out. Fifty-two of the SMS were not returned, resulting in a response rate of 97.9% in the total group. Each patient received around 70 SMS, 10 (27.8%) patients responded to all SMS, 24 (66.7%) patients missed \u2264 3 SMS, and none of the patients missed \u2265 5 SMS during the 35 week study period.\n\nResponse-rates at each of the centres were 97.1% (816 of 840 possible), 98.3% (971 of 988 possible) and 98.4% (669 of 680 possible), respectively. Sixteen (30.7%) of the missing responses were due to using a letter instead of a number (6 SMS), technical problems with the server (8 SMS) or reporting numbers outside the range of 0 -10 (2 SMS). Two-hundred and thirty-eight (9.5%) reminder SMS were sent out, of which 210 (87.7%) were answered."

      "text": "As far as we know, no other studies have compared patient reported outcomes assessed with mobile phones (SMS) and paper questionnaires (P&P) in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. A review comparing whether computer-administered tests were equivalent to their P&P forms concluded that health scores obtained via the two modalities were directly comparable  [7] . The review used a test-retest correlation as the standard of comparison. It might be argued that an average weighted correlation is a more appropriate measure of agreement between the two methods than the mean scores and their standard deviation as used in our study. However, as we have 14 repeated measurements within each method per patient, calculation of an average weighted correlation would tend to even out the differences.\n\nWhen using a personal digital assistant or a computer it is possible to write more text than within a single SMS message. Because of the 160-character limit in the SMS format, we had to abbreviate the P&P questions. Our choice of presenting all four variables in one text message can be questioned. In a study evaluating feasibility of SMS for asthma diary data collection the patients complained of receiving a sequence of three SMS instead of just one  [8] . Presenting more than one message implies a delay between the user's reply to the message and the reception of the next message of approximately one minute. This is the time needed for the reply message to reach the server, the server to validate the reply and send out the next message and for the next message to reach the user  [9] . We decided to use one message per communication in order to decrease the risk of non-compliance and patients dropping out.\n\nWhen receiving the SMS message, the patients scored each of the four variables as a number code. In a study converting SMS answers into simple number codes, none of the participants reported any difficulty using the simple codes. In fact, the authors believed that simplifying the logistics was an important factor in achieving a high response rate  [9] .\n\nTo actually describe the individual course in a fluctuating condition such as inflammatory rheumatic diseases, data collection at regular and tight intervals are needed  [10, 11] . This requires real-time assessment and, as a consequence, methods of reporting that are not prone to retrospective data entries. It is well known that P&P registrations are not always filled in at the appropriate time  [6, 12, 13] . Retrospective data entry has implications on memory retrieval of symptom occurrence and intensity; that is, fluctuations during the week might be missed and patients might report symptoms as perceived during the last days rather than on daily basis  [13, 14] . The risk of retrospective reporting calls into question the reliability and validity of the P&P method in data collection of PROs. In contrast, the time stamped data collected with the SMS method precludes retrospective reporting and falsification of the data with regard to real time."

      "title": "Feasibility of the SMS method",
      "text": "Further, the SMS method was highly feasible in a multicentre clinical study with frequent data collection of patient-reported outcomes.\n\nWe interpreted response-rates as a measure of feasibility and found a mean response-rate of 97.9% over a 35 week period. Two studies on patients with low back pain, another fluctuating condition, have reported response-rates of 63% and 82.5%, respectively  [15, 16] . The latter was a multicentre study where the patients were followed weekly for 6 months and 11% of the patients were telephoned personally for reminders  [16] . In our study a reminder SMS was sent out to 9.5%. Our results indicate that patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease were comfortable with the SMS method and that the method is highly feasible in a multicentre setting.\n\nThe fact that mobile phone ownership is high across the world and that people carry their phones with them almost all time make the mobile phones feasible tools for frequent data assessments  [17] . Further, a high proportion of patients up to age 65 were successfully using SMS despite older age or functional disability caused by rheumatic diseases  [18] . From the clinician and researcher's point of view, the SMS method is more feasible than its P&P equivalent. The SMS method may lead to a reduction in data management burden, processing time and costs compared to the P&P data collection method  [6] [7] [8] 19] ."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "A limitation of the SMS method is the 160-character limit per message. This affects the number of questions one can pose, as well as the amount of information the responses can contain. Further, patient mistakes during data entry are possible, i.e. using letters instead of numbers, not separating the numbers with a period, or sending responses outside the range; all mistakes that are interpreted by the server as a non-response. In our study we predefined responses outside the range of 0-10 as missing responses, while we accepted numbers separated by something other than the period, i.e. a space."

      "text": "The P&P collection method has an important place in clinical research. However, in studies requiring frequent data collection and real-time assessments, the SMS method may outperform the P&P method and provide high response rates. Questions suitable for SMS should be short and preferably answered in an equally short manner, thus the SMS method seems best suited for single-item instruments like the numeric rating scale."
