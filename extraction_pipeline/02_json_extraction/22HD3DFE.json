Bangladesh has one of the largest numbers of adults with diabetes in the South Asian region. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of a three-arm cluster randomised control trial of mHealth and community mobilisation interventions to prevent and control T2DM and non-communicable diseases' risk factors in rural Bangladesh (D-Magic trial). Methods and analysis The economic evaluation will be conducted as a within-trial analysis to evaluate the incremental costs and health outcomes of mHealth and community mobilisation interventions compared with the status quo. The analyses will be conducted from a societal perspective, assessing the economic impact for all parties affected by the interventions, including implementing agencies (programme costs), healthcare providers, and participants and their households. Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated in terms of cost per case of intermediate hyperglycaemia and T2DM prevented and cost per case of diabetes prevented among individuals with intermediate hyperglycaemia at baseline and cost per mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure. In addition to ICERs, the economic evaluation will be presented as a cost-consequence analysis where the incremental costs and all statistically significant outcomes will be listed separately. Robustness of the results will be assessed through sensitivity analyses. In addition, an analysis of equity impact of the interventions will be conducted."

Bangladesh has the second largest number of adults with diabetes in the South Asian region, with around 7 million adults aged 20-79 years with diabetes.  1 The prevalence of diabetes among adults (20-79 years old) in Bangladesh is estimated to be around 8.5%,  1 2  with a three to fourfold increase since the 1990s.  3 4 It is predicted that prevalence of diabetes in Bangladesh will reach 23.6% in men and 33.5% in women by 2030, unless preventive efforts are undertaken.  3 The increasingly high incidence of diabetes in Bangladesh has had a significant economic burden, in particular for people with diabetes, their families and the country's healthcare system. It is estimated that the annual health expenditure for diabetes is around US$218 million, where most of the costs born by the families.  5 nderlying the increasing prevalence of diabetes, globally and in Bangladesh, are complex genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, including changes in dietary habits and increases in risk factors like smoking and physical inactivity.  2  Effective interventions are available to prevent T2DM and to prevent the complications and premature death from diabetes.  2  The evidence from LMICs shows that lifestyle and other non-pharmacological interventions can prevent and delay the onset of T2DM and its complications.  6 However, there is a lack of cost-effective programmes designed specifically for Bangladeshi populations, taking into account their contextual needs and resources."

[8] [9] ] [10] [11]  However, there is little information on the cost and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions for the prevention and control of NCDs.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  Two recent systematic reviews of the economic evidence of mHealth  13  and mHealth for diabetes prevention and control  14  have shown that there are a handful of NCD and diabetes interventions that have reported cost and cost-effectiveness evidence. Nearly, all of these studies have been conducted in high-income settings. The majority of these studies report that mHealth interventions are cost-effective or cost saving, though the quality of reported evidence was not satisfactory in some of cases.  13 14 imilarly, although there is some evidence on effectiveness of community-based interventions in the management of T2DM in low-income settings,  [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]  there is little evidence on how cost-effective these interventions might be.  14 A recent review  14  has identified 10 community-based interventions on preventing and controlling diabetes. These interventions, which are largely implemented in high-income settings, have reported that community-based interventions are cost-effective or cost-saving approaches in the management of T2DM.  14 he current study will be the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of community mobilisation through PLA in the prevention of T2DM. This approach has previously been shown to be highly cost-effective in improving maternal and newborn health.  20 21 This study will also contribute to the evidence on cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions for preventing T2DM in LMIC settings."

Key informant interviews with project leads and monthly/quarterly staff time sheets will be used to allocate joint costs between the programme components.

A sample of 11 health facilities including 8 community clinics and 2 Health and Family Welfare centres (with equal numbers in control and intervention clusters), as well as 1 Upazila Health Complex/Hospital (which cover both control and intervention areas) was selected for baseline audits of diabetes and NCD services, estimating their resource utilisations and unit costs. Similar audits and cost data collection will be conducted for the same facilities post intervention in order to assess the changes in NCD service utilisation attributable to the D-Magic interventions. This data will be complemented by healthseeking behaviour information collected from the study participants in control and interventions clusters at the D-Magic end-line impact evaluation survey. Differences in service utilisation between intervention and control areas will be attributed to the D-Magic interventions.\n\nA simple audit and cost-capture tool was developed for facility data collection and piloted with facilities at different levels. Data from the cost-capture tool will be complemented by the existing data from the facility reports and published data. Costs of services provided by the facilities will be estimated using a step-down approach.  40 ny change in demand for services provided in the facilities other than those mentioned above and the services not covered by them, in intervention areas compared with the control, will be identified during the trial's routine monitoring and end-line impact evaluation survey.

These include changes in health-seeking behaviour, and changes in household lifestyles that might affect food and non-food consumption patterns and spending as well as time spent engaging in physical activities. It also includes the time (opportunity) cost of participation in the PLA group meetings and participating in the actions taken by the groups (table  1 ).\n\nHealthcare-seeking costs D-Magic may increase the participants and their households' seeking advice and care from both formal and informal providers for testing and treatment for hypertension, diabetes, prediabetes and other NCDs. Information on costs of care-seeking is collected from all the participants recruited in the project, at the baseline and end-line evaluation surveys. This information will be complemented by the data collected from the household consumption expenditure survey. The difference in spending for the participants and their households will be calculated and compared between intervention and control areas.\n\nChanges in household food and non-food expenditure Changes in food and non-food expenditure will be captured in a comprehensive household consumption and expenditure survey.

These costs include Open access the direct costs (eg, cost of getting to the group) and time cost of group participation (eg, travel time and time spent in the group) and participating in the actions taken by the group, or changing health and lifestyle behaviours. Information on the potential direct and time costs will be collected through a subsample survey of 312 group participants (both male and female), randomly selected. Sample size for the survey was primarily calculated to give sufficiently accurate estimate of group participants' characteristics.\n\nCost-effectiveness and cost-consequence analyses Economic evaluation will be conducted as a within-trial analysis using the intention-to-treat results, and will be presented in terms of ICERs, calculated as the difference in total costs of mHealth and community mobilisation interventions (plus HSS activities) versus HSS activities only (or control), divided by the difference in mean effects of each interventions versus control.  41 42 As mentioned previously, ICERs will be evaluated in terms of cost per case of intermediate hyperglycaemia and T2DM prevented and cost per case of T2DM prevented among individuals with intermediate hyperglycaemia at baseline, and for some of the secondary outcomes such as cost per mm Hg reduction in systolic BP. In addition to ICERs, the economic evaluation will be presented as a cost-consequence analysis where the incremental costs and all statistically significant outcomes will be listed separately, allowing policy-makers to compare the costs and all impacts/gains of the D-Magic interventions. Cost-consequence analysis has been recommended for complex public health interventions, such as D-Magic, that have multiple health and non-health impacts, which are difficult to measure in a common outcome unit.  42 43 ll costs will be presented in 2017 prices in Bangladeshi Taka and International Dollars (INT$). All costs will be adjusted for inflation using the Bangladeshi Consumer Price Index and will be converted to 2017 INT$ using the purchasing power parity conversion factor for Bangladesh. Moreover, both costs and outcomes will be discounted using a standard discount rate of 3%, as recommended by WHO-CHOICE  44  and the Gates/IDSi Reference Case for Economic Evaluation.  45 The impact of uncertainty in key parameters on the cost-effectiveness results will be assessed through a series of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Reporting of the study design, analytical methods and findings will follow the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.  46 The D-Magic interventions will be judged to be cost-effective and affordable (though, indirectly) against the WHO-CHOICE recommendation,  44  as well as recently developed cost-effectiveness thresholds.  47 he possibility of conducting an extended cost-effectiveness analysis  48  alongside modelling national scale up of the D-Magic interventions will be explored. Moreover, we will explore the possibility of running a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis using decision analytical modelling based on the relevant outcomes such as systolic BP, body mass index (if statistically significant) to predict future economic impacts from implementing the D-Magic interventions on the target population.\n\nstrengths and limitations of the study In order to increase transparency and minimise bias, publication and peer review of economic evaluation protocols is encouraged. This study reports planned data collection and analyses alongside a complex public health trial. The study will contribute to the scarce cost-effectiveness evidence on mHealth and community mobilisation interventions for preventing diabetes and NCDs.\n\nFurthermore, adopting a cost-consequence analysis approach makes it possible to report all health and non-health impacts of the D-Magic interventions, in addition to ICERs, which can assist policy-makers to make informed decisions in designing or implementing similar complex interventions. Incorporating equity impact analysis and CV are other strengths of this study, which provide useful information for future scale-up of the interventions.\n\nThe study design has one limitation. The D-Magic trial is not powered to test the differences between the mHealth and community mobilisation interventions due to the large sample size required and the resources available for the trial. However, the possibility of a direct comparison between the two interventions will be explored."
