  "abstract": "We estimate a bargaining model of competition between hospitals and managed care organizations (MCOs) and use the estimates to evaluate the effects of hospital mergers. We find that MCO bargaining restrains hospital prices significantly. The model demonstrates the potential impact of coinsurance rates, which allow MCOs to partly steer patients towards cheaper hospitals. We show that increasing patient coinsurance tenfold would reduce prices by 16%. We find that a proposed hospital acquisition in Northern Virginia that was challenged by the Federal Trade Commission would have significantly raised hospital prices. Remedies based on separate bargaining do not alleviate the price increases.",

      "text": "In many markets prices are negotiated by the relevant parties rather than set by one of the sides or determined by means of an auction. Price negotiation is commonplace and plays an important role in transactions that span many economically important industries. For example, retransmission rates between content providers and cable companies (Crawford   and Yurukoglu, 2012), the terms of trade between Amazon.com and book publishers, 1 and hospital prices in the health care markets that we study here are all determined by bilateral negotiations between small numbers of firms. In a bargaining framework, an increase in a party's leverage improves its terms of trade. One of the ways that parties can achieve better bargaining leverage is by merging.  2  In this paper we estimate a model of competition in which prices are negotiated between managed care organizations (MCOs) and hospitals. We use the estimates to investigate the extent to which hospital bargaining and patient coinsurance restrain prices and to analyze the impact of counterfactual hospital mergers and policy remedies. It is both important and policy relevant to analyze the impact of hospital competition. Over the last 25 years, hospital markets have become significantly more concentrated due to mergers (Gaynor and   Town, 2012), with the hospital industry having the most federal horizontal merger litigation of any industry.  3 Our analysis builds on and brings together three different literatures that (i) structurally estimate multi-party bargaining models; (ii) simulate the likely effect of mergers; and (iii) study competition in health care markets. Our contribution is in modeling the effect of final consumers paying some of the costs (through coinsurance); in our estimates of pricecost margins and policy-relevant counterfactuals; and in the way we estimate the model, which generalizes the equilibrium models commonly used in industrial organization that does not require data on downstream market outcomes. The approach we follow in this paper can be used more generally to understand mergers in industries where prices are determined by  1  See  http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/why-is-amazon-squeezing-hachette-maybe-it-really- needs-the-money/ 2 Theoretical results in the literature show that joint negotiation can lead to higher or lower prices, with the effect depending on the curvature of the value of the bargaining partner (Horn and Wolinsky (1988a); Chipty and Snyder (1999)). The empirical literature generally, but not unanimously, finds that larger firms are able to negotiate lower prices, all else equal (see Chipty, 1995; Sorensen, 2003; Ho, 2009).\n\n3 Since 1989, there have been thirteen federal hospital antitrust trials. Most recently, the Federal Trade Commission successfully challenged mergers in Toledo, OH (In the Matter of ProMedica Health System Inc. Docket No. 9346, 2011) and Rockford, IL (In the Matter of OSF Healthcare System and Rockford Health  System, Docket No. 9349, 2012).\n\n1 negotiation between differentiated sellers and a small numbers of \"gatekeeper\" buyers who act as intermediaries for end consumers.\n\nA standard way to model competition in differentiated product markets is with a Bertrand pricing game. In this industry patient demand for hospitals is very inelastic because patients pay little out of pocket for hospital stays, and therefore Bertrand competition between hospitals implies negative marginal costs. In contrast, our estimated bargaining model generates more reasonable marginal costs and (as we show empirically) merger impact.\n\nOur model of competition between MCOs and hospitals has two stages. In the first stage, MCOs and hospital systems negotiate the base price that each hospital will be paid by each MCO for hospital care. We model the outcome of these negotiations using the Horn and Wolinsky (1988a) model. The solution of the model specifies that prices for an MCO/hospital-system pair solve the Nash bargaining problem between the pair, conditioning on the prices for all other MCO/hospital-system pairs. The Nash bargaining problem is a function of the value to each party from agreement relative to the value without agreement, and hence depends on the objective functions of the parties. We assume that hospitals, which may be not-for-profit, seek to maximize a weighted sum of profits and quantity and that MCOs act as agents for self-insured employers, seeking to maximize a weighted sum of enrollee welfare and insurer costs. To evaluate the robustness of this relatively strong assumption on the MCO objective function, we also report calibrated results from a model where MCOs, whose objective is profit maximization, explicitly post premiums \u00e0 la Bertrand following the price negotiation stage.  4  the second stage, each MCO enrollee receives a health draw. Enrollees who are ill decide where to seek treatment, choosing a hospital to maximize utility. Utility is a function of outof-pocket expense, distance to the hospital, hospital-year indicators, the resource intensity of the illness interacted with hospital indicators, and a random hospital-enrollee-specific shock.\n\nThe out-of-pocket expense is the negotiated base price -as determined in the first stagemultiplied by the coinsurance rate and the resource intensity of the illness. The first-stage Nash bargaining disagreement values are then determined by the utilities generated by the expected patient choices.\n\nSolving the first-order conditions of the Nash bargaining problem, we show that equilibrium prices can be expressed by a formula that is analogous to the standard Lerner index equation, but where actual patient price sensitivity is replaced by the effective price sensi-tivity of the MCO. If hospitals have all the bargaining weight, the actual and effective price sensitivities are equal and prices are the same as under Bertrand pricing by hospitals with targeted prices to each MCO. In general, the two are not equal. While the difference between actual and effective price elasticities depends on a number of factors, in the simple case of identical single-firm hospitals, the effective price sensitivity will be higher than the actual price sensitivity, and hence hospital markups will be lower than under Bertrand pricing.\n\nWe estimate the model using discharge data from Virginia Health Information and administrative claims data from payors, from Northern Virginia. The use of claims data is novel and helps in two ways. First, the data allow us to construct prices for each hospitalpayor-year triple. Second, the data let us construct patient-specific coinsurance rates, which we use to estimate patient behavior.\n\nWe estimate the multinomial logit patient choice model by maximum likelihood, and the parameters of the bargaining model by forming moment conditions based on orthogonality restrictions on marginal costs. We calculate marginal costs by inverting the first-order conditions as explained above. This is the analog for the bargaining model case of the \"standard\" techniques used to incorporate equilibrium behavior in differentiated products estimation (e.g., Bresnahan, 1987; Goldberg, 1995; Berry et al., 1995).\n\nWe find that patients pay an average of 2-3% of the hospital bill as coinsurance amounts.\n\nWhile patients significantly dislike high prices, the own-price elasticity for systems is relatively low, ranging from 0.07 to 0.17, due to the low coinsurance rates. Without any health insurance, these own-price elasticities would range from 3.10 to 7.34. Estimated Lerner indices range from 0.22 to 0.58, which are equivalent to those implied by Bertrand pricing by hospitals if own-price elasticities ranged from 4.56 to 1.74. This implies that bargaining incentives make MCOs act more elastically than individual patients, but less elastically than patients without insurance.\n\nUsing the estimated parameters of the model, we examine the impact of a number of counterfactual market structures, focusing on the proposed acquisition by Inova Health System of Prince William Hospital, a transaction that was challenged by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and ultimately abandoned. We find that the proposed merger would have raised the quantity-weighted average price of the merging hospitals by 3.1%, equivalent to a 30.5% price increase at just Prince William. We also consider a remedy implemented by the FTC in a different hospital merger case, where the newly acquired hospitals were forced to bargain separately, in order to re-inject competition into the marketplace. We find that separate bargaining does not eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the Prince William acquisition since it changed disagreement values for both hospitals and MCOs. Finally, we examine the impact of different coinsurance rates on restraining prices. We find that mean prices would rise by 3.7% if coinsurance rates were 0 but drop by 16% if coinsurance rates were 10 times as high as at present (approximately the optimal coinsurance rate for hospitalizations calculated by Manning and Marquis (1996)).\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of our results, we also consider a model where MCOs simultaneously post premiums and compete for enrollees. Lacking data on premiums and premium elasticities necessary to estimate this model, we instead calibrate it using estimates from other studies and from our base model. We find a larger price increase of 7.2% from the Prince William merger. Unlike our base model, with posted premium competition, a hospital system will recapture some of the patients from the MCO in the event of disagreement through those patients choosing different MCOs. This increase in the disagreement value gives the hospital system more leverage, relative to the base model. On the other hand, the disagreement values of MCOs will also likely be higher in the posted premium competition model as MCOs can optimally adjust premiums in response to disagreement. Our finding of a larger price effect shows that the patient recapture story appears to play a bigger empirical role when considering how these effects impact the implications of a merger.\n\nGiven that we present results from two models, it is worth considering the relative advantages of each approach. Models that are similar to our posted premium competition one have been used in other bargaining contexts, such as Crawford and Yurukoglu (2012)'s model of the cable industry. We believe that posted premium setting is the better model in industry such as television where the downstream firms set posted prices and consumers select products based on those prices. However, for the hospital industry, there are several industry features that are at odds with the assumptions of the posted premium setting model. These include the fact that premiums for large employers are determined via negotiated long-run contracts and allow for price discrimination (Dafny, 2010), and not by take-it-or-leave-it premium offers that follow the price negotiation process (as in the posted premium setting model); that self-insured employers negotiate administrative fees alone, and not premiums; and that employer-MCO contracts are typically non-linear. For these reasons, we believe that employers and MCOs align their incentives more than implied by posted premium setting. This would result in there being less of a tradeoff between capturing employee surplus and creating employee surplus than in the posted premium setting model, though admittedly more than the zero tradeoff that is allowed by the base model. Overall, our view is that the real world is somewhere \"in between\" the two models in this sense, and that estimation using the base model is the best way to proceed given our available data. This paper builds on three related literatures. First, our analysis builds on recent work that structurally estimates multilateral bargaining models. Crawford and Yurukoglu (2012)   were the first to develop and estimate a full structural bargaining framework based on Horn   and Wolinsky (1988a); they examined bargaining between television content providers and cable companies.  5 The posted premium setting model is essentially their model (with a slightly different demand model), with the addition of coinsurance and other features unique to the healthcare sector. Our econometric approach is differentiated in that the estimation does not require solving for equilibrium prices and the unobserved term reflects cost variation.\n\nSecond, our paper relates to the literature that uses pre-merger data to simulate the likely effects of mergers by using differentiated products models with price setting behavior. foot_2 With a few exceptions (Gaynor and Vogt, 2003), it has been difficult to credibly model the hospital industry within this framework. For instance, as noted above, because consumers typically pay only a small part of the cost of their hospital care, own-price elasticities are low implying either negative marginal costs or infinite prices under Bertrand hospital pricing. We find that the equilibrium incentives of an MCO will both be more elastic and also change in different ways following a hospital merger than would the incentives of its patients. More generally, the impact of a merger on prices in the bargaining context will be different in magnitude and potentially even sign than with Bertrand hospital price setting. foot_3\n\nFinally, an existing literature has focused on bargaining models in which hospitals negotiate with MCOs for inclusion in their network of providers. Capps et al. (2003) and Town   and Vistnes (2001) estimate specifications that are consistent with an underlying bargaining model but neither paper structurally estimates a bargaining model. We show that their specification corresponds to a special case of our model with zero coinsurance rates and lump-sum payments from MCOs to hospitals. Our work also builds on Ho (2009, 2006), Lewis and   Pflum (2011), and Ho and Lee (2013). Ho (2009) is of particular interest. She estimates the parameters of MCO choices of provider network focusing on the role of different networks on downstream MCO competition. Our work, in contrast, focuses on the complementary price setting mechanism between MCOs and hospitals, taking as given the network structure.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model. Section 3 discusses econometrics. Section 4 provides our results. Section 5 provides counterfactuals. Section 6 examines the robustness of our results to modeling assumptions. Section 7 concludes."

      "text": "We model the interactions between MCOs, hospitals, and patients. The product we consider for MCOs is health administration services sold to self-insured employers. 8 Employers acquire these services and insure their employees as part of a compensation package, so employee and employer incentives are largely aligned. 9 In self-insured plans, the employer pays the cost of employee health care (less coinsurance, copays and deductibles) plus a management fee to the MCO. In this market, the central role of the MCO is to construct provider networks, negotiate prices, provide care and disease management services, and process medical care claims. Our base model assumes that each employer has an ongoing contract with one MCO, 10 under which the MCO agrees to act in the incentives of the employers that it represents in its negotiation with hospitals, in exchange for a fixed management fee that is determined by some long-run market interaction between the MCO and the employer. 11\n\nWe model a two-stage game that takes as given these employer/MCO contracts. In the first stage, MCOs, acting as agents of the employers, negotiate with hospital systems for the terms of hospitals' inclusion in MCOs' networks. 12 In the second stage, each patient receives a health status draw. Some draws do not require inpatient hospital care, while others do. If 8 In the U.S., private health insurance is generally acquired through an employer and approximately 60% of employers are self-insured with larger employers significantly more likely to self-insure (Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust, 2011).\n\n9 Baicker and Chandra (2006) find that increases in medical costs are incompletely passed through to wages but that they also have broader labor market consequences.\n\n10 58% of employees offered health insurance through their employer are only given one health insurance option (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component National-Level Summary Tables ,  2012) .\n\n11 According to an industry expert, the most common fee structure that MCOs use for self-insured plans are fixed fees based on the employer size. We thank Leemore Dafny for putting us in contact with this expert.\n\n12 Section 6 considers a calibrated model where MCOs explicitly post premiums \u00e0 la Bertrand to attract enrollees following the hospital-MCO price negotiation process.\n\na patient needs to receive inpatient hospital care, she must pay a predetermined coinsurance fraction of the negotiated price for each in-network hospital, with the MCO picking up the remainder. Coinsurance rates can vary across patients and diseases. The patient selects a hospital in the MCO's network -or an outside alternative -to maximize her utility."

      "text": "We now describe the second stage: patient choice of hospital. There is a set of hospitals j = 1, . . . , J, and a set of managed care companies m = 1, . . . , M . The hospitals are partitioned into S \u2264 J systems. Let J s denote the set of hospitals in system s.\n\nThere is a set of enrollees i = 1, . . . , I. Each enrollee has health insurance issued by a particular MCO. Let m(i) denote the MCO of enrollee i. In our base model, m(i) is fixed having been chosen via the long-run employer/MCO contracts. Each MCO m has a subset of the hospitals in its network; denote this subset N m . For each m and each j \u2208 N m , there is a base price p mj , which was negotiated in the first stage. Let p m denote the vector of all negotiated prices for MCO m.\n\nPrior to choosing the hospital, taking as given plan enrollment and the networks, each patient receives a draw of her health status that determines if she has one of a number of health conditions that require inpatient care. Let f id denote the probability that patient i at MCO m is stricken by illness d = 0, 1, ...D, where d = 0 implies no illness, w d denotes the relative intensity of resource use for illness d, and w 0 = 0. In our empirical analysis, w d is observed. We assume that the total price paid for treatment at hospital j by MCO m of disease d is w d p mj , which is the base price multiplied by the disease weight. Therefore, the base price, which will be negotiated by the MCO and the hospital, can be viewed as a price per unit of w d . This is essentially how most hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare, and many MCOs incorporate this payment structure into their hospital contracts. Each patient's insurance specifies a coinsurance rate for each condition, which we denote c id . The coinsurance rate indicates the fraction of the billed price w d p m(i)j that the patient must pay out of pocket.\n\nFor each realized illness d = 1, . . . , D, the patient seeks hospital care at the hospital which gives her the highest utility, including an outside option. The utility that patient i receives from care at hospital j \u2208 N m(i) is given by\n\n(1)\n\nIn equation (  1 ), x ijd is a vector of hospital and patient characteristics including travel time, hospital indicators, and interactions between hospital and patient characteristics (e.g., hospital indicators interacted with disease weight w d ), and \u03b2 is the associated coefficient vector.\n\nThe out-of-pocket expense to the patient is c id w d p m(i)j . As we describe below, we observe data that allow us to impute the base price, the disease weight, and coinsurance rate; hence we treat out-of-pocket expense as observable. We let \u03b1 denote the price sensitivity. Finally, e ij is an i.i.d. error term that is distributed type 1 extreme value.\n\nThe outside choice, denoted as choice 0, is treatment at a hospital located outside the market. The utility from this option is given by\n\nWe normalize the quality from the outside option, x i0d , to 0 but we allow for a non-zero base price p m(i)0 . foot_4 Finally, we assume that e i0 is also distributed type 1 extreme value.\n\nConsumers' expected utilities play an important role in the bargaining game.

      "title": "MCO and hospital bargaining",
      "text": "We now exposit the bargaining stage. There are M \u00d7 S potential contracts, each specifying the negotiated base prices for one MCO/hospital system pair. We assume that each hospital within a system has a separate base price, and that the price paid to a hospital for treatment of disease d will be its base price multiplied by the disease weight w d . MCOs and hospitals have complete information about MCO enrollee and hospital attributes, including x ijd and hospital costs.\n\nFollowing Horn and Wolinsky (1988a) we assume that prices for each contract solve the Nash bargaining solution for that contract, conditional on all other prices. The Nash bargaining solution is the price vector that maximizes the exponentiated product of the values to both parties from agreement (as a function of that price) relative to the values without agreement. It is necessary to condition on other prices because the different contracts may be economically interdependent implying that the Nash bargaining solutions are interdependent. For instance, in our model the value to an MCO of reaching an agreement with one hospital system may be lower if it already has an agreement with another geographically proximate system. Our bargaining model makes the relatively strong assumption that each contract remains the same even if negotiation for another contract fails.\n\nEssentially, the Horn and Wolinsky solution nests a Nash bargaining solution (an axiomatic cooperative game theory concept) within a Nash equilibrium (of a non-cooperative game) without a complete non-cooperative structure. The results of Rubinstein (1982) and Binmore et al. (1986) show that the Nash bargaining solution in a bilateral setting corresponds to the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of an alternating offers non-cooperative game. Extending these results, Collard-Wexler et al. (2013) provide conditions such that the Horn and Wolinsky solution is the same as the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium with passive beliefs of a specific simultaneous alternating offers game with multiple parties.\n\nStarting with MCOs, we now detail the payoff structures and use them to exposit the Nash bargain for each contract. Each MCO, acting on behalf of its contracted employers, seeks to maximize a weighted sum of the consumer surplus of its enrollees net of the payments to hospitals, taking m(i) as fixed. Because m(i) is fixed, a hospital system that does not reach agreement with MCO m will not capture back any of m's patients through plan switches by those patients. Define the ex-ante expected cost to the MCO and the employer that it represents to be T C m (N m , p m ). The MCO pays the part of the bill that is not paid by the patient, hence\n\n(5)\n\nDefine the value in dollars for the MCO and the employer it represents to be:\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the relative weight on employee welfare. If employer/employee/MCO incentives were perfectly aligned then \u03c4 = 1; \u03c4 < 1 implies that MCOs/employers value insurer costs more than enrollee welfare; while \u03c4 > 1 implies that they value enrollee welfare more than insurer costs. Assume that N m , m = 1, . . . , M , are the equilibrium sets of network hospitals.\n\nFor any system s for which J s \u2286 N m , the net value that MCO m receives from including\n\nHospital systems can be either for-profit or not-for-profit (NFP). NFP systems may care about some linear combination of profits and weighted quantity of patients served. Let mc mj denote the \"perceived\" marginal cost of hospital j for treating a patient from MCO m with disease weight w d = 1. We assume that the costs of treating an illness with weight w d is w d mc mj . The perceived marginal costs implicitly allows for different NFP objective functions:\n\na NFP system which cares about the weighted quantity of patients it serves will equivalently have a perceived marginal cost equal to its true marginal cost net of this utility amount (Lakadawalla and Philipson, 2006; Gaynor and Vogt, 2003).\n\nWe make three further assumptions regarding the cost structure. First, we assume that marginal costs are constant in quantity (though proportional to the disease weight). Second, we allow hospitals to have different marginal costs from treating patients at different MCOs, because the approach to care management, the level of paperwork, and ease and promptness of reimbursement may differ across MCOs. Finally, we specify that\n\nwhere mc mj is the marginal cost for an illness with disease weight w d = 1, v mj are a set of cost fixed effects (notably hospital, year, and MCO fixed effects), \u03b3 are parameters to estimate, and \u03b5 mj is the component of cost that is not observable to the econometrician.

For brevity, we omit the '*' from now on, even though all prices are evaluated at the optimum. We obtain:\n\nThe assumption of constant marginal costs implies that the FOCs (  12 ) are separable across MCOs.\n\nWe rearrange the joint system of #(J s ) first order conditions from (  12 ) to write\n\nwhere \u2126 and \u039b are both #(J s ) \u00d7 #(J s ) size matrices, with elements \u2126(j, k) = \u2202q mk \u2202p mj and \u039b\n\nA B q mk . Solving for the equilibrium prices yields\n\nwhere p, mc and q denote the price, marginal cost and adjusted quantity vectors respectively for hospital system s and MCO m. Equation (  14 ), which characterizes the equilibrium prices, would have a form identical to standard pricing games were it not for the inclusion of \u039b. One case where \u039b = 0 -and hence there is differentiated products Bertrand pricing with individual prices for each MCO -is where hospitals have all the bargaining weight, b m(s) = 0, \u2200s.\n\nImportantly, (  14 ) shows that, as with Bertrand competition models, we can back out implied marginal costs for the bargaining model as a closed-form function of prices, quantities and derivatives, given MCO and patient incentives. Using this insight, (  7 ) and (  14 ) together form the basis of our estimation. We now show some intuition for the forces at work.\n\nThe impact of price on MCO surplus. In order to understand how equilibrium prices are impacted by various factors, we need to develop the A expression from equation (  12 ). We provide this derivation in Appendix A1. We focus here on the case where \u03c4 = 1 (so that MCOs value consumer surplus equally to insurer costs), in which case A is\n\nThe first term, -q mj , captures the standard effect: higher prices reduce patients' expected utility. The second term accounts for the effect of consumer choices on payments from MCOs to hospitals. As the price of hospital j rises, consumers will switch to cheaper hospitals. This term can be either positive or negative, depending on whether hospital j is cheaper or more expensive than the share-weighted price of other hospitals; the difference is reflected in the expression in the large parentheses.\n\nIn our model, as long as coinsurance rates are strictly between zero and one, MCOs use prices to steer patients towards cheaper hospitals, and this will influence equilibrium pricing.\n\nTo see this, consider a hospital system with two hospitals, one low cost and one high cost, that are otherwise equal. The MCO/hospital system pair will maximize joint surplus by having a higher relative price on the high-cost hospital, as this will steer patients to the low-cost hospital. At coinsurance rates near one, i.e., no insurance, this effect disappears, because patients bear most of the cost and hence the MCO has no incentive to steer to low-cost hospitals beyond patients' preferences. Interestingly, at coinsurance rates near zero (full insurance) this effect also disappears but for a different reason: since the patient bears no expense, the MCO cannot use price to impact hospital choice.\n\nThe effect of bargaining on equilibrium prices. Note from equation (  14 ) that price-cost margins from our model have an identical formula to those that would arise if hospitals set prices to patients, and patients chose hospitals using our choice model, but with \u2126 + \u039b instead of \u2126. Since \u2126 is the matrix of actual price sensitivities, we define the effective price sensitivity to be \u2126 + \u039b. For the special case of a single-hospital system, we can write\n\nThe term B must be positive or the MCO would not gain surplus from including j in its network. From (15), the first term in A is the negative of quantity, which is negative. If the rest of A were 0, as would happen with identical hospitals, then \u039b would be negative. In this case, MCO bargaining increases the effective price sensitivity, and hence lowers prices relative to differentiated products hospital Bertrand pricing.\n\nMore generally, with asymmetric hospitals and multi-hospital systems, the incentives are more complicated. There may be cases where MCO bargaining may not uniformly lower prices, notably if cost differences across hospitals are large and hence where it is important to steer patients to low-cost hospitals. However, we still generally expect that MCO bargaining lowers prices relative to differentiated products Bertrand hospital pricing.\n\nThe impact of mergers on prices. Similarly to Bertrand pricing by hospitals, mergers here can also result in higher equilibrium hospital prices, although the mechanism is slightly different. In bargaining models, the MCO holds down prices by playing hospitals against each other. Post-merger, this competition is lost, causing prices to rise. Formalizing this intuition, Chipty and Snyder (1999) find that a merger of upstream firms (i.e., hospitals) will lead to higher prices if the value to the downstream firm (i.e., MCO) of reaching agreement relative to disagreement is concave.  15 In our model, if consumers view hospitals as substitutes, then the WTPs generated from the patient choice model will tend to generate a concave value function, resulting in a price rise from a hospital merger.\n\nNote that the magnitude of the merger effect may be different than under hospital Bertrand pricing. With hospital Bertrand pricing, a merger only changes the cross-price effects. With bargaining, the term B increases with a merger as B is the joint value of the system. Moreover, since B enters into the effective own-price elasticity in (  16 ), with bargaining, the effective own-and cross-price sensitivities both change from a merger. However, the cross-price terms change differently, and potentially less, than with Bertrand pricing. Since these effects can be of opposite sign, the net effect of the merger under the bargaining model relative to under the Bertrand pricing model is ambiguous.\n\nNote also that non-linearities of the value function can come from sources other than consumer substitution between hospitals. As an example, a merger between hospitals in two distinct markets could result in a price change, which would not happen with hospital Bertrand pricing. To see this, consider an MCO serving two separate markets without overlap and with one hospital in each market. If the two hospitals are identical except that the hospital in the first market is more expensive, then the MCO might be willing to trade off a higher price in the first market for a lower price in the second, in order to steer patients to or away from the outside option appropriately. A merger between the two hospitals would allow the new system to make this tradeoff, and thus it would increase price in the first market and decrease it in the second market. With competition between MCOs (as in our posted premium competition model) there is an additional source of non-linearity: in the case of disagreement some enrollees will switch their insurance plan, and will end up going to the same hospital through a different plan. This additional source will tend to increase prices more than in our base model.\n\nZero coinsurance rates and the relation to Capps et al. (2003). Now consider the special case of zero coinsurance rates. In this case, prices cannot be used to steer patients, and hence the marginal value to the hospital of a price increase is q j , while the marginal value to the MCO is -q j . Because a price increase here is effectively just a transfer from the MCO to the hospital system, individual hospital prices within a system do not matter. The FOC for any m and j, j \u2208 J s then reduces to:\n\nHence, prices will adjust so that system revenues are proportional to the value that the system brings to the MCO. Because the prices of systems other than s enter into the right hand side of (17) through V m , (17) still results in an interdependent system of equations.\n\nHowever, these equations form a linear system and hence we can solve for the equilibrium price vector for all systems in closed form with a matrix inverse (see Brand, 2013).\n\nThere is also a large similarity between our model with zero coinsurance and Capps et al.\n\n(2003)'s empirical specification of hospital system profits. Using our notation, Capps et al.\n\nargue that hospital system profits from an MCO can be expressed as:\n\nwhich is similar to equation (  17 ) except that the right side has willingness to pay rather than the sum of willingness to pay and MCO costs.  16 The Capps et al. formula in (18) would yield the same price as our model with zero coinsurance if hospitals obtained a lump-sum payment for treating patients, with the MCO then paying all the marginal costs of their treatment."

      "text": "We use data from Northern Virginia to simulate the effects of a merger that was proposed in this area. Our primary data come from two sources: administrative claims data provided by four large MCOs serving Northern Virginia (payor data) and inpatient discharge data from Virginia Health Information. Both datasets span the years 2003 through 2006. These data are supplemented with information on hospital characteristics provided by the American Hospital Association (AHA) Guide.\n\nA longstanding challenge in the analysis of hospital markets is the difficulty of acquiring actual transaction-level prices for each hospital-payor pair in the market. The administrative claims data are at the transactions level and contain most of the information that the MCO uses to process the appropriate payment to a hospital for a given patient encounter. In particular, the claims data contain demographic characteristics, diagnosis, procedure performed, diagnosis related group (DRG), and the actual amount paid to the hospital for each claim.\n\nThere are often multiple claims per inpatient stay and thus the data must be aggregated to the inpatient episode level. We group claims together into a single admission based on the date of service, member ID, and hospital identifier. The claims often have missing DRG information. To address this issue, we use DRG grouper software from 3M to assign the appropriate DRG code to each admission.\n\nUsing the claims data, we construct base prices, p mjt , for each hospital-payor-year triple.\n\nWe use the DRG weight, published by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services each year, as the disease weight w id . DRG weights are a measure of the mean resource usage by diagnosis and are the primary basis for Medicare inpatient payments to hospitals. Our use here is appropriate if the relative resource utilization for Medicare patients across DRGs is similar to that of commercial patients. We regress the total amount paid divided by DRG weight on gender, age and hospital dummies, separately for each payor and year. We then  16  See also Lewis and Pflum (2011) for a similar argument.\n\ncreate the base price for each hospital as the mean of the fitted regression values using all observations for the payor and year. 17 Our price regressions explain a large part of the within payor/year variation in prices: the R 2 values across the 16 regressions have an (unweighted) mean of 0.41. Our model also relies on the prices for the outside option, which is treatment at a Virginia hospital outside our geographic area. For each MCO m, we let the outside option price p m0 be the unweighted mean of the base price vector p m .\n\nAn alternative method of constructing prices is to directly use the contracts between hospitals and MCOs. However, the complexity of these contracts resulted in difficulties in constructing apples-to-apples prices across MCOs and hospitals.  18 As consistently quantifying the contract terms was impractical, we use the claims data to formulate the price measures as described above.\n\nThe claims data also contain information on the amount of the bill the patient paid outof-pocket. This information allows us to construct patient-specific out-of-pocket coinsurance rates. Different insurers report coinsurance rates differently on the claims. In order to provide a standardized coinsurance measure across patients and MCOs, we formulate an expected coinsurance rate. We do this by first formulating a coinsurance amount which is the out-of-pocket expenditure net of deductibles and co-payments divided by the allowed amount. The allowed amount is the expected total payment the hospital is receiving for providing services to a given MCO patient.  19 The resulting coinsurance variable is censored at zero. Then, separately for each MCO, we estimate a tobit model of coinsurance where the explanatory variables are age, female indicator, age\u00d7female, DRG weight, age\u00d7DRG weight and female\u00d7DRG weight.  20 We then create the expected coinsurance rate for each patient as the predicted values from this regression. In our coinsurance regressions, the percent of observations censored at 0 ranges from 31% to 98% across payors, reflecting variations in  17  We have also explored alternative approaches to calculating prices including using amount paid as the dependent variable with the addition of DRG dummy variables as regressors. The quantitative implications of our estimates are robust to these different price construction methodologies.\n\n18 As an example, we examined one hospital in our data, which had (1) contracts with a fixed payment for each DRG; (2) per-diem contracts with fixed daily rates for medical, surgical and intensive care patients;\n\n(3) contracts with a set discount off of charges; and (4) a hybrid of the above, with switching between reimbursement regimes based on the total charges.\n\n19 Some MCOs do not distinguish between deductibles and copayments. For these MCOs, we identify copayments by treating expenditures of an even dollar amount (e.g., 25, 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 135,  140, 150, etc.) as a deductible (implying no variation in out-of-pocket expenditure across the hospitals) and coding the coinsurance amount in that case as 0.\n\n20 We allow coinsurance rates to vary by DRG because insurance contracts may have different terms for different inpatient conditions and patients may sort into different insurance contracts based on their conditions.\n\ncoinsurance practices across MCOs. The parameters generally indicate that the coinsurance rate is decreasing in age, higher for women, and decreasing in DRG weight.  21 e Virginia discharge data contain much of the same information as the claims data but, in general, the demographic, patient ZIP code, and diagnosis fields are more accurate, and an observation in these data is at the (appropriate) inpatient admission level. The discharge data also contain more demographic information (e.g., race), and the identity of the payor, and are a complete census of all discharges at the hospital.\n\nFor these reasons, we use the discharge data to estimate the patient choice model. We limit our sample to general acute care inpatients whose payor is one of the four MCOs in our payor data and who reside in Northern Virginia, defined as Virginia Health Planning District (HPD) 8 plus Fauquier County.  22 We exclude patients transferred to another general acute care hospital (to avoid double counting); patients over 64 years of age (to avoid Medicare Advantage and supplemental insurance patients); and newborn discharges (treating instead the mother and newborn as a single choice). We restrict our sample to patients discharged at a hospital in Virginia. The outside choice, j = 0, consists of people in this area who were treated at a hospital in Virginia other than one in our sample.  23  obtain the following hospital characteristics from the AHA Guide of the relevant year: staffed beds, residents and interns per bed, and indicators for FP ownership, teaching hospital status, and the presence of a cardiac catheterization laboratory, MRI, and neonatal intensive care unit. We compute the driving time from the patient's zip code centroid to the hospital using information from MapQuest."

(Note that WTP is estimated in the patient choice stage.) That hospital will be able to negotiate a relatively high price with that MCO. The relative importance of WTP, and hence the extent of the price variation relative to other prices that involve the same MCO or hospital, is determined by \u03c4 , thus serving to identify this parameter."

In late 2006, Inova Health System, a health care system with hospitals solely in Northern Virginia, sought to acquire a not-for-profit institution that operated a single general acute-care hospital, Prince William Hospital (PWH). Inova operated a large tertiary hospital in Falls Church, Fairfax Hospital, with 884 licensed beds, which offered all major treatments from low acuity ones to high-end ones such as transplants. Inova also operated four, roughly similar community hospitals: Fair Oaks, Alexandria, Mount Vernon, and Loudoun Hospitals. Inova's previous acquisitions included Alexandria Hospital, in 1997 and Loudoun Hospital, in 2005. PWH had 180 licensed beds and was located in Manassas. The Federal Trade Commission, with the Virginia Office of the Attorney General as coplaintiff, challenged the acquisition in May, 2008. Subsequently, the parties abandoned the transaction. 25 The FTC alleged that the relevant geographic market consisted of all hospitals in Virginia Health Planning District 8 (HPD8) and Fauquier County. This geographic area included five other hospitals, although Northern Virginia Community Hospital closed in 2005.\n\nOf the remaining four, Fauquier, Potomac, and the Virginia Hospital Center are independent 25 PWH was later acquired by the Novant Health, a multi-hospital system based in North Carolina.\n\nwhile Reston Hospital Center was owned by the HCA chain.

These differences do not reflect variation in the severity of diagnoses across hospitals as our construction of prices controls for disease complexity. The range between the highest and lowest hospital is 36% of the mean PWH price, which is in the middle of the price distribution. Table 2 presents statistics by hospital for the sample of patients we use to estimate the hospitals range from 1.7 to 3.3% with a mean of 2.4%, which aligns with national data from three of the largest insurers. 27 There is significant variation across payors in the use of coinsurance which helps in our identification of \u03b1, as average coinsurance rates vary between 0.2% and 4.4% across MCOs in our data.\n\nFinally, Table  2  provides the shares by discharges among hospital systems in this area.\n\nWithin this market, Inova has a dominant share, attracting 64% of the patients.

The highest-paying MCO pays hospitals, on average, over more than the lowest-paying MCO. While this variation is high, large variations across hospitals and payors are not uncommon (Ginsburg, 2010).

In addition to the negotiated price, the explanatory variables include hospital/year fixed effects, hospital indicators interacted with the patient's DRG weight, and a rich set of interactions that capture dimensions of hospital and patient heterogeneity that affect hospital choice.\n\nConsistent with the large literature on hospital choice, we find that patients are very sensitive to travel times. The willingness to travel is increasing in the DRG weight and decreasing in age. An increase in travel time of 5 minutes reduces each hospital's share between 17 and 41%. The parameter estimates imply that increasing the travel time to all hospitals by one minute reduces consumer surplus by approximately $167. 28\n\n27 According to analysis based on claims data for over 45 million covered lives from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI), the average total out-of-pocket expenditures is approximately 4.8%. HCCI's figure includes deductibles and co-payments which we have removed from our coinsurance variable and thus the two estimates are well aligned. See HCCI 2012 Health Care Cost and Utilization Report available at  http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/2012report  for details.\n\n28 The patient's price sensitivity to travel likely reflects the fact that they will be visited by members of their social support network who may make several trips per day. The parameter on out-of-pocket price is negative and significant indicating that, in fact, inpatient prices do play a role in admissions decisions. foot_10 However, in contrast to travel time, patients are relatively insensitive to the gross price paid from the MCO to the hospital, largely because of the low coinsurance rates that they face. Table  4  presents the estimated price elasticities of demand for selected hospitals. Own-price elasticities range from -0.098 to -0.153 across the five reported hospitals. The fact that our elasticity estimates are substantially less than 1 imply that under Bertrand competition the observed prices could only be rationalized with negative marginal costs, even for stand-alone hospitals.

      "text": "Table  5  presents the coefficient estimates and standard errors from the GMM estimation of the bargaining model. We estimate two specifications. In Specification 1, we fix the bargaining weights to b m(s) = 0.5 (which implies that b s(m) = 0.5) and allow for marginal cost fixed effects at the hospital, MCO, and year levels. In Specification 2, we allow the bargaining parameters to vary across MCOs (lumping MCO 2 and 3 together) but omit the MCO cost fixed effects.  30 We bootstrap all standard errors at the payor/year/system level.\n\nFocusing first on Specification 1, the point estimate on \u03c4 indicates that MCOs place over twice as much weight on enrollee welfare as on reimbursed costs. Though the coefficient is not statistically significantly different from 0 or 1, 95 of the 100 bootstrapped draws of \u03c4 are positive. A value of \u03c4 other than 1 may reflect employers placing a different weight on welfare than enrollees but may also be due to errors in measuring coinsurance rates or physician incentives to steer patients to low-price hospitals (Dickstein, 2011). We find an increasing cost trend for hospitals over time. We also find large variation in the hospital marginal costs across MCOs. This latter finding reflects the fact that there is large variation across MCOs in the mean prices charged by hospitals.\n\nTurning to the results from Specification 2, here we estimate three different bargaining weights b m(s) . We find significant variation in bargaining weights across MCOs, with all MCOs having more leverage than hospitals. Only MCO 1's bargaining parameter is not significantly different than 0.5. This variation is driven by the same price variation that generated the estimated cost heterogeneity in Specification 1. The estimates from Specification 2 imply that MCOs 2 and 3 have a bargaining weight of essentially 1, so that hospitals have a bargaining weight of 0. Thus, MCOs 2 and 3 drive hospital surpluses down to their reservation values.\n\nTable  A2  in Appendix A2 reports a specification where the bargaining weight differs across each MCO/hospital-system pair. Very few of the parameters here are significantly different than 0.5. Note: * * denotes significance at 1% level and * at 5% level. Significance tests for bargaining parameters test the null of whether the parameter is different than 0.5. We report bootstrapped standard errors with data resampled at the payor/year/system level. \"Patients from MCO 1\" and \"Year 2003\" are both excluded indicators.\n\nOur estimation can explain the large cross-MCO price differences in three ways: (1) as differences in hospital costs across MCOs; (2) as differences in the bargaining weights across MCOs; or (3) as differences in WTP across MCOs. Specification 1 focuses on the first explanation, while the Specification 2 focuses on the second. The third alternative could occur if, for example, the geographic or illness severity distribution of enrollees varies across MCOs. Both specifications allow for the third alternative but find that the cost or bargaining weight explanations (respectively) fit the data better. Because we include MCO fixed effects, our estimates of \u03c4 and b will be largely identified by within-MCO price differences. Despite the large cross-MCO price variation, we believe that this variation allows us to perform credible counterfactuals that reflect reasonable estimates of what would happen relative to the baseline.\n\nWe consider Specification 1 to be the most salient for three reasons: (1) given one particular interpretation of bargaining weights, which is as relative discount factors (Rubinstein,   1982; Collard-Wexler et al., 2013), it is most consistent with standard dynamic industrial organization models that treat discount factors as identical across agents;\n\n(2) the results from Specification 2 that all hospital prices for two MCOs are equal to their reservation values implies that hospital mergers (even to monopoly) will have little impact on prices, a finding that is not consistent with the empirical hospital merger literature (Gaynor and Town, 2012); and\n\n(3) It aligns with previous estimates from the literature -for example, Crawford and   Yurukoglu (2012) finds finds bargaining parameters that are closer to 0.5 than to 0 or 1. Table 6 lists the estimated weighted mean 2006 Lerner index, P -mc P , by hospital sys-tem. The mean Lerner indices range from 0.22 to 0.58, and are relatively high for both\n\nInova and PWH. Importantly, Table  6  also presents the actual own-price elasticity, effective price elasticities for both MCO objective functions, and own-price elasticity that would exist without insurance. We calculate effective price elasticities using the inverse elasticity rule elast mj = -( P -mc P ) -1 . For PWH, the actual price elasticity is 0.13 while the effective price elasticity is much higher and, at 1.94, consistent with positive marginal costs. If patients faced the full cost of their treatment instead of having insurance, our first stage estimates imply that PWH's price elasticity would rise to 5.16. For Inova, the own-price elasticity is even lower than for PWH, at 0.07, because it is a large system, but the effective own-price elasticity is 2.55, slightly higher than for PWH.\n\nOverall, Table  6  provides a clearer picture of the impact of MCO bargaining. In all cases, the effective price elasticities are in between actual price elasticities and price elasticities without insurance. It is well-understood that the risk-reduction component of insurance dampens consumer price responsiveness relative to having no insurance. In a model of Bertrand competition between hospitals, this will result in hospital prices far above marginal costs. We find that MCO bargaining leverage serves to partially overcome the equilibrium effects of insurance moral hazard, driving equilibrium prices closer to what they would be in a world without health insurance."

      "text": "This subsection evaluates the impact of counterfactual industry structures, focusing on the proposed Inova/PWH merger that the FTC successfully blocked in 2008. In addition to examining the proposed Inova/PWH merger, we also examine the impact of imposing separate bargaining in this merger; the de-merger of Loudoun Hospital from Inova; and breaking up Note: price changes are calculated using quantity weights. The price changes relative to PWH or Loudoun base reflect the total system revenue change divided by the base revenue of this hospital.\n\nthe Inova system.  31 r results are in Table  7 . Counterfactual 1 finds that the Inova/PWH merger leads to a significant increase in prices and profits for the new Inova system. The net quantity-weighted price increase is approximately 3.1% and the net increase in profits is 9.3%. Considering the relative size of PWH to the Inova system, a 3.1% price increase across the joint systems from this transaction is quite substantial, amounting to 30.5% of base PWH revenues. Patient volume at the merged system goes down slightly, by 0.5%, reflecting both low coinsurance rates (and hence that patient demand is inelastic) and the equilibrium price increase by rival hospitals. Not reported in the table, managed care surplus, which is weighted consumer surplus net of payments to hospitals, drops by approximately 27% from this merger.\n\nIn the Evanston Northwestern hospital merger case, the FTC imposed a remedy requiring the Evanston Northwestern system to negotiate separately with MCOs (with firewalls in place) from the newly acquired hospital, Highland Park Hospital.  32 We examine the im-plications of this type of policy by simulating a world where Inova acquires PWH and the PWH negotiator bargains with a firewall from the other Inova hospitals. We simulate this counterfactual by assuming that the disagreement values for PWH negotiations reflect the case where only PWH is excluded from the network, and analogously for the 'legacy-Inova' disagreement values.  33 en though the negotiations are separate, the PWH bargainer might internalize the incentives of the system, namely that if a high price discouraged patients from seeking care at PWH, some of them would still divert instead to other Inova hospitals which is beneficial for the parent organization. Counterfactual 2 imposes the Evanston Northwestern remedy and assumes that the negotiators recognize these true incentives faced by the system in their bargaining. We find that the conduct remedy performs similarly to the base merger outcomes, with a post-merger price increase of 3.3% and a managed care surplus loss of 27.8%.\n\nThe FTC in its Evanston decision hoped that this conduct remedy would re-inject competition into the market by reducing the leverage of the hospital that bargains separately; e.g., PWH could only threaten a small harm to the MCO from disagreement. However, this remedy also reduces the leverage of the MCO since if it offers an unacceptable contract to PWH, some of its but-for PWH patients would certainly go to other Inova hospitals. The increase in disagreement values on both sides implies that the impact of this remedy (relative to the outcome under the merger absent the remedy) is theoretically ambiguous. Empirically, separate negotiations do not appear to solve the problem of bargaining leverage by hospitals.\n\nCounterfactual 3 examines the impact of Inova divesting Loudoun Hospital, which it acquired in 2005 without antitrust opposition. The counterfactual predictions tell a different story for the Inova/Loudoun demerger than the Inova/PWH merger. A divesture of Loudoun Hospital leads to a net reduction in price of 1.8% for the Inova system a reduction in profits of 4.7%, and an increase in managed care surplus of 13.5%. The price decrease translates into an approximate 14.7% price decrease relative to Loudoun's discharge share of the Inova system.\n\nThe smaller price impact is consistent with the FTC challenging Inova's proposed Prince William acquisition but not its Loudoun acquisition. Finally, Counterfactual 4 simulates the impact of breaking up the entire Inova system into separately-owned hospitals. This breakup leads to a 7% market-wide decline in prices and a 54.8% increase in consumer surplus. This result is consistent with the evidence that points to the creation of large hospital systems during the 1990s as important driver of higher hospital prices.\n\n33 Appendix A3 provides the first order conditions for this case.\n\nWe also examine the sensitivity of these results to the bargaining parameter estimates.\n\nWe first consider the impact of the Inova/PW merger using the estimates from Table  5 , Specification 2, instead of Specification 1. For the two MCOs with bargaining weights less than one, we find that our base Specification 1 generates a price increase of 1.7% for Inova and Prince William from the merger for these two payors, while Specification 2 generates a price increase of 4.2% for the same payors.\n\nWe also estimate our model and compute the effect of the Inova/PWH merger with different fixed bargaining parameters, focusing on one MCO for ease of computation. The results, which are in Appendix A2 Table  A3 , show that estimated marginal costs increase monotonically in the bargaining weight b. For b m(s) = 0, \u2200m, s (which, as we showed in Section 2.4, corresponds to Bertrand competition) we estimate mean marginal costs of $-278,000, which rises to $11,500 -very close to mean price -when b m(s) = 0.9. Given the increasing estimated marginal costs, it follows that the effective own price elasticity also increases monotonically in b. Finally, since higher price elasticities generally imply lower markups, it is not surprising that we find that the effects of the predicted Inova/PWH merger are also monotonic in b, ranging from a market-wide 18.3% price increase with b m(s) = 0 to 0.05% with b m(s) = 0.9.\n\nWe view the merger impacts at both extremes to be implausible also lending support to a bargaining weight of b m(s) = 0.5."

      "title": "Moral hazard and coinsurance in equilibrium",
      "text": "There is a long tradition in economics of evaluating how the moral hazard from health insurance causes enrollees to overconsume medical care relative to the societal optimum (Pauly,   1968).x Less studied is the indirect impact of health insurance on equilibrium provider prices.\n\nBy covering out-of-pocket expenses, health insurance dampens the incentive of consumers to respond to differential prices in selecting healthcare providers, which affects equilibrium prices. We seek to evaluate the extent to which coinsurance serves as a solution to the equilibrium pricing problems resulting from moral hazard. Table  8  examines the equilibrium impact of coinsurance on equilibrium hospital prices.\n\nCounterfactual 1 examines the extreme case of insurance policies that cover all inpatient care expenses at the margin. We find that quantity-weighted prices would be 3.7% higher than in the base case if coinsurance rates were zero. The reason for the price increase is straightforward. Patient demand would go from having a moderate elasticity to no elasticity at all. Thus, these results indicate that both patient coinsurance and MCO bargaining leverage play a role in constraining prices in this market.\n\nWe also consider higher coinsurance rates in Counterfactual 2. Estimates of the optimal health insurance design in the presence of moral hazard indicate that coinsurance rates should be approximately 25% (see Manning and Marquis, 1996).  34 In this counterfactual, we consider the impact of a tenfold increase in the coinsurance rates on the equilibrium, which yields roughly equivalent coinsurance rates to the Manning and Marquis ones. The increase in cost sharing has a large impact, with quantity-weighted prices dropping by 16% and quantity increasing slightly, relative to the base case. This counterfactual suggests that analyses of the optimal benefit design of insurance contracts, which do not consider the additional impact of increasing cost sharing on the price of health care, likely understate the gains from increased coinsurance rates.\n\nFinally, Counterfactual 3 considers the interaction of no coinsurance and the Inova/PWH merger. It is hypothesized that increasing patient cost sharing can partially undo the price impact of hospital mergers. Theoretically, however, the steering effect of coinsurance can either enhance or mitigate the increase in bargaining leverage from merger. We explore these possibilities by calculating the predicted impact of the Inova/PWH merger when patient cost sharing is zero. We find a lower increase from the merger at Inova/PWH, of 2.9% instead of 3.1%, than when we allow for positive coinsurance rates. In other words, the steering effect from coinsurance increases the equilibrium pricing effect of the merger."

      "title": "Robustness to modeling assumptions",
      "text": "This section considers an alternate model of the bargaining stage.  35 In this model, MCOs maximize their expected profits when negotiating with hospital systems over the terms of hospitals' inclusions in MCO networks. After the networks are set, MCOs simultaneously post premiums. Observing coinsurance rates, posted MCO premiums, and hospital prices, each enrollee chooses an MCO, which determines the assignment of patients to MCOs, m(i).\n\nGiven this assignment, the second stage is the same as in the base model: patients receive health status draws and then choose hospitals.\n\nThe posted premium competition model differs from the base model in that (i) the MCO objective function is to maximize profits, rather than the weighted difference between enrollee surplus and costs; and (ii) enrollee plan choices in the case of disagreement are allowed to vary.\n\nNote that both models account for consumer preferences in the formation of the network, they just do it in different ways. The base model assumes that there is agency between employers and MCOs, while in the posted premium competition model, this accounting occurs through the competitive interactions of the health plan marketplace.\n\nWe now detail the posted premium competition model, starting with the plan choice decision which occurs at the end of Stage 1. At this point, each individual i is faced with a premium P m for each plan m. The enrollee does not know her disease realization or her e ij hospital-specific shocks. Each enrollee makes a discrete choice of MCO to maximize the utility\n\nwhere \u03b1 1 is the dollar transformation of measured welfare from (4), \u03b1 2 is the disutility from premiums, \u03be m is the utility from MCO m from attributes other than its patient care and price (e.g., customer service), and E im is an i.i.d. unobservable, distributed type 1 extreme value. The enrollee may choose the outside option, U i0 = E i0 , in which case the enrollee will not be able to use a hospital in the second stage. The market share of MCO m for patient i is:\n\nwhich conditions on the choice of hospital networks and prices.\n\nMoving back in time to the premium-setting phase, we assume that MCOs simultaneously choose premiums, P m , to maximize expected profits, knowing all input costs p ns , \u2200n, s. Expected profits from a patient are the market share of the patient times the expected margin from attracting her. Overall, then, we can write profits (gross of fixed costs) to MCO m as:\n\nwhere we are again implicitly conditioning on hospital networks and prices.\n\nMoving now to the start of Stage 1, the bargaining process is similar to the base model, but the threat points are different. In particular, when considering the disagreement point an MCO takes into account that if it does not reach an agreement with a hospital system it will lose some enrollees and adjust its premiums to reoptimize given its new network.\n\nSimilarly, when considering a disagreement with an MCO, a hospital system considers that it will recapture some of the patients from that MCO because of the spill of patients to other MCOs. Appendix A4 details the agreement and disagreement values for MCOs and hospital systems.\n\nTo compute the equilibrium of the posted premium competition model, we require data on hospital costs, patient illness distributions, and plan quality, as well as values of the parameters \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 . We do not use any data on plan premiums, as these are calculated in equilibrium. We now outline the calibration of these data and parameters, with details in Appendix A4.\n\nFirst, we calibrate the premium sensitivity parameter \u03b1 2 , which is the disutility of spending an extra dollar on health insurance, using the equivalent parameter reported by Ericson and Starc (2012)'s study of health insurance in Massachusetts. Second, we choose the coefficient on hospital welfare at the premium stage, \u03b1 1 , that makes the marginal utilities of a dollar equal at the plan choice and hospital choice stages. We use the estimated marginal costs estimates from our base model specification (Table  5 , Specification 1) and set b s(m) = 0.5, \u2200s, m as in this specification. We calculate \u03be m based on plan market shares and let coinsurance c id = 0, \u2200i, d to ease the burden of computation. Finally, we assume that the ex-ante distribution of illness for each patient at the point when the patient chooses a health plan takes on exactly two potential values, no illness or illness. Inova/PWH merger for the merging parties than does the base model: 7.2% instead of 3.1%.\n\nPremiums rise by 3.4% following the merger. The combined effect leads to significantly lower consumer surplus (4.4%) and a decrease in insurance take-up of 1.6%. The increased price implies that the fact that hospitals can recapture some patients in the case of disagreement with an MCO in this model, which will increase the disagreement value of the hospital system following a merger, appears to be the dominant difference between the models."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Many bilateral, business-to-business transactions are between oligopoly firms negotiating prices over a bundle of imperfectly substitutable goods. In this paper we develop a model of the price negotiations game between managed care organizations and hospitals. We show that standard oligopoly models will generally not accurately capture the pricing behavior under these bargaining scenarios. We then develop a GMM estimator of the negotiation process and estimate the parameters of the model using detailed managed care claims and patient discharge data from Northern Virginia.\n\nWe find that patient demand is quite inelastic -with own-price elasticities of about 0.12 on average -as patients typically only pay out-of-pocket 2 to 3 percent of the cost of their hospital care at the margin. Consistent with our theoretical model, prices are significantly constrained by MCO bargaining leverage, though still much higher than they would be in the absence of insurance. Moreover, they are similar across two different objective functions for MCOs, one where they act as agents of employers through long-run contracts, and the other where they post premiums and compete for enrollees \u00e0 la Bertrand.\n\nThe proposed merger between Inova hospital system and Prince William Hospital, which the FTC challenged, would have significantly raised prices. The market we study is more concentrated than the average market but not an outlier, foot_17  implying that hospital mergers in other MSAs may also cause price increases and hence be cause for antitrust concern.\n\nConduct remedies used by the FTC in other hospital merger cases, with separate, fire-walled negotiating teams, would not help. Finally, we find that a large increase in the coinsurance rate would significantly reduce hospital prices. Patient cost-sharing has recently trended upwards and our model indicates that if this trend continues it could result in a significant reduction in provider prices.\n\nWhile our focus is on negotiations between hospitals and MCOs, we believe our framework can be applied in a number of alternative settings where there are a small number of \"gatekeeper\" buyers. Our approach allows us to write the equilibrium pricing in a way that is similar to the standard Lerner index inverse elasticity rule, by substituting effective demand elasticities for the demand elasticities. This approach further allows us to construct a simple GMM estimator for marginal costs, bargaining weights and underlying incentives.\n\nAn interesting extension to explore in future work is formal identification of the bargaining weights. We conjecture that the identification of these weights might be similar to identification of the nature of competition and that some of the results in Haile and Berry (2010)   would generalize to our case."
