  "title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Digital Health Interventions for Asthma or COPD: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Objective: Digital interventions such as remote monitoring of symptoms and physiological measurements have the potential to reduce the economic burden of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but their cost-effectiveness remains unclear. This systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) aims to assess whether digital health interventions can be cost-effective in these patients. Design: Systematic review of RCTs. Study quality was assessed using RoB2 tool. Data Sources: Systematic search in three databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligibility Criteria: Studies were eligible if they were RCTs with health economic evaluations assessing participants with asthma and/or COPD and comparing a digital health intervention to standard of care. Results: We included 35 RCTs, of which 21 were related to COPD, 13 to asthma and one to both diseases. Overall, studies assessed four categories of digital health interventions: (i) Electronic patient diaries (n = 4), (ii) real-time monitoring (n = 19), (iii) teleconsultations (n = 6) and (iv) others (n = 6). Eleven studies performed a full economic evaluation analysis, while 24 studies performed a partial economic analysis. Most studies involving real-time monitoring or teleconsultations presented economic results in favour of digital health interventions (indicating them to be cost-effective or less expensive than the standard of care). Mixed results were obtained for electronic patient diaries. In the studies that conducted a full economic analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranged from 3530,93\u20ac/QALY and 286,369,28\u20ac/QALY. In the studies that conducted a partial economic analysis, the cost differences between the intervention group and the control group ranged from 0,12\u20ac and 85,217,86\u20ac. Half studies with low risk of bias concluded that the intervention was economically favourable. \n Conclusion: Although costs varied based on intervention type, follow-up period and country, most studies report digital health interventions to be affordable or associated with decreased costs.",

      "title": "| Introduction",
      "text": "Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common chronic respiratory conditions that substantially impact patients' quality of life, being associated with high rates of disability, morbidity and mortality  [1] . In 2019, asthma was responsible for 21.6 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (20.8% of total DALYs from chronic respiratory disease  [2] ) and for 455,000 deaths worldwide  [3] . Similarly, COPD accounted for 3.2 million deaths, being the third leading cause of death worldwide  [4] . These two diseases also impose a substantial economic burden on individuals and societies. In fact, according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), respiratory diseases account for 6% of the total annual healthcare budget of the European Union in direct costs, with COPD alone contributing to 56% (\u20ac38.6 billion) of the overall expenses  [5] . Identically, Nunes, Pereira, and Morais-Almeida  [6]  estimated that the disease burden of asthma (including indirect costs) accounted for over \u20ac19 billion in Europe.\n\nA significant proportion of the economic burden associated with these conditions arises from exacerbations, as they may result in emergency department visits and hospitalisations, increased use of medication, and absence from school or work. Therefore, preventing exacerbations stands out as a crucial objective for both asthma and COPD. In order to achieve this goal, regular patient follow-up may be particularly needed. Symptoms and objective measures of airflow obstruction should be monitored frequently, to identify potential complications and allow timely adjustments in the treatment plan to prevent them  [7, 8] . In this context, telemedicine may play a particularly relevant role. It is defined as 'the provision of healthcare services at a distance with communication conducted between healthcare providers seeking clinical guidance and support from other healthcare providers (provider-to-provider telemedicine); or conducted between remote healthcare users seeking health services and healthcare providers (client-to-provider telemedicine)'  [9] . Telemedicine interventions can enable healthcare delivery through many ways, such as video-consultations, phone calls, real-time monitoring with home devices as spirometers or pulmonary telerehabilitation. These services allow for continuous monitoring of patients, which can alert healthcare professionals to changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters and facilitate early intervention before the occurrence of a severe exacerbation. Telemedicine approaches might even provide more accurate information on the patients' disease control compared with face-to-face consultations  [10]  and to remind patients to take their medications or vaccines. In addition, wearable or implementable digital devices can collect data on biomarkers relevant for monitoring patients with respiratory disease (such as serum immunoglobulin E, sputum and blood eosinophils, and the fraction of nitric oxide in exhaled air), whose assessment, combined with other clinical and physiological parameters, has the potential to prevent exacerbations and improve the precision therapeutic approach to asthma  [11] [12] [13] .\n\nAlthough telemedicine has already demonstrated its potential to reduce healthcare utilisation and improve quality of life in patients with these two diseases  [14] , having the potential to be associated with a reduction in costs, it is still unclear if it is costeffective in managing asthma or COPD. Therefore, this systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) aims to assess whether telemedicine interventions can be cost-effective in patients with asthma or COPD."

The remaining 24 studies performed a partial economic analysis, only comparing the costs between a digital intervention and the standard of care. Table  2  describes the economic perspective of each study, the intervention period, the type of costs evaluated, the costs and the difference in QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) (when applicable) of the digital health intervention and of the standard of care and the ICER (when applicable). All values are presented in Euro of 2024.\n\nEleven studies only adopted the healthcare perspective, eight adopted the societal perspective (with seven of them also adopting the healthcare perspective) and the remaining studies (n = 18) did not clarify the adopted perspective. The societal perspective considers the costs to be incurred by all stakeholders of the society, as opposed to the healthcare perspective that only considers the costs that the healthcare system needs to bear (excluding, therefore, items such as out-of-pocket costs paid by patients or indirect costs associated with productivity losses). Table  3  presents the economic perspective adopted in each study and the type of economic analysis performed.\n\nConsidering the studies whose interventions consisted of electronic patient diaries (n = 4), only one  [32]  performed a full economic analysis and concluded that the digital health intervention was not cost-effective (less costs but also lower amount of QALY). However, in this study, if the reference was the intervention group, the ICER would be 228435.6\u20ac/QALY. This was the only study in this group that involved COPD participants. The remaining studies assessed patients with asthma and performed partial economic analyses. Only one of those studies  [40]  concluded that the digital intervention was more costly than the standard of care (leading to an additional weekly cost of 2.52\u20ac per patient). This is the only study in this group that has low risk of bias. The other two studies concluded that the digital intervention was less costly, with one  [41]  reporting a weekly difference of 1.47\u20ac per patient between interventions and the other  [46]  reporting a weekly difference of 0.68\u20ac between the intervention and the standard of care groups.\n\nAmong studies that used teleconsultations as a digital health in-\n\ntervention, five provided phone calls to participants to inquire Study Diagnosis Inclusion criteria Sample size Mean age of participants Description of the intervention Type of digital health Lv S., 2019 [46] Asthma Children with positive asthma predictive index and willing and capable to correctly use an inhaler 152 participants 7.95 years Participants used a smartphone application that helped them manage their disease.

All the studies in this group conducted a partial economic analysis and concluded that the digital intervention was less costly than the standard of care. Half of the studies involved asthma participants  [36, 39, 45] , and the other half involved COPD participants  [21, 23, 24] . In this group, only one study is considered of low risk of bias  [36] .\n\nConsidering the group of studies that used real-time monitoring (n = 19), eight performed a full economic analysis [14, 16,    18-20, 27, 30, 37, 39] . Of these, one study  [20]  involved COPD participants and concluded that the digital health intervention was cost-effective, presenting an ICER of 14612.42\u20ac/QALY. Another study  [30] , also involving COPD participants, reported that the intervention was only cost-effective when considering the societal perspective (ICER of 3530,93\u20ac/QALY). In turn, another study  [37]  involved children and adults with asthma and concluded that the digital intervention was only cost-effective when considering the healthcare perspective in adults (ICER of 24,739\u20ac/QALY). The other studies assessed participants with COPD and concluded that digital health interventions were not cost-effective, presenting ICER ranging from 49,966\u20ac/QALY to 286,369,28\u20ac/QALY. There were 11 studies on real-time monitoring that conducted a partial economic analysis. All studies except one  [44]  concluded that the digital health intervention was less costly than the standard of care (cost differences ranging from 97.62\u20ac to 7424.1\u20ac). Of these studies, all but two  [35, 44]  included COPD participants. Among the low risk of bias studies in this group, four concluded that the intervention was economically favourable  [17, 20, 25, 29]  and two reported opposite results  [14, 19] .\n\nThe remaining studies (not included in any of the above categories) involved the use of SMS reminders, video interventions, web platforms and exercise encouragement phone calls (n = 6). Two studies in this group performed a full economic analysis.\n\nOne study  [31]  included COPD participants and compared the use of encouragement phone calls with routine face-to-face follow-up, in the hospital and in the community setting, concluding that the digital health intervention was cost-effective only when considering the community setting (ICER of 21,071\u20ac/QALY). In the other study  [43] , asthma participants received a DVD with explanation and illustration of how to carry out breathing exercises and motivational components. This intervention was considered cost-effective, with an ICER of 4738\u20ac/QALY. The remaining studies in this group performed only a partial economic analysis. Two studies, one  [8]  including asthma participants and the other  [47]  including both asthma and COPD participants, used text messages to remind participants to take their medication or to take an influenza vaccine and both concluded that this intervention was more expensive than the standard of care. The remaining studies involved participants with asthma using a web platform to answer different versions of the Asthma Control Questionnaire. One study  [38]  assessed adults and concluded that this intervention was more expensive than the standard of care and another study  [42]  assessed children and considered the intervention 219.02\u20ac less costly than the standard of care. Among the low risk of bias studies in this group, two concluded that the intervention was economically favourable  [31, 42]  and three reported opposite results  [8, 38, 47] ."

      "title": "| Discussion",
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that attempted to analyse the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions in the management of patients with asthma and/or COPD. We included  35   As demonstrated, the cost-effectiveness of an intervention largely depends on the willingness-to-pay threshold of each country, the healthcare organisation and also on the type of intervention and follow-up period. This makes it difficult to generalise results and to extract robust conclusions. However, our findings overall suggest that most studies consider the digital health intervention economically favourable.\n\nPrevious systematic reviews on cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions in other chronic conditions have applied a wide set of different methodologies. Nevertheless, in recent reviews, the most frequently reported type of digital health intervention used was video-conferencing  [48, 49] . By contrast, for asthma and COPD, real-time monitoring was the most frequent type of assessed intervention. This may be due to the fact that in asthma and COPD, the priority is to prevent exacerbations, rather than to provide scheduled consultations. As with this systematic review on asthma and COPD, systematic reviews on other chronic diseases tend to conclude that digital health interventions have a positive economic impact. However, they also agree that the generalisability of the results is complex and limited due to discrepancies in the modality of equipment used, cost items examined and type of economic analysis performed.\n\nIn our review, most included primary studies concluded that digital interventions are economically favourable since not only they are typically not expensive but also they have the potential to reduce exacerbations, leading to a reduction in costs related to nonscheduled primary care visits, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, medication use and work absenteeism. This is in line with studies related to other conditions prone to exacerbations, such as diabetes mellitus or heart failure  [50] .\n\nOnly six studies  [8, 35-37, 42, 46]  included children as participants. Most of them conducted a partial economic analysis, and all but two  [8, 37]  concluded that the intervention was less costly than the standard of care.\n\nWhether an intervention is cost-effective depends on the willingness-to-pay threshold of each country, so the results may vary considering the income of the country in study. Future research should focus on understudied contexts, such as low-income countries and rural societies. In fact, in these settings, patients may have more have limited access to health care and/or to Internet and more limited digital skills  [50] .\n\nProviding access to digital hardware and advocating for digital literacy is essential, especially in a generation willing to invest in digital tools in health care. Furthermore, costs of acquiring the equipment are one of the most relevant items that increases total costs of the intervention, so future research should also report longer intervention periods, as the costs of the digital equipment tend to decrease with prolonged usage  [51] . Finally, future research may also preferentially consist on complete economic evaluation analyses rather than partial economic studies.\n\nOur review has some limitations. Firstly, studies were very diverse in terms of costs evaluated and intervention period analysed, limiting the comparisons we were able to perform. Secondly, the majority of the studies raised some concerns in terms of risk of bias mainly due to missing outcome data. Thirdly, most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries, so our findings may not be generalised to low and middle-income countries. Additionally, most of the studies included in this review are more than 10 years old, potentially not reflecting the most recent technological developments. Finally, many primary studies were not full economic evaluation studies, but only compared the costs of the digital health intervention versus standard of care. A full economic analysis takes into account the costs and the consequences/outcomes of an intervention, while a partial analysis only considers the costs of the intervention. Having conducted a full economic evaluation study would be particularly relevant in cases which the digital health intervention was found to be more costly than the standard of care (in order to assess whether the society would be willing to pay for the additional costs considering the expected additional gains in health outcomes).\n\nThis systematic review has also some strengths. Firstly, we encompassed a broad set of digital health interventions, allowing us to assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of teleconsultations, electronic patient diaries and real-time monitoring interventions. We included only RCT, which are less prone to confounding (particularly for the assessment of the consequences of interventions) than observational studies  [52] . Our literature research comprised three different electronic bibliographic databases, and we did not use exclusion criteria based on the date or language of publication. Finally, the articles were screened and selected by two reviewers, with disagreements being resolved through consensus or through a third reviewer in cases where discrepancies remained unresolved."

      "title": "| Conclusion",
      "text": "Our study gives preliminary findings about the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions in the management of asthma and/or COPD. We have stratified the studies by the type of digital intervention used, in order to provide a more useful resource for practice, research and decision-making. Most studies suggest that these interventions are favourable from an economic point of view, particularly when referring to teleconsultations and real-time monitoring in adult patients. Despite having more studies involving COPD patients, in both asthma and COPD most assessed digital health interventions seem to be associated with less costs (or with small increases in costs) and higher health-related quality-of-life. However, an effort should be made to conduct more high-quality studies, since most of the studies included in this review are more than 10 years old and consist of partial economic analyses."

The results obtained from other digital interventions (such as electronic patient diaries, text messages or web platforms) reported contradictory results. However, each of these interventions was assessed by a smaller amount of studies."
