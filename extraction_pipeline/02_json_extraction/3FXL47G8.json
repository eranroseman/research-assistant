  "title": "Circular Business Model for Digital Health Solutions: Protocol for a Scoping Review",
  "abstract": "Background: The circular economy reshapes the linear \"take, make, and dispose\" approach and evolves around minimizing waste and recapturing resources in a closed-loop system. The health sector accounts for 4.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions and has, over the decades, been built to rely on single-use devices and deal with high volumes of medical waste. With the increase in the adoption of digital health solutions in the health care industry, leading the industry into a new paradigm of how we provide health care, a focus must be put on the amount of waste that will follow. Digital health solutions will shape health care through the use of technology and lead to improved patient care, but they will also make medical waste more complex to deal with due to the e-waste component. Therefore, a transformation of the health care industry to a circular economy is a crucial cornerstone in decreasing the impact on the environment. Objective: This study aims to address the lack of direction in the current literature on circular business models. It will consider micro, meso, and macro factors that would impact the operational validity of circular models using the digital health solutions ePaper label (medical packaging), smart wearable sensor (health monitoring devices), smart pill box (medication management), and endo-cutter (surgical equipment) as examples. \n Methods: The study will systematically perform a scoping review through a database and snowball search. We will analyze and classify the studies from a predetermined set of categories and then summarize them into an evidence map. Based on the review, the study will develop a 2D framework for businesses to follow or for future research to take a standpoint from. Results: Preliminarily, the review has analyzed 26 studies in total. The results are close to equally distributed among the micro (8/26, 31%), meso (10/26, 38%), and macro (8/26, 31%) levels. Circular economy studies emphasize several circular practices such as recycling (17/26, 65%), reusing (18/26, 69%), reducing (15/26, 58%), and remanufacturing (8/26, 31%). The value proposition in the examined business model is mostly dominated by stand-alone products (18/26, 69%) compared to product as a service (7/26, 27%), involving stakeholders such as health care professionals or hospitals (20/26, 77%), manufacturers (11/26, 42%), and consumers (9/26, 35%). All studies encompass societal (12/26, 46%), economic (23/26, 88%), and environmental (24/26, 92%) viewpoints. \n Conclusions: The study argues that each digital health solution would have to be accessed individually to find the optimal business model to follow. This is due to their differing life cycles and complexity. The manufacturer will need a layered value proposition, implementing several business models dependent on their respective product portfolios. The need to incorporate several business models implies an ecosystem perspective that is relevant to consider.",

      "text": "A circular economy is a system that has been evolving in theory and practice for decades, with a core focus on minimizing waste and reprocessing products in a closed-loop system  [1] [2] [3] [4] . Grounded in a circular economy, a circular business model follows the same core fundament by emphasizing the creation and capture of value  [2, 5] . Businesses in resource-intensive industries, such as health care, can find a lot of value in implementing circular business models for their products to decrease their environmental footprints and become more resource efficient. Although circularity is not a mainstream model, several sectors have successfully started incorporating circular practices, especially in the utilities and consumer goods industries  [6, 7] . Yet with the advancement of circular models, health care seems to lag in the implementation of circular practices compared to other industries  [8] .\n\nAs global technological advancement continues, the health care industry has witnessed a surge in the adoption of digital health solutions across hospitals, health care professionals, and patients  [9] . Given the increased production and use of digital health solutions, they have become a good use case for circular business models and could serve as a pivotal tool for reshaping the health care supply chain and business models. These intricate products are resource-intensive, comprising diverse materials such as metals, plastics, glass, and electronic components, all handled in the current linear waste management system. A waste management system refers to a strategy for how companies dispose of, reduce, and reuse waste  [10, 11] . Waste management in health care is often complex, especially in hospitals, with multiple streams of high volumes of waste generated daily  [10] [11] [12] . Although several studies have delved into incorporating circular practices in hospital or home care waste management systems  [10, 11] , research on a broader system-level viewpoint incorporating the supply chain, its stakeholders, and their interconnectedness is lacking  [13] . Therefore, the main focus of this review will not be the patient but rather the system and its stakeholders. Nevertheless, as patient focus is at the core of all health care operations, this should be done while acknowledging and considering the role and importance of the patient in it.\n\nThe current literature landscape's lack of consensus on how to develop a circular business model in health care does not arise due to disagreements on how circular waste management should be introduced but rather stems from a lack of knowledge and research on the topic. This conundrum could hint toward current circular business model solutions being too generalized and not considering the specificities of the health care industry and digital health to be implemented. Circularity must thus be implemented on a product-or industry-specific level to succeed  [7] .\n\nFor instance, 2 crucial characteristics of digital health solutions would make the implementation of a generic circular model fail. First, the term digital health \"solution\" is used on purpose instead of \"device\" because the product not only contains hardware but also software and data components (Figure  1 ). Apart from the circular practices of the solution's hardware, we must also consider the waste of data, both in terms of the climate impact data storage has through embedded CO 2 emissions due to electricity use and the continuous use as well as the repurposing of data. Even within digital health solutions, a distinction must also be made between the different types of life cycles the solutions have due to their varying use. Some digital health solutions never leave the hospital, in which case it can be easier to control their reprocessing, while other solutions are owned by the patients, which can leave uncertainties on take-back schemes in a circular business model. Second, the contamination risk of medical solutions adds an additional layer of regulatory and operational complexity that also must be considered in the operations of the circular model. You need to ensure the product does not spread or contain harmful elements impacting human health and the environment. The motivation behind developing an industry-specific model forms the purpose of this scoping review: to theoretically develop a framework that businesses can take as a standpoint  [7] . This fills the call for research combining circularity and digital health in health care and bridging the research gaps by merging the concepts.\n\nTo develop concepts for tailored circular business models for digital health solutions, this scoping review examines existing circular models in the health care industry and of other similar products in other industries. To make the analysis concrete, 4 product categories will be used as examples: medical packaging (ePaper label), health monitoring devices (smart wearable sensor), medication management (smart pill box), and surgical equipment (endo-cutter). These 4 products are representative of medical versus nonmedical, as well as single-use versus recurrent-use products."

      "title": "Unit of Analysis",
      "text": "The unit of analysis in the scoping review is the circular business model. This is due to it being the core concept that motivates and justifies the performance of the study. The units of analysis can be broken down into circular and business models. Circularity will be defined through the concept of the 4 R's (recycle, reuse, reduce, and remanufacture) and the MacArthur butterfly model  [2]  and hence refers to the concept of creating a closed-loop system where resources are remanufactured, reused, and recycled instead of being disposed of after use. The 4 R's and the butterfly model both emphasize the importance of reducing waste and creating a circular economy. The second part of the unit of analysis, the business model, is a framework that describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value  [14] . It is a conceptual tool that helps businesses articulate and communicate their strategy, operations, and revenue models in a concise and structured manner  [5, 14] ."

    {
      "title": "Theoretical Boundaries",
      "text": "A set of theoretical boundaries will guide the scoping review. First, as the research on circular business models in health care is limited, the search does not solely focus on the health care industry but also related industries such as wellness. To avoid a scope that is too broad, it is important to narrow down the types of solutions to be examined and only include products that have similar components (Figure  1 ) or business models to a digital health solution. The study will therefore include specific types of products that contain hardware, software, or data and preferably are part of a highly regulated industry. Second, the study will not only take into account traditional business model factors such as revenue stream and value proposition but also the environmental and societal impact of the circular model being examined. This would involve a comprehensive analysis of the economic, environmental, and social benefits and costs of the circular model being proposed or implemented, as well as any potential trade-offs that may arise."

      "text": "The scoping review will provide valuable information for future research in the circular economy as well as within the European Union (EU)-funded Digital Health in Circular Economy (DiCE) project and the stakeholders involved  [15] . The adoption of circular economy principles by businesses developing digital health solutions has the potential to align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  [16] . The scoping review addresses SDG 3 on good health and well-being and SDG 9 on industry, innovation, and infrastructure  [16] . Furthermore, the circular economy can also support economic growth and job creation. Lastly, the research is also relevant to SDG 12, as part of the business model comes from the value of returned materials, both in economic terms and in more environmental settings, to avoid depleting scarce resources  [15] ."

To support the research question, a set of subquestions has been created to guide the analysis. 1 . What are the barriers and enablers of implementing circular economy practices in the digital health market, and how can they be addressed? (This question will enlighten why traditional circular practices do not apply to the digital health market and where the existing models should be adapted.) 2 . How are value and cost both negatively and positively redistributed in implementing a circular business model and impacting its key targets and performance indicators?\n\n(This question will discover how the business model of the solutions will change in terms of value. Value can be seen as financial, epistemic, ethical, service, and reputation.) 3. How would operating systems and data gathered by the solutions be affected positively or negatively by circularity? (This question focuses specifically on the software and data management parts of the solutions to ensure circularity is not only observed from the hardware perspective.)"

Furthermore, a separate cross-checking search in PubMed has been done to ensure the databases include studies within the industry of interest, health care. Scopus and Web of Science have been chosen for several reasons. First, they both cover interdisciplinary results, thus fitting the scope of the scoping review into circularity, business model, and health care. Second, the databases have similar search functions, making the standard search protocol easier to follow without too much adaptation from one database to another. Third, they are some of the biggest databases and have a broad reach. Following the research protocol, a set of search criteria and search strategies have been applied when searching in the mentioned databases.\n\nThe snowball search will be performed by screening the reference list of selected studies and their references. The dual search approach will help ensure a more comprehensive scoping review and provide a complete understanding of the topic. The keywords have been chosen by testing the number of hits for each keyword and using the snowball search technique to choose relevant keywords.\n\nA total of 3 search queries have been created to enlighten the different layers of the research question (Table  1 ). One topic is the life cycle and supply chain of digital health solution. No relevant results appeared when searching for explicit terms of digital health. Therefore, the first search has a broader level and focuses on products in health care, wellness, fitness, or medicine and will be manually sorted based on whether they are or resemble digital health solutions. The second and third topics are the solution's individual components, which are hardware, software, and data.\n\nTable 1. Search queries."

Second, in the literature search, the review only focuses on studies from 2010 onward. Therefore, older, important articles might be missed and not included in the review, which the readers should be aware of."

      "text": "The conclusion and outcome of the review will show that a circular business model for digital health solutions will be very specific to what kind of product it is. This will in the future require manufacturers to have a clear end-of-life management plan for their product and incorporate a layered value proposition. Furthermore, to make the value proposition and end-of-life management of the products successful, the review implies they must engage in an ecosystem with several actors to close the circular loop."
