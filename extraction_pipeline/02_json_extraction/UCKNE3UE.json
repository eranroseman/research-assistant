  "abstract": "Background--Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, but most ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients do not obtain enough. \n Methods and Results--ACTIVE REWARD (A Clinical Trial Investigating Effects of a Randomized Evaluation of Wearable Activity Trackers with Financial Rewards) was a 24-week home-based, remotely monitored, randomized trial with a 16-week intervention (8week ramp-up incentive phase and 8-week maintenance incentive phase) and an 8-week follow-up. Patients used wearable devices to track step counts and establish a baseline. Patients in control received no other interventions. Patients in the incentive arm received personalized step goals and daily feedback for all 24 weeks. In the ramp-up incentive phase, daily step goals increased weekly by 15% from baseline with a maximum of 10 000 steps and then remained fixed. Each week, $14 was allocated to a virtual account; $2 could be lost per day for not achieving step goals. The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. Ischemic heart disease patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (  11 ) years and 70% were male. Compared with control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp-up (1388 versus 385; adjusted difference, 1061 [95% confidence interval, 386-1736]; P<0.01), maintenance (1501 versus  264; adjusted difference, 1368 [95% confidence interval, 571-2164]; P<0.001), and follow-up (1066 versus 92; adjusted difference, 1154 [95% confidence interval, 282-2027]; P<0.01). Conclusions--Loss-framed financial incentives with personalized goal setting significantly increased physical activity among ischemic heart disease patients using wearable devices during the 16-week intervention, and effects were sustained during the 8week follow-up.",

Patients were excluded if they were already enrolled in a formal cardiac rehabilitation program within the past 1 year, did not have access to a smartphone or tablet compatible with the wearable device, were admitted to the hospital and were not being discharged to home, or had any other reason that participation was unsafe (eg, hemodynamic instability or New York Heart Association Class III-IV heart failure) or infeasible (eg, inability to provide informed consent)."

To prevent potential mismeasurement, we ignored any daily values less than 1000 steps because evidence indicates that these values are unlikely to represent capture of actual activity.  26, 27 If less than 4 days of data were available during the second week (n=5), the patient was contacted to inquire about any device issues and the run-in period was expanded until at least 4 days of data were captured."

The wearable device was preset with the goal of 10 000 steps per day and could be adjusted by the patient. The wearable device displayed progress toward that goal using a circular dial, and actual step counts were available within the smartphone application. Patients in this arm received no other interventions. Patients in the incentive arm received daily feedback on their performance for all 24 weeks. In the ramp-up incentive phase (weeks 1-8), daily step goals increased gradually from baseline by 15% each week with a maximum goal of 10 000 steps. After 8 weeks, step goals then remained fixed during the maintenance incentive phase (weeks 9-16) and the follow-up phase without incentives (weeks 17-24). During the 16-week intervention, patients were offered a loss-framed financial incentive. Each week, patients were informed upfront that $14 was allocated to a virtual account. Each day the patient achieved his or her step goal, the balance remained unchanged, but each day the step goal was not achieved, the patient was informed that $2 had been deducted. The balance was refreshed with $14 every week on Monday. This design leveraged 4 important psychological principles: Individuals tend to be more motivated by losses than gains,  18, 28  favor immediate over delayed gratification,  29  try to avoid the feeling of regret,  [30] [31] [32] [33]  and tend to be more driven for aspirational behavior around temporal landmarks such as the beginning of the week (the fresh start effect).  34 fter the 16-week intervention period and 24-week trial, patients in both arms were asked to complete self-reported surveys on healthcare utilization (participation in cardiac rehabilitation, cardiac catherization, cardiology clinic visit, emergency room visit, and hospital admission) and perceptions of the overall study and wearable device."

      "text": "Power calculations (a priori) were based on previous work  17- 19  and assumed a baseline mean step count of 6000 steps in the control group with an SD of 2000 steps, a 15% dropout rate, and a 2-sided a of 0.05. It was estimated that a sample of 148 patients (74 per arm) would ensure at least 80% power to detect a 1000-step difference between the incentive and control arms in the change in mean daily steps from baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. However, enrollment was closed with 105 patients because of funding constraints on the timeline. Based on these same assumptions, we had at least 80% power to detect a 1200-step difference.\n\nAll randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. For each patient on each day of the study (patient-day level), the number of steps achieved was obtained as a continuous variable. Data could be missing for any day if a patient did not use the activity tracking device or did not upload data. One patient had very high step counts compared to others in the study. After investigation, we learned that the patient frequently played the drums and there have been reports of inaccurate step tracking from this activity.  35, 36 herefore, all of this patient's data were deemed invalid and classified as missing. For the prespecified main analysis, we used multiple imputation for data that were missing and step values less than 1000. We have used this method in previous work  [17] [18] [19] 25  and in this study because evidence indicates that step values less than 1000 may not represent accurate data capture.  26, 27 7 Five imputations were conducted using the mice package in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), which allows for patient random effects with this data structure. 37  The following predictors of missing data were included: study arm, week of study, calendar month, baseline step count, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, household income, body mass index, days since last cardiac catheterization, most recent ejection fraction, and history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and valvular heart disease. Results were combined using Rubin's standard rules.  38  Se ondary analyses were conducted using collected data without multiple imputation, both with and without step values less than 1000.\n\nUnadjusted analyses estimated the change in mean daily steps from baseline to each week and each phase (ramp-up, maintenance, and follow-up) of the study. In adjusted analyses, we used PROC GLIMMIX in SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) to fit linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept, patient random effects, and to account for the repeated measures of daily step counts. In the main model, we included baseline step count and fixed effects for calendar month and study arm. To test the robustness of our findings, we also fit a fully adjusted model that included age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, household income, body mass index, days since last cardiac catheterization, most recent ejection fraction, and history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and valvular heart disease. We assumed a normal distribution and obtained difference in steps between arms for each phase (ramp-up, maintenance, and follow-up) using the least squares means (LSMEANS) command. In a post-hoc exploratory subgroup analysis, we evaluated effects in patients with recent care for IHD by fitting the same models for only patients who had a cardiac catheterization within the 90 days preceding enrolling in the study.\n\nHypothesis tests were 2-sided using a significance level of 0.05. Analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc) and R software (version 3.4.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing)."

      "text": "In this trial, 105 patients with IHD were randomized (Figure  1 ). Patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11) years, 70% were male, and 74% enrolled in the trial within 90 days after a cardiac catheterization. Baseline patient characteristics were well balanced across the study arms (Table  1 ). Baseline mean daily steps were 6577 (SD, 3084) in control and 7205 (SD, 3246) in the incentive arm, which was not significantly different (P=0.32).\n\nOne hundred three patients (98%) completed the entire 24week study. During the maintenance period, 22.0% of observations were missing and 1.9% of step counts were less than 1000. In the control arm, these rates were higher with 38.6% observations missing and 1.4% of step counts less than 1000 (Table  S1 ).\n\nIn the control arm, the unadjusted change in mean daily steps from baseline began near 500 during the first 6 weeks, but then slowly declined throughout the rest of the study (Figure  2 ). In the incentive arm, the unadjusted change in mean daily steps from baseline began above 1000 in week 1 and increased during the ramp-up incentive phase to nearly 2000. Mean change in daily steps from baseline remained above 1250 for the maintenance period and then slightly declined in the follow-up period ranging from 850 to 1250 (Figure  2 ).\n\nIn the main adjusted model compared with control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp-up (1388 versus 385; adjusted difference, 1061\n\n[95% confidence interval [CI], 386-1736]; P<0.01), maintenance (1501 versus 264; adjusted difference, 1368 [95% CI, 571-2164]; P<0.001), and follow-up (1066 versus 92; adjusted difference, 1154 [95% CI, 282-2027]; P<0.01). Results were qualitatively similar in the fully adjusted model (Table  2 ) and in secondary analyses that used collected data (Tables  S2  and  S3 ).\n\nSeventy-eight patients (74.3%) had recent care for IHD as indicated by a cardiac catheterization within the 90 days preceding enrolling in the study. Subset analyses among this group found that compared with control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp-up (1331 versus 276; adjusted difference, 1131 [95% CI, 466-1797]; P<0.001), maintenance (1445 versus 142; adjusted difference, 1509 [95% CI, 720-2297]; P<0.001), and follow-up (1225 versus 4; adjusted difference, 1455 [95% CI, 745-2376]; P<0.001; Table  S4 ).\n\nNo adverse events were reported during the entire trial. Total cost of loss-framed incentives was $5194, which averaged $103.88 per patient. Self-reported healthcare utilization was similar between arms (Tables  S5  and  S6 ). By the end of the intervention, only 8 patients (3 in control and 5 in the incentive arm) reported joining a formal cardiac rehabilitation program. Most patients reported positive perceptions of their experience in the study, but more patients in the incentive arm agreed that they would continue to use the wearable device after the study completed (83.8% versus 5.8%; Table  S7 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this trial, we found that loss-framed financial incentives with personalized goal setting and wearable devices significantly increased physical activity among IHD patients over a 6-month period including 8 weeks of follow-up without incentives. To our knowledge, this is 1 of the first studies to demonstrate the successful use of financial incentives and wearable devices to increase physical activity among this high-risk population. Subset analyses found similar results among the 74% of patients who had recent care for IHD as indicated by a cardiac catheterization within the 90 days preceding enrolling in the study. This intervention remotely monitored patients using an automated technology platform and wearable devices and therefore has the potential to be scaled more broadly.\n\nOur findings reveal several important implications for future intervention design. First, a key element of our study design was the use of loss aversion, a principle from behavioral economics.  13, [17] [18] [19] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]   behavior is achieved. However, our previous work among overweight and obese individuals found that loss-framed incentives were more effective than gain-framed incentives.  18 esults from this trial confirm that loss-framed incentives can significantly increase physical activity among high-risk cardiovascular disease patients. We also found that loss-framed incentives led to sustained effects during the 8-week followup without incentives (1154 more steps). Whereas physical activity in the incentive arm declined slightly from maintenance to follow-up, activity during both periods was higher than during the ramp-up phase (1061 more steps). It is also important to note that physical activity levels in the control arm declined over time, most rapidly during the follow-up phase. Nonetheless, future studies should evaluate the sustainability of incentive effects over longer-term periods and could compare incentive designs that vary in magnitude, duration, or frequency. Future studies could also evaluate financial incentives and personalized feedback independently to assess differential effects. Second, our approach to goal setting was unique from most previous financial incentive-based intervention studies. Many physical activity interventions that use incentives are designed with static step goals that ask individuals to immediately achieve large step increases.  16, 40, 42 In this trial, we used a ramp-up phase to gradually increase physical activity goals (15% increase per week) and personalized these goals using the patient's baseline step count. This approach mirrors that of cardiac rehabilitation programs.  5, 7 Future studies could directly compare immediate versus gradually increasing step goals and evaluate different trajectories for step-goal increases.\n\nThird, this trial used a home-based, remotely monitored intervention that could be scaled more broadly by leveraging technology. IHD patients in this study all met eligibility criteria for cardiac rehabilitation, but only 7.6% reported enrolling in a formal program by the end of the intervention. Nationally, cardiac rehabilitation enrollment rates are suboptimal.  8, 10, 11 lthough our intervention does not substitute for cardiac rehabilitation, it may be an effective method to increase physical activity in patients who are eligible but do not participate in these programs. Future studies could build upon this approach to further test a home-based, remotely monitored cardiac rehabilitation program.\n\nOur study is subject to several limitations. First, patients were from 4 hospitals in southeastern Pennsylvania and needed access to a smartphone or tablet, which may limit generalizability. Second, we evaluated physical activity using step counts and did not have data on other measures of physical activity, device wear time, or other health outcomes. However, step counts are most commonly displayed by wearable devices and have been successfully used in interventions with small improvements in clinical outcomes across different populations.  43 Future studies could evaluate both changes in step counts and other clinical outcomes over longer periods. Third, the control arm had slightly higher missing data rates than the incentive arm. However, our imputation and regression models both used patient random effects to adjust for differential variation across patients and arms. We also found similar results when using imputed and nonimputed data. Fourth, whereas effects were sustained during follow-up, daily feedback was continued and physical activity did decline slightly. Further evaluations are needed to determine longer-term sustainability. Fifth, the control arm did not receive daily feedback or personalized goal setting, and so we were unable to isolate the effects of the financial incentive alone. Sixth, in this study, loss-framed incentives were compared with control and not with gain-framed incentives. Future studies could compare different ways to frame incentives in this study population to increase physical activity."

      "text": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Among patients that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality. However, despite CR being a Class I (standard of care) recommendation in multiple American Heart Association AMI guidelines, more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive appropriate CR and much of this is due to challenges in access to these programs. Recent innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual's physical activity using wearable devices. Incentives designed using insights from behavioral economics have been demonstrated to motivate device engagement and behavior change. A remotely-monitored CR program could improve access for many individuals and potentially be more cost-effective because it is less resource-and personnel-intensive. The objective of this study is to use a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based, remotely monitored program using wearable devices and financial incentives to increase physical activity. Participants will go through four phases: baseline period (weeks 1-2), ramp-up period (weeks 3-10), maintenance period (weeks 11-18), and follow-up period (weeks 19-26)."

Since CR centers are often located in more urban areas, patients that live in more rural locations or without transportation may have difficulty reaching these centers.\n\nRecent innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual's physical activity using wearable devices (6). These devices have been demonstrated to be accurate for tracking step counts (7) and could be utilized to deploy a home-based intervention. Recently, the concept of a remotely-monitored, internet-based CR program has been shown to be safe and superior to usual care (in terms of reducing CVD risk) in a small Canadian pilot study (8). A remotelymonitored CR program would provide access for the many individuals that cannot reach a CR center and potentially, in the future, could be more cost-effective because it is less resource-and personnel-intensive. The optimal range of steps for secondary prevention of AMI is in the range of 6500-8500 steps/day (9).\n\n[1] Murray et al, US Burden of Disease Collaborators. The State of US Health, 1990-2010.

Patients will be randomized to one of the two arms using a block size of four. To account for possible differences in reimbursement for CR among patients with and without Medicare, we will stratify the randomization by age (less than 65 years vs. 65 years and older). Since referral to a standard health system CR program is recommended for all patients after an acute myocardial infarction, we will not attempt to modify current referral and adherence patterns to these programs. However, data suggest that more than 80% will not actually obtain this type of cardiac rehabilitation. During the study, we will ask all patients whether or not they participated in a standard cardiac rehabilitation program.\n\nAll participants will receive $20 for enrolling and $30 for completing the 26 week study. All participants will be given the option to have an in-person visit with the study coordinator at the beginning and after the maintenance period to conduct the six minute walk test. If a participant chooses to participate they will receive $30 for each visit.\n\nParticipants in all arms will be informed of the CDC/federal recommendation guidelines for physical activity and receive additional interventions as follows:\n\nArm 1. Control: use a wearable device to track physical activity and sleep data. Receive reminders to use their device and sync their data.\n\nArm 2. Financial incentive-based program: Participants will be given a wearable device to monitor daily step counts and sleep patterns with automated feedback on physical activity goal attainment via text message, automated interactive voice call or email (based on participant communication choice). Based on recommendations for the optimal step count for secondary prevention of AMI, we will establish a baseline step count for each participant (weeks 1-2) and then recommend a 15 percentage point increase in daily step goal each week during the 8-week ramp-up phase (weeks 3-10) with a maximum goal of 10,000 steps. After the ramp-up phase, participants will be asked to maintain that daily step goal for the maintenance period (weeks 11-18). After 18 weeks, financial incentives will be stopped and the participants will be followed for an additional 8 weeks with the same step goal as the maintenance period (weeks 19-26).\n\nParticipants will be given daily feedback on whether or not they achieved their daily step goal on the prior day, for the entire intervention and follow-up period. Participants will be told at the beginning of each week during the ramp-up and maintenance phases that $14 has been placed in a virtual account for them. Each day during the week that the participant does not meet their daily step goal, $2 will be removed from their account. Accrued winnings will be sent to the participant by check via US mail at the end of each month. There will be no financial incentive during the 2-week baseline period or the 8-week follow-up period."

All participants will provide informed consent for access to these materials. The data to be collected include demographic data (e.g., age, sex, self-identified race), outcome data, and daily activity data collected by the wearable device. Research material that is obtained will be used for research purposes only. The same procedure used for the analysis of automated data sources to ensure protection of patient information will be used for the survey data, in that patient identifiers will be used only for linkage purposes or to contact patients. The study identification number, and not other identifying information, will be used on all data collection instruments. All study staff will be reminded to appreciate the confidential nature of the data collected and contained in these databases. The Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services (PMACS) will be the hub for the hardware and database infrastructure that will support the project and is where the Way to Health web portal is based. The PMACS is a joint effort of the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, the Cardiovascular Institute, the Department of Pathology, and the Leonard Davis Institute. The PMACS provides a secure computing environment for a large volume of highly sensitive data, including clinical, genetic, socioeconomic, and financial information. Among the IT projects currently managed by PMACS are: (1) the capture and organization of complex, longitudinal clinical data via web and clinical applications portals from cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials; (2) the integration of genetic array databases and clinical data obtained from patients with cardiovascular disease; (3) computational biology and cytometry database management and analyses; (4) economic and health policy research using Medicare claims from over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. PMACS requires all users of data or applications on PMACS servers to complete a PMACShosted cybersecurity awareness course annually, which stresses federal data security policies under data use agreements with the university. The curriculum includes Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training and covers secure data transfer, passwords, computer security habits and knowledge of what constitutes misuse or inappropriate use of the server. We will implement multiple, redundant protective measures to guarantee the privacy and security of the participant data. All investigators and research staff with direct access to the identifiable data will be required to undergo annual responsible conduct of research, cybersecurity, and HIPAA certification in accordance with University of Pennsylvania regulations. All data for this project will be stored on the secure/firewalled servers of the PMACS Data Center, in data files that will be protected by multiple password layers. These data servers are maintained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited physical access rights. They are also cyber-protected by extensive firewalls and multiple layers of communication encryption. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by University of Pennsylvania system managers. We will use highly secure methods of data encryption for all transactions involving participants' financial information using a level of security comparable to what is used in commercial financial transactions. We believe this multi-layer system of data security, identical to the system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems medical records, greatly minimizes the risk of loss of privacy. In addition, risk of loss of confidentiality will be minimized by storing completed paper copies of the surveys and signed informed consent forms in locked file cabinets in locked offices accessible only to trained study staff. Each subject will be assigned a unique identifier without identifying information, and data will be entered into an electronic database using only the unique identifier. Only trained study staff will have access to the code that links the unique identifier to the subject's identity. Electronic data will be stored on secure, password-protected firewalled servers at the University of Pennsylvania."

      "text": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Among patients that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality. However, despite CR being a Class I (standard of care) recommendation in multiple American Heart Association AMI guidelines, more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive appropriate CR and much of this is due to challenges in access to these programs. Recent innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual's physical activity using wearable devices. Incentives designed using insights from behavioral economics have been demonstrated to motivate device engagement and behavior change. A remotely-monitored CR program could improve access for many individuals and potentially be more cost-effective because it is less resource-and personnel-intensive. The objective of this study is to use a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based, remotely monitored program using wearable devices and financial incentives to increase physical activity. Participants will go through four phases: baseline period (weeks 1-2), ramp-up period (weeks 3-10), maintenance period (weeks 11-18), and follow-up period (weeks 19-26)."

To account for possible differences in reimbursement for CR among patients with and without Medicare, we will stratify the randomization by age (less than 65 years vs. 65 years and older). Since referral to a standard health system CR program is recommended for all patients after an acute myocardial infarction, we will not attempt to modify current referral and adherence patterns to these programs. However, data suggest that more than 80% will not actually obtain this type of cardiac rehabilitation. During the study, we will ask all patients whether or not they participated in a standard cardiac rehabilitation program.\n\nAll participants will receive $20 for enrolling and $30 for completing the 26 week study. All participants will be given the option to have an in-person visit with the study coordinator at the beginning and after the maintenance period to conduct the six minute walk test. If a participant chooses to participate they will receive $30 for each visit.\n\nParticipants in all arms will be informed of the CDC/federal recommendation guidelines for physical activity and receive additional interventions as follows:\n\nArm 1. Control: use a wearable device to track physical activity and sleep data. Receive reminders to use their device and sync their data.\n\nArm 2. Financial incentive-based program: Participants will be given a wearable device to monitor daily step counts and sleep patterns with automated feedback on physical activity goal attainment via text message, automated interactive voice call or email (based on participant communication choice). Based on recommendations for the optimal step count for secondary prevention of AMI, we will establish a baseline step count for each participant (weeks 1-2) and then recommend a 15 percentage point increase in daily step goal each week during the 8-week ramp-up phase (weeks 3-10) with a maximum goal of 10,000 steps. After the ramp-up phase, participants will be asked to maintain that daily step goal for the maintenance period (weeks 11-18). After 18 weeks, financial incentives will be stopped and the participants will be followed for an additional 8 weeks with the same step goal as the maintenance period (weeks 19-26).\n\nParticipants will be given daily feedback on whether or not they achieved their daily step goal on the prior day, for the entire intervention and follow-up period. Participants will be told at the beginning of each week during the ramp-up and maintenance phases that $14 has been placed in a virtual account for them. Each day during the week that the participant does not meet their daily step goal, $2 will be removed from their account. Accrued winnings will be sent to the participant by check via US mail at the end of each month. There will be no financial incentive during the 2-week baseline period or the 8-week follow-up period."

If participants are still interested in participating, the Way to Health portal will take them through an automated online informed consent. The consent document will be divided into sections and potential participants will have to click a button to advance through each section. This is to help ensure that participants read the consent form thoroughly by breaking down the form into manageable blocks of text. Each section will have a button allowing the user to contact a researcher via email or by telephone if they have questions about the consent form. Successive screens will explain the voluntary nature of the study, the risks and benefits of participation, alternatives to participation, and that participants can withdraw from the study at any time. On the final consent screen, potential participants who click a clearly delineated button stating that they agree to participate in the study will be considered to have consented to enroll. After consenting, participants will complete an online questionnaire to determine their eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the study arms and led through an automated description of the details specific to that arm. Participants will be provided with details regarding how to contact the research team via email or phone at any time if they subsequently wish to withdraw from the study.

Interested participants will be directed to the online Way to Health study website to review and provide informed consent, complete eligibility and baseline questionnaires, and if eligible enroll in the study.\n\nAll participants will receive a wearable device from the study coordinator and be asked to authorize the device to electronically transmit de-identified data to the study database.\n\nParticipants in this arm will be told to wear the step tracking device for the next two weeks and get used to the device. They will be provided with the study coordinator's email and phone number to contact with any questions. Participants will be told that they need to sync their wearable device with their smartphone in order for data to be transmitted to the study team. Participants will receive regular reminders during the baseline period to wear and sync their devices. If the study coordinator notices that a participant is not transmitting data during this two-week baseline period, they will contact the participant to determine the reason and offer assistance on how to use the device. After the two-week baseline period is completed, a baseline step count will be calculated using the second week of step count data and ignoring days on which the individual had less than 1,000 steps. We use the second week of data rather than both weeks in case the individual has more activity during the first week simply because they got a new device. We ignore days on which less than\n\n1,000 steps are recorded because prior research suggests that this is unlikely to be appropriate capture of physical activity (Rowe et al. Pediatric Exercise Science. 2004;16:1-12. Kang et al. Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science. 2004;9(4):233-250.) and including these values may inappropriately downward bias the baseline step level for that individual. If at least four days of data are not available to calculate th baseline step count, then the period will extend until at least four days of data are available.\n\nOnce a baseline step level has been determined, participants will be sent a message to log into Way to Health to receive further instructions on their arm design as described previously in section 5.1: design."

Investigators Mitesh Patel, MD, MBA, MS is the Principal Investigator (PI) and is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Health Care Management at the Perelman School of Medicine and The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He has past experience leading six clinical trials using the Way to Health Platform to deploy interventions using financial and social incentives to promote weight loss and increased physical activity. He currently spends 80% of his effort on research and 20% on clinical and teaching activities. Department of Pathology, and the Leonard Davis Institute. The PMACS provides a secure computing environment for a large volume of highly sensitive data, including clinical, genetic, socioeconomic, and financial information. Among the IT projects currently managed by PMACS are: (1) the capture and organization of complex, longitudinal clinical data via web and clinical applications portals from cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials; (2) the integration of genetic array databases and clinical data obtained from patients with cardiovascular disease; (3) computational biology and cytometry database management and analyses; (4) economic and health policy research using Medicare claims from over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. PMACS requires all users of data or applications on PMACS servers to complete a PMACShosted cybersecurity awareness course annually, which stresses federal data security policies under data use agreements with the university. The curriculum includes Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training and covers secure data transfer, passwords, computer security habits and knowledge of what constitutes misuse or inappropriate use of the server. We will implement multiple, redundant protective measures to guarantee the privacy and security of the participant data. All investigators and research staff with direct access to the identifiable data will be required to undergo annual responsible conduct of research, cybersecurity, and HIPAA certification in accordance with University of Pennsylvania regulations.\n\nAll data for this project will be stored on the secure/firewalled servers of the PMACS Data Center, in data files that will be protected by multiple password layers. These data servers are maintained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited physical access rights. They are also cyber-protected by extensive firewalls and multiple layers of communication encryption. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by University of Pennsylvania system managers. We will use highly secure methods of data encryption for all transactions involving participants' financial information using a level of security comparable to what is used in commercial financial transactions. We believe this multi-layer system of data security, identical to the system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems medical records, greatly minimizes the risk of loss of privacy. In addition, risk of loss of confidentiality will be minimized by storing completed paper copies of the surveys and signed informed consent forms in locked file cabinets in locked offices accessible only to trained study staff. Each subject will be assigned a unique identifier without identifying information, and data will be entered into an electronic database using only the unique identifier. Only trained study staff will have access to the code that links the unique identifier to the subject's identity. Electronic data will be stored on secure, password-protected firewalled servers at the University of Pennsylvania."

The home-based rehab program tries to motivate a gradual step count increase that should pose little health risk to participants. Participants are given guidance on when to seek medical attention and a reporting protocol is in place to capture any changes in symptoms with physical activity. Another potential risk of this study is a breach of participant confidentiality. We will minimize this risk by linking individual identifying information with participant ID numbers only in one single secure file that will only be accessed by the study team in the case of an adverse medical event, participant dropout, or if otherwise deemed necessary by the Principal Investigator. All other identifying information will be discarded after initial contact with the Study Coordinator. Due to the financial incentives in this study, we will be collecting social security numbers so that we can complete W-9 forms for participants. Social security numbers only will be used to generate W-9 forms and will be deleted once they are no longer needed. We will also collect home addresses to mail incentive payments. This will be done through a University of Pennsylvania approved partnership with Wells Fargo. Accidental disclosure of social security numbers could lead to identity theft. We will use commercial-grade encryption to protect social security information in transit. Names and addresses will be stored in encrypted databases. These data will be viewable only by the respective participants and the study coordinator. All other members of the research team will be able to view only participant ID numbers. There will be no functionality in the web application to export a dataset with identifiable information.
