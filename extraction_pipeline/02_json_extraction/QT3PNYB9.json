  "title": "Wearable Devices for Supporting Chronic Disease Self-Management: Scoping Review",
  "abstract": "Background: People with chronic diseases can benefit from wearable devices in managing their health and encouraging healthy lifestyle habits. Wearables such as activity trackers or blood glucose monitoring devices can lead to positive health impacts, including improved physical activity adherence or better management of type 2 diabetes. Few literature reviews have focused on the intersection of various chronic diseases, the wearable devices used, and the outcomes evaluated in intervention studies, particularly in the context of primary health care. Objective: This study aims to identify and describe (1) the chronic diseases represented in intervention studies, (2) the types or combinations of wearables used, and (3) the health or health care outcomes assessed and measured. \n Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, searching the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases for studies published between 2012 and 2022. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, applied the selection criteria, and performed full-text screening. We included interventions using wearables that automatically collected and transmitted data to adult populations with at least one chronic disease. We excluded studies with participants with only a predisposition to develop a chronic disease, hospitalized patients, patients with acute diseases, patients with active cancer, and cancer survivors. We included randomized controlled trials and cohort, pretest-posttest, observational, mixed methods, and qualitative studies. Results: After the removal of 1987 duplicates, we screened 4540 titles and abstracts. Of the remaining 304 articles after exclusions, we excluded 215 (70.7%) full texts and included 89 (29.3%). Of these 89 texts, 10 (11%) were related to the same interventions as those in the included studies, resulting in 79 studies being included. We structured the results according to chronic disease clusters: (1) diabetes, (2) heart failure, (3) other cardiovascular conditions, (4) hypertension, (5) multimorbidity and other combinations of chronic conditions, (6) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (7) chronic pain, (8) musculoskeletal conditions, and (9) asthma. Diabetes was the most frequent health condition (18/79, 23% of the studies), and wearable activity trackers were the most used (42/79, 53% of the studies). In the 79 included studies, 74 clinical, 73 behavioral, 36 patient technology experience, 28 health care system, and 25 holistic or biopsychosocial outcomes were reported. \n Conclusions: This scoping review provides an overview of the wearable devices used in chronic disease self-management intervention studies, revealing disparities in both the range of chronic diseases studied and the variety of wearable devices used.",

      "text": "Noncommunicable diseases, commonly referred to as chronic diseases, are the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 41 million deaths annually and accounting for 74% of global mortality  [1] . Aging populations, combined with unhealthy lifestyles such as poor diet and sedentary habits, contribute to a significant rise in chronic disease risk factors, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia  [1] . These diseases are characterized by their long-term nature, slow progression, and need for continuous care and self-management  [2] . Most patients with a chronic disease in primary care have at least one additional chronic condition, making multimorbidity (defined as 2 concomitant chronic diseases) a common challenge that requires integrated, patient-centered care approaches to reduce the treatment burden  [3] .\n\nSelf-management is a key element of the care plan, and capturing meaningful information to empower individuals with chronic diseases is essential. Technological advancements have paved the way for wearable electronic devices and sensors that empower individuals to manage their health conditions more independently  [4, 5] . These innovations support the adherence to disease-related recommendations, such as medication regimens and symptom monitoring, by facilitating real-time monitoring and data collection. Wearable devices operate as data collection tools, transmitting information to software applications for analysis and delivering actionable health updates or notifications  [6] . Key features of these devices include  (1)  automatic data collection (eg, blood glucose [BG], blood pressure [BP], physical activity, and heart rate);  (2)  direct transmission of data to the patient and, in some cases, their primary health care providers; and (3) availability of data across multiple platforms (eg, smartwatches, smartphones, and monitors). These systems offer real-time feedback either automatically or via clinician intervention, promoting sustained patient engagement with recommended health behaviors  [4] [5] [6] .\n\nThis potential for patient empowerment using wearables is observed in several reviews that report positive effects on clinical outcomes, such as glycemic control, and behavioral outcomes, such as symptom self-management  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Systematic reviews have explored the efficacy of wearables in managing diabetes, especially in relation to glycemic control  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . BG monitoring devices, a common wearable for diabetes management, exemplify the utility of these technologies in facilitating behavior change and adherence to treatment protocols  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Numerous literature reviews have explored the use of wearable technologies in chronic disease management focusing on specific devices and health outcomes. Existing literature reviews are focused on specific wearable technologies, such as activity trackers  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  or BG monitors  [8, 9, 11] , or on self-management within particular chronic disease populations, including patients with diabetes  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 21] , cardiovascular diseases  [22, 23] , and cancer  [7]  and cancer survivors  [17] , as well as populations at risk of chronic diseases  [19, 24] .\n\nSeveral reviews have emphasized the impact of wearables on specific health outcomes, such as increased physical activity  [16, 17, 19, 20] . While these focused reviews offer valuable insights, they often do not capture the broader implications of wearable technology across multiple chronic conditions and diverse health outcomes. Despite the growing body of research, few comprehensive reviews have examined the intersection of various chronic diseases, wearable devices, and the range of health outcomes assessed in intervention studies. A systematic review identified a gap in understanding how wearables influence health outcomes in chronic diseases despite their potential for enhancing self-management  [25] . To address this gap, Mattison et al  [25]  conducted a comprehensive review across multiple chronic diseases and outcome measures, highlighting the importance of such an analysis particularly in the context of primary health care.\n\nBuilding on this work, our review adopted broad objectives aiming to provide an overview of the role of wearables in chronic disease management considering the clinical realities of the variety of devices used and the high prevalence of multimorbidity. A comprehensive analysis of wearable devices across various chronic diseases and health outcomes is essential for future research and patient-centered interventions in primary care settings that will reduce the treatment burden."

The 97 references [34-130] of the 79 included studies [52-130] can be found in Multimedia Appendix 2. Most studies (45/79, 57%) were conducted in North America (39/45, 87% in the United States and 6/45, 13% in Canada), followed by 9% (7/79) conducted only in the United Kingdom, 5% (4/79) only in the Republic of Korea, 5% (4/79) only in China (one of them was conducted in Hong Kong), 4% (3/79) only in the Netherlands (3/79, and 4% (3/79) only in Spain. 5% (4/79) of the studies were conducted in 2 or more countries, and 11% (9/79) were conducted in other single countries.\n\nWe used the MMAT  [33]  to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. No studies were excluded based on MMAT scores accordingly with the aim of our scoping review to identify and describe existing knowledge  [26] . The MMAT scores of the 79 studies  can be consulted in Multimedia Appendix 3 [34-130]. A total of 58% (46/79) of the studies used an RCT design. Most RCTs (20/46, 43%) obtained a score of 4 stars, 26% (12/46) obtained a score of 3 stars, 24% (11/46) obtained a score of 2 stars, and 7% (3/46) obtained a score of 1 star. Per the study context, an RCT could not have 5 stars due to unfeasible patient blinding. In Table 1, we structure our results according to 9 chronic disease clusters: diabetes (18/79, 23% of the studies), heart failure (13/79, 16% of the studies), other cardiovascular conditions (10/79, 13% of the studies), hypertension (8/79, 10% of the studies), multimorbidity and other combinations of chronic conditions (8/79, 10% of the studies), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 8/79, 10% of the studies), chronic pain (6/79, 8% of the studies), musculoskeletal conditions (6/79, 8% of the studies), and asthma (2/79, 3% of the studies). We also structured our results according to the technologies used. The most frequent were wearable activity trackers (WATs; eg, a smartwatch or a device worn at the chest, waist built-in accelerometers, or connected pedometers). We found WATs in 53% (42/79) of the studies, BP monitors in 35% (28/79) of the studies, weighing scales in 25% (20/79) of the studies, BG monitors in 20% (16/79) of the studies, and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors/devices in 10% (8/79) of the included studies. A total of 61% (48/79) of the intervention studies used a single wearable (or smart health) device, whereas 39% (31/79) of the studies used \u22652 devices. In Table 2, we structure our results based on the types or combinations of wearables used. Table 2 provides an overview of the outcomes measured for each wearable or combination of wearables along with the reported effects. There are 2 points that require clarification.

[56,62,63,83,92, 93,95,97-101,103-105,112,122,129]. The other clinical outcomes most reported were weight or BMI changes in 13% (10/79) of studies. The most frequently reported behavioral outcomes were PA or lifestyle changes, including the number of steps and self-reported walking, in 27% (21/79) of studies [52,53,57,58,61,63-66,69,70,72,75, 76,78-81,90,95,117]. Other behavioral outcomes, such as self-efficacy (9/79, 11%) [53,57,75,81,92,93,107,117,123], and self-care management (6/79, 8%) [88,107,112,113,116,118], also appeared in a substantial number of studies. Adherence to treatment or recommendations (12/79, 15%) [61,65,78,94,95,97,99,101,106, 111,116,121] and engagement (6/79, 8%) [55,78,89, 108,113,115] are also frequently reported. Other commonly reported outcomes include satisfaction with technology (12/79, 15%) [55,64,66,68,75,78,81,84,96,100,102,118], and technology usability (6/79, 8%) [60,78,96,106,108,111]. QoL or health-related QoL are assessed in 19% (15/79) of studies [53,65,72,79,81,85,94,102,107,114-117,120,127], reflecting a broad focus on clinical, behavioral, technological experience, holistic, and biopsychosocial aspects. In terms of positive results, BP control-related outcomes were reported as statistically significant in 8% (6/79) of studies [56,62,63, 93,97,98], and PA or lifestyle behavior changes in 10% (8/79) of studies [52,66,70,72,75,76,81,120]. Other behavioral outcomes, such as self-efficacy and self-care management enhancement, were reported as statistically significant in 5% (4/79) [112,116,117,123] of studies. Positive changes in weight or BMI were reported as statistically significant in 4% (3/79,) of studies [62,65,79] but demonstrated neutral or non-significant results in 9% (7/79) of studies [83,86,88,103,105,117,129]. Other outcomes, such as QoL or health-related QoL (8/79, 10%) [65,72,102,107,113,114, 117,120], technology usability (5/79, 6%) [60,96,106,108,111], and adherence to devices (4/79, 5%)  [65, 95, 101, 111] , also demonstrated non-significant or neutral findings in those studies.\n\nAs shown in Table  3 , we then counted the number of outcomes measured for each chronic disease cluster according to our 5 outcome categories.

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "This scoping review aimed to achieve 3 main objectives related to health intervention studies involving wearable devices. The primary strength of this review lies in our broad portrayal of interventions across multiple chronic diseases, various wearable devices, and distinct categories of health and health care outcomes, along with their reported effects (positive, neutral, or negative). We selected these broad objectives because, as other reviews have highlighted  [24, 25] , providing a comprehensive overview of this topic is relevant for informing and shaping future research directions.\n\nFirst, we identified and described clusters of chronic diseases that have been studied. We observed significant disparities-diabetes and heart failure have been extensively researched, whereas musculoskeletal conditions and asthma have been studied much less frequently despite showing promising results. We intentionally excluded studies that solely involved BG monitoring devices measuring BG levels as the only outcome given the existing evidence  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Nevertheless, diabetes emerged as the most represented chronic disease, appearing in 23% (18/79) of the studies, whereas only 3% (2/79) of the studies included participants with asthma.\n\nSecond, we identified and described the technologies used. WATs were commonly used either alone or in conjunction with other devices tailored to specific chronic conditions, such as BG monitors, BP devices, ECG devices, and connected weighing scales. There was notable variation in technology use-while WATs were widely used, other devices such as oxygen saturation monitors, photoplethysmography sensors, inhaler adapters, indoor air quality monitors, portable spirometers, small devices attached to inhalers, ingestible sensors, and wearable patches with accelerometers were less common.\n\nThird, we identified and described the outcomes measured in 5 distinct categories. Clinical and behavioral outcomes were the most frequently assessed, whereas patient technology experience, health care system (such as use or efficiency), and holistic or biopsychosocial (such as QoL) outcomes were reported less frequently."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This scoping review has several limitations. We did not integrate the individual interventions into our analysis. Although we report the measured outcomes, these results must be interpreted with caution as effect sizes were not considered. However, informed readers can consult the appended files that contain all the relevant information, including study design, sample size, intervention and participant characteristics, outcomes measured, and effects. We only conducted searches in the MEDLINE (Ovid) and Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, and Emerging Sources Citation Index) databases, which may have led to missing sources. Confounding factors such as multicomponent behavioral strategy interventions were also not considered. Nevertheless, these confounding factors were similarly not addressed in a previous systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of WATs due to the heterogeneity of study designs and interventions  [18] . In total, 3 reviewers extracted and assessed the quality of all the studies only once, although this was mitigated by data validation from an experienced researcher."

      "title": "Comparison With Other Reviews",
      "text": "Our findings revealed significant disparities in the chronic diseases studied. Type 2 diabetes and heart failure were extensively researched, whereas conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders, chronic pain, and asthma were less represented. This both complements and contrasts with the findings of another review, which noted type 2 diabetes, Parkinson disease, and chronic lower back pain as among the most studied conditions  [25] . Many other reviews have focused on diabetes  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 21]  and cardiovascular diseases  [22, 23] . One reason for this emphasis on cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes may be the inherent capabilities of wearables to monitor and manage these conditions  [4] , along with their availability and affordability. For instance, regarding asthma, we found promising effects on health outcomes but identified only a limited number of studies  [127, 128] .\n\nIn terms of the technologies used, we observed that the most common devices used were WATs. This aligns with the number of reviews focusing on the effects of WATs for different diseases  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , often in combination with disease-specific devices. This observation is also consistent with those of other reviews as wearable technologies have emerged as promising tools for managing chronic diseases, offering continuous monitoring of vital signs, physical activity, and disease-specific markers  [132, 133] . Similarly to our findings, these devices have shown potential across various conditions, including BP and ECG monitors for cardiovascular diseases  [22, 23]  and BG monitoring devices for diabetes  [8, 9, 11] , by enabling early detection of complications and promoting patient engagement  [25, [132] [133] [134] .\n\nRegarding outcomes, we identified 5 distinct categories in our review, with clinical and behavioral outcomes being the most frequently reported. This aligns with the growing body of research highlighting the role of wearables in monitoring physiological parameters and behaviors  [134] . Similarly to our findings, other reviews have reported clinical outcomes such as glycemic control  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  as well as behavioral outcomes, including physical activity levels  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , medication adherence, and self-management  [5, 18] ."

    {
      "title": "Future Directions",
      "text": "Despite the promising health outcomes reported, other reviews have highlighted that the quality of evidence varies considerably, with many studies limited by small sample sizes or short durations  [25] . Researchers emphasize the need for more long-term studies and systematic reviews that incorporate RCTs with larger sample sizes to measure the effectiveness of wearables across a wider variety of chronic diseases  [18, 24, 25] . There is a need for rigorous, long-term studies to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-efficiency of wearables in chronic disease self-management  [25, 132] .\n\nOur findings indicate that patient technology experience, holistic and biopsychosocial, and health care system outcomes have been covered less and could benefit from more robust studies. As the integration of wearable technology into health research and clinical practice continues to expand, establishing comprehensive guidelines to ensure effective use across diverse chronic conditions and applications will be important, ranging from chronic disease management to real-time health monitoring for specific or underrepresented populations  [134] .\n\nIn line with our findings, which show that health care system outcomes are reported less frequently than clinical and behavioral outcomes and often have inconclusive effects, a significant challenge will be integrating wearable data into existing health care systems and clinical workflows  [135] ."

      "text": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of wearable devices used in chronic disease self-management intervention studies, revealing disparities in both the range of chronic diseases studied and the variety of wearable devices used. We described the clinical and behavioral benefits of wearable devices, particularly for activity trackers, BG and BP monitors, and ECG wearable devices. These findings lay a foundation for future research, offering researchers valuable insights to further explore health care system outcomes, validate the impact of concomitant device use, and expand their use to other chronic diseases."
