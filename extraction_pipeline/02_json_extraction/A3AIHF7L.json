  "abstract": "Purpose. To determine if two widely used behavioral change measures-Stages of Change (SoC) and Patient Activation Measure (PAM)-correlate with each other, are affected by financial incentives, or predict positive outcomes in the context of incentive-based health interventions. Design. Secondary analysis of two randomized controlled trials of incentives for weight loss and for improved diabetes self-monitoring. Setting. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey. Subjects. A total of 132 obese and 75 diabetic adults enrolled in one of two trials. Measures. SoC and PAM scores; weight loss and usage rate of diabetes self-monitoring equipment. Analysis. Multiple regression; Kruskal-Wallis test. Results. We found no association between baseline SoC and PAM scores in either study (p \u00bc .30 and p \u00bc .89). Regression models showed no association between baseline PAM score and SoC and subsequent outcomes for either study (weight loss study: PAM: p \u00bc .14, SoC: p \u00bc .1; diabetes study: PAM: p \u00bc .45, SoC: p \u00bc .61). Change in PAM score and SoC among participants in the intervention groups did not differ by study arm or among participants with better outcomes. Conclusion. PAM score and SoC may not effectively predict success or monitor progress among individuals enrolled in incentive-based interventions. (Am",

To test the impact of baseline scores on outcomes, we regressed the primary outcome variable for each study upon both baseline PAM score and a binary variable equal to one if the participant was in the Maintenance SoC at baseline. SoC was made binary because the three earlier stages (precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation) contained very small numbers of individuals.\n\nThe change in SoC score was the number of stages the participant moved along the scale. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare changes in SoC scores by study arm. We also classified participants by which quartile of weight loss and device usage they were in at the conclusion of each intervention and used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare changes in scores between individuals in different quartiles. All analyses were performed with STATA/MP 12.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas)."

We also found no significant associations between the outcome variable for each study and either baseline PAM score or an indicator variable for being in the Maintenance SoC. These findings were unchanged when additional controls were included in regression models.\n\nResults were similarly negative when we examined the change in PAM and SoC scores over time. For both studies, the mean change in PAM and SoC scores by study arm was not significantly different (weight loss: PAM: p \u00bc .38, SoC: p \u00bc .43; biometrics: PAM: p \u00bc .44, SoC: p \u00bc .59).

      "text": "PAM and SoC scores were not associated with each other in either study, possibly because while the PAM asks general questions about self-management of health issues, the SoC question addresses a single behavior. Some researchers have suggested that the single-item SoC measure is prone to overly optimistic responses and to misclassifying stage for goals that require many different behavioral changes to achieve success.  4 aseline PAM and SoC distributions suggest that our study populations were highly motivated relative to the general population and participants in other interventions.  5, 6 It is possible that individuals interested in participating in incentive-based studies are more activated and have already taken action to modify their behaviors at baseline.\n\nBaseline scores for both the PAM and SoC did not predict subsequent changes in either weight or device usage. There were no significant differences in how these scores changed between the intervention and control groups for either study, even though\n\nTable Weight Loss and Biometrics Studies: Mean Baseline PAM Score by Baseline Stage of Change Baseline Stage of Change Baseline PAM Score Weight Loss Study Biometrics Study Mean (SD) N Mean (SD) N Precontemplation 86.3 ( -) 1 0 Contemplation 65.5 (13.6) 9 73.3 (20.7) 6 Preparation 78.3 (14.6) 16 79.9 (17.5) 7 Action 72.8 (17.6) 38 76.3 (17.3) 22 Maintenance 72.8 (23.3) 68 74.5 (15.5) 39 Total 73.1 (20.2) 132 75.5 (16.4) 74 Kruskal-Wallis test v 2 \u00bc 4.85, p \u00bc 0.30 v 2 \u00bc 0.64, p \u00bc 0.89 PAM indicates Patient Activation Measure. 134 American Journal of Health Promotion November/December 2015, Vol. 30, No. 2 For individual use only.
