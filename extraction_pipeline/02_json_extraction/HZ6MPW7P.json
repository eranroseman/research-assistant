  "abstract": "Objective-While multiple social and behavioral risk factors associated with obesity co-occur among young children, most studies have examined them separately. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between social risk factors, behavioral problems, health behaviors and obesity among preschool children in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N=1589). Methods-A cumulative social risk score was created by summing maternal reports of intimate partner violence, food insecurity, housing insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal substance use, and father's incarceration, obtained when the child was 3 years old. Mothers reported on the child's internalizing and externalizing behaviors with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at age 5. Mothers also reported on hours the child spent watching TV and sleeping as well as servings of soda or juice drinks the child consumed per day. Child height and weight were measured at age 5. Obesity was defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) >=95 th percentile. Results-In regression analyses adjusted for health behaviors, behavioral problems and sociodemographic factors, cumulative social risk was associated with obesity among girls. Externalizing behavioral problems, were associated with obesity among girls (PR 1.5 95%CI 1.2, 1.7) and boys (PR 1.3 95%CI 1.1, 1.6). Short sleep duration was also associated with obesity among girls (PR 1.2 95% CI 1.0, 1.4) and boys (PR 1.3 95%CI 1.1, 1.5) even after adjusting for behavioral problems and social risk factors. Watching more than 2 hours of television per day was associated with obesity among boys (PR 1.5, 95%CI 1.2, 1.9) but not girls. Conclusions-Co-occurring social and behavioral risk factors are associated with obesity among five-year old children. Childhood obesity is a major public health problem in the United States (US) that disproportionately affects African American and Hispanic children as well as children of low socioeconomic status (SES) (1, 2). These racial/ethnic groups tend to live in environments characterized by high social stress (family and neighborhood), which recent evidence has linked to increased risk of obesity (3-5). For example, children living in a",

      "text": "home where there are reports of maternal intimate partner violence (IPV)  (3) , child maltreatment and neglect, maternal depression and maternal drug use have a higher likelihood of becoming obese. Furthermore, as the number of social stressors experienced increases, so does the magnitude of obesity risk  (6) . Social stressors are frequently associated with other dysfunctional behaviors,  (7)  and most likely these respective risks are positively reinforcing each other. Prior studies have focused on the influence of one specific type of risk factor at a time, such as social  (3, 8, 9)  or behavioral risks  (10, 11) ; with few studies exploring how multiple risks factors are simultaneously implicated in obesity  (12) . Identifying specific types of risks more likely to influence obesity early in life can directly inform interventions that could specifically target such risks. This study extends previous research by investigating profiles of social and behavioral risk associated with obesity among preschoolers.\n\nAmong younger children, those who experience social stressors are also more likely to experience behavioral problems  (13) . Longitudinal studies have documented a relationship between child behavior and obesity  (14) (15) (16) (17) . Anderson and colleagues noted a modest association between externalizing behaviors among 24-month old children and higher Body Mass Index (BMI) at 24 months and through age 12  (14) . A relationship between depressive symptoms and obesity has been documented among male and female adolescents and adults,  (18)  however among younger children the relationship has been noted only among girls  (15, 19) .\n\nLess is known about the relationship between social stressors and obesogenic health behaviors, particularly among young children. While using food as a way to cope with stressful situations has been shown among adult populations,  (20)  in very young children, health behaviors may reflect their parent behaviors and/or the home environment  (21) . Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between sedentary lifestyle and stressful home environments. In a stressful home environment certain sedentary behaviors, such as television viewing, may be used as a tool to manage the child's time and keep him or her occupied. It may also be harder for a parent to maintain health-promoting routines in the household, such as regular bedtime and restricted television viewing, both factors associated with obesity.\n\nPrevious work showed that the association between cumulative social risk and childhood obesity among preschool children (4-6 years of age) was only apparent among girls enrolled in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study  (6) . However, little is known about the relationship between social risk factors and specific health behaviors among children, which may elucidate potential mechanisms explaining this relationship. Furthermore, in very young children the relationship between behavioral problems, health behaviors and obesity has not been examined. In this study, the relationship between social risk factors and obesogenic behavioral factors is examined, as well as the relationship between social factors, behavioral problems, health behaviors and obesity among five-year old boys and girls."

Non-marital births were over-sampled relative to marital births in a ratio of 3 to 1. The study is a joint effort by Princeton University's Center for Research on Child Wellbeing (CRCW) and Center for Health and Wellbeing, Columbia University's Social Indicators Survey Center, and The National Center for Children and Families (NCCF) ( http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu ). Details on the study design can be found in Reichman and colleagues 2001  (22) . In brief, 4898 women were recruited from 75 hospitals during the birth of the child between 1998-2000 in 20 US cities with populations over 200,000. Random samples of both married and unmarried births were selected until preset quotas were reached. Upon completion of screening and determination of eligibility, consent was obtained. Mothers completed a baseline interview at delivery and participated in follow-up interviews when the children were approximately 12, 36 and 60 months of age. All children who remained in follow-up were asked to participate in an inhome assessment at the 60-month follow-up; 2489 completed the assessment. The 1589 children used in final analyses had complete information on the social risk factors of interest and height and weight information at the 60-month follow-up. Those who did not participate in the 60-month in-home assessment differed significantly by race/ethnicity from those who participated (Blacks, 46% non-participants vs. 50% participants p < .0001; Hispanics 28% non-participants vs. 24% participants p < .0001)."

The CIDI-SF was scored according to the developer's guidelines ( http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/documentation/core/scales/  ff_3yr_scales.pdf accessed June 03, 2010), which generates probable diagnosis of psychiatric disorders consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; APA, 1994). To ascertain probable depression, mothers were initially asked if they experienced dysphoria (depression) or anhedonia (lack of enjoyment of what is often experienced as pleasurable) in the past year for a specific duration (two weeks or more, and if so, whether such symptoms lasted most of the day and occurred every day). If presence and persistence of symptoms were positive, mothers were asked about seven other symptoms, such as losing interest in typically enjoyable activities, trouble sleeping and thinking about death. A probable depression score resulted from adding up the answers to these seven symptoms plus the first dysphoric symptom, if present, ranging therefore from 0 to 8. A score of three or more is considered as a probable case. Also, if a mother reported taking antidepressants, she was considered as a probable case.\n\nMaternal Substance Use-Mothers were asked whether in the past month they drank more than 5 alcoholic beverages in one day, had smoked pot or marijuana or if they had used cocaine, crack, LSD, speed, heroin or other hard drugs. In addition, mothers were asked whether alcohol/drugs had interfered with their daily life, personal relations or whether they had sought help or treatment for a drug or alcohol problem since the child's birth. Mothers affirming any of these questions were classified as using drugs/alcohol."

These questions were derived from the Survey on Income and Program Participation  (27)  and the New York City Social Indicators Survey  (28) . Mothers affirming one or more of the above questions were categorized as experiencing housing insecurity.\n\nFood Insecurity-Mothers were asked whether in the past 12 months they were ever hungry but could not afford to buy more food or whether their children were hungry but they could not afford to buy more food  (27) .

A score of 1 was assigned for each item endorsed for each of the 6 measures for each year. The cumulative score was created by summing over the dichotomous variables for both assessments and ranged from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating a higher level of cumulative social risk, resulting in the total cumulative social risk score (Mean 1.3 SD 1.5)."

As done in previous studies, behavioral problems were characterized as a T score greater than 65 considered a clinical score. These analyses focus on the CBCL externalizing and internalizing scales.

In the sample of 1589 children, 51% are boys, 51% African-American and 27% Hispanic (Table  1 ). Seventeen percent of children were obese at age 5. Seventeen percent and 4% of children had externalizing and internalizing scores at or above the clinical range. A greater number of girls were reported as sleeping 9 hours or less compared to boys. Boys were more likely to have internalizing behavioral problems than girls. No other gender differences were noted in the distribution of social risk factors, obesity, health behaviors or study covariates.\n\nIn bivariate analyses of the associations between social risk factors and obesity, experiencing more than one social risk factor was associated with obesity among girls but not boys (40.4% vs 31.8%, girls, p < 0.05) (Table  2 ). Externalizing behavioral problems were associated with obesity among girls (26.2% vs 15.6%, p < 0.05). Watching more than 2 hours of television per day was associated with obesity among boys (72.9% vs 61.1%, p < 0.05) (Table  2 ). No associations between health behaviors and obesity were noted among girls.\n\nFigures  1  and  2  show the prevalence of behavioral problems and health behaviors by cumulative social risk group.

Furthermore, experiencing two or more social risk factors compared to none, was significantly associated with lack of sleep (51% vs. 39%), television watching for more than 2 hours a day (72% vs. 55%), and high soda and juice consumption (67% vs. 54%) among boys (all p < 0.05) (Figure  1 ). Among girls, cumulative social risk was associated with soda and juice consumption (69% vs. 59%, p< 0.05) (Figure  2 ).\n\nIn fully adjusted models, cumulative social risk remained associated with obesity among girls, but not boys (Table  3 ). Externalizing behavioral problems (girls PR 1.5 95%CI 1.2, 1.7 and boys PR 1.3 95%CI 1.1, 1.6) and lack of sleep (girls PR 1.2 95%CI 1.0, 1.4 and boys PR 1.3 95%CI 1.1, 1.5) were associated with obesity among both boys and girls.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This study examined the relationship between multiple social risk factors, behaviors and childhood obesity in a longitudinal study of urban five-year-old children. In adjusted analyses, externalizing behaviors, short sleep duration and TV watching were all associated with obesity among boys. Among girls, cumulative social risk factors, externalizing problems and short sleep duration were associated with obesity even after accounting for a number of socio-demographic factors. Cumulative risk factors were associated with externalizing behaviors and soda/juice consumption among boys and girls and with sleep duration and TV watching among boys.\n\nThe relationship between social risk factor and health behaviors is consistent with other studies, which have noted associations between stressful environments and sleep habits  (35)  and internalizing and externalizing behaviors  (36)  among children. Associations were also noted between soda/juice consumption, TV watching and social risk factors. In a stressful environment parents may not be emotionally available to care for the needs of the child and thus be more inclined to use a TV to occupy the child or give in to a child's request for soda/ juice. However with the exception of soda/juice consumption, these associations were only evident among boys. It is plausible that observed gender differences are associated with socially acceptable strategies to manage stress-related behavioural problems in children that are linked to the child's sex.\n\nAssociations between behavioral problems and obesity were also noted. Similar associations have been previously documented between externalizing behaviors and obesity as was noted in this study among five-year-old boys and girls  (14) . Anderson and colleagues recently documented a relationship between externalizing behaviors and BMI among children. Externalizing behaviors are indicative of more impulsivity, poor inhibitory control and lack of self-regulation. In a recent study, Graziano and colleagues demonstrated that low self regulation among toddlers, as well as low inhibitory control skills/higher reward sensitivity, is associated with obesity at age 5  (37) . Children with higher reward sensitivity may engage in impulsive eating and may request foods that are sweet and high in fat which are reportedly tastier than healthier/bland foods. In a Dutch study of 6-13 year old children, impulsivity and reward responsiveness were associated with childhood BMI, indirectly through overeating  (38) . We furthermore note that externalizing behaviors but not internalizing behaviors were associated with obesity. This is contrary to other studies, which have noted associations between internalizing behaviors (depression) and obesity particularly among girls. Possible differences could be attributed to the age of the sample and the low prevalence of internalizing problems in this sample. While most internalizing behaviors have been associated with obesity among adolescents this sample is considerably younger. Only one study, to our knowledge, has documented a relationship between internalizing behaviors among children entering kindergarten and obesity (39) noting a significant cross-sectional association between parent rated and teacher rated internalizing behaviors and obesity among girls  (39) .\n\nAmong girls, the relationship between social risk factors and obesity appears to be independent of health behaviors and behavioral problems. Suggesting other factors associated with social stress are responsible for the associations noted. Alternatively, it is plausible that the measures used are too imprecise. For example while the CBCL is a well validated measure to assess child behavioral problems it was not designed to specifically measure impulsivity or reward sensitivity specific behaviors that have been associated with obesity among children.\n\nFurthermore, the health behavior measures used are limited in that diet and overall physical activity was not specifically assessed, and furthermore these factors were only assessed at the five-year follow-up which may be attributing to the lack of association. It is also plausible other factors, not assessed, such as emotional eating or emotional regulation are responsible for these associations. While a test for mediation was not conducted in these analyses due to the timing of data collection for these behaviors and obesity, the cooccurrence of health behaviors, behavioral problems and obesity was examined in this cohort of pre-school children. Despite these limitations the current study has a number of strengths. The analyses are based on a national sample of mainly children of low socioeconomic status, with objectively measured height and weight. Furthermore, the study jointly explores the association between social risk factors, obesity and behavior, which had not been done previously.\n\nIn these analyses associations were noted between the cumulative exposure to social risk factors, behavioral problems, health behaviors and obesity among five-year-old children. Disentangling the mechanisms linking social risk factors in early life, child behavior, and obesity among young children can better inform intervention and prevention efforts to curb childhood obesity. If social risk factors and behavioral problems are the upstream contributors of obesogenic health behaviors (i.e., excess TV watching, lack of sleep), more effective prevention and intervention efforts can be developed to target these health behaviors and thus prevent childhood obesity and its consequences. If replicated, these findings lend support to efforts to further explicate profiles of social risk, behavioral problems, and health behaviors that are associated with obesity risk among preschool children."
