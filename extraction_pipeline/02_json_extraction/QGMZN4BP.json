  "abstract": "Introduction: Absence of structured guidelines to navigate the complexities of implementing AI-based applications in healthcare is recognized by clinicians, healthcare leaders, and policy makers. AI implementation presents challenges beyond the technology development which necessitates standardized approaches to implementation. This study aims to explore the activities typical to implementation of AI-based systems to develop an AI implementation process framework intended to guide healthcare professionals. The Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) was considered as an initial reference framework. Methods: This study employed a qualitative research design and included three components: (1) a review of 30 scientific articles describing differences empirical cases of real-world AI implementation in healthcare, (2) analysis of qualitative interviews with healthcare representatives possessing first-hand experience in planning, running, and sustaining AI implementation projects, (3) analysis of qualitative interviews with members of the research group\u00b4s network and purposively sampled for their AI literacy and academic, technical or managerial leadership roles. Results: The data were deductively mapped onto the steps of QIF using direct qualitative content analysis. All the phases and steps in QIF are relevant to AI implementation in healthcare, but there are specificities in the context of AI that require incorporation of additional activities and phases. To effectively support the AI implementations, the process frameworks should include a dedicated phase to implementation with specific activities that occur after planning, ensuring a smooth transition from AI's design to deployment, and a phase focused on governance and sustainability, aimed at maintaining the AI's long-term impact. The component of continuous engagement of diverse stakeholders should be incorporated throughout the lifecycle of the AI implementation. \n Conclusion: The value of this study is the identified processual phases and activities specific and typical to AI implementations to be carried out by an adopting healthcare organization when AI systems are deployed. The study advances previous research by outlining the types of necessary comprehensive assessments and legal preparations located in the",

      "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly being developed and tested in healthcare settings, enabled by enhanced analytical capabilities and advancements in computational technologies. These advancements allow for the processing of complex datasets and support from sophisticated AI-based applications for improvements in healthcare processes and health outcomes  (1, 2) .\n\nHowever, previous research has highlighted the complexity of implementing AI in healthcare  (3) . The deployment of AI in healthcare is inherently more complex compared to sectors like manufacturing, retail, and finance, where standardized processes, lower regulatory constraints, and reduced risks to human life enable more straightforward implementation  (4) . Additionally, industries outside healthcare benefit from relatively easier access to large, high-quality datasets for training AI models, further facilitating adoption.\n\nHealthcare, on the other hand, involves intricate interactions between human providers, patients, and technology, where the risks are exceptionally high, and any compromise in patient safety or quality of care must be rigorously avoided. The integration of AI introduces additional challenges and uncertainties related to clinicians' liability in using the AI model outcomes in decisionmaking or neglecting them, autonomy of the patient and clinician, explainability, ethics, and the need for oversight and quality control  (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Compared to other sectors, healthcare faces structural barriers to technological adoption, encompassing technological, individual, social, and organizational domains  (6, (10) (11) (12) . For AI specifically, these barriers encompass challenges related to data, methodologies, technology, regulations and policies, human factors, environmental conditions, and organizational structures  (6) (7) (8) (9) . For example, data quality is often compromised for the sake of faster workflows creating challenges in obtaining high-quality data for AI model training. Consequently, clinicians and patients may lack trust in the AI models for decision-making, a situation further burdened by unclear boundaries of liability. Also, organizational structures and different data storage practices lead to difficulties in combining the data.\n\nClinicians have recognized a lack of structured guidelines to navigate these complexities, ensuring that AI-based applications are implemented in a more predictable manner that enhances, rather than hinders, clinical workflows and patient outcomes  (13, 14) . Healthcare leaders emphasize the importance of considering implementation early in the development process, moving beyond the technology development and recognizing the significant challenges associated with practical implementation  (8) . Policymakers are also understanding the need for comprehensive guidelines to ensure that AI implementations comply with stringent regulatory  (15)  and ethical standards  (16) .\n\nHowever, research indicates that the implementation of AIbased applications in healthcare has often lacked standardized and structured methodologies  (2, 17) . Despite growing attention to the challenges associated with implementation, there remains a significant need for empirical, experience-based research to identify strategies, processes, and methods that can effectively address these barriers  (18, 19) . Such research has the potential to inform the development of guidelines to support the integration of AI in healthcare.\n\nSeveral frameworks have emerged for research and development purposes specifically addressing AI, such as the research-based evaluation framework for AI-based decision-support systems  (20) , the reporting guidelines for clinical trial reports for interventions involving AI  (21) , the provisional AI implementation framework  (19) , International consensus guideline for trustworthy and deployable AI in healthcare  (22) , the adoption of AI in the Healthcare Industry Model  (23) , and the organizational governance framework for AI adoption  (24) . Several studies have addressed elements crucial to implementation such as managerial, cultural, individual, and technological challenges, with some insights into the implementation process  (2, 9, 17) . However, studies have not been sufficiently detailed to provide sufficient processual support that could guide AI implementations to facilitate their integration and use in practice.\n\nFor a more standardized approach to AI implementation, implementation science emphasizes the importance of comprehensive planning from the outset  (25) . Such planning involves creating conditions that are favorable for implementation and for carrying out the process in a structured, well-planned, and orderly manner. Process frameworks are used in implementation science to provide guidance for implementation by outlining key considerations and activities that need to be undertaken before, during and after the implementation process  (26) .\n\nThe Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) (  27 ) is a widely recognized process framework within implementation science, known for its adaptability and applicability across diverse contexts, including healthcare  (28) (29) (30) (31) . Aiming at increasing quality of implementations, QIF's creators Meyers et al. Have built the QIF on 25 theories, models, and frameworks across multiple research and practice areas. The resulting QIF framework contained 14 activities clustered into a 4-phase temporal sequence  (27) . Its structured and comprehensive approach offers detailed guidance on key activities and considerations necessary for successful implementation, making it a promising candidate for structuring the implementation of AI-based applications in healthcare. Unlike many other implementation process frameworks, which often provide more generalized guidance on translating research into action, the QIF stands out for its practical specificity and focus on actionable steps  (28) . The structure of the QIF includes four phases with detailed activities in each. The first phase recommends considering the host setting and examining how the innovation and the context fit each other. The second phase is focused on structuring the implementation process and assigning personnel. The third phase guides towards a necessity of support and feedback mechanisms for the implementation process. The final fourth phase is dedicated to learning and reflection to create capabilities leading to improved future implementations in the organization.\n\nThis study constitutes an integral part of a broader project (18) aimed to develop, test and evaluate a framework to guide the implementation of AI-based applications in healthcare. This paper focuses on the framework development part  (32) , with the specific aim to explore the activities typical to implementation of AI-based systems for developing an AI implementation process framework intended to guide healthcare professionals, leaders, and decision makers who plan, lead, or are involved in the implementation processes. To achieve this aim, the QIF was considered as an initial reference framework."

      "text": "This study employed a qualitative research design  (33) , utilizing two complementary methods for data collection and analysis: a review of scientific articles and analysis of qualitative interviews (Figure  1 ). The literature review on multiple examples of real-world AI implementations in healthcare practice provided a broad overview of process steps and lessons that comprised AI implementation within different types of AI systems, clinical areas and geographies as well as the lifecycle of AI systemsfrom development to deployment and adoption. The qualitative interviews had a two-fold goal: first, to collect direct individual reflections on experiences in the AI implementation process, and second, to reflect on what structure and content of the QIF may contribute to inform a future process framework specifically adapted for the implementation of AI in healthcare. The integration of these methods and diverse data sources enabled data triangulation, which increased the quality and credibility of research findings  (34)  and provided a more rounded understanding of how AI implementations are and should be conducted in practice. The knowledge generated from this study will inform future methodological developments to support AI implementations. The interviews performed in this study did not include sensitive personal information of the participants, and therefore, according to the Swedish legislation on research ethics, an ethical approval was not required."

A set of references to the empirical studies was extracted from these reviews resulting in 38 articles published between 2011 and 2023, covering various countries of origin [the articles' search strategy is described in  (9) ]. Earlier articles were excluded from the scope of the present study due to the rapid pace of technological advancement and the aim to focus on contemporary AI solutions. The selected articles were reviewed by title, abstract, and full text when needed to identify ones that contained implementation process data and resulted in 30 articles included. The remaining 8 articles had no focus on the implementation process and were excluded from this review.\n\nMost of the articles included represented AI systems developed, tested, and gone through real-world implementations within healthcare organizations discussing process steps and challenges during the different stages of AI system's lifecycle, from development to adoption. Of the total of 30 articles, 14 articles (47%) examined AI applications in treatment, 13 articles (43%) explored AI applications in diagnosis, and 3 articles (10%) investigated AI applications in prevention (Supplementary Material S1). For simplicity, the categorization of the articles was made mutually exclusive, with each article classified under the most predominant aspect as determined by the author's understanding. However, some articles may overlap and fit into multiple categories. The data extracted from these included articles were process steps, activities, involved stakeholders, and lessons learned."

The participants were explained the study purpose and the procedure, and that the project does not handle any sensitive personal data. They were also informed about the possibility to access their anonymized data and provide corrections, if needed. Then, the participants provided verbal consent to participate and to express personal experiences and perceptions. The interview questions related to how can a detailed guide support real-world implementations of AI in healthcare, and their impressions of the QIF in connection with the implementation of AI, its potential benefits and disadvantages, and the level of detail (the interview guide is provided in Supplementary Appendix S2). Participants were members of the research group\u00b4s network and purposively sampled for their AI literacy and academic, technical or managerial leadership roles. The data was collected via video communications (averaging 30 min, with a range of 10-50 min) and e-mail conversations, that were sometimes repeated to ask for more detail or to clarify written feedback."

To achieve a rounded view of the process and variability between clinical areas and the types of AI, these participants represented positions within different cases carried out in large healthcare organizations from different geographical regions in Sweden (Table  2 ). Two of the projects were AI-based decisionsupport systems in different clinical areas, one project was an AIbased patient monitoring system, and one project was an AIbased system facilitating clinical administration. These cases were selected using convenience sampling  (36)  due to a scarcity of available cases where AI systems have been integrated into routine practice in healthcare. The interviews were conducted in May-September 2024 with 11 professionals in 9 interviews (Table  2 ). The participants were explained the study purpose and the procedure, and that the project does not handle any sensitive personal data. They were also informed about the possibility to access their anonymized data and provide corrections, if needed. Then, the participants provided verbal consent to participate and to express personal experiences and perceptions. The interview used open-ended questions with a focus to discern implementation process activities, their sequence, involved stakeholders, and lessons learned. The interviewees were asked questions like \"Why and how did the implementation process start, who initiated the project, what was the trigger?\", followed by \"How was this activity performed, who were involved?\", then directing the conversation to \"What activities happened next?\" until the sequence of activities was identified. Each interview lasted between 1.5 and 3 h, totaling 15 h."

The studies provided varying level of detail, often with an extensive focus on a few activities depending on the purpose of the study or on the issues the authors had aimed to highlight. Then the data were deductively mapped onto the steps of QIF using direct qualitative content analysis  (31)  aiming to compare the processes described in the studies and the QIF. Data not fitting onto the QIF but reflecting realities of the AI implementation process were registered separately. The interview transcripts from the interview study I detailing the perceptions of experts about QIF were reviewed using direct qualitative content analysis  (33) . Insights were labelled using the numbering of the QIF steps. The insights not fitting onto the QIF but reflecting realities of the AI implementation process were registered separately. This allowed to determine areas of alignment and gaps between QIF and AI implementation practice and to identify potential modifications or extensions of the QIF.\n\nTo extract the AI implementation process from the case interviews (interview study II), the interview transcripts were reviewed aiming to familiarize with the context, to identify start and end points, key actions, decisions, and involved parties and their responsibilities. Then the data were listed for mapping an individual process of every case. Then the data were deductively mapped onto the steps of QIF using direct qualitative content analysis  (33) . This allowed for comparisons between the processes of the case and the QIF. Data not fitting onto the QIF but reflecting realities of the AI implementation process were registered separately.\n\nThree pairs of co-authors evaluated the data independently, discussed and reached a consensus through a number of iterations  (37) . Data not fitting onto the QIF were included in two different ways and later processed during the data analysis. First, data (condensed quotes) within the same area as respective QIF steps were documented in a separate column next to each step of QIF (Supplementary Material S3). Second, the data on activities of the practical AI implementation process that QIF does not cover were documented, analysed and summarized separately in the paragraph \"Limitations of QIF for AI implementation\" below."

On the technological side, actual changes in the IT infrastructure of the organization should be implemented establishing the secure data management, building test and production environments  (46, 51) , (Case 2). The data analysis also underscores the importance of change management activities, such as continuous communication with staff, AI vendors and developers and conducting training of AI system's users addressing the system's technical specifics, the new workflows and roles (Case 2, Case 4).

Obtaining stakeholders' confirmation that the problem is relevant allows to consider a global view and to formulate clear use case at the onset of the implementation since different stakeholders might need different output from AI or have different interpretations; it also promotes their readiness for change  (40, 45, 46) . Throughout the implementation process, engaging the stakeholders can help in several ways. It includes obtaining scientific, theoretical and practical knowledge of the health area which is useful for technology professionals  (50) . Next, the stakeholders can help in defining the parameters of the targeted population, data features to train the model on, and to think through how the model could be deployed  (41, 46) . Later, they can report on the user experience and whether the AI model aligns with their needs  (50) . Moreover, the stakeholders can play a role in designing the evaluation of the AI model  (41)  and can participate in creating the training materials  (13) . Finally, early engagement assists in change management and training since clinicians develop intuition and gain experience that advances their ability to train others  (13) ."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study aimed to explore the activities typical to implementation of AI-based systems for developing an AI implementation process framework intended to guide healthcare professionals. To achieve this aim, QIF was considered as an initial reference framework  (26) .\n\nPrevious research has indicated that a lack of stepped guidance and AI specificity in the presently available implementation frameworks can lead to patient safety risks, dissatisfaction of clinical staff, extra costs and delays in the AI system's deployment as demonstrated by previous research  (13, 17, 39, 40) . The key findings of this study are the identified processual phases and activities specific and typical to AI implementation projects to be carried out by an adopting healthcare organization when AI systems are deployed in routine practice. By reflecting upon the QIF, additional phases of implementation and governance were discerned, and different AI-specific activities were detected in connection to the QIF steps.\n\nA significant finding of the study is that successful AI implementation necessitates comprehensive pre-implementation assessments. Some types of identified assessments align with the ones suggested by QIF, such as the in-depth analysis of the problem and stakeholder needs, assessing compatibility of the AI system with an organization's strategy, processes, IT infrastructure, and potential impact on patients, clinical roles, and the organizational culture. These aspects in need of assessment were also recommended by previous research discussing the innovation process or determinants in the context of digital health and health innovation  (64) (65) (66) . The present study identified additional types of recommended assessments in the context of AI and located them as necessary activities in the planning phase: investigating explainability of AI algorithm  (45, 48) , relevance of an AI model to the local data (Expert 3) and conditions for re-training the model (Expert 6), level of data security and protection (Case 3), risk-consequence analysis (Expert 2, Expert 3, Case 4), cost-benefit analysis  (43) , considering the opportunity cost (Expert 3), ethics and patient safety considerations  (45, 48) , (Expert 3). Furthermore, the present study identified several preparatory actions in the legal area not described by the previous research. In addition to the traditional activities like negotiating different contracts and agreements between the organization and the vendor and verifying whether the AI system is suitably certified  (59) , this study added activities like setting up agreements regarding the data flow and protection and defining the policy explaining clinicians' liability  (40, 43, 44) , (Expert 3).\n\nThe present study identified a number of important activities that could be added to the actual implementation phase. These implementation activities include creating new or updating and standardizing local procedures and clinical protocols integrating the AI system, changing or creating new job descriptions, adapting IT architecture and setting up secure data management, conducting training and continuously communicating with users  (44, 46, (49) (50) (51) 57) , (Case 2, Case 4). Previous research either did not emphasize them entirely  (65)  or has reflected upon elements of it through different determinants, barriers and facilitators (64). This study was not able to place these activities within the process view of QIF which indicates that a specialized framework for AI implementation process should integrate them in the future.\n\nThis study underscores the importance of incorporating creation of the organizational structures and processes for the postimplementation governance period  (13, 41, 45)  as an integral part of the AI implementation framework. In the \"follow-up\" stages of AI-implementation, these processes are even more important, because not only the continued human adherence guarantees the sustained use, but also the monitoring of the model's performance and patient safety. Notably, this crucial phase dedicated to governance of maintenance and sustainability of the AI systems is absent in existing implementation frameworks such as  (26)  and  (64) . While specialized frameworks and different national guidelines focusing on governance of AI are beginning to emerge (67), a process-oriented perspective remains lacking. This perspective should address several key questions: When and how should governance work commence? What practical organizational structures and processes can facilitate effective governance? What is the role of leadership in this context? How can various stakeholders (e.g., healthcare organizations and vendors) collaborate to ensure the sustained use of AI systems? Ultimately, how can we guarantee the enduring effectiveness and sustainability of AI governance? Addressing these critical questions is paramount to ensuring that governance, maintenance, and sustainability of AI systems remain a top priority for healthcare practitioners during the implementation process.\n\nFurther, other significant finding is the importance of prioritizing staff training throughout all phases of AI implementation, pre-, during, and post-implementation, to ensure success. These findings extend previous research that was limited to the overall content of the training for AI implementation  (22, 67) . This study emphasizes that preinnovation training might be insufficient in the context of AI. It requires a continuous, iterative approach starting pre-and throughout the lifecycle of the AI system and should have a focus on the related clinical context and processes surrounding the AI system. In addition, specific competences and skills of staff should be developed prior to engaging in AI implementation  (50) . The study also revealed insights into the intensity of resources required for conducting effective training that enables staff to engage in using the AI system in their practice sustainably. The cost category related to continuous training and preparation of the training materials should be considered when evaluating the organization's capacity for conducting the AI implementation and in planning the costs (41), (Case 2).\n\nLastly, another crucial finding is that engagement of the stakeholders should span throughout all the phases of the AI implementation  (13, 40, 45, 46, 50, 55, 56, 62)  which corresponds to previous research highlighting the importance of stakeholder input and involvement  (22, 64, 65) . However, earlier implementation frameworks have not discerned the practical activities of stakeholder involvement through the processual perspective of different phases of implementation. During the preparatory phase, the stakeholders' role is to provide the subject knowledge, to confirm the relevance of the problem and the use case, to help define the target population and the parameters of the training data, and to envision the new workflows integrating the AI system  (40, 41, 45, 46) . The stakeholders should also be part of the AI system's piloting and evaluation activities and provide feedback  (41) . During the implementation phase, the stakeholders are involved in training as trainers or trainees and assist in communication and dissemination activities  (13) . During the governance and maintenance phase, the stakeholders can have roles in the AI system's governance committee, provide continuous feedback and ideas for improvement  (13, 41, 45) .\n\nWhile this study offers valuable insights into the process of AI systems' implementation, several limitations exist. First, the dataset used for analysis does not include scientific publications published since 2024 or cases representing generative AI applications. While the present study provides a solid foundation for understanding the implementation process for AI systems, newer types of AI models might present additional important implementation practices not covered in this article. Further, the data collected through the interview studies with the representatives from AI implementation cases and the experts represent the Swedish context and might not depict some practices manifesting in other healthcare contexts. Moreover, the cases were selected using convenience sampling which might provide limited generalizability of the results and overrepresentation of certain types of AI systems. Also, access to interviewees in Case 1 was limited to the implementation leader. This limitation was partially addressed by conducting two interviews with the same person to obtain more details on the implementation process.\n\nFuture research should discern processual differences based on the typology of AI (for example, AI systems dedicated to improving administrative processes of healthcare organizations compared to diagnostic AI systems). Another potential research avenue could relate to exploring potential differences in implementation when AI models are developed internally at healthcare organizations and procured from external vendors. How can stakeholders be educated to ensure their proper engagement throughout all phases. The future research could also address practicalities behind different activities in the implementation process and how they influence the success of the implementation and its sustainability. Systematizing such knowledge would create a better understanding of the interconnections between the activities and would help understand their relative weight for success of the implementation."
