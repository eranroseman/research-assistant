  "title": "A new method for computing the projection median, its influence curve and techniques for the production of projected quantile plots",
  "abstract": "This article introduces a new formulation of, and method of computation for, the projection median. Additionally, we explore its behaviour on a specific bivariate set up, providing the first theoretical result on form of the influence curve for the projection median, accompanied by numerical simulations. Via new simulations we comprehensively compare our performance with an established method for computing the projection median, as well as other existing multivariate medians. We focus on answering questions about accuracy and computational speed, whilst taking into account the underlying dimensionality. Such considerations are vitally important in situations where the data set is large, or where the operations have to be repeated many times and some well-known techniques are extremely computationally expensive. We briefly describe our associated R package that includes our new methods and novel functionality to produce animated multidimensional projection quantile plots, and also exhibit its use on some high-dimensional data examples.",

However, several different multivariate median concepts have been developed that retain some characteristics of the univariate median. For example, an early extension of the multivariate median was suggested by Hayford  [1] , which is simply the component-wise median, also known as the vector of marginal medians. The spatial median, also known as the L 1 median  [2, 3] , and Tukey's median  [4]  are two other popular variants. Oja's median  [5]  provides an alternative to the spatial median, but it is known to be more computationally expensive than other choices. These, and others, are reviewed in  [6] [7] [8] . We briefly review some of them here next, not least as we use them later in our simulation study."

Intuitively, if the shift vector \u03bc is far away from the true 'middle' of the dataset, then the magnitude of m X (\u03bc, a), as well as the integral M X, m (\u03bc), will be large. By contrast, a smaller m X (\u03bc, a) can be obtained when the \u03bc is moving closer to the true 'middle' of the data set.\n\nInstead of computing the squared value of m X (\u03bc, a) for the integral, we also considered the absolute value as an alternative. However, this leads to similar numerical results.\n\nExample. We now generate two polar plots of the absolute value of m X (\u03bc, a), when \u03bc is both close to, and far away, from the true median, respectively. A random two-dimensional dataset with k = 100 points was generated, whose Tukey's median computed as  (2.78, 8.16 ). Here, the Tukey median is to be interpreted as a 'sensible' middle of the data set. The shift vector \u03bc is set to be (2.2, 8) and (2, 7.5) respectively, and for each plot, two thousand random projections were used to calculate the univariate median m X (\u03bc, a), using methods to be explained in Section 2.4. Fig  1  shows that when \u03bc is near the Tukey's median, the magnitude of each m X (\u03bc, a) is less than 0.65, while a larger value, ranging from 0 to 1.2, is shown in the figure when \u03bc is far away from the median. Overall, when integrated the quantity involving the \u03bc is closer to the Tukey median it gives a smaller result.\n\nThe projection median and yamm definitions seem similar, as both project the multiset onto the line passing through the origin, and then take the median. However, the projection median integrates med(X a ) directly over the unit hypersphere in R n , whereas yamm minimises the objective function M X;m \u00f0\u03bc\u00de 2 R over the shift vector \u03bc. Despite these differences, the following theorem shows that the projection median and yamm are identical. Theorem. For any finite multiset X \ufffd R n with n \ufffd 2, yamm is equivalent to the projection median.\n\nFor the proof of the theorem, see S1 Appendix."

Another approach computes the projection median directly from the definition in Eq  (12) , using the spherical coordinates illustrated in Eq  (13) , where the integral can be obtained by the trapezoidal rule. For example, in the two-dimensional case, we apply the trapezoidal rule once on Eq  (11) .

      "text": "For a dataset in R n with k observations, the computational complexity for the Spatial median is O(nk)  [17] , which is the same for the exact computation of the component-wise median. The projection median can be obtained in O(k 4/3 log 1+\ufffd k) time in R 2  [9] , and O(k\n\nn /(n+1)}+\ufffd] time is required to compute the projection median, where \u03b4 n = (4n -3) -n and \ufffd is a fixed small constant. Several algorithms for other multivariate medians have been developed or the bivariate case. The current best algorithms for Oja's and Liu's medians require O(k log 3 k) and O(k 4 ) time, respectively  [18] , whereas that for the fastest bivariate Tukey median is O(k log 3 k)  [19] . The calculation of these three multivariate medians in higher dimensions is more complicated and approximate computation is often preferred/required.\n\nTo provide empirical assessment of the real computation speed, we apply several R software medians to simulated data. There are several R functions using different algorithms to compute one median. For example, spatial.median from the library ICSNP estimates the median with the algorithm developed by Vardi and Zhang  [20] , while Gmedian developed by Cardot et al.  [21]  is faster but, perhaps, less accurate. In addition, l1median  [22]  from library pcaPP and med from depth also provide opportunities to compute the spatial median.\n\nHence, after some experiments, we choose the best function (evaluated in terms of speed and accuracy) for each multivariate median in R 2 and R 3 shown in Table  1 . Much of the software for multivariate medians in R only works in low numbers of dimensions.\n\nThe med function can only calculate the bivariate Liu's median, which is considerably more challenging in higher dimensions. The calculation of Tukey's median is exact in one and two dimensions, and approximate in higher dimensions. We use the approximate Tukey's median computation in the med function, due to numerical errors that sometimes surface when using the exact algorithm. For Oja's median, the approximate method (evolutionary algorithm) is used instead of the exact one, as it is faster and can deal with high dimensions.\n\nTable  2  displays mean computation times and their standard deviations across 1000 simulated datasets from the two-dimensional Laplace distribution with different numbers of observations (k) for each set. The results are produced by running R on a single core of an Intel i7-8750h processor with 2.20 GHz base clock using 16Gb RAM. For small k, Liu's median is fastest, but its speed is not as fast as others for higher k. In this experiment, Oja's median is the slowest for small k values, but its speed does not appear to be particularly sensitive to k. Hence, its speed is faster than Tukey's median when k = 200. The projection median is one of the quickest when k is below 100, while for large k values, the component-wise median and the Spatial median are faster.\n\nThe results in Table  2  are produced by only one possible R function for one median. However, other functions can be used. For example, the med function from the depth package can also be used to calculate the spatial median and provides accurate answers. It is extremely\n\nTable 1.

The spatial median and the projection median have smaller mean squared error, the latter performing better for small k values. On the other hand, Liu's median always produces a very high mean squared error.\n\nConclusion. Based on these simulations, for the R functions listed in Table  1 , the spatial and projection medians always have the lowest mean squared error, but also fast running speeds. Although Liu's median has the shortest computation time, for small k, it is the most inaccurate, and its computation time becomes long for large datasets. Similarly, the component-wise median is fast, even when k increases, but it has a large mean squared error. Hence, the spatial and projection medians are good choices when computing two-dimensional robust measures of location in this case, and the latter is preferred for small datasets. The computational results for high-dimensional simulations (n = 3, 5, 10) can be found in S1 Table."

This function returns the projection median estimate vector. The function PmedTrapz computes the projection median in R 2 and R 3 and is invoked by PmedTrapz(x, no.subinterval) PmedTrapz applies the trapezoidal rule once in R 2 and twice in R 3 on each entry of the vector med\u00f0X a \u00de, mentioned in section 2.1.2, and returns a vector of the projection median estimate.\n\nThe argument no.subinterval determines the number of subintervals for the trapezoidal rule. For the bivariate case the no.subinterval argument is a single number that controls the number of subdivisions for the one-dimensional integration; for the trivariate case the argument is a vector of length two that controls the number of subdivisions for the two integrals. In general, it is better to use at least 36 subintervals, which typically produces accurate results without excessive running time.\n\nMore subintervals may be appropriate for more complex datasets. For some unusual data sets it would be ideal to have a high resolution of the interval of integration in one particular region, and a relatively low resolution elsewhere, but this is beyond the scope of the current research. A small number of partitions, e.g. below 15, is not recommended for reasons of accuracy.\n\nThe yamm function is valid for data of any dimension. It uses an optimiser to provide another method to compute the projection median. The arguments are yamm(x, nprojs = 2000, reltol = 1e-06, xstart = l1median(x), opt.method = \"BFGS\", doabs = 0, full.results = FALSE).\n\nThe yamm function is a wrapper to minimise the the objective function yamm.obj, which uses the Monte Carlo method to approximate the squared or absolute value of the univariate median of the projection of the shifted data matrix. The nprojs argument controls the number of projections in the Monte Carlo approximation and doabs is an indicator, where 1 uses the absolute value of the univariate median and 0 forces the use of the squared value. The arguments reltol, xstart, opt.method are supplied directly to the R optimisation function optim: reltol is the tolerance for the optimiser, with default value of 10 -6 . Usually, we set a larger value (e.g. 10 -3 ) to this argument, which will reduce the running time, whilst maintaining accuracy. The argument opt.method controls the selection of optimisation methods, which can be chosen from any of the four options, \"BFGS\", \"Nelder-Mead\"  [29] , \"CG\"  [30] , \"L-BFGS-B\"  [31] , and \"SANN\"  [32] . The default choice \"BFGS\" is relatively fast and stable in our case. See the help page of the function optim in R for further details about the different optimisation methods. The xstart argument provides the initial value for the parameters to optimise over, which plays an important role in the function yamm. A good starting point will reduce the running time and provide a more accurate result, so we use the spatial median as the default value. Other multivariate medians could be used, but they need to be fast. If full. results = TRUE, the output of this function involves a list with components obtained from the optim function, otherwise, it returns a vector containing the multivariate median estimate."

Obtaining true multivariate quantiles can be computationally challenging, and what we produce are not true multivariate quantiles, but they do enable us to gain useful understanding about multivariate data. The muqie (MUltivariate QuantIlE) plots are constructed as follows.\n\nFirst choose a unit-length direction vector, u. Then project our yamm-centred multivariate data onto u to obtain a univariate set. The muqie point, Q(\u03b1, u), is merely the vector u rescaled to have length equal to the \u03b1-quantile of the univariate set. A muqie plot is the collection of all muqie points, Q(\u03b1, u) over all unit-length direction vectors u. In practice, we construct our plot by choosing a number of directions and joining the points. The basic concept, and plots, are not new, Section 2 of Fraiman and Pateiro-Lopez  [34]  introduces the concept based on mean-centred data and is related to ideas in  [35] . Our main addition to this body of work is to (i) centre using yamm, or other robust median and (ii) presenting the muqie plots as dynamic videos of increasing \u03b1. Fig 5. Muqie plot for the three cluster two-dimensional data set without outliers. The figures are produced for different values of pseudo-quantile \u03b1. The centre point (in blue) in each plot is the yamm median. Left: \u03b1 = 0.4, Right: \u03b1 = 0.8. These plots were produced by the muqie() function in the Yamm package. For the animated plot, the package includes the makeplot() function, which calls muqie() for multiple values of \u03b1. Then we use the CRAN package animation to produce an animated GIF using saveGIF(makeplot(clusters2d[,-c(102,103)], nprojs = 4000), diff.col = 3, interval = 0.1, width = 500, height = 500).\n\nThe movie beetle shows a three-dimensional Muqie plot using three variables from the beetle data.

      "title": "5. Conclusions and discussions",
      "text": "We have introduced a new method, yamm, to compute the projection median, for data in R n with n \ufffd 2. We have proved the theoretical equivalence of yamm and the projection median. Through theoretical and numerical investigations we demonstrate the robustness of yamm on a simple, but illuminating, bivariate setup. Then, we illustrated three computation methods for the projection median, which can be best deployed in different situations. Approximating the projection median by the Monte Carlo method is valid in any dimensions but requires a large number of projections to ensure accuracy, while using the trapezoidal rule is computationally fast and accurate in two and three dimensions, but requires more integration on the projection vector in the higher dimensions, which becomes rapidly more complex. The yamm approximation can also compute the median in any dimensions. Its computational speed is not as quick as the other two, under the same conditions (e.g. the number of projections). However, thanks to the optimiser, a small number of the projections can be chosen to obtain an accurate median with a reasonable starting point (e.g. other multivartiate medians or mean value), which can be a distinct advantage.\n\nOur research also documents the simulated empirical performance for different medians in terms of the computation time and the mean squared error. Using different R functions to calculate different multivariate medians, we find that the spatial median and the projection median are always accurate with relatively fast speed using the existing R functions. The performance of other multivariate medians either exhibits slow speed or large mean squared error.\n\nFinally, we introduce our R package, Yamm, that contains our three methods to compute the projection median. We show that our methods coincide with each other in R 2 and R 3 , and all multivariate medians are not affected by the outliers in the dataset, but the location of the mean value varies a lot. Currently, the function PmedTrapz in the R package is only valid in R 2 and R 3 , further investment can be conducted on extending this function to higher dimensions.\n\nThe Yamm package also introduces our Muqie plots, which are capable of producing animated plots of two-and three-dimensional sets' projected quantiles. The animated 'growth' of these \"quantile\" plots give a vivid picture of the extent, spread and configuration of data in the sets.\n\nThe Yamm package is available on the CRAN archive."

The function Plot3dMedian in Yamm plots the three-dimensional medians. The dataset clusters3d has four clusters, each generated from different independent normal distributions, as well as five outliers. Fig 4 is produced with the dataset clusters3d, whose outliers have been removed. It shows that apart from the Oja's median, the other medians are located close to each other. Again, the three approximations of the projection median almost coincide in every component."
