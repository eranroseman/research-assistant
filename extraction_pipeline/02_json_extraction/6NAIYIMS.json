  "title": "Characterizing Active Ingredients of eHealth Interventions Targeting Persons With Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using the Behavior Change Techniques Taxonomy: Scoping Review",
  "abstract": "Background: The behavior change technique taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1; Michie and colleagues, 2013) is a comprehensive tool to characterize active ingredients of interventions and includes 93 labels that are hierarchically clustered into 16 hierarchical clusters. \n Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the active ingredients in electronic health (eHealth) interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and relevant outcomes. \n Methods: We conducted a scoping review using the BCTTv1. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), studies with or pre-post-test designs, and quasi-experimental studies examining efficacy and effectiveness of eHealth interventions for disease management or the promotion of relevant health behaviors were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility using predetermined eligibility criteria. Data were extracted following a data extraction sheet. The BCTTv1 was used to characterize active ingredients of the interventions reported in the included studies. Results: Of the 1404 unique records screened, 32 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and reported results on the efficacy and or or effectiveness of interventions. Of the included 32 studies, 18 (56%) were Web-based interventions delivered via personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet, computer, and/or mobile phones; 7 (22%) were telehealth interventions delivered via landline; 6 (19%) made use of text messaging (short service message, SMS); and 1 employed videoconferencing (3%). Of the 16 hierarchical clusters of the BCTTv1, 11 were identified in interventions included in this review. Of the 93 individual behavior change techniques (BCTs), 31 were identified as active ingredients of the interventions. The most common BCTs identified were instruction on how to perform behavior, adding objects to the environment, information about health consequences, self-monitoring of the outcomes and/or and prefers to be explicit to avoid ambiguity. Response: Checked and avoided of a certain behavior Author: Please note that the journal discourages the use of parenthesis to denote either and/or and prefers",

      "text": "The global burden of diseases has shifted from communicable diseases to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) due to interrelated nutritional, sociodemographic, and epidemiological transitions  [1] . Deaths attributable to NCDs are expected to rise by 15% between 2010 and 2020  [2, 3] . Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major NCDs. Globally, around 415 million people are living with diabetes  [4] , and the global obesity epidemic  [3]  has increased its importance for global health. This number is expected to rise to 642 million by 2040. Hence, diabetes has become one of the largest global health emergencies of the 21st century  [4] .\n\nAs a result of advances in information and communication technology (ICT), mobile phones and the Internet are increasingly playing a role in interventions for health promotion and in those aimed at preventing and managing diseases  [5] . These technologies may help patients perform behavior necessary for disease management and lifestyle modification and may support long-term treatment. Engaging patients in the care continuum using technological support to improve treatment outcomes and enhancing communication between patients and providers are effective interventions  [6, 7] .\n\nAn increasing number of effective ICT applications are currently employed by health providers to improve health behaviors and manage disease outcomes in persons with T2DM  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Electronic health (eHealth) is the use of ICT for health  [14] . Eysenbach defined eHealth as an \"intersection of medical informatics, public health, and business, referring to health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies\"  [15] . Applications such as telemedicine, videoconferencing, Web-based applications, tailored and untailored text messaging, mobile phone apps, biometric sensors, wearable devices, and Internet-based interactive support systems are currently used for the management of T2DM and to support the adoption of a healthier lifestyle  [8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .\n\nSeveral outcome measures were employed in studies investigating the effectiveness of eHealth interventions targeting persons with T2DM  [8] . Blood glucose and hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) levels and the incidence of hypoglycemic events are often used as objective primary outcome measures in randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The frequency or rate of T2DM-related complications, adherence to self-care, and prescribed medications are also used to evaluate intervention effectiveness  [28] . HbA 1c as an outcome measure is relatively well standardized and widely employed in research  [8, 28, 29] .\n\nIn contrast, measures for assessing changes in lifestyle, quality of life, and other psychosocial outcomes vary substantially  [30] . In several studies, the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is used to measure quality of life  [31, 32] . However, other studies prefer using the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale  [20]  or the Diabetic Quality of Life (DQoL)  [33]  questionnaire. Measuring the effectiveness of interventions requires identifying the outcomes of interventions and the tools used to measure the outcomes. Identifying the outcomes facilitates the comparison and syntheses of evidence across multiple interventions. While results of systematic reviews of randomized trials and observational studies suggest that participation in eHealth interventions leads to improvements in disease-related outcomes and health behaviors as well as a reduced risk for complications, the active ingredients of these interventions remain unclear  [34, 35] . The lack of homogeneity of measurements and the complexity of identifying and summarizing active ingredients of interventions make synthesizing and replicating the evidence a challenging task  [35, 36] . This is further complicated by poor descriptions of intervention content often available in scientific publications  [37] . Therefore, adding to existing research findings, synthesis of evidence, and reliable implementation of interventions is limited  [35, 36] .\n\nSeveral models and taxonomies have been developed to help describe intervention content and simplify reporting of the effects of behavioral interventions. For example, using the Behavioral Change Wheel (BCW), researchers can organize content and components of behavioral interventions into 9 intervention functions: education, persuasion, incentivization, coercion, training, enablement, modeling, environmental restructuring, and restrictions  [38] . The BCW model provides a systematic way of classifying behavioral change interventions using the 9 intervention functions and 7 policy categories. To translate the general intervention functions into specific techniques that were employed in a given intervention to change behavior, Michie et al  [39]  recommend the application of the Behavior Change Techniques Taxonomy Volume 1 (BCTTv1) ( www.behaviourchangewheel.com/about-wheel ). The Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) taxonomy  [40]  was used in a systematic review by Tricco and colleagues  [41]  to categorize and aggregate the effectiveness of 142 quality improvement studies in diabetes. Categories included education of patients, promotion of self-management, and reminder systems  [41] . Both the EPOC taxonomy and the BCW model of intervention content evaluation are considered important hallmarks of a more reliable content analysis and the development and use of a common language for describing intervention components. However, a recent systematic review including 23 randomly sampled studies of 142 interventions demonstrated significant limitations of the EPOC taxonomy. Specifically, the level of detail with regard to content and the mode of delivery of interventions were not well represented when using the taxonomy  [42] . Similarly, Drake and colleagues  [43]  called for a standardization of intervention content analysis. They pointed out difficulties they encountered when synthesizing the literature due to a lack of common language and a reliable model for analyzing intervention content  [43] . Reliable content analysis of interventions and synthesis of evidence have been challenging due to poorly described behavioral interventions, a general inconsistency of terminologies across interventions, and the lack of replicable intervention content analysis methodology  [36, 44, 45] . We believe that in comparison to the BCW model and the EPOC taxonomy, the BCTTv1 appears to be a more comprehensive, detailed, reliable, and useful tool in assisting researchers in retrospectively identifying the active ingredients of interventions, particularly behavioral interventions. The BCTTv1 includes 93 behavior change techniques considered to be effective for behavior change and 16 hierarchical clusters  [44] .\n\nThe BCTTv1 has been validated and is used to design and retrospectively evaluate and aggregate effect sizes of eHealth and other behavioral health interventions  [46] . This is of particular importance because some evidence suggests that when theory in delineating intervention outcomes is used as a foundation for intervention design, the impact of interventions on those outcomes increases. Results of several studies suggest that eHealth interventions targeting persons with T2DM that are grounded in theory are associated with positive clinical, psychological, and behavioral outcomes such as reductions in HbA 1c levels, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and depression and increases in physical activity  [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . To our knowledge, the BCTTv1 has never been applied to evaluate eHealth interventions targeting persons with poorly controlled T2DM. Hence, this scoping review was initiated to identify relevant outcome measures reported in studies examining the effects of eHealth interventions in persons with poorly controlled T2DM and characterize the contents of the interventions targeting this particular population using the BCTTv1."

We use eHealth interventions in T2DM as a term to refer to all mobile Health (mHealth) interventions-those delivered via personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet, computer, Internet, and other forms of ICT-implemented to improve the management and outcomes of T2DM.\n\nTo address the objectives of this scoping review, we followed the 5 steps described in the framework by Arksey and O'Malley  [52] : (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selecting relevant studies, (4) charting data from the selected studies, and (5) summarizing and reporting the results  [52] . Unlike systematic reviews, scoping reviews do not quantitatively aggregate the evidence but rather collate and summarize the evidence by mapping the related literature and examining the extent, breadth, nature, and characteristics of the available evidence  [52] . Levac et al  [53]  recommended additional substeps to deal with the challenges encountered while conducting scoping studies. The details of the main challenges in each stage and the recommended substeps can be read elsewhere  [53] ."

We also hypothesized that eHealth interventions targeting persons with T2DM include behavioral components. To search the relevant evidence for our hypothesis, we formulated the following research questions: Which outcome measures are used to assess the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in poorly controlled T2DM patients? What are the active ingredients of the eHealth interventions in poorly controlled T2DM?"

During a preliminary search, we did not observe major differences in search results when using Excerpta Medica (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Cochrane Library. Therefore, we concluded that PubMed and Web of Science covered the relevant articles. Articles containing results pertaining to eHealth interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled T2DM (HbA 1c \u22657.0%) published in peer-review journals from January 1990 to June 2016 were considered as potentially relevant for the review. To be included in the review, articles had to report findings of studies with quasi-experimental or pre-/post-designs or of RCTs and had to have a focus on eHealth interventions and poorly controlled T2DM. Articles were excluded if they were published in languages other than English, if only titles were available, and if they were study protocols for future or ongoing evaluations of eHealth interventions. The screening process and identification of the relevant studies are shown in Figure  1 .\n\nThe key word search strategy employed to identify relevant literature is described in Multimedia Appendix 1.

      "text": "This was the main step for answering the research questions and required all reviewers to reach consensus regarding the classification of the type of intervention delivery and content and identification of the outcome measures. Here, the descriptive analytical narrative method was employed  [53] . In addition, using thematic content analysis, type of intervention and outcome measures were exclusively categorized by content, nature of outcomes, and context/setting of implementation.\n\nThe descriptions of all interventions were analyzed, and active ingredients of the interventions were identified following the BCTTv1 by Michie and colleagues  [44] .\n\nEmphasis was put on reaching consensus with regard to the labeling of the intervention components according to the taxonomy (Multimedia Appendix 3). MK and TL independently analyzed the contents of the interventions using the taxonomy. Analysis was followed by discussions between MK and TL regarding the coding. When there was disagreement, CP was consulted to reach consensus. Whenever we were indecisive in coding, we used the BCTTv1 coding rules supplement by Presseau and colleagues  [42] . When the BCTTv1 and the coding supplement were not clear enough to characterize intervention content, the following 5 coding assumptions were used: 1. If an intervention included an educational component but sufficient detail on the themes and sequence of educational activities was not provided, the intervention was given the labels \"information about health consequences\" and \"instruction on how to perform behavior.\" 2 . If an intervention included training without providing detail regarding the training, it was labeled as \"instruction on how to perform behavior.\" 3 . If patients in a given intervention received blood glucose or blood pressure measurement devices, Internet services, software applications, computers, mobile phones, and/or airtime services, booklets, or leaflets, the intervention was labeled as \"adding objects to the environment.\" 4 . If an intervention included warning or cautionary messages to raise patients' consciousness regarding dangers of an unhealthy diet or sedentary behavior or clinical parameters reaching certain values (eg, elevated blood glucose, blood pressure), this was labeled as \"salience of consequences.\" 5. If motivational messages or calls or motivational interviewing were included in an intervention, the intervention was coded as \"social support (emotional).\""

      "text": "The purpose of this review was to identify the relevant outcome measures reported in studies examining the effects of eHealth interventions in persons with poorly controlled T2DM and characterize the active ingredients of eHealth interventions among persons with poorly controlled T2DM using the BCTTv1.\n\nMost of the studies (25 out of 32) measured the effectiveness of eHealth interventions using a statistically significant change in HbA 1c percentage as a primary outcome measure. This is similar to the review reported by Vorderstrasse and colleagues  [29] . A review from the Cochrane Library by Pal and colleagues  [27]  found that all 16 RCTs included in its review used HbA 1c percentage as a primary outcome measure of effectiveness. Lipska and Krumholz  [83]  challenged this glucocentric approach, reporting that the effectiveness indicator of interventions in T2DM is moving away from the historic surrogate marker (ie, HbA 1c ) to cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe identification of the active ingredients of the behavioral interventions is a basis for synthesizing evidence, building on evidence, and replicating interventions targeting behavioral change. The development and use of the EPOC taxonomy and BCW models contribute to the homogeneity in characterizing the contents of different interventions and in quantifying intervention effects (eg, by aggregating effect sizes). However, we observed that these 2 frameworks were not sufficiently comprehensive to characterize the content of interventions in detail. BCTTv1, in contrast, appeared suitable for in-depth analysis of the active ingredients of interventions. It offered a means of handling heterogeneity and provided a baseline for meta-analysis or the estimation of effect sizes for quantifying effects of behavior change interventions.\n\nIn our scoping review, only 31 (33%) of the 93 BCTs were identified in interventions. Similarly, Presseau et al  [42]  identified less than a quarter of the 93 BCTs in 23 interventions. BCTs such as credible source, reward (outcome), focus on past success remain underused in interventions. Innovative eHealth interventions employing these BCTs need to be tested with regard to their impact in changing patient behavior and affecting T2DM outcomes. Of the 31 BCTs identified in interventions included in this review, the most frequently used were instruction on how to perform behavior, adding objects to the environment, social support (practical), feedback on outcomes of behavior, self-monitoring on outcomes of behavior, and prompts/cues. Van Vugt and colleagues  [49]  identified BCTs such as providing feedback on performance of behavior, providing information on consequence of behavior, problem solving, and prompts/cues as the most commonly used BCTs in Web-based self-management programs for patients with T2DM. Pal  [27]  demonstrated that among the most frequently used BCTs, prompt self-monitoring of behavioral outcome and provide feedback on performance were reported to have significant effects on HbA 1c levels. However, frequency of inclusion of an individual BCT is neither proof for it significantly improving patient outcomes nor proof of a proper design of interventions  [84] .\n\nOur study results suggest that, on average, 6.7 BCTs were included per each intervention. The evidence on whether including many BCTs in an intervention improves patient outcomes is not strong. Systematic reviews by Avery and colleagues  [50]  and Cradock  [85]  revealed that only 50% and 60%, respectively, of the most frequently used BCTs were associated with reductions in HbA 1c . An evaluation of diabetes-related apps by Hoppe and colleagues  [86]  indicated that diabetes mobile phone apps having more BCTs also had significantly higher functionalities and higher user ratings. However, which combination of BCT ingredients had a stronger effect and which BCTs were key moderators of effectiveness in poorly controlled T2DM needs to be further investigated. Customizing eHealth interventions to individual behavioral characteristics and disease progress increases the effectiveness of the intervention  [87] . Tailoring or individualizing the communication between patients and providers has gained substantial attention in the past decade. In this review, we observed that more than 75% of the interventions were customized to the individual patient characteristics or needs. In addition, a generally increasing trend of tailored eHealth interventions was noted in the reviewed studies. Strategies used for tailoring vary across studies. Kim  [64]  and Wayne  [80]  used pragmatic approaches of tailoring and contextualized the intervention with respect to the individual patient. McFarland and colleagues  [67]  tailored the intervention to individualize the communication between patients and providers. First, patients self-monitored blood glucose levels by using monitors and transmitted their data using a messaging device. A registered nurse then downloaded the message and contacted the patient via telephone to evaluate whether there were any specific health concerns. Based on specific concerns (eg, with regard to adherence to certain medications or a dietary regimen or hypoglycemic events), patients were given recommendations regarding insulin dosage or lifestyle changes. Ralston and colleagues  [71]  tailored the Web-based intervention according to the clinical condition of each patient. Accordingly, the care manager responded to specific messages from each patient and reviewed the submitted blood glucose levels of each patient to adjust hypoglycemic medications as needed. Several studies suggest that tailoring may be an effective means of behavioral change and improving self-management skills  [88] [89] [90] [91] . Tailoring also helps initiate, enhance, and safeguard the partnership between the provider and the patient, increasing shared decision-making and person-centered care which ultimately facilitates the uptake of the desired behavior, such as healthy eating and improved physical activity  [92] . However, a recent systematic review reported that there is lack of evidence to suggest tailored eHealth interventions are more effective than nontailored interventions  [93] . Therefore, this issue obviously requires more research. Despite a broad consensus that the use of theories or models to guide the development of interventions leads to greater impact of interventions, the current review showed that only 8 (25%) of the 32 eHealth interventions were theory-based. The finding of our review is consistent with the claim that undertheorization of eHealth interventions and underutilization or an inadequate application of behavioral science and health education theories is still a major issue in the eHealth intervention literature  [38, 47, 84, 85, 94] . The evidence on effectiveness of designing and implementing interventions through the use of theories is mixed. Some evidence suggests that theory-grounded eHealth interventions are more likely to be associated with positive outcomes of patients with T2DM. Theories can enhance the uptake of the desired behavior by supporting providers and patients to collaboratively set targets, enhance the motivation of intervention participants, and provide a roadmap for behavior and treatment modification  [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . The impact and processes by which eHealth interventions influence outcomes are not directly comparable to the impact of pharmacological drugs that are administered into the body and bring a change within a certain period of half-life of the ingredient. eHealth interventions, in part, impact cognitive processes (eg, by improving knowledge) and may help intervention participants internalize the advantages of performing the target behavior, such as improving self-management, dietary, or physical activity behavior, leading to long-term maintenance of these behaviors. Behavior maintenance can then be subsequently linked with changes in biological markers and long-term changes in quality of life and a lower incidence in complications."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Our scoping review had several limitations. The definition of poorly controlled diabetes was based on that of the American Diabetes Association. However, other guidelines, such as the one from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, consider an HbA 1c level up to 7.5% as a good indicator of glycemic control. This should be taken into consideration while interpreting our results. In some cases, it was challenging to crossmatch intervention contents described in the articles with the BCTs. For example, there were interventions that included motivational messages or calls to induce the uptake of a target behavior. However, motivation was not explicitly described in BCTTv1. In addition, there were interventions with poor descriptions. For instance, interventions provided education but there was no information available regarding the type of education. Coding the poorly described interventions was therefore challenging. Hence, we were forced to develop assumptions to deal with poorly described interventions. Another limitation of our scoping review was that the correlation between the 2 reviewers coding the BCTs was not systematically assessed. Rather, 2 coders independently analyzed contents of interventions, and where they disagreed, a third person was consulted to reach consensus."
