  "title": "Indirect Economic Burden of Sickle Cell Disease",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to quantify the indirect costs of sickle cell disease in the United States. Methods: Adult patients from a sickle cell disease clinic at an urban academic healthcare system completed an adapted Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Productivity Cost Questionnaire related to the impact of their disorder on absenteeism, presenteeism, ability to contribute through unpaid work outside of employment, and other aspects of life. Additional data were collected from patient records about each participant's genotype, total hemoglobin level, and pain level. Results: Of the 192 individuals, 187 who completed the survey reported experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis pain events during the last year that negatively affected their productivity at work and in daily roles. Three-fourths of respondents reported impairment in their ability to complete everyday tasks, such as caring for children, running errands, doing housework, shopping for groceries, and volunteer (unpaid) work. Only 30% of respondents reported being employed or self-employed. Of those employed, estimated costs of absenteeism and presenteeism attributable to pain events averaged $15 103 per person annually. Estimated total annual losses in unpaid work productivity averaged $3 145 862 for the study respondents and another $2 870 652 for their caregivers. Conclusions: Sickle cell disease affected the work productivity, nonwork productivity, and the daily lives of adults seen with the disorder in an academic medical center.",

      "text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a set of genetic abnormalities resulting in malformed red blood cells, primarily affecting individuals of African or Mediterranean descent.  1  Approximately 89 000 to 100 000 individuals in the United States  2, 3  and millions of individuals worldwide have received a diagnosis of SCD.  4  The primary symptomatic manifestation of SCD is unpredictable, severe, disabling, often ubiquitous pain that begins in infancy and becomes more frequent and severe with age.  5, 6 Pain typically occurs in the back, extremities, chest, and abdomen.  7 Chronic SCD pain  8  and progressive organ damage and organ failure  9  are punctuated by acute painful episodes 10 called vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). A VOC results when malformed red blood cells block blood flow in small blood vessels, causing tissue ischemia, inflammation, and severe episodes of pain. The inflammatory response in turn leads to further blockage of red blood cells and other cellular elements, creating a vicious cycle.\n\nThe landmark Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study  11  showed that, contrary to previous belief, most pain in SCD, including most VOCs, is treated at home. Only severe VOCs forcing patients to present for treatment on a little more than 3% of diary days over 6 months were observed by clinicians working in emergency rooms and hospitals; most pain was not seen by medical providers.  12 hus, the pain and dysfunction of patients with SCD are likely to be unmeasured and underappreciated by researchers and clinicians, and many clinicians expect that most SCD pain will result in visits.  13 Indeed, the frequency of severe VOCs that require hospital admissions or emergency department visits is correlated with reduced survival.  14 CD imposes a recognized economic burden on the US healthcare system and society, primarily owing to inpatient hospitalizations. Additional costs are generated through emergency department use, physician visits, and prescription drugs. Average annual costs are approximately $10 000 for a child  15, 16  and $34 000 for an adult.  15 Lifetime costs run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for individuals with SCD.  15  The disease has also been shown to substantially impact patients' quality of life.  [17] [18] ] [19] [20]  Although the direct medical costs of SCD have been studied in some detail, the indirect costs to society and to individuals with SCD have not been adequately quantified. VOCs, chronic pain, and organ dysfunction can have a devastating impact on an individual's employment, work productivity, and contributions to society. They often impede the performance of normal functions of employment and nonwork roles.\n\nThus, to hasten SCD treatment and financing decisions, policy makers must understand the full impact of SCD on patients including indirect costs. This understanding can guide evidencebased changes in therapy choices and insurance coverage. The purpose of this study was to quantify lost work owing to absenteeism, presenteeism resulting from lost productivity while at work, and reduction in the ability to contribute through volunteering (unpaid work) outside of employment attributed to SCD."

The clinic sees 650 adults with SCD from the southeastern region of the United States and provides a transition program from pediatric to adult care.\n\nTo be eligible for inclusion in this study, patients were required to speak and understand English, be at least 18 years of age, and have a diagnosis of SCD of any genotype. Individuals who reported that they had not experienced pain in the last year were excluded from the study. The study was approved by the institutional review board associated with the health system."

      "text": "Patients were recruited during scheduled clinic visits between June 2017 and December 2017 by a trained research assistant who obtained written informed consent for study participation. Recruitment was performed sequentially as patients arrived for clinic visits, before they met a physician. A $20 stipend was offered, to be mailed to patients who completed the study.\n\nOnce a patient provided consent, a written survey (Appendix I in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2  021.02.014 ) was administered in a private area of the clinic. The average time taken to complete the survey was 10 minutes. The research assistant also accessed the patient's medical records to obtain and record the patient's sickle cell genotype and total hemoglobin level. No additional identifiers were recorded for this study."

Nine of the questions collect demographic information, including the number of hours per week of paid work and the number of working days per week. Three questions measure productivity costs owing to absence from work, and 3 questions assess impact on presenteeism. Presenteeism is defined as a work productivity problem wherein workers are physically present at their jobs but not fully productive because of an illness or other medical condition. The remaining 3 questions measure and value unpaid work. Unpaid work is defined as any labor provided by individuals that is not directly compensated (eg, uncompensated labor provided to care for a sick relative). In addition to iPCQ items, questions were asked about significant changes in patients' lives owing to SCD relating to perceptions about impact on a patient's career and personal life.\n\nDetails about each participant's genotype, total hemoglobin level, and pain were collected from patient records. Pain scores were obtained to identify associations between this variable and survey questions.\n\nBefore the survey was administered, the questions were pretested on 5 individuals who did not have SCD to assess understanding and clarity. Minor revisions to the questions were made based on the pretest results."

      "text": "Descriptive analyses were conducted on all patient characteristics, productivity costs, and important changes in a patient's life owing to SCD using the questions in Appendix I (in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.02.014 ). Continuous measures were summarized as means, medians, and standard deviations. Categorical measures were summarized as counts and percentages. General demographic questions were used to describe the study sample and to allow for subgroup analyses of costs. Questions describing absenteeism from work, presenteeism owing to lost productivity at work, and impact on unpaid work were used to estimate productivity decreases attributable to SCD. Questions about substantial changes in patients' lives owing to SCD provided descriptive information about its impact on career and personal life.\n\nQuestions from the iPCQ were used to calculate short-term and long-term productivity costs for absenteeism, presenteeism, and unpaid work. Short-term and long-term productivity were assessed by asking respondents to estimate the impact of SCD on productivity for the last 4 weeks and the last year, respectively. Absenteeism was quantified by multiplying the total days of missed work over the 4-week and 1-year periods by the average daily wage rates from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics for the geographic location and time period of the study. Presenteeism was measured by multiplying respondents' short-term and longterm estimates of the total number of workdays during which they were bothered by SCD symptoms by their response to a question asking them to estimate how much less productive they were on symptomatic days. For instance, an estimate of 5 on the 10-point scale indicates that every day worked with SCD symptoms reduced productivity by 50%, or by half of a workday. That estimate of reduced productivity at work was multiplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics daily wages for the period and location of the study. Caregiver hours spent assisting patients with SCD on unproductive workdays were also estimated. Losses in unpaid work and caregiver time were calculated using the same method used for absenteeism, with the substitution of estimates of unpaid work for estimates of paid work.\n\nAdditional questions were asked of patients about any substantial life changes that occurred because of their SCD. Respondents were asked yes and no questions about items related to career impact, effects on social and family life, and relationships with others."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Economic analyses using a societal perspective should comprise all relevant costs and consequences of interventions in the evaluation including those that fall outside of healthcare delivery.  23, 24 An important cost category that is often excluded in economic analyses is the impact a health condition has on a patient's life.  [25] [26] 6] [27]  Patients who spend time dealing with medical disorders have less time to spend on paid work, unpaid work, or leisure activities.  27 Time is a scarce resource, with economic value, and time away from family, work, and leisure needs to be quantified to understand the true economic effect of medical disorders and healthcare. The fact that most patients with SCD spend substantial time managing their disease at home, outside of healthcare settings, prompted our evaluation of the value, costs, and consequences of that time.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the impact of SCD on productivity associated with employment and with unpaid work The overwhelming majority of survey respondents were black, which is consistent with a disorder that most commonly affects people of African or Mediterranean descent.  28 Approximately 30% of respondents were employed or self-employed, which is less than half of the 62% national employment participation rate for black individuals in the United States.  29 Although more than half of the respondents in this study were unemployed or unable to work, this is consistent with previous studies estimating that 40% to 60% of people with SCD are not employed.  [30] [31] ] [32] [33]  In addition to a high unemployment rate among respondents, this study demonstrated a substantial impact on work owing to sickle cell symptoms. Estimated indirect costs of absenteeism and presenteeism among the 53 employed respondents in this study were $15 103 per person compared with an estimated annual direct medical cost of $34 266 (2005 costs) for adults with SCD.  15  Of the 260 workdays in a year, respondents missed an average of more than 7 weeks of work in the last year because of SCD symptoms. These absences resulted in substantial lost productivity and may have complicated relationships at work by affecting their coworkers. Although an occasional absence is to be expected in a work setting, the lost work associated with an accumulation of repeated absences may be difficult to manage. This, in turn, may affect team cohesiveness and may add to workplace stress.\n\nPresenteeism was common in employees with SCD. Study results showed that most wage-earning employees (80% of respondents in the previous month; 90% of respondents in the previous year) went to work despite experiencing sickle cell symptoms. This finding is supported by previous research that found that employed individuals with SCD only stayed home on 17% of the days on which they had pain.  31 espondents reported an average of 100 symptomatic days at work in the last year and judged that those days were approximately half as productive as non-symptomatic days, indicating that employed respondents lost almost a half day of productivity for every day that they worked with symptoms. Similar to absenteeism, presenteeism may result in complicated relationships at work by adding to colleagues' workloads and contributing to workplace stress.\n\nWe also found that, beyond its impact on employment, morbidity associated with SCD affected almost every aspect of patients' lives. A majority of survey respondents indicated impairment in their ability to complete activities of daily living and had impairment in unpaid workdays on almost 3 of every 10 days over the last year. Productivity was lost in fulfilling societal roles as parents, family members, friends, and community volunteers. When asked about the impact of SCD on specific aspects of their lives, respondents reported that the disorder restricted their choice of career, inhibited their social life, and limited their participation in sports or hobbies. In addition, more than 60% of respondents reported that their SCD caused difficulties with a partner or family member and prompted a decision to delay having children.\n\nThere are many nonhealth-related causes of unemployment for individuals with SCD, although the protean impact of daily pain and dysfunction on patients' lives seems to be a major reason. Our results suggest that the known daily chronic pain of SCD that is often invisible to healthcare providers, punctuated by the VOCs that are visible to providers, dominates patients' lives. Together, pain and organ dysfunction make full-time employment difficult for individuals with SCD because of frequent absenteeism. In addition, SCD may complicate patients' employability owing to behavioral and social influences, such as depression, anxiety, illicit drug use, and unstable home situations.  34 Patients may catastrophize  35  and somatize  36  about their pain and may have comorbid depression and anxiety  37  or kinesiophobia.  38 They also may have disturbed sleep or sleep-disordered breathing.  [39] [40] 0] [41] [42] [43] [44]  Fatigue may be severe, with severe anemia, and correlates substantially not only with pain but with sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and stress  45  and neurocognitive function and decreased quality of life.  46 oor interpersonal relationships at work have been reported to be a larger contributor to unemployment than physical health in individuals with SCD.  47 Additionally, SCD may impact individuals' ability to attend college or engage in other educational opportunities, which further reduces their employability."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The findings of this research are limited by the fact that it examined a population of patients with SCD in a single clinic in the southeast United States. In particular, the results of this study might vary for regions with different wage and unemployment rates, education levels, social support systems, and more. In addition, the study relied on patient self-reports of the impact of SCD on their lives, which may not represent the true impact of the disorder. An attempt was made to minimize measurement bias by using the validated iPCQ instrument to quantify both paid and unpaid productivity losses.  21, 48 The response rate was high (89%) and respondent burden for filling out the survey was low, with most respondents completing it in less than 10 minutes. Data collection was conducted by trained interviewers to minimize bias associated with the data collection process.\n\nThe study used the human capital method, which used hourly wage rates to value both paid and unpaid productivity losses.  48, 49 lthough the human capital method is often preferred because it is easy to implement and understand, it has been disputed as a method for measuring productivity for some of its assumptions and choices.  27, 50, 51 One concern is that the method assumes full productivity in the labor markets in which the work by individuals is actually lost instead of just postponed. In real-world settings, when individuals are absent from work, their tasks are typically put off until they return, although this may be difficult to do for repeated or lengthy absences, as may occur with SCD. Another objection is that productivity calculations attributable to presenteeism assume that all individuals are 100% productive all of the time. This assumption may overestimate the lost productivity of individuals. Nevertheless, the human capital method is widely used in economic studies, and no other method of measuring productivity is better or more transparent.\n\nFinally, the calculations of nonwork productivity may be controversial. In this study, impairment was calculated to cost approximately $41 209 for individuals with SCD and their caregivers, a figure that exceeds the previously mentioned published estimates of direct medical costs  15  ($34 266) and the costs of absenteeism and presenteeism from this study ($15 103). Some might argue against including nonwork productivity because of methodologic difficulties or an opinion that nonwork is not really economically productive. Decision makers with this opinion may choose to ignore calculations of nonwork value, despite the theoretical support and widespread use in the economics literature. One may consider that a substantial amount of lost productivity was missed because it was not possible to calculate unemployment owing to SCD. A majority of survey respondents reported being unable to work, being out of work and looking for work, or not looking for work. If SCD contributes to the cause of unemployment for these people, absenteeism and presenteeism calculations are insufficient to capture the disorder's full indirect costs on patients and on society.\n\nDespite these limitations, our findings suggest that the impact of SCD has implications that extend well beyond medical resource usage. The first implication relates to medical care itself and to costeffectiveness analyses about medical treatments. Decisions and policies regarding medical and nonmedical interventions in SCD should account for both indirect and direct medical costs associated with patient care. Our study provides such measures of indirect costs. The second implication of our findings relates to their power to support SCD advocacy. Most SCD pain, including VOCs, is treated at home. VOCs are unpredictable. Nevertheless, patients, families, and clinicians dealing with SCD may feel helpless to defend patients against employers prepared to fire employees with SCD because of their VOCs, especially when VOCs are long, frequent, or severe. Sickle cell pain and VOCs have been described as \"invisible\"-there is no incontrovertible, clinically objective measure of a VOC. SCD employment policies suggest that the number of annual hospitalizations is not the only valid measure of disease severity or reason for accommodation of with SCD,  52  but, anecdotally, employers depend on hospitalizations and clinic visits to validate employees' SCD claims of medically valid work outages. Some clinicians themselves may doubt the validity of heavy job absenteeism owing to VOCs or presenteeism despite being in a VOC. Other clinicians may feel incapacitated when validating disability or repeated absences for their patients. Validation requires them to state that the employee wants to work but cannot or that the employee goes to work while ill and needs accommodation; such advocacy without objective evidence often fails.\n\nThese findings may be used to firmly persuade clinicians to advocate more forcefully or to convince employers of the validity of VOCs treated at home or of VOCs occurring during work. The hope is that this will reduce waste and improve work productivity for patients and employers."
