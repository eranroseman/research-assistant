  "title": "General Practitioners' Perspective on eHealth and Lifestyle Change: Qualitative Interview Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Wearables, fitness apps, and patient home monitoring devices are used increasingly by patients and other individuals with lifestyle challenges. All Danish general practitioners (GPs) use digital health records and electronic health (eHealth) consultations on a daily basis, but how they perceive the increasing demand for lifestyle advice and whether they see eHealth as part of their lifestyle support should be explored further. Objective: This study aimed to explore GPs' perspectives on eHealth devices and apps and the use of eHealth in supporting healthy lifestyle behavior for their patients and themselves. Methods: A total of 10 (5 female and 5 male) GPs were recruited by purposive sampling, aged 38 to 69 years (mean 51 years), of which 4 had an urban uptake of patients and 6 a rural uptake. All of them worked in the region of Southern Denmark where GPs typically work alone or in partnership with 1 to 4 colleagues and all use electronic patient health records for prescription, referral, and asynchronous electronic consultations. We performed qualitative, semistructured, individual in-depth interviews with the GPs in their own office about how they used eHealth and mHealth devices to help patients challenged with lifestyle issues and themselves. We also interviewed how they treated lifestyle-challenged patients in general and how they imagined eHealth could be used in the future. Results: All GPs had smartphones or tablets, and everyone communicated on a daily basis with patients about disease and medicine via their electronic health record and the internet. We identified 3 themes concerning the use of eHealth: (1) how eHealth is used for patients; (2) general practitioners' own experience with improving lifestyle and eHealth support; and (3) relevant coaching techniques for transformation into eHealth. Conclusions: GPs used eHealth frequently for themselves but only infrequently for their patients. GPs are familiar with behavioral change techniques and are ready to use them in eHealth if they are used to optimize processes and not hinder other treatments. Looking ahead, education of GPs and recognizing patients' ability and preference to use eHealth with regard to a healthy living are needed.",

      "text": "Wearables, fitness apps, and patient home monitoring devices are increasingly used by the general population. A recent study showed that 96% of a representative sample of 1004 Danes between 40 and 60 years prefers lifestyle change to medication  [1] , and outcomes for patients engaging in medical treatment has shown to be significantly affected by patients' engagement  [2] .\n\nInternet and mobile interventions have the ability to improve lifestyle behaviors for patients when behavior change elements are used by health professionals  [3] . However, teams with both medical doctors and lifestyle coaches did not perform better than teams without medical doctors  [4] . General practitioners (GPs) are central in the Danish health care system and have specialization certificates equal to other specialties for medical doctors. Close to 85% of all Danes see a GP at least once annually  [5] , and the GP is the patient's primary contact point to the health care system. The GPs have a 5-year postgraduate specializing degree and act as gatekeepers between the primary levels and the specialized health care system, covering hospitals, private hospitals, and specialists.\n\nWe have previously described a collaborative electronic health (eHealth) solution that supported lifestyle coaching by establishing a relationship and providing behavioral change (weight loss of 7.0 kg for 20 months) through monitoring and empathic, relevant, and individualized feedback in a general practice setting  [6] . These findings were replicated in a later version of the solution in a municipality setting in the region of North East England in Durham and Darlington County for men with type 2 diabetes in a pilot randomized controlled trial where patients lost an average of 5.4 kg compared with a control group that received usual care and lost 2.8 kg. In that same study, in-depth interviews with participating patients revealed that meeting face to face was important for the patients  [7] , and a recent qualitative study has shown that building a relationship to a health care professional using collaborative eHealth for lifestyle change is probably the most important driver for successful long-term outcome  [8] .\n\nThe role of GPs with regard to support of patients with lifestyle challenges and use of eHealth has not yet been explored. Hence, we aimed to identify factors important to GPs assisting patients undergoing lifestyle changes. Of particular focus was how the GPs see eHealth as a part of their own and their patients' struggle to live a healthier life."

In 2017, there were approximately 3500 GPs in Denmark covered by the collective agreement with the public health care system. On average, each GP had 1600 patients. In the Region of Southern Denmark, there were 786 full-time employed GPs working in 378 shared or solo practices  [5] . GPs were paid partly by a per capita remuneration (30%) and partly a fee for service offering (70%) such as fees for consultations (20 \u20ac), telephone consultations  (3,5 \u20ac) , asynchronous e-consultations (6 \u20ac), various blood tests, and other relevant GP tasks. GPs did not receive remuneration for receiving or interpreting patient-registered outcome measurements (PROMs). Patients were generally quite loyal to their GP and change doctor rarely."

GP characteristics were 5 females and 5 males, and with a mean age of 51 years ranging from 38 to 69 years.

The interview guide was made with inspiration from a study on GPs attitude toward the treatment of cardiovascular disease  [11]  and a previous study exploring the patients' perspective of using eHealth in changing lifestyle  [8] .\n\nThe interviews were held in Danish and carried out from March to May 2017 in the GPs' offices and took 45-60 min each. All interviews were performed by CJB, who has worked as a GP for more than 10 years and with different eHealth solutions for more than 15 years. The GPs were asked to describe examples from their own experience and were encouraged to reflect upon them to explore the various aspects of the topics evolving."

To systematically uncover important themes and to get a rich, straightforward description of the concepts and latent variables, the explorative approach of systematic text condensation was applied  [12, 13] . The transcripts were read thoroughly to get an overall impression of the material before the initial coding. A priori coding was done by using QSR NVivo 11 software  [14]  for each transcript. Themes were identified, and the data were coded, sorted, and categorized into themes and subthemes by identifying similar expressions, patterns, and sequences. Data from each theme were condensed and summarized into generalized descriptions and concepts concerning GPs' perspectives on the use of eHealth in relation to improving lifestyle for their patients and themselves. During the analytical process, the extracted information was related to the full transcripts to preserve the original context. The identified themes were compared between the different researchers. Coinciding themes of importance was identified and consistency was reached. Have you communicated with your patients using digital tools? How?\n\nHave you ever received patient-registered objective measurements via digital tools? How do you use them?\n\nExperience with eHealth in relation to their own and patients' health challenges Finally, quotes were selected to illustrate each theme and its related subthemes and translated from Danish to English. The two researchers, CJB and GIS, compared their individual translations, agreeing on wording and meaning. The remaining authors then reviewed the quotes in Danish and English, and changes were made if all authors agreed on it. In the text, interview quotes are followed by a unique participant identifier called GP1 to GP10 (Multimedia Appendix 1). The authors CJB and GIS were the only ones aware of the true identity of the GPs."

      "title": "Comparison With Prior Work eHealth Use for Patient Communication",
      "text": "Our finding that GPs only used eHealth one way is in alignment with a recent study including interviews with 3 GPs and 9 other health care professionals, demonstrating that GPs and health care professionals most often used eHealth by recommending websites, even though they saw eHealth enabling patients to participate in balanced two-way conversations in face-to-face consultations  [15] .\n\nThe lack of more advanced eHealth use can both be due to patients' preconception of what they expect from their GP as well as GPs' reluctance in using new technology. Bowes et al  [16]  found that patients who had found information on the internet prioritized the opinion from their doctor higher than information found on the internet, except when the doctors were disinterested, dismissive, or patronizing. Then, the doctor-patient relationship was damaged, and patients would seek information from alternative routes. Creating space for eHealth in GPs' patient communication is a two-way street. A Danish study suggests that GPs have a fundamental different perspective of what digital interaction can be used for compared with patients' perspective. Patients often expected a dialogue with room for discussion, whereas GPs mostly saw e-consultation as a tool for short closed information, which might be due to a lower remuneration for e-consultations for the GPs compared with face-to-face consultations  [17] . Furthermore, GPs often have a strong relationship with their patients, which we anticipate could be of importance for developing new collaborating eHealth solutions, where adherence to agreed treatment based on an existing relationship is often an issue  [18] . Studies have shown that quality of both websites and apps vary  [16, 19] , which might also play a role in the GPs lack of eHealth use in addition to the GPs explaining that it was difficult to know what to recommend. Generally, however, along with other studies, we also found that GPs as health professionals are positive to the use of eHealth solutions  [15, 20] . All GPs in our study underestimated the patients' wish for lifestyle advice  [1] . One of the main challenges seems to be to fit eHealth and lifestyle talks into the known workflow, highlighting that competing priorities might be one of the major obstacles  [15, 21] . Asynchronous e-consultations have been used for more than 10 years by GPs in Denmark, and concerns of security of data were only raised by one GP, a concern that seemed to be more prominent in other studies  [22] ."

GPs found that eHealth monitoring through measurable outcomes helped them to set realistic goals and reminded them of how even small steps could help them live healthier in accordance with studies looking into a number of behavioral change techniques used in eHealth  [24] . GPs also explained how patients gave them ideas to use different apps for benefiting their own health. A trend that was also noted in an English study on the role of GPs, finding that this could be understood in an Eliasian framework as the functional-democratization of patient-doctor relations via civilizing processes  [25] . As a GP, you have to take up different roles. An Australian study from 2016 has described how GPs on help lines not being able to see patients face to face have to take a new role  [26] . A total of 9 out of the 10 GPs wanted to live healthier, and eHealth solutions gave the GPs the opportunity as private persons to live healthier. GPs experienced that being supported both from family and peers mattered. Maybe GPs when discussing lifestyle with patients should take a new role and discuss GPs as human beings also have to make lifestyle choices on a daily basis to stay healthy, mainly because it opens for a respectful empathic dialogue, which is important for patients' long-term successful lifestyle improvement  [8] ."

The GPs told how they used coaching techniques such as motivational interviewing to set realistic goals, focusing on measurable outcomes, overcoming structural barriers, and having patients commit to concrete realistic contracts using pen and paper  [23] . GPs expressed the will to assist patients in healthy lifestyle choices and deep reflection monitored through PROM delivered via eHealth. Studies show that PROM data could be supported by algorithms based on eHealth  [29]  and through patient-centered care  [30, 31] , giving space for the patient to act. Adding machine learning or artificial intelligence to PROM data could potentially strengthen the GPs' ability to assist patients cost efficiently in conjunction with other health care professionals, which is being tested in specific patient groups  [32] , but will need substantially more research."

Another limitation is that we only interviewed GPs. Data from patients could have revealed other aspects of the GPs' role in assisting patients' lifestyle change."

      "text": "GPs used eHealth for their own health but did not translate that into lifestyle change guidance for their patients, although they had been inspired themselves from discussions with patients. eHealth has the potential to become an important tool for the GPs in future work to improve the health of their patients. Education is needed, remuneration structures may need to be revisited, and more research is needed on how GPs can become active in developing behavioral change eHealth solutions that will create the future framework for collaboration among general practice, local authorities, and patients."
