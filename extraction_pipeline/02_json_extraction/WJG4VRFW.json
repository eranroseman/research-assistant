  "title": "A Mega-Study of Text-Based Nudges Encouraging Patients to Get Vaccinated at an Upcoming Doctor's Appointment",
  "abstract": "Many Americans fail to get life-saving vaccines each year, and the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 makes the challenge of encouraging vaccination more urgent than ever. We present a large field experiment (N=47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were (a) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and (b) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor's appointment and indicated it was reserved for them. This successful script could be used as a template for campaigns to encourage the adoption of life-saving vaccines, including against COVID-19. same population on the same outcome. We conducted our study in fall 2020 in partnership with two large health systems in the Northeastern United States: Penn Medicine and Geisinger Health. We included all patients with new or routine (non-sick) primary care appointments at Penn Medicine between September 24, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and at Geisinger Health between September 28, 2020 and December 31, 2020 who met the following eligibility criteria: (1) they had a cell phone number recorded in their electronic health record, (2) they had not opted out of receiving SMS appointment reminders from their healthcare provider or asked not to be contacted for research purposes, (3) they did not have a documented allergy or adverse reaction to the flu vaccine and (4) they had not yet received a flu shot in 2020 according to their electronic health record. 1  Twenty-six behavioral scientists worked in small teams to generate 19 different text messaging protocols. Protocols varied the contents and/or timing of up to two sets of text reminders to get a flu shot sent from the patient's healthcare provider in the three days preceding the patient's appointment. All intervention message content is included in SI Appendix.",

      "text": "According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, only 60% of Americans plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine  (1) . To make matters worse, past research suggests that many who say they intend to get vaccinated will not follow through  (2) . Experts have estimated that to reach herd immunity, 60-90% of Americans must be inoculated against the novel coronavirus  (3, 4, 5) . Evidence-based strategies that can be rapidly deployed at scale to encourage vaccination are urgently needed.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 differs from the flu in many ways, both are deadly respiratory diseases with an available vaccine that many Americans choose not to get. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that every American over 6 months old receive a flu shot  (6)  because inoculation typically reduces the chances of contracting the flu by at least 50%  (7) . Yet, less than half of Americans were vaccinated during the 2019-20 influenza season  (8) , and an estimated 35,000 died from the flu  (9) .\n\nIt may be possible to move the needle on vaccination against the flu (and, hopefully, COVID-19 as well) with simple, low-cost nudges  (10) . For instance, we know that prompting people to consider and jot down the exact date and time when they will get a flu shot at a workplace clinic makes vaccination more likely (11); that defaulting people into vaccination appointments is effective  (12) ; that mailings designed to leverage behavioral science insights can increase immunization  (13) ; and that simply reminding high risk individuals to get vaccinated increases inoculation rates  (14) .\n\nIn this paper, we test 19 different nudges delivered to patients via text message, all designed to boost adoption of the flu vaccine."

      "text": "To identify whether and how text messaging interventions could be used to boost vaccination rates at routine primary care visits, we ran a mega-study-a field experiment in which many interventions developed by different teams of scientists were tested in the 4 Following our pre-registration, we evaluated whether participants received a flu shot on the date of their scheduled appointment or in the three days leading up to it (i.e., when treatments had begun) using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and pooling data from Penn Medicine and Geisinger. The primary predictors in our regression were 19 indicator variables-one for assignment to each of our study's 19 experimental conditions (with an indicator omitted for assignment to our study's usual care control condition). Our pre-registered OLS regression included the following control variables:  (1)  an indicator for being a Penn Medicine patient, (2) patient age, (3) indicators for patient race/ethnicity, (4) indicators for patient gender,  (5)  an indicator for whether the patient received a flu shot last year,  (6)  indicators for the type of clinician who saw the patient, and  (7)  the linear and squared days separating the patient's target primary care appointment from the start of our study (September 20, 2020, when the first participants were enrolled).\n\nIn our usual care control group, 42% of patients received a flu vaccine on the day of their scheduled appointment or in the three days before it. As Figure  1  shows, 6 out of our 19 interventions (32%) produced a statistically significant boost in vaccinations (twosided unadjusted p's < 0.05), and all of our interventions directionally increased vaccination rates. The 19 treatments boosted vaccination levels by an average of 2.1 percentage points or 5% (p = 0.024), and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all 19 effects have the same true value (Chi-sq = 21.277, df = 18, p = 0.266)..\n\nTo account for multiple comparisons, we report not only standard errors, twosided p-values and 95% confidence intervals, but also q-values (see Web Appendix). Since each of the six effects significant at \u03b1 = 0.05 has a q-value lower than 0.02, the expected proportion of false positives among estimates at least as extreme as the sixth largest is less than 2%  (15) . Using the harmonic mean method to compute the metaanalytic p-value from our study, we find that the probability of observing the 19 results depicted in Figure  1  given that they are all true nulls is < 0.0055.\n\nThe top-performing intervention in our study showed a 4.6 percentage point boost in vaccination (an 11% increase; p < 0.01) at the cost of sending two text messages (less than a dime). Correcting for likely inflation in the largest out of 19 estimates, we calculate a more conservative estimate of the true effect to be a 2.8 percentage point boost in vaccination or a 6.7% increase from baseline (see SI Appendix and Web Appendix). As shown in Figure  S1  in the Web Appendix, the first text message in this condition, sent 72 hours before the patient's appointment, noted that \"it's flu season,\" \"a flu vaccine is available for you,\" and \"a vaccine reminder\" would be sent before the appointment. The second text in this condition, sent 24 hours before the appointment, stated simply that \"this is a reminder that a flu vaccine has been reserved for your appointment.\" This intervention was the top-performer among both Penn Medicine and Geisinger patients.\n\nWhich attributes correlate best with intervention effectiveness? In post-hoc analyses, we found that interventions performed better when they were (a) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient (\u03b2= .41, p = .05) and (b) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive) (\u03b2= .48, p < .03). See SI Appendix and Web Appendix for details on how messages were rated and, next, classified using principal components analysis. Notably, some of the most artful interventions (e.g., one including a joke about spreading the flu told by a dog to a cat and conveyed in picture form) were among the least effective.\n\nIn secondary analyses, we examined how treatment effects differed across different subpopulations studied (see Web Appendix). In general, we found that estimated treatment effects across conditions did not differ significantly whether we looked at patients from Penn Medicine or Geisinger, patients who identified as male or female, patients who were 65+ versus under 65 years old, patients who did or did not receive a flu shot in the 2019-2020 flu season, or patients who had appointments with physicians versus other types of clinicians (all p's > 0.375). There were some significant differences in treatment effect estimates by patient race, suggesting tailoring communications on this dimension could be valuable, but our attribute analyses yielded nearly identical results for White and non-White patients.\n\nOverall, our findings show nudges sent via text messages to patients prior to a primary care visit and developed by behavioral scientists to encourage vaccine adoption can substantially boost vaccination rates at close to zero marginal cost. Our bestperforming message, which increased adoption by an estimated 11%, reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor's appointment and mentioned that a shot was reserved for them. Although the factors influencing the adoption of vaccines for other diseases, including COVID-19, differ in important ways, this successful script could potentially be repurposed."

      "text": "Participant enrollment. Adult patients (N = 48,688) at Penn Medicine and Geisinger were automatically enrolled in the study if they had an eligible primary care appointment scheduled during the study period. Eligible appointments were in-person, non-sick visits with the patient's primary care provider (who was a physician, resident, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant).\n\nPatients were ineligible for this study if they:\n\n1. Had received their 2020-2021 flu shot prior to their first eligible appointment (as documented in their medical record), 2. Had a documented allergy or adverse reaction to the flu shot, 3. Did not have a cell phone number on file, or 4. Had previously opted out of receiving appointment reminders or had asked not to be contacted for research purposes.\n\nPatient enrollment and randomization occurred four days prior to their first eligible appointment during the study period. The earliest intervention messages were sent three days prior to patients' scheduled appointments. See the section of this document entitled Intervention Messages for the exact content of the messages and when messages were sent in each study condition.\n\nA number of patients with eligible appointments were not enrolled in our study. First, a total of 670 patients were assigned to an experimental condition but did not receive any intervention messages due to technical malfunctions. These patients are excluded from analyses since they were, for all practical purposes, not a part of our study. Another 712 patients canceled their appointments on the same day they were enrolled (four days prior to their appointment), which was before messages were sent in any condition.  1 These patients are also excluded from analyses since, again, they were not able to experience an intervention condition.\n\nPatients who canceled their appointment less than four days in advance (N=10,978), did not show up their appointment (N=3,648), or converted their appointments to telemedicine visits (N=907) were included in our analyses given that they could have already received intervention messages by the time they changed their plans. If these patients rescheduled their original appointment or scheduled a new appointment during the study period (N=4,515), their intervention messages were re-started prior to their new appointment (i.e., up to three days prior to the new appointment). Patients at Penn Medicine stopped receiving messages as soon as they canceled or changed their appointment; patients at Geisinger who canceled or changed their appointments received messages for the remainder of the day.\n\nEnrollment began on September 20, 2020 (for appointments on September 24, 2020) at Penn Medicine and September 25, 2020 (for appointments on September 29, 2020) at Geisinger.\n\nfoot_6  Consistent with our pre-registration, this paper analyzes data collected through December 31, 2020 (our first study endpoint). However, as noted in our pre-registration, we also plan to analyze additional data collected in 2021. Specifically, following our pre-registration, we will analyze data again when 1) we have successfully recruited 4,000 people per experimental condition or 2) we reach March 31, 2021whichever comes first. We will also analyze all data collected through March 31, 2021, no matter what. Power calculations. At least 2,295 patients were assigned to each study condition (average: N = 2,365.4; median: N = 2,367). Power calculations indicate that we have 90% power to detect a difference of 4.8 percentage points in vaccination rates across conditions (two-tailed \u03b1 = 0.05). Randomization. Once enrolled, patients were randomly assigned to a study condition with stratification by (1) site (Geisinger vs. Penn Medicine), (2) age at the time of appointment (18-64 vs. 65+), and (3) vaccination receipt in the 2019-2020 flu season as recorded in medical records (yes vs. no/unknown)."

      "title": "c. The Interventions",
      "text": "The mega-study included 19 different experimental conditions designed by 26 behavioral scientists from the BCFG Scientific Team, the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit, and the Geisinger Behavioral Insights Team. The interventions were designed as eight self-contained experiments, each with its own comparison condition that could be analyzed separately. All experimental conditions were randomized simultaneously to allow us to analyze the effectiveness of different interventions across studies (and compared to a control condition that did not receive a flu shot nudge). Altogether, these 19 different experimental conditions and 1 holdout control condition were launched simultaneously at both Penn Medicine and Geisinger in September 2020. All experimental conditions were designed to increase flu shot vaccinations and were delivered via text message (SMS).\n\nPatients in the holdout control condition received only the standard appointment SMS reminders from their health system, indicating the date, time, and location of their appointments. These reminders were sent two business days prior to appointments at Penn Medicine, and one week, three days, and one day prior to appointments at Geisinger.\n\nIn all 19 experimental conditions in our mega-study, patients were sent intervention text messages in addition to the standard health system appointment reminders. Interventions varied the content of the text messages patients received and could include interactive components (e.g., Y/N questions with branching messaging determined by patient responses), links to external videos and surveys, variable numbers of messages (up to two, unless patients opted in to receive additional messages), and the timing of text messages (which could be sent as early as three days prior to a scheduled appointment and as late as 15 minutes prior to the appointment). Complete information about the study stimuli in each condition is detailed in the Intervention Messages section of this document."

Our primary dependent variable is a binary measure of whether patients received a flu shot at or in the three days before their appointment (following assignment to experimental conditions), as recorded in their electronic health records.\n\nFor the primary dependent variable of whether patients received a flu shot at or before their appointment, we counted all flu shots that occurred during patients' \"intervention window.\" We define this as the time during which patients could have received intervention messages through the date of their appointment. For patients who went to their appointment as scheduled, the intervention window began three days prior to their scheduled appointment and ended on the date of their appointment. If patients rescheduled their appointment after the start of their intervention window, the intervention window extended from three days prior to the original appointment through the date of the new appointment. Patients who canceled their appointments during their intervention window and did not reschedule were included in our analyses (the conclusion of their intervention window was defined based on the date of the canceled appointment).\n\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Following our pre-registration, we ran an ordinary least squares regression (OLS) to predict whether a given patient received a flu shot at or in the three days prior to their target appointment (a binary indicator variable).  3 The primary predictor variables in our regression were 19 indicators for assignment to each of the study's 19 experimental conditions (an indicator for the holdout control condition, which was the reference group in our regression, was omitted). Our regression controlled for the study site, individual patient characteristics including age, race, and gender, flu shot receipt in the previous flu season (2019-20), the type of provider who saw the patient, and the linear and squared number of days elapsed since the start of the study. See Table  S1  in the Web Appendix ( https://bit.ly/2YeummU ).\n\nWe also examined whether the effects of our treatments varied for patients from Penn Medicine or Geisinger (see Table  S2  in the Web Appendix), patients who identified as male or female (see Table  S3  in the Web Appendix), patients who were 65+ versus under 65 years old (see Table  S4  in the Web Appendix), patients who did and did not receive a flu shot in the 2019-2020 flu season (see Table  S5  in the Web Appendix), patients who identified as White versus patients who identified with another race/ethnicity (see Table  S6  in the Web Appendix), and patients who saw physicians at their primary care appointment versus patients who saw other clinicians (see Table  S7  in the Web Appendix). For each of these subgroup analyses, in addition to running separate regressions for the subgroups, we also ran a model where we interacted the indicator for the subgroup variable of interest (e.g., an indicator for identifying as White, an indicator for identifying as male) with all of the other covariates in our model. We then tested the joint hypothesis that all the interaction terms between the subgroup variable and the 19 experimental conditions are 0. Except for the comparison between White and non-white patients, none of the F-tests were significant (Penn vs. Geisinger: F = 0.543, p = 0.945; male vs. female: F = 0.820, p = 0.686; age 18-64 vs. age > 64: F = 1.017, p = 0.437; did take the flu shot in the 2019-2020 flu season vs. did not take the flu shot in the 2019-2020 flu season: F = 1.070, p = 0.375; White vs. Non-White: F = 1.729, p = 0.025; appointment with a physician vs. other clinicians: F = 0.850, p = 0.647). This suggests that our treatment effects are fairly consistent across different subgroups.\n\nComputation of 95% Confidence Intervals. The 95% confidence intervals are computed in the standard approach as  \u0302\u00b1  2.5%  \u0302 \u0302 using the estimated treatment effects () \u0302 and standard errors ( \u0302 \u0302) as reported in Table  S1  of the Web Appendix. The standard errors are obtained from the HC1 heteroskedasticity-consistent estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of regression coefficients  (2) . We use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors rather than traditional OLS standard errors because the latter do not account for the fact that random shocks in linear probability models are always heteroskedastic.\n\nComputation of q-values. The q-value of a particular estimated effect is the expected proportion of false positives incurred when calling that effect significant. Whereas the pvalue of an estimate is typically described as the expected proportion of estimates at least as extreme as the current one given that the true effect is null, the q-value of an estimate can be described as the expected proportion of false positives occurring among estimates given that they are at least as extreme as the current one (see  Storey & Tibshirani 2003, pp . 9442 and 9444-9445)(3). We computed the q-values using the qvalue R package (4), with the default smoother for choosing tuning parameters.\n\nAssessing possible inflation in the estimated effect of the top performing intervention. Even though a priori the estimate of each effect is unbiased, knowing that an effect is the maximum raises the concern that its expected measurement error is positive rather than zero, such that ( \u0302) > . We therefore conduct two additional analyses on the effect size of the top performing intervention.\n\nFirst, we conduct a\n\nGrubbs test (5) of the null hypothesis that the effect size of the top performing intervention follows the same Normal distribution as the effect sizes of the other 18 interventions. Second, we compute the expected value of the maximum out of  = 19 effects when they are all Normally distributed with mean  = 0.0212 and standard deviation  = 0.0099, which are the sample mean and standard deviation of the 19 point estimates. [( 1 , . . . ,   ) |   \u223c (, )] =  +  1,  Where  1, is the shift due to selecting the maximum out of  standard Normally distributed values, which equals 1.84448 for  = 19 (6). The value of the observed maximum corrected for the upward shift equals ( 1 , . . . ,   ) - 1, .\n\nCode and data availability. The data analyzed in this paper were provided by the Geisinger and Penn Medicine health systems. We do not have legal permission to publicly post individual-level data on vaccinations that we received from our healthcare system partners because our partners consider this to be sensitive health data. Data containing individuallevel health information is typically not made publicly available to protect patient privacy (as even if the data are de-identified, it is still possible to re-identify patients from de-identified data). To be as transparent as possible while protecting patient confidentiality, we have posted aggregated data and all of our analysis scripts, done with R and SAS, at  https://bit.ly/2YeummU . Researchers interested in using individual-level data to replicate our results should contact Behavior Change for Good (bcfg@wharton.upenn.edu) and must sign the same data non-disclosure agreement to access the data on a protected medical server."

      "text": "To explore underlying characteristics that are more vs. less predictive of intervention efficacy, we conducted the following exploratory (i.e., not pre-registered) steps. First, we recruited naive raters from Prolific to rate attributes on 5 subjective dimensions (see Participants and Methods below). Separately, we coded attributes on 12 objective dimensions (see Methods below). We then analyzed bivariate correlations between each of these 17 attributes and intervention efficacy (see Results: Correlational Analysis in the Web Appendix). To account for non-independence of attribute ratings, we identified a smaller number of attribute dimensions by performing principal component analysis (see Results: Principal Components Analysis in the Web Appendix). Specifically, considering attributes with at least a medium-sized (r > .25) relationship with efficacy, we used principal components analysis to capture underlying dimensions of covarying attributes and then assessed the relationship between these dimensions and efficacy in a simultaneous OLS regression predicting efficacy."

Participants received $0.60 in exchange for completing our short survey. We included an attention check question (\"How many words are in this sentence?\") in between our main survey task and our demographics questions, following best practices for online surveys outlined by Mason and Suri (2016). We dropped the following participants from our analysis: (a) 6 participants with duplicate IP addresses, (b) 72 remaining participants who incorrectly answered our attention check question, and (c) 65 remaining participants who did not fully complete our survey, leaving us with 2,071 study participants (MAge=46.9; SD=9.59); 48.6% male; 84.4% White/Caucasian, 5.5% Black, 5.0% Asian,, 3.6% Hispanic, 1.3% Other, and less than 1% for each of American Indian / Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander."

These statements, presented in randomized order, include: \"Receiving this set of text messages would put me in a positive mood.\" (positive mood); \"Receiving this set of text messages would put me in a negative mood.\" (negative mood); \"This set of text messages seems to assume that I already intend to get my flu shot. The messages are just a reminder.\" (reminder); \"This set of text messages has a casual, informal tone.\" (casualness); and \"I would be surprised to get these sorts of text messages from my doctor or health system.\" (surprise factor). Participants rated one and only one intervention.\n\nOn the next screen, participants completed our attention check. They were then asked whether they got a flu shot during the a) 2019-2020 flu season and b) 2020-2021 flu season. Finally, we collected self-reported demographic information (age, gender, race, ethnicity, highest level of education achieved, and country of residence).\n\nCoding of Objective Attributes. We examined twelve objective attributes of our text message interventions. Three attributes coded readability of the first text message in an intervention set using the editor function in Microsoft Word: word count, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, and Flesch-Kincaid reading ease. A fourth attribute indicated whether a given intervention condition had been designed as a control condition in the self-contained studies (control condition). Coding of eight additional attributes assessed the following features of all text messages in an intervention: 21 the presence of an exclamation mark (exclamation mark); whether the messages explicitly said a flu shot was \"reserved for you\" (reserved for you); the number of discrete text messages sent by the health system (message count); the time between a patient's appointment and the last text message sent (hours before appointment); 22 the number of verbs using the imperative tense (excluding standard opt-out instructions, e.g., \"remember to\u2026,\" imperative); the number of verbs using the interrogative tense (e.g., \"did you\u2026,\" interrogative); The inclusion of an image or a link to multimedia (multimedia); and whether the recipient was asked to take an action such as texting back, clicking a link, or sharing the text message with others, excluding standard opt-out instructions (interactive). 21 Where intervention language slightly differed between the Geisinger and Penn Medicine channels, we used the Geisinger language for consistency, as the stimuli mocked up for our Prolific coders all used Geisinger as the use case. 22 When the last set of messages in a text messaging intervention came at 6pm the evening before the patient's scheduled appointment, we took the average of 14 hours and 24 hours (i.e., 19 hours), assuming that their appointment would most likely be between 8am and 6pm.\n\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

F-tests were then conducted for the beta coefficients from the regressions to compare the overall significance across treatment groups. As shown in Table  S8 , study arms were well-balanced on age, gender, race, health system, and vaccination history (p-values from all F-tests > 0.05).\n\nTable  S8 . Summary of patient characteristics overall, at different health systems, and in our control versus intervention groups. F-Test p-values are based on pairwise comparisons of the 19 study conditions to the control group in our mega-study to compare the overall significance across treatment groups using the regression models described above. Additionally, to summarize across all categories of race and clinician overseeing the appointment, we analyzed these balance variables using design-based F-tests."

In addition, we examined the effects of our experimental conditions on patients' likelihood of showing up to their scheduled appointments (Table  S10 ). Our top-performing intervention does boost the rate at which patients show up for their appointments, and we see a moderate (but insignificant) correlation between the estimated impact of our interventions on flu vaccine take up and showing up for an appointment (r = 0.34; p = 0.15). Our interventions may work in part by increasing the likelihood that patients will attend their appointments.\n\nTable  S9 .

Table  S11  shows that in addition to the usual care control condition, the top performing experimental condition significantly outperformed over half of the other experimental conditions.\n\nWe performed several additional Wald tests. First, we tested that the average treatment effect across all 19 interventions was different from zero. The average effect was 0.02127 (SE = 0.00939, p = 0.02357). Second, we tested the null hypothesis that all 19 effects have the same true value (Chi-sq = 21.277, df = 18, p = 0.266). Third, we tested the contrast between the average effect of the top 6 interventions and the average effect of the bottom 13. The difference was 0.01605 (SE = 0.00453, p = 0.00040). Fourth, we tested the difference between the effect of the top performing intervention and the average effect of the other 18 interventions. The difference was 0.02644 (SE = 0.00939, p = 0.00486). Note, the third and fourth tests involve hypotheses that are formulated only after the treatment effects were estimated and ranked.\n\nConsequently the true differences are likely smaller than the estimated differences reported here.\n\nAs described in SI Appendix, we assess the risk of inflation using a Grubbs test and computing a corrected value for the estimate of the top performing intervention. The null hypothesis that the top performing effect comes from the same Normal distribution as the other effects is rejected at p = 0.05218. This suggests that the top performer is indeed different from the others. The expected upward shift due to selecting the maximum out of 19 estimates equals 0.0183. This results in an expected maximum value of 0.0395 which is still smaller than the actual observed value of 0.0463. Alternatively, correcting the observed maximum for the upward shift results in a revised estimate of 0.0280 which is still larger than the observed mean of 0.0212.\n\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

These statements, presented in randomized order, include: \"Receiving this set of text messages would put me in a positive mood.\" (positive mood); \"Receiving this set of text messages would put me in a negative mood.\" (negative mood); \"This set of text messages seems to assume that I already intend to get my flu shot.

Participants rated one and only one intervention.\n\nOn the next screen, participants completed our attention check. They were then asked whether they got a flu shot during the a) 2019-2020 flu season and b) 2020-2021 flu season. Finally, we collected self-reported demographic information (age, gender, race, ethnicity, highest level of education achieved, and country of residence).\n\nCoding of Objective Attributes. We examined twelve objective attributes of our text message interventions. Three attributes coded readability of the first text message in an intervention set using the editor function in Microsoft Word: word count, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, and Flesch-Kincaid reading ease. A fourth attribute indicated whether a given intervention condition had been designed as a control condition in the self-contained studies (control condition). Coding of eight additional attributes assessed the following features of all text messages in an intervention: 2 the presence of an exclamation mark (exclamation mark); whether the messages explicitly said a flu shot was \"reserved for you\" (reserved for you); the number of discrete text messages sent by the health system (message count); the time between a patient's appointment and the last text message sent (hours before appointment); 3 the number of verbs using the imperative tense (excluding standard opt-out instructions, e.g., \"remember to\u2026,\" imperative); the number of verbs using the interrogative tense (e.g., \"did you\u2026,\" interrogative); The inclusion of an image or a link to multimedia (multimedia); and whether the recipient was asked to take an action such as texting back, clicking a link, or sharing the text message with others, excluding standard opt-out instructions (interactive)."

Paired correlations between the ratings of intervention attributes as well as our estimate of intervention efficacy, for our 19 text messaging interventions\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis. Because intervention attributes were not linearly independent (see correlations in Table  S14 ), we used principal components analysis to extract dimensions of correlated attributes among a subset of the attributes coded. Specifically, given our limited degrees of freedom, we set a cutoff of attributes with medium sized (i.e., r > 0.25) associations with efficacy in Table  S14 : surprise factor, interactive, casualness, reminder, and reserved for you.\n\nAs shown in Figure  S2 , a scree plot and parallel analysis (i.e., the scree plot of simulated data from 10,001 reshufflings of the same data) indicated a two-component solution. Specifically, the slope of the scree plot levels off after two dimensions and, in addition, the cross-over point is between two and three dimensions. The first and second components explained 38.90% and 31.51% of the variance in the ratings, respectively. The loadings from the principal components analysis with an oblique promax rotation of this subset of five attributes are shown in Table  S15 . We interpreted Component 1 as incongruence with typical health provider messaging (i.e., surprising, interactive, casual) and Component 2 as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient. These components were largely independent (r = -0.03, p = 0.90). Bivariate associations with intervention efficacy were substantial for both Component 1 (\"incongruence\") (r = -0.49, p = 0.03) and Component 2 (\"reserved reminder\") (r = 0.43, p = 0.07), respectively."

First, we recruited naive raters from Prolific to rate attributes on 5 subjective dimensions (see Participants and Methods below). Separately, we coded attributes on 12 objective dimensions (see Methods below). We then analyzed bivariate correlations between each of these 17 attributes and intervention efficacy (see Results: Correlational Analysis below). To account for non-independence of attribute ratings, we identified a smaller number of attribute dimensions by performing principal component analysis (see Results: Principal Components Analysis below). Specifically, considering attributes with at least a medium-sized (r > .25) relationship with efficacy, we used principal components analysis to capture underlying dimensions of covarying attributes and then assessed the relationship between these dimensions and efficacy in a simultaneous OLS regression predicting efficacy."
