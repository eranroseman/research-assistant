  "title": "Incorporating Health Behavior Theory into mHealth: an Examination of Weight Loss, Dietary, and Physical Activity Interventions",
  "abstract": "Health behavior interventions are effective for many modifiable lifestyle behaviors. In some cases, remotely-delivered behavioral interventions, particularly those that include some form of contact with a clinician and strong behavioral strategies, have been shown to be as effective as traditional in-person interventions; they are also more flexible, disseminable, and cost-effective. With ubiquitous increases in mobile phone use, opportunities for remote delivery of health interventions (mHealth) have grown exponentially, particularly in the use of behavioral smartphone applications. Despite research suggesting that mHealth interventions can be effective at initiating and maintaining behavior changes, many mHealth interventions are not theoretically-based, and evidence-based behavioral strategies are not often adapted into the mobile format. Thus, there is a need for clear summaries of behavioral change theories and examples of theoretically driven behavioral strategies to unify and improve the field of mHealth. The authors review the existing literature on theories of behavior change, intervention, and systems for evaluating theoretical content. Specifically, the authors briefly summarize both traditional and contemporary theories of behavior change, evidencebased behavioral strategies, and the methods for evaluating the degree to which they are included in existing mHealth behavioral interventions, with an emphasis on weight loss, dietary, and physical activity interventions. Authors also include examples of integration of theory into both research and clinical practice. This research highlights the importance of incorporation of theory into behavior change interventions. The authors suggest specific theoretical considerations for the development of mHealth interventions within collaborative, interdisciplinary environments, and recommend future research areas.",

      "text": "Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as poor diet, sedentarism, and smoking, account for the majority of premature deaths worldwide  (Lim et al. 2013; Mokdad et al. 2004 ) and have quickly become the leading cause of disability adjusted life years  (Murray et al. 2013) . Further, 75% of healthcare costs in the US are linked with chronic preventable diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and cancer, which have maladaptive health behaviors among their root causes  (Prevention 2004) .\n\nHealth behavior change interventions have been shown to be effective for a number of lifestyle behaviors, including smoking cessation, weight loss/dietary changes, medication adherence, physical activity, and diabetes mellitus management  (Krebs et al. 2010; Norris et al. 2001; Park et al. 2014; Parsons et al. 2007; Whittaker et al. 2016 ). These interventions are most effective when they are based on behavioral science theories and incorporate evidence-based behavioral strategies, such as self-monitoring and goal-setting  (Glanz and Bishop 2010; Webb et al. 2010) . Although most research on gold-standard behavioral interventions is based on in-person delivery models  (Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group et al. 2009; The Look AHEAD Research Group and Wing 2010; Sacks et al. 2001) , researchers have recently shown that these interventions are also effective when delivered remotely (e.g., telephone calls with a behavioral interventionist) and with the assistance of technology that is responsive to behavior change  (Appel et al. 2011; Bennett and Glasgow 2009; Duggan 2013; Krukowski et al. 2009; Pellegrini et al. 2012; White et al. 2010) . As the use of mobile phones among individuals of varying ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses expands  (Duggan 2013) , there is an increased focus on behavioral interventions delivered via mobile technology (mHealth; e.g., smartphones, wearables)  (Free et al. 2010) . Several studies have shown that mHealth interventions are effective at promoting health, including improving physical activity and dietary behaviors  (Davies et al. 2012; Free et al. 2010; Head et al. 2013; O'Reilly and Spruijt-Metz 2013; Vandelanotte et al. 2016 ). These findings have enormous public health implications because remotely delivered interventions are cost-effective, scalable, and offer flexibility to patients  (Bennett and Glasgow 2009; Krukowski et al. 2009) .\n\nStudies have consistently indicated that there is minimal inclusion of traditional behavioral change theories in exercise  (Cowan et al. 2012; Direito et al. 2014; Middelweerd et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015) , dietary  (West et al. 2013) , and weight loss  (Azar et al. 2013 ) targeted mobile applications, commonly called apps. Additionally, websites designed to improve health behaviors and text-message based interventions often contain little theoretical information  (Cole-Lewis and Kershaw 2010; DeKoekkoek et al. 2015; Doshi et al. 2003; Fischer et al. 2016; Morton et al. 2015) . Researchers have indicated that it is difficult to replicate mHealth interventions as many published studies do not detail the structure, content, or evidence base of their intervention  (DeKoekkoek et al. 2015; Morton et al. 2015) . This lack of replicability creates challenges for researchers and developers as evidence shows that messaging-based interventions are more likely to be successful when guided by behavioral theory (Cole-Lewis and Kershaw 2010). While researchers typically provide examples of behavior change strategies utilized in these interventions, few studies explicitly link their text content to empirically tested theoretical frameworks  (Haapala et al. 2009; Morton et al. 2015; Patrick et al. 2009) ."

To address these goals, we review relevant literature on theories, meta-analyses, interventions, and systems for evaluating theoretical content. We also provide examples of methods for evaluating the existence of theoretically based content in mHealth materials, particularly smartphone apps. The majority of this information is presented in Table  1  and\n\nTable 2 so that readers may more easily compare content, research support, and examples across theories. Our hope is that readers, particularly clinicians, clinical researchers, and mHealth program developers, will be better equipped to evaluate the integration of theory into technology, and therefore develop and utilize more evidence-based mHealth interventions. Although we seek to address mHealth behavioral interventions broadly, we emphasize weight loss, dietary, and physical activity interventions, as these are among the areas most represented in the literature and in existing smartphone apps that target behavior change."

      "title": "Traditional Theories of Behavior Change",
      "text": "The three traditional behavioral models that are most supported in the lifestyle intervention literature and addressed most comprehensively across systematic reviews and metaanalyses are Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Trans-Theoretical Model (TTM)  (Bandura 1998; Bish et al. 2000; Buchan et al. 2012; Chung and Fong 2015; Noar et al. 2007; Noar et al. 2008; Painter et al. 2008; Rothman 2000; Webb et al. 2010; Webb and Sheeran 2006) . These theories are described in greater depth in Table  1 , including how they connect to research and practice. Briefly, SCT focuses on the relationships among the person, environment, and behavior, and suggests that while we judge and model behavior based on the surrounding environment, and thus benefit from positive social support, execution of a behavior is contingent upon self-efficacy (i.e., one's confidence in his/her ability to perform or engage in a certain behavior)  (Bandura 1997 ). In the TPB, an individual first needs a Bbehavioral intention^(based on attitudes and perceived norms), and second must believe s/he has the ability to perform a behavior in order for a behavior to occur  (Ajzen 1991) . Lastly, the TTM includes multiple components (e.g., decisional balance, self-efficacy, processes of change, stages of change), and is the most widely researched theory of behavior change  (Prochaska et al. 2008) . According to the TTM, behavior change is more successful when change processes (e.g., consciousness raising) are applied frequently according to an individual's stage of change, wherein stages reflect attitudes, intentions, and behaviors related to an individual's readiness for change  (Prochaska et al. 2008) .\n\nIt is important to note that the Health Belief Model (HBM), which postulates that perceived severity and likelihood of a disease or negative outcome and perceived barriers are determinants of whether a person adopts a healthy behavior  (Janz and Becker 1984) , is also widely discussed in the behavioral literature. However, recent research indicates that interventions using the HBM have smaller effect sizes than interventions that -Behavior change is contingent upon the concept of self-efficacy, or an individual's belief that he or she has the ability to perform a task or reach a goal  (Bandura 1986 (Bandura , 1997) )  -Self-efficacy is developed through a) setting reasonable and attainable behavioral goals, and b) modeling.\n\n-When an individual can see the step-by-step process of engaging in a behavior, it makes that behavior more understandable, and therefore more replicable. -The SCT is highly supported by research in health behavior change  (Stacey et al. 2015; Young et al. 2014 ).\n\n-Promoting and increasing self-efficacy is important in behavior change  (Olander et al. 2013 ).\n\n-Increases in self-efficacy in the first 6 months of an exercise program most strongly predicted exercise adherence for the next 6 months  (Brassington et al. 2002 ).\n\n-In a 5-month intervention program, self-efficacy was the best predictor of PA maintenance, and social support was the best predictor of self-efficacy  (Duncan and McAuley 1993) .\n\n-Improvements in self-efficacy were related to better outcomes in a treatment program designed to improve exercise and healthy eating  (Annesi and Tennant 2013) .\n\nClinical consideration: Encourage patient to include family/friends in behavior change goals, for example exercising together, discussing exercise plans to increase accountability, and bringing family members or friends to appointments. Encourage patients to set goals that are realistic and attainable.\n\nResearch design consideration: Assess participants' social support from family and friends for specific behaviors; build support into interventions, (e.g., in-person support groups, social media groups, monthly group activities, companion app, buddy-systems); assess self-efficacy as a potential mediator of behavior change."

      "title": "Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)",
      "text": "-The TPB is an extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), which states that attitudes toward a behavior and related subjective norms (i.e., one's perception of what the norms for that behavior are -influenced by spouses, friends, etc.) make up one's behavioral intention (readiness to perform a behavior), which then leads to an actual behavior  (Ajzen 1991 ).\n\n-TPB added perceived behavioral control to the TRA, stating that perceived behavioral control is also important in the development of a behavioral intention. Perceived behavioral control is one's perception of his or her ability to perform a particular behavior (Ajzen 1991) -All the variables in the TPB (attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control) are uniquely important in producing behavior change.\n\n-Of the three variables in this model, perceived behavioral control is the most important in determining actual behavioral intentions, including intentions to exercise, eat healthily, and maintain weight  (French et al. 2013; Gardner and Hausenblas 2006; McConnon et al. 2012; Neipp et al. 2015; Payne et al. 2004; Schifter and Ajzen 1985) .\n\nClinical consideration: Suggest small, manageable changes to diet or activity to produce more long-term changes (e.g., take the stairs at work, use a bathroom far from your desk) and encourage patients to verbalize (or record) intentions to increase accountability.\n\nResearch design consideration: Intervention could build in tailored degree of difficulty to help participants gain control over small changes over time (e.g., 5000 steps per day, then 7500, then 10,000). Build in social networking capabilities to allow users to see others' progress.\n\nTrans-Theoretical Model/Stages of Change (TTM/SOC) -The SOC includes 3 core dimensions: processes, stages, and levels of change  (Prochaska and Norcross 2010) , though the majority of research validating and utilizing this theory focuses solely on stages of change (SOC)  (Prochaska 2013 ).\n\n-Processes are covert or overt activities that people engage in to alter emotions, thinking, behavior, or relationships related to particular problems or patterns of living.\n\n-In SOC, people fall along one of 5 stages in relation to an identified health behavior  (Prochaska and DiClemente 1982) , though stages are nonlinear. If change is initially unsuccessful, individuals will recycle back into earlier stages.\n\n-Stages of change are as follows  (Adams and White 2003; Marshall and Biddle 2001; Nguyen et al. 1997 ):\n\n\u2022 Precontemplation = no intent -Behavioral weight loss based on SOC has been successful  (Mastellos et al. 2014 ).\n\n-The stages in the SOC are unique and generally supported by the majority of studies  (Marshall and Biddle 2001) .\n\n-SOC-based interventions may be more beneficial for promoting short-term change than long-term adherence  (Adams and White 2003 ).\n\n-Self-efficacy is critical for moving through stages  (Prochaska 2013 ).\n\n-Specific processes of change are more effective during particular stages of change  (Prochaska and Norcross 2010) .\n\n-There are 10 processes of change that have the most research support (Prochaska and Norcross 2010), including:\n\nClinical consideration: Identify which stage a patient is in to provide more individualized and appropriate interventions for behavior change; for example, explore ambivalence in precontemplation and contemplation, problem-solving and habit building in preparation and action, and relapse prevention in maintenance.\n\nResearch design consideration: Assess stage of change before and throughout an intervention and tailor the intervention components based on different stages (initiation of a behavior requires different skills than maintenance of a behavior).\n\ndo not adhere to any theory or interventions that use alternate theories  (Carpenter 2010; Noar et al. 2007 ). As previously mentioned, a range of behavioral theories exist; however, the SCT, TTM, and TPB are most commonly cited and supported in the lifestyle intervention and behavior change literature  (Bandura 1998; Bish et al. 2000; Buchan et al. 2012; Chung and Fong 2015; Noar et al. 2007; Noar et al. 2008; Painter et al. 2008; Rothman 2000; Webb et al. 2010; Webb and Sheeran 2006)  and are advantageous over not using any theory. A number of other traditional theories of behavior change exist, including Prospect Theory  (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Tversky and Kahneman 1992) , Protection Motivation Theory  (Maddux and Rogers 1983) , Regulatory Fit Theory  (Cesario et al. 2008; Higgins 2000) , and Self-Determination Theory  (Ryan and Deci 2000) . These theories are less widely researched and/or supported, and thus are not included herein."

      "title": "Contemporary Theories of Behavior Change",
      "text": "As mobile interventions become more interactive and adaptive, traditional behavior change theories become more limited in their ability to inform the development of mHealth  (Azar et al. 2013; Mohr et al. 2014; Riley et al. 2011) ; thus, contemporary theories have emerged. Similarly to the traditional theories, the contemporary theories are presented in greater depth in Table  2 ; however, as the research on contemporary theories is limited, we include research support that extends beyond weight loss, diet, and physical activity. The Persuasive Technology Theory (PTT) asserts that technology can impact users' behaviors and attitudes through non-coercive persuasion and social influence  (Fogg 2003) . Recent research highlights the importance of persuasive technology, defined as both human-computer interaction (i.e., interaction between humans/users and computers) and computer-mediated communication (i.e., human communication via computers in different forms, e.g., email, text-messaging, videoconferencing), in remotely delivered interventions  (Kelders, Kok, Ossebaard, & Van Gemert-Pijnen, 2012) . In their review, Kelders et al. found that particular intervention characteristics and persuasive technology elements can improve adherence, including increased interaction with a counselor, more frequent intended usage, more frequent updates and more extensive employment of dialog support  (Kelders et al. 2012 ). The Fogg Behavior Model (FBM, see Table  2 ) expands upon PTT and captures three elements of behavior change: motivation (e.g., social praise, incentives), ability (e.g., tailored information) and triggers (e.g., messages prompting re-engagement with an application, reminders to promote behavior change)  (Fogg 2009) .\n\nThe FBM further suggests that all three elements must cooccur for a behavior to happen. Similarly, Ritterband's Internet Intervention Model (RIIM) emerged in response to the lack of theory underlying existing internet-based interventions  (Ritterband et al. 2009) . Specifically, this model\n\nTable 1 (continued) Traditional Theories Description Research Support Implications \u2022 Contemplation = intent but no engagement in behavior \u2022 Preparation = occasional engagement in behavior \u2022 Action = regular engagement in behavior for <6 months \u2022 Maintenance = regular engagement in behavior for 6+ months -Levels represent a hierarchical organization of 5 distinct but interrelated levels of psychological problems that can be addressed in psychotherapy, including: 1) Symptoms/situational problems; 2) maladaptive cognitions; 3) current interpersonal conflicts; 4) family/systems conflicts; and 5) intrapersonal conflicts. Consciousness raising (education & feedback); catharsis/dramatic relief; self-reevaluation; environmental reevaluation; self-liberation; social liberation; counterconditioning; stimulus control; contingency management; helping relationship. Table 2 Detailed information on contemporary theories of behavior change. Contemporary Theories Description Research Support Implications Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) -In the FBM, behavior is based on 3 dimensions: motivation, ability, and prompts.\n\n-Motivation refers to constructs that facilitate behavior change, including sensation (pleasure vs pain), anticipation (hope vs fear), and belonging (social acceptance vs rejection).\n\n-Ability to carry out a behavior is related to both the individual's skills and resources, and the difficulty of the behavior. It is dependent upon time, money, physical effort, brain cycles (how mentally taxing a behavior is), social deviance (how socially acceptable a behavior is), and non-routine (routine behaviors are easier to perform)  (Fogg 2009 ).\n\n-Prompts (previously called triggers  (Fogg 2019 )) tell people to perform a behavior, and should be applied/initiated at the right time, such that the person has both motivation and ability present when the trigger occurs.\n\n-Researchers used the FBM, in conjunction with SCT, to design an app that triggers behavior change; participants in the app condition walked significantly more than the control group  (Rabbi et al. 2015) .\n\n-Researchers used the FBM to guide the implementation of a text based cognitive intervention for weight loss. The program improved parental knowledge about nutrition and activity and parental healthy behaviors  (Militello et al. 2016 ).\n\n-Researchers used FBM to develop a text-message based cervical cancer screening intervention in Korean American women, resulting in increased knowledge of risk and guidelines, and a reduction in perceived barriers to screening  (Lee et al. 2014) . Clinical consideration: Work with patients to improve motivation (e.g., social support, rewards) & ability (e.g., removal of barriers, skills training), and use triggers (e.g. alarms, text messages, reminders) to enhance those dimensions of behavior at times the patients are likely to perform the behaviors. Research design consideration: Interventions should include appropriate triggers at the right time (e.g., reminder to log meals at night, motivational message to exercise in morning) and should trigger behaviors that participants have the ability to complete at the time of the trigger. Ritterband Internet Intervention Model (RIIM) -According to the RIIM, when internet-based interventions are effective, they create & maintain behavior change through 9 (nonlinear) steps. -Per Ritterband et al. (page 1), Bthe user, influenced by environmental factors, affects website use and adherence, which is influenced by support and website characteristics. Website use leads to behavior change and symptom improvement through various mechanisms of change. The improvements are sustained via treatment maintenance.^(Ritterband et al. 2009) -The user is the patient, participant, or consumer, the environment is the individual's influences (e.g., family, friends, employer, community), the website is the program or application through which treatment is delivered, website use is the actual treatment/website utilization (e.g., how often a user logs into the program), support impacts adherence and ranges from emails and texts to face-to-face meetings, mechanisms of change (e.g., motivation, skill building, modeling) bring about behavior change, resulting in symptom improvement. Treatment maintenance includes some form or relapse prevention. -Research utilizing the RIIM is very limited at present, though the below studies have designed their protocols according to the theory.\n\n-An internet-based prevention program for young adults with intimate relationship problems was developed based on the RIIM, and researchers describe the role of this theory in intervention development  (Draucker et al. 2017) .\n\n-Researchers developed an intervention for increasing activity while decreasing the length of bouts of sedentary behavior. They based a mobile component of the intervention on the RIIM, with intent to increase sustained use of their mobile technology  (Fanning et al. 2018) . Clinical consideration: Work with patients to identify relevant user characteristics (e.g., severity of problem, readiness for change, expectations) and environmental factors (e.g., social support) that influence their website use, and ultimately behavior change.\n\nResearch design consideration: Interventions could be expanded to assess efficacy across delivery platforms, such as mobile phones and smart phone apps.\n\nestablishes a framework for researchers to develop and test internet interventions promoting behavior change and symptom improvement by conceptualizing, identifying, and measuring factors that influence these outcomes (e.g., user characteristics, environmental factors, website use)  (Ritterband et al. 2009) ."

      "title": "Interactions across Theories",
      "text": "While the above models have different theoretical components and explanations as to how or why behavior change occurs, they have substantial overlap and research indicates that there are interactions in how theories predict behavior. In a cross-sectional study of physical activity, researchers found that social cognitive characteristics (as defined by the SCT) differentiated stages of exercise behavior (as defined by TTM)  (Wallace et al. 2000) . In particular, the social cognitive components of exercise self-efficacy and social support for physical activity most strongly predicted the stage of behavioral change for college men and women  (Wallace et al. 2000) .\n\nSimilarly, different components of the TPB were relevant to different stages of change; in a study of physical activity in older adults  (Nguyen et al. 1997) , attitude toward exercise and subjective/social norms were most important for people in the lowest stage of change, though were less important once exercise was occurring regularly. Conversely, perceived behavioral control (self-efficacy) was a significant predictor of amount of physical activity across all of the stages of change  (Nguyen et al. 1997) .\n\nDifferent theories may also be more relevant based on the type of behavior change. Palmeira et al.  (Palmeira et al. 2007 ) designed a study to compare the effectiveness of TTM, SCT, TPB, and another less supported theory for changes in weight loss and physical activity. For weight management, TTM appeared best, with the majority of weight change due to changes in self-efficacy, followed by SCT then TPB. For physical activity, SCT was the best at creating behavior change, followed by the TTM.\n\nAlthough overlap across traditional and contemporary theories exists, including similarities between ability in FBM, self-efficacy in SCT, and perceived behavioral control in TPB, only the FBM delineates the novel construct of triggering. Appropriate triggering may be a necessary propellant to move through the stages of change. One study investigated triggers that initiate movement through stages of change for physical activity engagement and found that effective triggers differed based on an individual's stage and demographic factors  (Tai-Seale 2003) . Taken together, these findings indicate that behavioral health theories vary significantly among interventions, and that researchers and developers should incorporate theory into intervention design based on the type of behavior change desired."

      "title": "Approaches to Evaluating Theory-Based Content in mHealth",
      "text": "Several models and evaluation strategies have been designed to bridge the gap between behavioral theory and technology. The Persuasive System Designs Model (PSDM) builds on the FBM's  (Fogg 2009 ) conceptualization of persuasive technology with 28 design guidelines that are defined with software requirements and implementation examples for developing systems that can change individuals' attitudes/behaviors  (Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa 2008) . The Behavioral Intervention Technology (BIT) model  (Mohr et al. 2014)  was also created from the PSDM and FBM, and assists developers and designers in utilizing theory in their intervention content  (Mohr et al. 2014) .\n\nSimilarly, an original instrument was developed by Doshi et al. for assessing specific intervention strategies derived from four traditional theories of health behavior change (SCT, TPB, TTM & HBM) in physical activity websites  (Doshi et al. 2003) . It has established reliability and validity, and contains a list of 20 strategies that are rated on 5 different levels of interactions with users (knowledge, cognitive strategies, behavioral strategies, emotion-focused strategies, and therapeutic interventions), which results in a total possible score of 100  (Doshi et al. 2003) . Several studies  (Azar et al. 2013; Cowan et al. 2012; West et al. 2013 ) have evaluated theoretical content in mobile apps using Doshi et al.'s evaluation system, and generally have found low traditional and contemporary theoretical content in apps across health/behavior change domains. In a theory-based content analysis of mobile apps for weight management, Azar et al.  (Azar et al. 2013 ) identified a dearth of traditional theoretical content (mean score = 8.1/100). They also included a persuasive technology content survey to assess technology engagement based on key features of FBM and found limited contemporary theoretical content (31.6/100). Lister et al. also expanded upon work by Doshi  (Doshi et al. 2003)  and others  (Cowan et al. 2012; Michie et al. 2011 ) and compiled a list of 13 health behavior constructs that are specific to smartphone apps and eliminate overlapping constructs among the existing models  (Lister et al. 2014) ; this list of constructs appears to be the evaluation instrument most inclusive of various theoretical components and most simple to use. Lastly, another popular evaluation instrument is Michie et al.'s taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCT)  (Michie et al. 2013; Michie et al. 2011) . BCT taxonomy v1 is the most recent version of the taxonomy and it contains an extensive, hierarchal taxonomy of 93 consensually agreed upon, reliable, distinct BCTs, clustered into 16 groups  (Michie et al. 2013) , though it is important to note that this taxonomy does not explicitly measure theoretically driven content."

      "text": "The mHealth field has been rapidly expanding in the last decade  (Free et al. 2010) , and greater inclusion of theory into methodology is likely to lead to a number of important outcomes, including continued growth of the mHealth field and improved effectiveness of interventions. Unfortunately, current mHealth researchers and developers often do not explain their use of theory or provide examples of intervention content (e.g., content of messages). When researchers and developers do report theoretically-based intervention design, they often do not identify which intervention components are related to which theories. One reason for this problem is that the individuals or teams developing mHealth interventions are often mobile technologists and not behavioral scientists or content experts  (Roth et al. 2014) . Thus, the focus leans toward acceptability and engagement, rather than the incorporation of effective behavioral strategies. Additionally, even for behavioral scientists and experts, understanding the various behavior change theories, knowing which are most supported in the lifestyle intervention literature, and applying this knowledge to emerging field of mHealth intervention is quite an undertaking.\n\nThe models described herein are complex, and in highlighting only their main components, nuances may not have been thoroughly captured. Despite this complexity, the majority of models include self-efficacy (or a similarly defined construct), and describe it as critical for both the development and maintenance of behaviors  (Doshi et al. 2003; Lister et al. 2014) . Goal setting that is specific, achievable and builds upon past successes is one example of promoting self-efficacy in mHealth interventions. Personalization is also important across a number of models, particularly connecting with patient/participants' values, goals, successes and/or stage of change  (Doshi et al. 2003; Head et al. 2013; Krebs et al. 2010; Noar et al. 2007) . Finally, many of the models emphasize the importance of a positive social environment and healthy environmental norms in both developing and maintaining healthy behaviors  (Ajzen 1991; Bandura 1986 Bandura , 1997;; Fogg 2009) .\n\nContemporary, technology-based theories emphasize the importance of triggering for performance of new behaviors  (Azar et al. 2013) . Reminders, notifications, and feedback, whether pushed within an app, sent via text or email, or presented on a website, should be developed with these concepts in mind. Further, exploring varied mechanisms of delivery (e.g., smart phone apps, video messages, social media) may lead to increased engagement with interventions  (Naslund et al. 2016) . Research and consumer testing approaches that assess and adjust to participant/consumers' responses (e.g., micro-randomized trials  (Klasnja et al. 2015) ) are also needed. Moreover, although research has shown that behavioral interventions are most effective when they are combined with patient-centered approaches, such as motivational interviewing  (Armstrong et al. 2011; Lundahl et al. 2013; O'Halloran et al. 2014) , novel approaches are needed to assess the degree to which feedback delivered via technology impacts initiation of behavior, and perhaps even more lacking in mHealth behavioral interventions, helps sustain behavior change.\n\nIt is clear that theoretically driven interventions are more effective  (Webb et al. 2010) ; however, future research differentiating effective theoretical components is necessary. Moreover, while the presence of theoretical content is not necessarily reflective of an mHealth intervention's effectiveness, integrating more theoretical content and evidence-based techniques into interventions may increase the effectiveness of behavior change interventions. We have a greater chance than ever before to deliver interventions at the moments that matter most for influencing a person's behavior. In this evolving environment, it is critical that we remain true to well-studied behavioral theory as we learn to incorporate new technology. Well-constructed interdisciplinary teams are needed to advance the field of mHealth, and it is important for behavioral scientists, clinicians, software engineers, designers, and others to share an understanding of theories of behavior change. This shared knowledge will enable them to build mHealth technologies that are engaging and acceptable, while also impacting and contributing to sustained behavior change and better health outcomes."
