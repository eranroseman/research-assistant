  "abstract": "Aims Although some scores based on traditional statistical methods are available for risk stratification in patients hospitalized in cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), the interest of machine learning (ML) methods for risk stratification in this field is not well established. We aimed to build an ML model to predict in-hospital major adverse events (MAE) in patients hospitalized in CICU. \n Methods and results In April 2021, a French national prospective multicentre study involving 39 centres included all consecutive patients admitted to CICU. The primary outcome was in-hospital MAE, including death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock. Using 31 randomly assigned centres as an index cohort (divided into training and testing sets), several ML models were evaluated to predict in-hospital MAE. The eight remaining centres were used as an external validation cohort. Among 1499 consecutive patients included (aged 64 \u00b1 15 years, 70% male), 67 had in-hospital MAE (4.3%). Out of 28 clinical, biological, ECG, and echocardiographic variables, seven were selected to predict MAE in the training set (n = 844). Boosted cost-sensitive C5.0 technique showed the best performance compared with other ML methods [receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUROC) = 0.90, precision-recall AUC = 0.57, F1 score = 0.5]. Our ML score showed a better",

ML techniques handle the complexity of the available data optimizing predictive performance and decisionmaking in several diseases.  2, 3 In the field of cardiovascular health in recent years, ML has been shown to be of particular interest.  4, 5 ardiovascular imaging is particularly suited to these techniques because of the large amount of data to be processed, as recently studied by our working group.  6 he mortality rate for patients hospitalized in cardiac intensive care units (CICUs) has been estimated at 5-8%, which is not negligible. For the clinician, risk stratification and prediction are important to adapt clinical and biological monitoring. The ability of ML to integrate multimodal clinical, biological, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data seems of particular interest in the critical care setting.  7, 8 owever, risk stratification using ML techniques in CICU has been poorly evaluated.  9 herefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility and performance of a ML-based score, through a large multicentre registry of consecutive patients admitted to CICU, to predict in-hospital major adverse event (MAE). The performance of this ML score will then be compared with existing scores and evaluated in an external validation cohort."

The inclusion criteria were as follows: male or female patients aged \u226518 years admitted to the CICU whatever the medical reason with a written informed consent obtained at enrolment. The management of each patient was at the discretion of the treating physicians following the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

Haemodynamic was evaluated using non-invasive measurement of arterial pressure. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed systematically within the first 24 h of admission for all patients (all standardized echocardiographic parameters are presented in the Supplementary material online, Methods S3). Biological data were collected systematically upon admission, including haemoglobin, serum potassium, creatinaemia, the peak of troponin, the N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide, or B-type natriuretic peptide.\n\nThe presence of illicit drugs was determined through urine analysis using a dedicated drug assay (NarcoCheck\u00ae, Kappa City Biotech SAS, Montlu\u00e7on, France) within 2 h of admission to the CICU. The following illicit drugs will be screened for all consecutive patients: (i) cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol), including cannabis and hashish; (ii) cocaine and metabolites, including cocaine and crack; (iii) amphetamines; (iv) 3,4methylenedioxy-methylamphetamine (or ecstasy); and (v) heroin and other opioids. The NarcoCheck\u00ae urine drug assay detected the following medical psychoactive drugs: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressant drugs, methadone, and buprenorphine (see Supplementary material online, Methods S2). A standardized exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) measurement was systematically taken with a CO-Check Pro device (Micro Direct Diagnostics Ltd, UK) immediately on arrival in CICU.

The data set underwent manipulation through diverse methodologies aimed at assessing and enhancing algorithmic performance. Initially, the primary data set was adjusted to exclude patients with missing data, and no preprocessing steps were applied. The primary findings were based on this approach. In the second approach, we imputed missing values using the multivariate imputation by chained equations method (R package: mice). Finally, to address imbalanced date (low prevalence of events), we used a third strategy of data resampling with the synthetic minority oversampling technique algorithm (R package: DMwR)."

      "text": "In the context of imbalanced data (a large number of patients for a small number of events), a comparative analysis was conducted among logistic regression and alternative supervised ML algorithms (including ridge regression, boosted cost-sensitive C5.0, and XGBoost). While logistic regression faces challenges with imbalanced data, ridge regression introduces regularization to mitigate overfitting. Boosted cost-sensitive C5.0 adapts the C5.0 decision tree algorithm by incorporating cost-sensitive considerations, assigning different misclassification costs to minority and majority classes. XGBoost, an ensemble method, employs a gradient boosting framework and is well suited for handling class imbalances through adaptive boosting of weak learners. Adaptive boosting is an artificial intelligence technique that optimizes the performance of an algorithm by using a number of weaker and less efficient algorithms in combination. By combining these weaker algorithms, a more powerful model can be built. The same principle can also be used to combine complex algorithms and improve their accuracy. In addressing imbalanced data, the aim is therefore to minimize the overall misclassification cost and mitigate the problem of imbalanced data. To assess the performance of these algorithms, we used several parameters: AUROC, precision-recall area under curve (PRAUC), balanced accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative prediction values, McNemar test P-value, and Brier score. Due to the low occurrence of events and the imbalanced nature of the data, the F-score and the precision-recall curve were preferred to determine the best model. We used a five-fold cross-validation process to fit the model hyperparameters using grid search (R package: caret).\n\nTo evaluate the interest of the CICU classification model, the performance of the proposed ML model will be compared to a logistic regression with variables selected a priori according to their clinical pertinence including age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes and LVEF, and known scores assessing outcomes in CICU patients from the literature: quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE), and the Acute Heart Failure (ACUTE-HF) score.

      "text": "In our study, we reported a rate of in-hospital MAE of 4.6% and inhospital death of 1.6%. Prior American and Canadian studies have shown a higher death rate estimated around 8.5% in overall patients hospitalized in CICU.  23, 24 In parallel, studies conducted in coronary intensive care unit including mainly ACSs showed death rates closer to our study around 4.5%.  25 However, we observed baseline demographic features highly similar to that of prior CICU populations with a vast majority of men and a mean age around 65 years.  23, 26 This low rate of in-hospital death in our study could then be related to the high proportion of ACSs in the ADDICT-CICU trial. It has been shown that death and adverse events among patients hospitalized for ACS have decreased over the past decades and remain lower than that of patients admitted for acute HF.  26, 27  Exhaled CO was one of the highest ranked features for risk prediction in our analysis. It has been previously described as a measure of particular interest for the study of tobacco exposure and is used in the monitoring of smoking cessation.  14  Table 2 Supervised learning machine algorithms to predict in-hospital major adverse events Model evaluation metrics Logistic regression Ridge regression Boosted C5.0 XGBoost AUROC (95% CI) 0.84 (0.72-0.96) 0.85 (0.72-0.96) 0.90 (0.75-0.98) 0.83 (0.71-0.95) Precision-recall AUC 0.53 0.54 0.57 0.42 Balanced accuracy 0.66 0.66 0.70 0.62 F-score 0.42 0.42 0.50 0.33 Sensitivity 0.33 0.34 0.42 0.25 Specificity 0.98 0.98 0.99 0.99 Positive predictive value 0.57 0.57 0.63 0.50 Negative predictive value 0.97 0.96 0.97 0.96 McNemar test P-value 0.23 0.23 0.34 0.15 Brier score 0.91 0.9 0.68 0.95 CO, carbon monoxide; LVEF, ventricular ejection fraction; MAP, mean arterial pressure; TAPSE, Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome, independent of smoking status.  28 Our working group has already shown that exhaled CO, not only associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, would also be associated with the in-hospital prognosis in the acute phase once the cardiovascular disease is declared.  10, 29 This finding is also supported by Tun et al.  30  who showed that increased levels of exhaled CO were associated with an adverse cardiovascular biomarker profile and a higher risk of HF, especially with reduced ejection fraction. Exhaled CO may therefore be an interesting predictive marker for acute HF as well as coronary artery disease through its association with a poor cardiovascular risk profile. Illicit drug use was also integrated as an important variable to build our ML model. This finding is in line with a prior analysis from ADDICT-CICU study showing that illicit drug use is strongly associated with the occurrence of in-hospital outcomes with an incremental prognostic value above traditional risk factors.  29 These findings can be explained by several types of sympathomimetic effects of illicit drugs which can increase blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and consequently myocardial oxygen demand.  31 e observed a strong contribution of echocardiographic parameters to risk prediction. The three echocardiographic parameters retained in the variables of importance reflected left, right, and diastolic ventricular function with LVEF, TAPSE index, and E/e\u2032 ratio. Many studies have shown that left ventricular dysfunction, evaluated using global longitudinal strain or LVEF, was associated with a poor prognosis in a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases.  32, 33 Right ventricular dysfunction in the acute setting of coronary syndrome and HF has also been described as an important prognostic factor.  34, 35 The same is true regarding prognostic significance of filling pressure, which was well known in HF and has recently been demonstrated in the field of ACSs.  36 These findings are in line with a recent study which showed a specific association of the E/e' ratio with overall in-hospital death in CICU.  37 ur ML model exhibited improved prognostic value to predict in-hospital outcomes than several traditional scores assessed in CICU, including traditional logistic regression. Our ML model included only seven variables to outstripped GRACE and TIMI scores in ACS, and ACUTE-HF score in acute HF.  19, 20  These good performance could be partly explained by the many-faceted nature of the model: each variable captures a different facet of the patient's medical evaluation (i.e. haemodynamic, inotropism, fluid overload) that could have consequences on both the short and medium term. Besides, the small number of variables ensures a practical and easy use in everyday practice. Up to date, no specific ML model including clinical, biological, and echocardiographic data has been built.  38 The Mayo Clinic team recently developed a clinicobiological risk model that does not include echocardiographic and ECG characteristics. The M-CICU Admission Risk Model (M-CARS) was also developed specifically for CICU patients.  39 he M-CARS model consists of seven variables, one of which is the Braden skin model and three are biological results (blood urea nitrogen, anion gap, and red blood cell distribution width). Unfortunately, we did not have all the data necessary to calculate this model and could not compare the performance of our ML model with that of M-CARS. Most of the scores developed to date have produced good results using traditional statistical methods such as logistic regression. Although our results show a better performance of the ML model, some data shade the interest of ML techniques in the prediction of medical risk. Large systematic reviews suggest that, in the presence of bias, poor calibration, and/or other methodological limitations, ML often has no performance advantage over logistic regression models.  40 Larger external validation cohorts in other regions or other healthcare systems are needed to confirm the performance of the ML model.\n\nInterestingly, the ML model seems to distinguish two groups of patients. On the one hand, right ventricular function of smokers is of particular interest. This result may be explained by the association of smoking with an increased incidence of respiratory diseases such as obstructive lung disease or elevated pulmonary pressures. The tree then differentiates the patients in this group as having or not having diastolic dysfunction, illustrating the possible evolution of right heart pathology on left pressures. Non-smoking patients, on the other hand, have a greater burden of HF and haemodynamic signs, with a thorough evaluation of signs of cardiogenic (pre-)shock. These results demonstrate other interests and advantages of ML techniques based on decision trees. In fact, they can also be used to identify subgroups of patients with different risk profiles. Here, the subgroups identified by the ML model correspond to genuine patient populations with their own characteristics. The machine learning model had a significantly higher area under the curve for receiver operating curves and precision-recall curves in predicting inhospital major adverse events than all other risk models (P < 0.001). The results are given with their 95% confidence interval."

      "title": "Study limitations",
      "text": "We acknowledge some limitations. First, the sample of patients analysed was reduced after splitting between training and validation cohorts. In addition, the exclusion of eight centres to build an independent validation cohort also lowered the sample size. This implies that the subgroup of patients with the same hospitalization reason, such as HF or ACS, also had small sample size. The performance of this ML score on these diagnostic subcategories should therefore be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, as there is no other study on the CICU population that has measured exhaled CO and illicit drug use, the results necessarily had to be validated on the ADDICT-CICU cohort. Indeed, we acknowledge as a significant limitation the lack of external validation of our ML model outside of France. Second, although we observed a small number of in-hospital events, we adapted our statistical analysis with algorithm and resampling techniques to deal with unbalanced data.  41 A specific post hoc sensitivity analysis was carried out for this purpose. Although the high heterogeneity of the population of this study is a significant challenge and a limitation of the analysis, it is important to highlight similar performances of our ML score in the subgroup analyses performed. Third, we noted missing data on ultrasound variables, up to 25% for the E/e\u2032 ratio, related to the feasibility of the examination in the acute phase. Although echocardiography is carried out at the patient's bedside, it is not always easy to perform within the first 24 h of admission in many centres around the world. Still, the selection of variables was performed only on patients without missing data and a post hoc sensitivity analysis conducted in overall patients showed similar results. Fourth, our final model included illicit drug use and exhaled CO level, which are not routinely captured in all CICUs. However, a growing body of evidence points to the value of systematically assessing drug use at CICU admission, and exhaled CO levels can help assess respiratory status. We also collected information on illicit drug use at the time of admission to hospital and on history of drug use, but we can neither establish nor rule out a causal link between drug use and hospitalization. In addition, some biological data such as lactate dosage or interventional findings such as the frequency of the need for ventilation, organ replacement procedures, and/or SAPS/TISS were not systematically performed in the patients of this study due to the initial haemodynamic stability at baseline. Fifth, although this was a multicentre study, it was not exhaustively conducted in all French centres. Yet, the 39 centres that participated in the study included centres in large metropolitan areas, medium-sized cities, public university hospitals, non-university hospitals, and private clinics, ensuring a fairly representative sample of French CICUs."
