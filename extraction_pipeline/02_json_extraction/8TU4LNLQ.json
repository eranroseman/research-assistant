      "text": "Nearly 80% of US adults own a smartphone,  1  which accurately tracks physical activity.  2 Wearable devices are growing in adoption and can track other biometrics.  [2] [3] 3] [4]  However, it is unknown whether smartphones or wearables are more sustainable for remotely monitoring patients over longer-term periods. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of remotely monitoring physical activity from smartphones vs wearables in the 6 months after hospital discharge."

      "text": "This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial was approved by the University of Pennsylvania institutional review board and followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline. Data were obtained from an ongoing trial that enrolled patients from January 23, 2017, to January 7, 2019.  5 Patients provided written informed consent to participate in the trial.\n\nAdults admitted to medicine services at 2 hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were eligible if they could ambulate, had a smartphone compatible with the Withings HealthMate application, and planned to be discharged to home. Patients were randomly assigned to use the smartphone alone or with a wearable (Withings Steel) for 6 months (eFigure in the Supplement). Physical activity data from devices were obtained using Way to Health as described in a previous study.  6 All patients received $50 to enroll and $50 to complete the trial. Patients in the smartphone group were given the wearable after trial completion. All patients selected communication preferences (text message, email, or telephone voice recording) and were sent a notification to synchronize their device if data had not been transmitted for 4 consecutive days.\n\nFor each patient, the duration of data transmission was estimated using the last day a step value was received and compared at 30, 90, and 180 days using Pearson \u03c7 2 tests. A Cox proportional hazard model was fit and adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance, education, marital status, annual household income, body mass index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score; censoring took place on patient death. Because patients may not have synchronized data for all days, the proportion of days of data transmission was also compared using a \u03c7 2 test.\n\nThe intention-to-treat analysis was conducted in SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and used 2-sided hypothesis tests (level of significance, P < .05). Investigators and analysts were blinded to group assignment."

      "text": "Patients discharged from the hospital using smartphones transmitted data for a greater duration and proportion of time, with a 32% relative increase in patients completing the 180-day period compared with those using wearables. This study is limited to physical activity data from patients at 1 health system. Wearables track behaviors that smartphones do not (eg, sleep), and future research will evaluate the usefulness of these data.  5 Because smartphones are ubiquitious,  1  our findings indicate that these devices could be a scalable approach for remotely monitoring patient health behaviors."
