  "title": "Supporting women's health outcomes after breast cancer treatment comparing a text message intervention to usual care: the EMPOWER-SMS randomised clinical trial",
  "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a co-designed lifestyle-focused text message intervention (EMPOWER-SMS) for breast cancer survivors' self-efficacy, quality of life (QOL), mental (anxiety, depression, stress) and physical (endocrine therapy medication adherence, physical activity, BMI) health. Methods Single-blind randomised controlled trial (1:1) comparing EMPOWER-SMS to usual care at 6-months (intention-totreat). Setting: public Breast Cancer Institute (Sydney, Australia). Eligibility criteria: adult (> 18 years) females, < 18-months post-active breast cancer treatment (stage I-III), owned a mobile phone, written informed consent. Primary outcome: Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease Scale at 6 months. Process data: message delivery analytics, cost, and post-intervention survey. Results Participants (N = 160; mean age \u00b1 SD 55.1 \u00b1 11.1 years) were recruited 29th-March-2019 to 7th-May-2020 and randomised (n = 80 EMPOWER-SMS: n = 80 control). Baseline mean self-efficacy was high (I: 7.1 [95%CI 6.6, 7.5], C: 7.4 [7, 7.8]). Six-month follow-up: no significant differences between groups for self-efficacy (I: 7.6 [7.3, 7.9], C: 7.6 [7.3, 7.9], adjusted mean difference 0 (95%CI 0.4, 0.4), QOL, mental health, physical activity, or BMI. Significantly less EMPOWER-SMS participants missed \u2265 1 endocrine therapy medication doses compared to control (I: 3/42[7.1%], C: 8/47[17.0%], Adjusted RR 0.13 [95%CI 0.02, 0.91]). Text messages were delivered successfully (7925/8061, 98.3%), costing $13.62USD/participant. Participants strongly/ agreed EMPOWER-SMS was easy-to-understand (64/64; 100%), useful (58/64; 90.6%), motivating for lifestyle change (43/64; 67.2%) and medication adherence (22/46; 47.8%). Conclusion EMPOWER-SMS was feasible, inexpensive, acceptable for delivering health information to breast cancer survivors between medical appointments, with minor improvements in medication adherence. Implications for Cancer Survivors Text messages offer a feasible strategy for continuity-of-care between medical appointments.",

      "text": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide and five-year survival rates are high (85-90% in high-income countries)  [1] . However, the number of lost disability adjusted life years  [DALYs]  among breast cancer survivors is high globally  (17, 708 ,600 DALYs)  [1] . The greatest contributors to DALYs are modifiable risk factors, including overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and smoking  [1] . Managing modifiable risks can be challenging due to treatment and endocrine therapy medication side effects (e.g. hot flushes, fatigue) that negatively affect women's mental and physical health  [2] . Health education can improve self-efficacy (self-confidence) for managing health  [3] [4] [5] [6]  and promote healthy lifestyles after active treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation)  [7] . However, survivorship education programs are scarce  [8] , resource-intensive, and rarely co-designed with end-users, which may reduce effectiveness  [7] . Novel, scalable and codesigned post-treatment health programs are urgently needed.\n\nMobile health (mHealth) interventions (e.g. mobile applications, text messaging) are strategies for providing health information remotely  [9] . The most accessible mHealth intervention is text messages, as over 5 billion people own mobile phones globally  [10] . Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) show that health education via text messages is effective for improving various modifiable risks  [11] [12] [13] [14] . There is limited but growing evidence that text message interventions may improve modifiable risks for individuals with breast cancer, including adherence to endocrine therapy medication  [12]  and weight maintenance  [13] . However, few interventions were co-designed with breast cancer survivors  [15] .\n\nOur team co-designed the EMPOWER-SMS text message program with breast cancer survivors, health professionals and researchers, which aims to improve breast cancer survivors' health self-efficacy, quality of life (QOL), mental (anxiety, depression, stress) and physical (BMI, physical activity, medication adherence) health  [16] . We hypothesized that participants who received the six-month EMPOWER-SMS intervention would have improved selfefficacy, QOL and health outcomes compared to usual care (control group) at six-month follow-up."

Participants taking endocrine therapy medications received 26 text messages from each topic. Other participants received messages regarding physical activity and healthy diet (39/104; 37.5%), social and emotional wellbeing (27/104; 26.0%) and general breast cancer information (38/104; 36.5%). Messages were positively toned, semi-personalised with the participant's preferred name and designed to be appropriate for individuals with a Grade 7 (Flesch Kincaid) reading level  [16] . One-third (33/104; 33.0%) of messages included weblinks to additional science-based information and free resources. Participants were advised not to reply (one-way delivery).

Briefly, at baseline, participants provided selfreported demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, country of birth), medical history and chronic disease risk factors (confirmed in medical files). The primary outcome was self-efficacy measured by the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease Scale  [18]  (Cronbach alpha range: 0.88-0.95) [19] , which measures confidence for managing six domains (fatigue, physical discomfort, emotional distress, other health problems, achieving health management tasks and things other than medication) on a scale from 1 to 10 (not confident at all to totally confident). The mean score out of 10 across domains is calculated, with higher scores reflecting higher self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes included:\n\nClinical and lifestyle measures BMI (healthy range: BMI \u2264 25kg/m2), body fat percentage and skeletal muscle mass measured using the Seca medical Body Composition Analyser (Seca GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany)  [20]  and waist circumference (cm) measured using standard tape measurement  [21] . Self-reported nutrition behaviours included number of fruits, vegetables, red meat and standard alcoholic drinks consumed in 7 days  [22] . Self-reported physical activity was measured using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire [GPAQ]  [21]  and validated using an ActiGraph\u2122 GT3X+ (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) accelerometer and wear-time log-book with 32/160 (20%) participants  [23] . Accelerometers were worn for 7 days after baseline and follow-up visits and then completed the GPAQ. Adherence to endocrine therapy medication was measured by self-reported missed doses within the last 7 days. Australian guideline cut points  [24, 25]  are presented in Table  2 ."

The outcomes were compared between EMPOWER-SMS and control groups at six-months, adjusting for the baseline measure of the outcome, with a significance level of 0.05. Dichotomous outcomes were analysed using log-binomial regression and for continuous outcomes, the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).\n\nTo validate the GPAQ, metabolic equivalents (MET) minutes/day for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were compared between the self-reported and accelerometer-assessed physical activity. Freedson and colleagues (1998)  [23]  cut-points were used to define accelerometer MVPA. Total MVPA minutes were divided by the number of days participants wore the accelerometer and MET minutes/day was estimated: minutes of moderate activity \u00d7 4 METs plus minutes of vigorous activity \u00d7 8 METs. The median MET minutes/day and IQI for accelerometer-assessed and self-reported physical activity were reported, and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation between the measurements. MET minutes/day at follow up was compared between EMPOWER-SMS and control groups using exact Wilcoxon rank sum test."

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, 4/160 (2.5%) participants were recruited and 79/160 (49%) completed follow-up visits over the phone and provided self-reported weight, waist circumference and height measurements based on detailed instructions from the research team. Before completing the baseline visit or receiving the text message with the group allocation, four participants withdrew consent (reasons provided in Fig.  1 ). Therefore, 156 were allocated to EMPOWER-SMS (n = 78) or control (n = 78) groups and were included in the analysis. At 6 months, 14/156 (9.0%) participants did not complete the follow-up visit and 2/78 (2.5%) discontinued the intervention (Fig.  1 ).\n\nAt baseline, participants were mean \u00b1 SD of 8.0 \u00b1 5.0 months post-active treatment, mean age \u00b1 SD 55.0 \u00b1 11.0 years and characteristics were not significantly different between groups, except the EMPOWER-SMS group had more smokers and ex-smokers compared to control (Table  1 ).

Overall, few participants met post-treatment secondary prevention guidelines at baseline or were within healthy ranges for depression, anxiety or stress, and significantly fewer EMPOWER-SMS participants met guidelines for waist circumference than controls (Supplementary Material 2). Baseline QOL subscales revealed EMPOWER-SMS participants had significantly lower scores for body image and higher sexual enjoyment than controls (Supplementary Material 3)."

Overall, participants reported that breast cancer minimally affected their life (mean \u00b1 SD 4.3 \u00b1 3.0) and did not experience breast cancer symptoms much (3.8 \u00b1 2.8). Participants felt that their treatment could help their breast cancer (7.8 \u00b1 2.3) and they felt that they understand their breast cancer well (8.1 \u00b1 1.7). However, they felt they had moderate control over their breast cancer (5.0 \u00b1 3.0), concerns about their breast cancer (5.7 \u00b1 2.9) and reported that their breast cancer affected them emotionally (5.0 \u00b1 3.0). When participants were asked what they thought caused their breast cancer (free-text), several common themes emerged: 'stress', 'genetics/family history', 'not sure', 'bad luck/chance', 'age', 'oestrogen/hormones' and 'unhealthy lifestyle' (included subthemes unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking and alcohol). Participants ranked the three most important causes of their breast cancer as (1) unhealthy lifestyle, (2) stress and (3) not sure."

      "text": "Accessible health education and support after breast cancer treatment remains a challenge in survivorship care  [8, 30] . Despite participants' perceptions that unhealthy lifestyle caused their breast cancer, this study highlighted that few participants were meeting secondary prevention guidelines; most participants had overweight or obesity, high body fat percentage, poor nutrition behaviours and poor mental health (anxiety, depression, stress), supporting a strong need for wide-reaching health support strategies. The EMPOWER-SMS RCT implemented a low-cost strategy to support selfefficacy, QOL and health outcomes via semi-personalised text messages for 6 months. Although EMPOWER-SMS was delivered as planned, it did not improve the primary outcome (self-efficacy). Adherence to endocrine therapy medication was high, but there was a significant difference between groups, favouring EMPOWER-SMS. Moreover, most participants rated EMPOWER-SMS easy-to-understand (100%), useful (91%), motivating (67%). Importantly, many participants felt the program duration was appropriate or wanted it to continue. In terms of the primary outcome (self-efficacy), it is possible that the chosen scale (self-efficacy for managing chronic disease) was too broad to identify a change in this population. This scale combines self-rated self-efficacy across multiple domains including managing fatigue, pain, emotional distress and 'things other than medications'. A previous study with cancer survivors found that self-efficacy can vary greatly across domains  [18] , indicating that evaluating them together may dilute their individual interpretation. Domain-specific baseline scores ranged from mean \u00b1 SD of 5.83 \u00b1 2.56 for fatigue self-efficacy to 6.84 \u00b1 2.23 for 'things other than medications'  [18] . Comparatively, the current study's baseline self-efficacy scores were high. A recent systematic review with meta-analyses of non-clinical populations found that digital health interventions had a small but positive impact on domain-specific self-efficacy for smoking but not healthy eating or physical activity  [31]  and only two were text message interventions (both not significant). Therefore, a domain-specific self-efficacy scale that aligned with EMPOWER-SMS content (physical activity, nutrition, fatigue, medication adherence) may have been more appropriate.\n\nDespite the positive data relating to usefulness and motivation, it is also possible that text messages alone are insufficient to produce a change in self-efficacy for female breast cancer survivors. A systematic review with meta-analysis of healthy adults found that the effect of digital health interventions on self-efficacy decreased as the number of women included in the study increased  [32] . Moreover, cancer survivors' self-efficacy can be impacted by high levels of pain, depression and negative perceptions of cancer  [18] . As there are no known similar text message studies targeting breast cancer survivors' self-efficacy, direct comparison with previous research is not possible. However, a recent study with women of reproductive age found that text messages improved knowledge of breast cancer and breast selfexamination but not self-efficacy for breast self-examination  [33] . A recent systematic review with meta-analyses found that some eHealth interventions, namely interactive websites, improved breast cancer survivors' self-efficacy  [15] , whereas another did not  [34] . Further large-scale trials are needed to elucidate the relationship between text message interventions and domain-specific self-efficacy for breast cancer survivors.\n\nThe current study provided preliminary evidence that a lifestyle-focused text message intervention can improve endocrine therapy medication adherence compared to usual care. This result mirrors findings of increased medication adherence compared to control for patients with coronary heart disease  [35] , HIV positive youth taking anti-retroviral medication among  [36] , patients taking antidiabetes oral tablets and beta-blockers  [37]  and asthma treatment  [38] . One systematic review of 2742 patients with chronic diseases found that text message reminders doubled medication adherence compared to usual care  [39] . Contrary to the EMPOWER-SMS intervention, which sent one, one-way (no replies) medication-related message per week, most previous interventions delivered daily text message reminders, and some required a response (two-way communication)  [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . A systematic review found 33-50% of women are non-adherent to their endocrine therapy tablets largely due to side effects (e.g. hot flushes, joint pain), but receiving social support and good clinician-patient communication can increase adherence  [40] . Moreover, a pre-post study of 100 breast cancer survivors found evidence that daily medication reminder text messages with option to report side effects to a health professional was helpful for identifying adherence barriers and convenient for patients  [41] . Qualitative results (focus groups, text message replies, free-text feedback survey responses) of the EMPOWER-SMS RCT found that the messages helped women feel supported and connected to their medical team between clinic visits  [29] . To our knowledge, EMPOWER-SMS is the first lifestyle-focused text message intervention with only one medication-related message per week and found evidence of improved adherence to endocrine therapy medication. Since overestimation of self-reported adherence to endocrine therapy tablets compared to objective measures is common  [42]  and may limit study findings, further robust research is needed with a larger sample size of patients taking endocrine therapy medication to understand the full clinical potential of this resource-light intervention. This study's results are confounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, COVID-19 restrictions in Sydney Australia included a stay-at-home order, which mandated working from home and closure of nonessential services  [43] . For breast cancer survivors, telehealth replaced in-person clinic visits to lower chances of disease transmission  [44] . This period was extremely stressful  [45] . Pre-pandemic research estimated the incidence of anxiety and depression among breast cancer patients to be 18-33%  [46]  and 9-66%  [46, 47] , respectively and symptoms consistently improve across the first 2 years post-surgery  [48] . In contrast, this study found that anxiety and depressive symptoms were above healthy ranges for 90/133 (68%) and 78/133 (58.6%) participants who were 1-2 years post-surgery. A systematic review of RCTs, including 764 adults diagnosed with depression, found that interventions that delivered 1-5 daily text messages were effective for improving depressive symptoms  [49] . The current study, on the other hand, did not specifically recruit patients with depression or anxiety and message content targeted general lifestyle support, rather than daily support for depressive or anxiety symptoms. Despite this, this study found a text message intervention was feasible, low-cost, and acceptable for delivering health information and support to breast cancer survivors, even during COVID19 lockdowns.\n\nAlthough the study had many strengths, including successfully testing a new co-designed digital health intervention in a high quality RCT with a population of culturally and ethnically diverse breast cancer survivors, several limitations should also be considered. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, half of the participants were followed-up by phone. Body composition data (body fat percentage, muscle mass percentage) were therefore unavailable and weight and waist-circumference measurements were self-reported, which limited power and accuracy  [50] . Also, participants' were a mean of 8 months post-treatment. Research suggests that continuity of patient care during and after treatment is important  [30] . It is possible that earlier implementation would have been more beneficial to assist in the acute phase of transitioning from active treatment to independent health self-management. Despite this, participants found EMPOWER-SMS acceptable, useful and motivating for behaviour change and some wanted it to continue beyond 6 months. Future studies should consider beginning digital health survivorship support closer to completion of active treatment and include longer-term follow-ups."

      "text": "A semi-personalised lifestyle-focused text message intervention for women post-active breast cancer treatment was not associated with improvements in the primary (selfefficacy) or secondary outcomes but did have a small significant improvement on endocrine therapy medication adherence. Moreover, the program was deemed useful, acceptable, and motivating for behaviour change and medication adherence from a socioeconomically diverse population. The program provides a feasible, inexpensive, and easily scalable strategy for providing post-treatment health information and support remotely, including during COVID-19 lockdowns. The program could benefit from implementation closer to the end of active treatment and longer-term follow-up."
