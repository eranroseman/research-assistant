  "title": "Impact and efficacy of mobile health intervention in the management of diabetes and hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "With the continuous development of science and technology, mobile health (mHealth) intervention has been proposed as a treatment strategy for managing chronic diseases. In some developed countries, mHealth intervention has been proven to remarkably improve both the quality of care for patients with chronic illnesses and the clinical outcomes of these patients. However, the effectiveness of mHealth in developing countries remains unclear. Based on this fact, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of mHealth on countries with different levels of economic development. To this end, we searched Pubmed, ResearchGate, Embase and Cochrane databases for articles published from January 2008 to June 2019. All of the studies included were randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis was performed using the Stata software. A total of 51 articles (including 13 054 participants) were eligible for our systematic review and metaanalysis. We discovered that mHealth intervention did not only play a major role in improving clinical outcomes compared with conventional care, but also had a positive impact on countries with different levels of economic development. More importantly, our study also found that clinical outcomes could be ameliorated even further by combining mHealth with human intelligence rather than using mHealth intervention exclusively. According to our analytical results, mHealth intervention could be used as a treatment strategy to optimize the management of diabetes and hypertension in countries with different levels of economic development.",

      "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) are major controllable risk factors for cardiac, cerebrovascular, and kidney diseases, and both of them are highly prevalent comorbidities among patients.  1 According to the global risk factor assessment published in 2015, high blood pressure (BP), high blood sugar, and smoking were considered to be the top three risk factors for the increasing disability rate.  2  Sequelae such as heart disease and stroke arising from those aforementioned risk factors are the leading causes of death worldwide.  3 The prevalence of DM and HTN has been continuously on the rise in developing countries, resulting in a heavy financial burden on their healthcare systems. Establishing more effective ways to manage chronic diseases has become the key to solving global health problems.\n\nOver the past two decades, an increasing number of people have been suffering from diabetes worldwide, especially in some developing countries such as China and India.  [4] [5] ] [6] [7]  According to a national survey conducted in 2010, 11% of Chinese adults were diagnosed with diabetes, representing a total of 109.6 million people.  6 It is worth noting that the prevalence of HTN in China is also very high, with the number of patients newly diagnosed with HTN still increasing. According to a study performed in China, 33.6% (335.8 million) of the Chinese adult population had HTN in 2010, but the BP of only 3.9% patients fell within the currently recommended range (BP<140/90 mm Hg).  8  Consequently, cheaper but more effective methods of managing chronic diseases need to be urgently developed in some underdeveloped areas.\n\nWith the continuous advance of technology, mHealth management mode has become increasingly popular. Until today, a standardized definition is not yet available, but it is defined by the WHO as the application of mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), patient monitoring equipment and other wireless technologies to support medical and public health practices.  9 At present, more and more people including those from lower economic classes own mobile and other electronic devices.  [10] [11] 1] [12]  mHealth intervention could possibly be cost-effective in helping medical staffs manage chronic diseases and modifying patients' behaviors, thus providing a practical healthcare strategy for economically underdeveloped countries.  [13] [14] 4] [15]  mHealth Clinical care/Education/Nutrition has been widely used for managing chronic conditions. Despite the fact that products related to mHealth intervention are increasing, the efficacy of mHealth in terms of improving healthcare conditions has not yet been verified and relevant pieces of evidence are scattered. The application of smart medical devices and mobile applications in chronic disease management was summarized in some earlier literature reviews.  [16] [17] 7] [18] [19]  Nonetheless, the efficacy of mHealth intervention in treating chronic diseases was rarely illustrated. In addition, the applicability of mHealth intervention has been confirmed by clinical trials in several developed countries, although these clinical trials are progressing quite slowly in developing countries such as China. In order to test the efficacy of mHealth interventions with respect to chronic disease management in regions with different economic levels, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in this study."

Heterogeneity among studies was measured with the I\u00b2, whose magnitude was divided into insignificant (I\u00b2<25%), moderate (I\u00b2\u226550%), and significant (I\u00b2\u226575%). A fixed-effect model was built to pool the data whenever the study had no significant heterogeneity (I\u00b2<50%), where as a random-effect model was implemented when the heterogeneity was more than moderate in the study (I\u00b2\u226550%). We calculated the mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs when studies had the same units or used the same measurements. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the cause of heterogeneity.\n\nWe evaluated the possibility of publication bias by constructing a funnel plot, then checked the funnel plot asymmetry by using Begg and Egger tests, and defined significant publication bias as a p<0.1. Additionally, Begg and Egger tests results were verified by metabias command. The trim-and-fill analysis was then used to evaluate the impact of publication bias on the results, which was done by metatrim command."

      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first article evaluating the impact of mHealth intervention in countries with different economic levels. A total of 51 research literature were included in this study. Our research results indicated that mHealth intervention could improve clinical indicators such as HbA1c, FBG, SBP, and DBP when compared with traditional treatment strategies. Meanwhile, we also discovered that mHealth intervention positively correlated with improvements in the patients' quality of life, satisfaction and lifestyle.\n\nOur study has confirmed the efficacy of mHealth intervention in the management of DM and HTN, which was consistent with the results obtained in previous studies. Prior articles on mHealth were essentially limited to a single type of intervention, such as telemedicine, mHealth Apps and MPTMs. However, five different types of mHealth intervention were included in this article.\n\nCategory Number of studies (n, %) Study ID* Data monitoring/collection/store/transmit 27 (52.9) 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, 25, 29, 31, 33, 34, 37, 40, 41, 43-47, 51 Feedback 10 (19.6) 2, 9, 10, 14, 22, 27, 31, 37, 38, 51 MPCs Knowledge and tips 3 (5.9) 7, 18, 35 Medical consultations 3 (5.9) 7, 18, 35 Reminder 1 (2.0) 35 mHealth APPs Suggestions 2 (3.9) 12-50 Medical consultations 1 (2.0) 23 Reminder 2 (3.9) 12-50 Data monitoring/collection/store/transmit 5 (9.8) 12, 30, 32, 38, 39 WPMDs Data monitoring/collection/store/transmit 8 (15.7) 23, 27, 28, 35, 36, 48-50 Secondary intervention results Improved knowledge 3 (5.9) 1, 3, 4 Improved adherence 14 (27.5) 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 18, 23, 24, 25, 36, 38, 45, 49 Improved self-efficacy/self-care \u00a7 13 (25.5) 1, 3, 4, 7, 15, 18, 20, 35-38, 45, 50 Improved behavior 12 (23.5) 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 16, 18, 24, 30, 35, 41,45 Improved satisfaction 10 (\n\nImproved quality of life 10 (\n\nbad habits 1 (2.0) 50 Reduced costs \u00b6 2 (3.9) 2-39 *Study ID: indicate the 1st to 51st study. \u2020Developing country: refers to countries with low levels of economy, technology, and people's living standards.

Outcomes assessed are (A) change in SBP at the end of intervention in studies that compared mHealth treatment with traditional treatment, (B) comparing the effects of mHealth intervention on SBP control in countries with different levels of economic development, (C) SBP in studies that compared combination treatment with mHealth treatment alone, (D) change in DBP at the end of intervention in studies that compared mHealth treatment with traditional treatment, and (E) comparing the difference of five different types of mHealth interventions on SBP control. DBP, diastolic blood pressure; MPTMs, mobile phone text messages; SBP, systolic blood pressure; WMD, weighted mean difference.\n\nThis study revealed that compared with the control group, telemedicine and MPTMs, or a combination of these two intervention measures could effectively improve blood sugar and BP levels. While the effect of telemedicine intervention was more evident (see figure  1 , HbA1c-D and figure 2, SBP-D). It should be noted that the pooled effect of intervention measures such as MPCs and APPs was not significant because the amount of literature was small, but most study results on MPCs and APPs indicated that mHealth intervention was conducive to improvements in blood sugar and BP levels.\n\nOur study also discovered that mHealth intervention had a greater impact on patient with T2DM than T1DM, which was consistent with the results of the study conducted by Su et al.  17  The main reason for such difference may be related to the disease's pathophysiology. As we know, patients with T1DM are completely dependent on insulin therapy, whereas patients with T2DM can improve their blood glucose through changes in their lifestyle and eating habits, especially in the early stage of diabetes. We found out that most mHealth intervention chiefly achieve blood sugar control by promoting favorable lifestyle and eating habits, which is the main reason why mHealth intervention is more effective for patients with T2DM. Hence, it is believed that the key to excellent curative effects is to formulate specific intervention measures for different types of diabetics.\n\nAccording to our study results, mHealth intervention has a more significantly positive effect in controlling the SBP in developed countries compared with the control group, but its effects were not that significant in developing countries. After carefully reading, examining and comparing the original studies, we found out that the three RCTs (Lee et al, Piette et al, Bobrow et al) conducted in developing countries exclusively used mHealth as intervention (not combined with professional healthcare management).  61 64 68 Nonetheless, in developed countries, mHealth intervention is usually combined with professional healthcare management to provide diseaserelated care during the intervention so as to enhance the clinical efficacy. This explains why mHealth intervention performed in developed countries demonstrates a higher efficacy with respect to SBP control. These results are consistent with those in the study carried out by Hou et al stating that the intervention of healthcare professionals is essential to enhance the clinical efficacy of mHealth.  16 ithal, the BP values after mHealth intervention have exhibited varying degrees of improvement compared with the baseline values, which was confirmed in most RCTs conducted in developing countries.  35 56 66 Based on these observations, we reckon that using mHealth intervention also exerts a positive effect on improving BP levels in developing countries. In order to validate our study results, we also conducted a subgroup analysis. The results of our subgroup analysis indicated that the combination of mHealth intervention and professional management (By pharmacists, nutritionists, full-time nurses and sports coaches) was more effective than exclusively performing mHealth intervention(combined intervention: WMD (95% CI)=-6.17 (-8.83 to -3.50); mHealth intervention: WMD (95% CI)=-2.16 (-5.07 to 0.75)). Notwithstanding, it should be noted that despite the immense convenience provided by the continuous development of high technology, greater benefits can be produced just by combining human intelligence with artificial intelligence."

It was the same case for the SBP and DBP when the articles published by Green et al and Margolis et al were excluded.  59 73 After a detailed analysis of the original study, we realized that disease management by professional pharmacists was illustrated in both articles. Consequently, it was inferred that professional intervention could strengthen disease management, which may also be a cause of heterogeneity."
