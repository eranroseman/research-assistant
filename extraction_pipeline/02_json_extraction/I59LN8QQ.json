  "title": "Determination of Capillary Blood TSH and Free Thyroxine Levels Using Digital Immunoassay",
  "abstract": "Background: The remote performance of thyroid function blood tests is complicated because it requires blood collection. Objective: To compare TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) levels between capillary and venous blood and assess the adequacy of measuring each value in capillary blood. Methods: This prospective intervention study was conducted at Ito Hospital and was based on the clinical research method. The participants were 5 healthy female volunteers and 50 patients (41 females and 9 males) between the ages of 23 and 81 years. To measure TSH and FT4 levels in capillary and venous blood, a digital immunoassay (d-IA) method capable of measuring trace samples was used. Chemiluminescence measurements were used as controls. Values obtained for each assay system were compared using Spearman's correlation analysis. Capillary blood was collected using an autologous device (TAP II; not approved in Japan). Results: Capillary plasma volume obtained using TAP II was 125 \u00b5L or more in 26 cases, 25 \u00b5L to 124 \u00b5L in 24 cases, and less than 25 \u00b5L in 5 cases. Strong correlations were noted in the TSH and FT4 levels between capillary and venous blood, with correlation coefficients of rs = 0.99 and rs = 0.97, respectively. Conclusion: Capillary TSH and FT4 levels strongly correlate with venous blood values. Trace samples can be used in high-precision d-IA methods. These results may promote telemedicine in assessing thyroid function.",

      "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic reduced face-to-face patient visits  [1]  and has accelerated the need for telemedicine. In some fields where blood testing is not required, telemedicine could be an alternative if telemedicine devices are available. However, for thyroid diseases, especially thyroid dysfunction, blood testing to measure thyroid hormone levels is essential for accurate assessment. Self-sampling of capillary blood using a microneedle device is one way of self-collection of blood  [2, 3] , and this method has already been used in patients with diabetes to check glucose levels  [4] . Although the currently used fingertip pricking with microneedle method is accepted worldwide and is less painful than venous blood sampling, this method can collect only 3 \u00b5L of capillary blood  [5] . Conversely, a microneedle capillary blood collection device enabled us to collect 100 \u03bcL of capillary blood samples from the upper arm  [6]  with less pain than usual venous blood sampling or fingertip pricking method  [3, 5] . Some studies that used this device have revealed that major immune cells  [7] ; SARS-CoV-2 antibody  [8] ; and biochemical components including liver enzymes  [9] , autoantibodies  [10, 11] , and inflammatory markers  [10] [11] [12]  can be measured as accurately as in venous blood samples. Capillary blood can be collected using a microneedle sampling device; however, its volume is still insufficient for blood testing using conventional instruments. The recently developed ultra-high-sensitivity digital immunoassay (d-IA) with attomolar sensitivity enables the detection of a single enzyme using single-molecule detection technology  [13] . The d-IA can detect enzymes in a small amount of samples. The d-IA has substantial potential, and it has already been used in the medical field  [14] . The d-IA technique was used in this study to measure a small amount of specimens.\n\nRegarding thyroid function, capillary blood sampling from heel prick has been used for screening congenital hypothyroidism of newborns worldwide  [15] [16] [17] , and this method has been implemented as a public service since 1977 in Japan. This screening test has revolutionized the detection of congenital metabolic and endocrine diseases because treatments can be initiated promptly in the early stages of life. Moreover, according to the American Thyroid Association statement formulated in 2018  [18] , although point-of-care (POC) thyroid diagnostic kits are used worldwide, most of these are qualitative TSH measuring kits designed for screening congenital primary hypothyroidism. Additionally, the few POC quantitative assay kits for TSH, T4, and T3\n\nare not yet commercially available in most countries. A recent study that analyzed thyroid hormone data obtained from a commercially available testing kit using capillary blood collected by the finger prick method revealed the prevalence of potential thyroid dysfunction among the general population  [19] . However, the study did not evaluate the accuracy of the test results. The limitations of POC diagnostic test kits include a lack of sensitivity and accuracy, the ability to measure items only in narrow ranges, and unreliability of results when using whole blood as a test sample  [18] .\n\nKahaly et al  [20]  and Shurbaji et al  [21]  observed significant correlations and concordance in the levels of TSH between capillary blood, venous whole blood, and venous serum using a Wondfo commercially available testing kit and compared the values to Abbott and Roche conventional kits as reference methods. To our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the concordance of both TSH and free T4 (FT4) thyroid hormone levels simultaneously between capillary and venous blood samples. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the values of TSH and FT4 levels in the capillary blood with those in the venous blood to assess adequacy and concordance."

The protocol was submitted to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare and approved by the Clinical Research Review Board of the University of Tokyo (#CRB3180024) and the Ethics Committee of Ito Hospital (#IRB364). The participants were 5 healthy female volunteers recruited by a volunteer recruitment agency (NEW-ING NPO Corp.) and 50 patients observed at Ito Hospital with various thyroid functions. All participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the registered study protocol and provided written informed consent to participate (Fig.  1 ).\n\nThe primary objective was to assess the concordance of TSH and FT4 values with capillary blood acquired via TAP II (YourBio Health, Medford, MA, USA; not approved in Japan) compared with venipuncture samples. The secondary objective was to measure the values of biochemical parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (T-Bil), and creatinine (CRE), in capillary blood and to assess the concordance with those values in venous blood."

      "text": "To measure TSH and FT4 values, a d-IA method  [14]  capable of measuring trace samples was used for capillary and venous blood measurements. The d-IA reagent for TSH and FT4 was developed by Abbott Japan LLC. TSH and FT4 assays in d-IA were performed in a two-step reaction using paramagnetic microparticle enzyme immunoassay technology with fluorogenic substrates. The coefficients of variants (CV) of the d-IA TSH assay were less than 10%  [22] . Five microliters for TSH or 9 \u03bcL for the FT4 assay, specific antibody-coated paramagnetic microparticles, and alkaline phosphatase-labeled conjugates were combined to form beads with antigen-antibody complexes. The resulting bead and fluorescent images were captured using a custom-made camera. Image analysis was described as reported  [14, 22] . To measure TSH and FT4 using d-IA, the same sample was repeatedly used according to the amount of sample collected. TSH was measured twice at maximum with the same sample, and FT4 was measured 3 times at maximum, and then the mean value was calculated. Conventional chemiluminescent measurement kits [ARCHITECT TSH (AB_2883972) and FT4 (AB_2801665), Abbott Laboratories] were used as a control. According to the package inserts, the CV of the Architect TSH and FT4 assay are both designed to have a precision of <10% (total CV). Biochemical parameters, including AST (Sekisui Medical Co., Ltd.), ALT (Sekisui Medical Co., Ltd.), T-Bil (FUJIFILM), and CRE (Kainos), were measured using an automatic biochemical analyzer (BioMajesty\u00ae JCA-ZS050, JEOL Ltd.), and a sample cup for a small number of specimens."

The primary objective of this study was to measure TSH and FT4 levels in capillary blood and compare them with venous blood values. The success rate of blood collection using TAP II was 89.1% (49/55). Capillary and venous blood TSH values were strongly correlated in the FAS group (rs = 0.99, P < .05; Spearman's correlation analysis) (Fig.  2 ), and the slope was y = 0.0 + 0.9 x (Passing-Bablok analysis). The PPS group also had a strong correlation between capillary and venous blood TSH values (rs = 0.99, P < .05), and the slope was y = 0.0 + 0.8 x.\n\nIn the analysis of the FT4 value, a strong correlation was observed between capillary and venous blood FT4 values in the FAS group (rs = 0.97, P < .05) (Fig.  2 ), and the slope was y = -0.0 + 1.0 x. Similar to the analysis in the FAS group, capillary and venous blood FT4 values were also strongly correlated in the PPS group (rs = 0.98, P < .05), and the slope was y = -0.0 + 1.0 x. However, 1 of the 24 participants was excluded from the analysis because the measurement exceeded the measurement range.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Our results showed that the success rate of TAP II blood collection was 89% (49/55), and notable correlations were observed between capillary and venous blood for both TSH and FT4. According to the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association  [23]  and European Thyroid Association  [24] , serum TSH levels should be measured as an initial screening for thyroid dysfunction as it has the highest sensitivity and  specificity. However, it is challenging to distinguish overt hyper/hypothyroidism from subclinical hyper/hypothyroidism or to detect central hypothyroidism by measuring only the TSH value. Woo et al developed a novel method to measure T4, T3, and TSH simultaneously from the same sample using a combination of multi-immunoreaction-based dual-color capillary electrophoresis and a dual-color laser-induced fluorescence technique  [25] . They showed this method had high detection sensitivity and required a short measurement time. However, FT4 is the hormone that represents the actual thyroid hormone status better than T4, and, thus, FT4 is used in daily clinical practice to evaluate thyroid function combined with TSH values. Consistent with previous reports  [20, 21] , our study demonstrated that capillary TSH and FT4 levels strongly correlate with venous blood values, suggesting that capillary values may be used to assess actual thyroid function in adults.\n\nThe biochemical parameters were measured as secondary analyses using the same plasma obtained via TAPII and venipuncture. While using anti-thyroid drugs, adverse events such as liver injury  [26]  should be carefully monitored. The results showed a correlation between AST, ALT, T-Bil, and CRE, although the correlation coefficient was not strong for T-Bil (rs = 0.77). Wickremsinhe et al observed a nearly perfect concordance, with concordance correlation coefficients of > 0.99  [9]  when comparing the biochemical parameter values of AST, ALT, and T-Bil between the capillary and venous blood. The difference in the concordance of T-Bil between our study and that of Wickremsinhe et al might be due to hemolysis. To detect hemolysis, they used both potassium levels in the blood and an automated mechanical system, and their results showed comparable quality to that of venipuncture blood. However, they also reported that the prevalence of hemolysis was higher in capillary blood than in venous blood. Because our study did not measure potassium levels, nor did we use an automated evaluation system, we could not evaluate hemolysis. As hemolysis affects each parameter differently, this difference in correlation may appear only for T-Bil. Considering the overall correlations in biochemical parameters, these values in capillary blood can also be used as true values for adults if we are cautious about the effect of hemolysis.\n\nThe TAP II device enabled us to collect more than 125\u03bcL of capillary blood in 26 participants, and we proved that this amount is enough to evaluate at least 6 parameters, including TSH and FT4. Several studies have successfully evaluated biochemical parameters and immune markers in capillary blood samples collected from the upper arm via a self-sampling device  [8] [9] [10] [11] . Furthermore, capillary samples were shipped overnight with or without centrifugation under controlled conditions to maintain sample quality in these studies. This suggests that utilizing a self-blood collection device in telemedicine may be feasible and reliable in several fields of internal medicine.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, we did not evaluate some considerations relating to logistic aspects, such as the stability of the self-collected blood sample, costs for reagents and shipments, availability of the analyzers in the local hospitals, time to get the result back, way to communicate the results to the physicians of those patients, and costs of this new consultation. Second, as mentioned earlier, we did not evaluate hemolysis using potassium levels. Finally, our study did not reflect the participants' perspectives. When this article was written, this device was not approved for commercial use in Japan. Thus, once approved, we should consider methods for collecting patient voices so that telemedicine using this device is more feasible, usable, and reliable for patients."
