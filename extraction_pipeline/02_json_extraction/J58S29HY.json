      "text": "Nicholas A.  Bowman  Lindsay Jarratt Linnea A. Polgreen Thomas Kruckeberg Alberto M. Segre\n\nColleges and universities have long sought to improve their students' adjustment, retention, and likelihood of graduation  (Berger, Ram\u00edrez, & Lyons, 2012) . To help with this goal, institutions have increasingly attempted to identify students who are struggling early in college so that they can provide timely support and assistance. These early efforts can include a variety of institutional assessments or commercial tools. Some research has shown that social adjustment and engagement measures gathered approximately 1 month into the first semester can predict short-term college retention  (Bowman, Miller, Woosley, Maxwell, & Kolze, 2019; Sun, Hagedorn, & Zhang, 2016) . These results support the potential importance of understanding these initial experiences and perceptions; however, a problem with this strategy is that it depends on students voluntarily completing a survey, and students who are struggling to adjust may be the least likely to respond. A second problem is that surveys are introspective by nature, so even data obtained from students who do respond are prone to error (e.g.,  Herzog & Bowman, 2011) .\n\nTherefore, the present study explored an alternative to traditional early-alert systems at residential institutions: using campus dining data to create an indicator of students' social networks. Key benefits of this approach are that students do not need to respond to institutional requests to provide information and that data collection is automatic and starts almost immediately when students arrive on campus. As a result, it is possible to use student behavior from as early as the first week or two of classes to inform individualized outreach efforts and support."

These social relationships can develop in different ways and can vary in strength from close friends to acquaintances. Overall, living on campus seems to promote social engagement and integration, which ultimately leads to greater retention  (Mayhew et al., 2016) ."

      "text": "The nature of the link between friendships and college success depends upon with whom these relationships occur. According to  Fischer (2007) , on-campus friendships and socializing were positively related to persistence, whereas off-campus ties were not. Moreover, students with a greater number of close campus friends were more likely to graduate from college  (Bronkema & Bowman, 2019) . Similar patterns are evident when considering relation ships and interactions through social media. For instance, the number of oncampus Facebook friends predicted greater social adjustment and (indirectly) retention, whereas the overall number of friends did not predict these outcomes  (Gray, Vitak, Easton, & Ellison, 2013) . Moreover, students who used Facebook primarily to communicate with campus friends had higher retention rates than those who interacted more with off-campus friends  (Morris, Reese, Beck, & Mattis, 2009) . Although Facebook is losing popularity among teenagers and young adults  (Berr, 2018) , the role of friends within and outside of one's college is likely to remain relevant today.\n\nThat said, the presence of college friendships does not automatically lead to benefits, since some studies have found no significant association with retention (e.g.,  Dewberry & Jackson, 2018; Swenson Goguen, Hiester, & Nordstrom, 2010) . As  Mayhew et al. (2016)  argued, the quality of these friendships is likely to be more important than the mere quantity of friends. In support of this interpretation, the strength of students' emotional connection with their close campus friends-who were already defined narrowly in terms of interpersonal relationships-predicted graduation above and beyond the number of close campus friends  (Bronkema & Bowman, 2019) . In addition, friendship may have a different meaning in the era of social media, where many students have hundreds (or even thousands) of people who are listed as \"friends.\" In light of these research findings about friendship quality and quantity, the present study designed an index of social networks that jointly considers the number of friends and students' level of engagement with each friend."

      "title": "METHOD",
      "text": "The sample consisted of 4,063 students (54% female, 20% Students of Color) who started their first year of college in Fall 2009 at a large Midwestern research university. This state flagship university is highly residential; at the time of this study, more than 95% of participants had meal plans. It also has an 85% retention rate to fall of the second year and an undergraduate population that consists overwhelmingly of traditional-age students. The dataset included 479,390 on-campus meals in the initial fall semester. Data about each meal swipe were obtained from the university's housing and dining office; this information was then linked to data provided by the registrar's office.\n\nWhen the data were collected, this university had two \"all you care to eat\" dining halls on campus, which were the only places where students could use their meal plans. Students' meal plans carried a declining balance of meals for the week, so each swipe represented eating one meal; these could not be used to pay for a friend or guest. Each dining hall had a single entry point for all students."

      "title": "Research in Brief",
      "text": "Dining facilities were primarily frequented by residential students, but a few staff and faculty also purchased meal plans (these were not included in the analysis). Seating in the dining hall was a mixed arrangement of square tables and booths, with most tables able to seat 2-6 students.\n\nThe outcome measures were retention to spring of the first year; retention to fall of the second, third, and fourth years; and graduation from the university up to 9 years after initial enrollment (the maximum time possible when data were collected). The key independent variable was an index of the combined number and frequency of different people with whom students dined regularly. Students' dining partners were determined by counting the instances in which two students had their ID cards swiped within 1 minute of each other in the same dining hall. This 1-minute window yielded a conservative estimate of friendship networks; it was sufficient to measure students who entered the dining hall at the same time, but it may have missed students who decided to meet at the dining hall rather than walking together to eat. Using this narrow time frame made it far less likely that students who did not know each other would be inaccurately counted as friends, especially early in the semester (when the values of these indices were smaller). That is, some pairs of students who did not know each other may have eaten one or two meals in close temporal proximity by random chance, but high frequencies would almost certainly indicate that these students were intentionally eating together. Importantly, preliminary analyses showed that the results were substantively identical when considering different timeframes.\n\nThis information was used to compute an m-index, which is analogous to the h-index that measures the citation impact and productivity of researchers  (Hirsch, 2005) . A student's m-index indicates the maximum number of meals (m) in which their ID card was swiped at a dining hall in close temporal proximity to m other students. For example, an m-index of 10 would mean that a student had eaten at least 10 on-campus meals with each of 10 different students (e.g., at least 10 with Alejandro, 10 with Becca, etc.). This index was computed cumulatively at several points in the fall semester (end of  Weeks 1 ,  2 ,  4 ,  8 , and  16 ). The m-indices were standardized with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to facilitate effect-size interpretation.\n\nAn additional dining-related variable included in some analyses was the total number of dining hall meals consumed at the same points in time. Precollege control variables were race/ethnicity (Asian American, Black/African American, Latinx/Hispanic, and other, with White as the referent group), sex, estimated family contribution (as determined by FAFSA), high school GPA, ACT composite score (or converted SAT math + verbal), and whether the student had any AP credits or transfer credits (this binary coding was used to avoid skew, since many students had no such credits). Binary variables indicated whether students participated in a first-year seminar, learning community, college transition course, or online introduction to campus resources; another binary variable indicated whether the student was an in-state resident.\n\nMultiple imputation by chained equations was used to impute values for students who had missing data on one or more variables (see  Carpenter & Kenward, 2013) . Only 1.3% of all cells were missing before imputation, and 25 datasets with complete cases were created for the analyses. Logistic regression was used to predict each retention or graduation outcome; separate analyses were conducted for each of the m-indices (e.g., examining meals through Week 4)."

      "title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The results for m-indices predicting retention and graduation are shown in Table  1 . The m-index was significantly and positively related to all outcomes in all weeks (p < .001). This result may not be surprising for the fall (Week 16) m-index predicting retention to spring of the first year or fall of the second year. In contrast, although the Week 1 m-index was based on only 8 days of meal data (including the weekend before classes started), it still significantly predicted graduation from the university after accounting for student demographics, precollege academic achievement, prior college credits, and college experiences. While some prior research indicated that early social integration predicts retention  (Bowman et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2016) , results of this study show a relationship even in the first week of classes, and they indicate that this very early engagement predicts student retention and graduation several years later.\n\nTo help represent the magnitude of these relationships, the delta-p values represent the percentage-point increase associated with a 1 standard deviation change in the m-index. For example, a student with an average m-index for the fall semester has a predicted graduation rate of 74%, whereas a student whose fall m-index is just 1 standard deviation above the mean has a predicted graduation rate of 80%. These relationships tend to be stronger for the m-indices in later weeks, which makes sense because these variables contain more data over a longer time period. That said, the delta-p for the Week 1 m-index is similar to that for Week 4 across all outcomes, and it is always more than half of the size of the corresponding Week 16 m-index.\n\nAlthough these results are promising and seem to support scholarship that links social integration with student persistence  (Cred\u00e9 & Niehorster, 2012; Mayhew et al., 2016) , an alternative explanation is that students who dropped out early in the fall semester no longer consumed on-campus meals; thus, any positive relationship may have worked at least partially in the opposite direction (i.e., early attrition shapes dining behavior). To Research in Brief avoid this possibility, we conducted additional analyses only among students who persisted to the spring semester. Even within this more selective sample, the results remain positive and significant in all weeks and for all outcomes. Another alternative explanation is that these patterns may be driven by the mere frequency of on-campus dining rather than by attributes of students' social networks. Students who eat more frequently on campus may have better financial support for their college education (so they can afford a more costly meal plan) and/or are less likely to go home (and therefore have more opportunities to eat on campus). We explored this possibility by including the total number of meals consumed through the corresponding week as another predictor. These two meal-related variables are highly correlated (r > .60 for all weeks), but the m-index remains statistically significant in all weeks and for all outcomes, whereas the total number of meals virtually always has a weaker relationship and is often nonsignificant. Thus, the consistently positive m-index results appear to reflect the importance of students' social networks rather than other factors that may contribute to dining hall use."

      "title": "IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS",
      "text": "This study presents intriguing evidence about a novel approach for understanding college students' social networks and adjustment by using data that are routinely available at residential colleges and universities. Institutional researchers can work with residence life and/or dining services to quickly analyze these early data and provide results to divisions of student affairs. Resident assistants could receive the names of students with low m-indices, so they can reach out to these students and help them become better acclimated. The results could also be analyzed by floor, building, and/or hall to identify-and intervene inenvironments that have problems with social isolation. Because students exhibit greater openness to forming new peer relationships at the beginning of the school year (e.g.,  Hays & Oxley, 1986) , receiving very early information about students' social networks and adjustment may prove useful for taking action to help facilitate this process. Dining halls could also create friendship or social spaces that are explicitly intended for students wishing to signal that they are open to meeting and interacting with new peers; such spaces could be provided toward the beginning of the academic year or possibly even all year.\n\nTo be clear, increasing students' m-indices should not be the central goal in and of itself; instead, this index constitutes a useful early indicator of students' social networks and peer relationships. It is quite possible that some students living on campus may have meaningful relationships that are not reflected in their use of dining halls. The m-index is also inherently an indirect indicator of friendship quantity and quality; it cannot directly measure the nature of the relationships of peers with whom students dine, and this quality dimension is critical for shaping retention  (Mayhew et al., 2016) . Therefore, the m-index may constitute a valuable tool, but it should not be interpreted as a comprehensive indicator of student friendships or connectedness.\n\nAlthough the m-index measured student relationships through the use of campus dining halls, the implications of this study may also apply to students more generally and at institutions with large representations of commuting and transfer students. For instance, this same approach for inferring friendships can be used in other college contexts that employ swipe cards, such as academic support centers, campus recreation centers, and perhaps college-wide events. Data from several different swipe card sources could be compiled and analyzed to create an index that would infer friendships from various campus locations.\n\nFinally, the consistency of positive and significant findings in this study is especially noteworthy, because other studies have sometimes found no significant link between friendships and retention  (Dewberry & Jackson, 2018; Swenson et al., 2010) . While our results are quite promising, additional research at other institutions is needed to explore the generalizability of these findings. The university in this sample did not have a Welcome Week at the time of the study, so institutions that have this type of early arrival may be able to identify social isolation even before the end of Week 1. Another important question pertains to the role of dining halls themselves in shaping these dynamics. To what extent does dining on campus play an important role in shaping students' friendships? Or does it simply reflect friendships that develop outside of the dining halls? Since living on campus has overall positive effects on retention  (Mayhew et al., 2016) , policies that encourage campus residence generally-and perhaps dining with fellow students specifically-could serve as effective strategies to develop and maintain peer relationships and ultimately student success.\n\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Nicholas A.
