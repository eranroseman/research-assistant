  "title": "Treatment outcome variation between depression symptom combinations in the STAR*D study",
  "abstract": "Background: In response to recent documentation of symptom and subtype heterogeneity in major depressive disorder, we report on exploratory analyses of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) clinical-trial data to further describe heterogeneity in depression and test the hypothesis that citalopram treatment-outcome patterns differ as a function of depression symptom combinations. Methods: Combinatorial algorithms, latent profile analysis, and repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance were employed to characterize heterogeneity and depression outcome-measure profile variability in the most prevalent symptom combinations with full data (26% of baseline and 13% of endpoint total sample). Results: Descriptive results suggest that substantial heterogeneity and moderate coherence characterize major depressive disorder; as in previous analyses, pairs of individuals sharing no symptoms in common were observed. Exploratory latent profile analysis indicated that different patterns of treatment outcome data exist among STAR*D participants. A small but significant interaction effect of symptom combination \u00c2 outcome measure profile was observed for clinician-rated but not self-reported symptom combinations. Limitations: Factors moderating the generalizability of these findings include binary symptom measures, a short treatment period, and a smaller number of individuals per combination. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that citalopram treatment outcomes vary as a function of diagnostic combinations, thereby providing preliminary evidence that the substantial heterogeneity documented in depression symptom presentations may carry implications for prognosis and treatment outcome. At the level of descriptive phenomenology, these results appear to corroborate the claim that depression is not a homogenous syndrome.",

      "text": "The diagnostic categories of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) have long been criticized for allowing a high degree of within-disorder heterogeneity such that patients may receive the same diagnosis yet share few or even no symptoms in common  (Frances et al., 1990; Krueger and Bezdjian, 2009; Olbert et al., 2014) . Nevertheless, most clinical research considers disorders at the syndrome level rather than examining variability between symptom presentations within disorders  (Cuthbert and Insel, 2010) .\n\nRecent documentation of symptom and subtype heterogeneity in major depressive disorder has highlighted questions regarding the disorder's diversity and consistency  (Fried and Nesse, 2015; \u00d8stergaard et al., 2011) . Empirical findings have provided some corroboration of these concerns by demonstrating that depression outcomes vary significantly depending on symptom presentations. For example, individual depressive symptoms differentially predict psychosocial functioning  (Denninger et al., 2011; Fried and Nesse, 2014; Uher et al., 2012) ; early improvement in specific symptoms tracks remission  (Sakurai et al., 2013) ; and treatment outcomes correlate with depression subtypes derived from latent-variable and clustering analyses  (Nandi et al., 2009; Schacht et al., 2014) .\n\nNevertheless, there exist serious limitations to researching depression at the level of individual symptoms or subtypes. Examining individual symptoms fails to capture the vast heterogeneity of diagnostic combinations-that is, symptom presentations meeting criteria for major depressive disorder  (Fried and Nesse, 2015; Olbert et al., 2014; \u00d8stergaard et al., 2011) -and more recent psychopathological Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage:  www.elsevier.com/locate/jad models have suggested that symptoms do not exist independently but rather interact with one another within causal networks  (Borsboom and Cramer, 2013; Bringmann et al., 2015) . By contrast, latent-variable models of depression symptoms have resulted in myriad factors and classes with substantial differences between them and have not conclusively demonstrated consistent subtypes  (van Loo et al., 2012) . Arnow et al. (2015)  did not find substantial treatment differences between depression subtypes (atypical, anxious, melancholic), although they did not track the defining symptoms of these subtypes. Moreover, latent-variable models presuppose that diagnostic categories represent coherent types that might further divide into subtypes.\n\nOne approach that has to date received little attention consists in examining the prognostic power of depression symptoms in combination. The extent to which variability in treatment outcomes exists at the level of diagnostic combinations remains an open question and represents an intermediate level of analysis between individual symptoms and model-derived subtypes or classes.\n\nWe present analyses of data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR * D) clinical trial to address the association between combinations of depressive symptoms and treatment outcomes, and in particular, to address three hypotheses. First, a main descriptive aim of the paper is to further quantify the heterogeneity of depression symptom combinations for comparison with prior work in other samples  (Olbert et al., 2014) . Corresponding to this descriptive aim, we test the following hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis 1. Pairs of disaggregated diagnostic combinations that share no symptoms in common (i.e., disjoint combinations) will exist in the STAR * D dataset.\n\nThe main exploratory aim of the paper is to examine whether different diagnostic combinations correspond to different patterns of treatment outcomes. Corresponding to this exploratory aim, we test the following two hypotheses, the first of which (Hypothesis 2) justifies examining treatment outcome variations: Hypothesis 2. Multiple patterns of treatment outcomes will exist in the STAR * D dataset.\n\nHypothesis 3. Outcome patterns will differ as a function of diagnostic combination."

HRSD and IDS-30 data were collected by research-outcome assessors via telephone-based structured interview at citalopram treatment entry and exit, whereas QIDS-C and QIDS-SR data were collected by telephone using an automated, interactive voice response (IVR) system. For the three non-binary measures (i.e., the QIDS-C, QIDS-SR, and IDS-30), symptoms endorsed or rated as at least moderate (i.e., scores of 2 or above) were defined as present."

      "text": "We used the following measures to address the study's descriptive aim (Hypothesis 1). The heterogeneity or degree of overlap between depression diagnostic combinations was characterized by combinatorial coherence (CC) and the Jaccard index (J); CC measures the proportion of disjoint combinations, whereas J measures average similarity between combination pairs without penalizing jointly absent symptoms. The dispersion or randomness of diagnostic-combination distribution was characterized by the Gini-Simpson Index (GS) and normalized entropy (E); GS represents the probability that two randomly chosen individuals will manifest different diagnostic combinations, whereas E measures intrinsic heterogeneity or uncertainty among diagnostic combinations (for details, see  Olbert et al., 2014) .\n\nCoherence and diversity measures were calculated for a variety of depression measures, including the clinician-rated enrollment checklist, self-reported PDSQ symptoms, and symptoms imputed from the QIDS-C, QIDS-SR, and IDS-30. For every measure but the clinician-rated enrollment checklist, coherence and diversity measures were also calculated for diagnostic combinations with the following symptom pairs disaggregated (i.e., separated into pairs of individual, potentially independently occurring symptoms; for a rationale for this procedure, see  Olbert et al., 2014) : insomnia and hypersomnia, weight gain/appetite increase and weight loss/appetite decrease, and psychomotor agitation and retardation."

Seven measures of treatment outcomes assessing symptom burden and functioning were selected for further study. Symptom burden was assessed using the HRSD. This measure was preferred over the QIDS-C, QIDS-SR, and IDS-30 for three reasons: (1) the HRSD defined participant inclusion criteria for and was the original primary outcome measure of the STAR*D trial  (Rush et al., 2004) ; (2) treatment outcome trials more frequently use the HRSD than any other depression measure  (Santor et al., 2006) , and thus using the HRSD maximizes generalizability; and (3) power was maximized, since HRSD data were available for more patients than for other measures at the end of treatment Level 1.\n\nOutcomes assessing patient functioning in work, daily activities, and quality of life were collected at treatment entry and exit via telephone using the IVR. Self-reported data assessed the following domains: ability to work and perform regular activities with the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire, which assesses impairment both in work and in daily activities (WPAI-Work and WPAI-Activity); quality of life with the 16-item Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ); daily functioning with the 5-item Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS); and health perceptions with the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SFHS), which assesses both physical (SHFS-Physical) and mental/emotional (SFHS-Mental) health components.\n\n2.4.

      "text": "To establish the existence of distinct patterns of outcome measures we used model-based cluster analysis (i.e., latent profile analysis) to cluster outcome variables (using the mclust package in R, version 5.0.0; Fraley et al., 2012) ; this mixture modeling technique is akin to latent class analysis that incorporates continuous observed variables to test for unobserved variables. A Bayesian multiple imputation algorithm was employed to impute missing data values using the mix package  (Schafer, 1997) . Imputed data were only used for the clustering analysis and not for the primary analysis described below.\n\nCluster solutions were tested for baseline data and for changescore data. For baseline data, we clustered the seven outcome variables described above: the HRSD, WPAI-Work, WPAI-Activity, QLESQ, WSAS, SFHS-Physical, and SFHS-Mental. The SFHS-Physical variable was not clustered for change-score data because it showed negligible correlations with other change-score data ( \u0305 r \u00bc.12). A plot of Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values for different model types was generated with the mclust package; a cluster model with ellipsoidal distributions of variable volume, equal shape, and variable orientation (\"VEV\" distribution) was selected as the best model according to the BIC criterion  (Fraley et al., 2012; Raftery, 1995) . The number of clusters in each case was determined using the bootstrap likelihood ratio test (LRT;  McLachlan and Peel, 2004; Nylund et al., 2007)  with 1000 draws. Model-based cluster solutions were generated using VEV distributions with the number of clusters determined by the bootstrap LRT test."

      "text": "Diagnostic combinations might vary on outcome measures in different ways. For example, one combination might show more improvement across all dependent measures than another combination (a main effect of combination), which might indicate differences in severity. Alternatively, some combinations might improve more on some outcome measures and less on others compared with other combinations (a combination \u00c2 measure interaction effect). If the intercorrelated dependent measures are treated as general depression outcome indicators, such differences would be indicated by different slopes in the profile or pattern of dependent measures.\n\nRepeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to evaluate the hypothesis that a combination \u00c2 measure interaction effect exists. The seven outcome measures used above (HRSD, WPAI-Work, WPAI-Activity, QLESQ, WSAS, SFHS-Physical, and SFHS-Mental) were used as within-subjects variables (i.e., the variables defining the profile line and slope), and clinician-rated and selfreported diagnostic combinations were examined as between-subjects factors (i.e., the groups defining different profile lines/slopes). Clinician-rated combinations were defined by the nine binary (nondisaggregate) DSM-IV-TR major depressive disorder symptoms obtained via clinician interview used to determine study enrollment eligibility. No comparable self-reported symptom checklist existed, and we therefore computed binary (non-disaggregate) nine-symptom combinations from self-reported patient symptoms on the PDSQ. Combinations with at least 30 individuals with valid change-score data for all dependent variables were selected for analysis to ensure adequate power. Measures with intercorrelations less than 3 were excluded, since a measure's lack of relation to other measures obviates the assumption that they are shared indicators of depression outcome; in particular, the SFHS-Physical variable was excluded from the change-score analysis ( \u0305 r \u00bc.12). Repeated-measures MANOVA analyses were performed with both baseline data and change-score data (endpoint-baseline) to examine co-occurring patterns in functioning across diagnostic combinations as well as to assess potential differences in treatment outcome trajectories. Hence, a total of 4 analyses were conducted in all: (1) baseline \u00c2 clinician ratings, (2) baseline \u00c2 self-report, (3) change scores \u00c2 clinician ratings, and (4) change scores \u00c2 self-report. F-tests of parallelism violations (i.e., combination \u00c2 outcome measure interactions) were identified as probative of qualitative differences between diagnostic combinations (i.e., differences that do not merely reflect differences in depression severity)."

For treatment baseline data, bootstrap results indicated an 11-cluster best-fit solution (10-vs. 11-cluster LRTS \u00bc 192.7, p \u00bc.001; 11-vs. 12-cluster LRTS \u00bc60.0, p \u00bc.263), and an 11-cluster model was therefore fit to the data (log-likelihood \u00bc \u00c019,696, n \u00bc2470, df\u00bc 305, BIC \u00bc \u00c041,968, ICL \u00bc \u00c043,674).

Treatment change-score clusters to a large extent appear to vary according to severity, although two moderate-severity clusters show some apparent non-parallelism. Baseline clusters showed greater variability. It should be noted that had cluster selection been undertaken based off of maximum BIC alone (rather than using bootstrap likelihood ratio tests), the number of clusters would have been different (4 baseline clusters and 3 change-score clusters), but the results would still corroborate the presence of multiple outcome-measure clusters in the data."

Combinations did not differ in their proportion of Hispanic-identified individuals.\n\nMauchly's test indicated that the sphericity assumption was violated in all four repeated-measure MANOVA analyses; thus, reported degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity. For the 7 clinician-rated combinations with at least 30 individuals per combination, 1035 possessed valid baseline data (25.6% of total sample of N \u00bc4041) and 536 possessed valid change-score data (13.3% of total sample) for respectively observed power levels of \u03b2\u00bc.99 and .98 to detect a significant interaction effect.

Including demographic variables (gender, % White, and age) as linear covariates did not materially change these results.

Self-reported diagnostic combinations did not show a significant interaction effect for either baseline or change-score data, p Z.05 (Fig.  2 ).\n\nAlthough some of the shifts in outcome measures surely represent regressions to the mean, significant interaction effects suggest that individual diagnostic combinations may vary substantially across outcome domains. For example, individuals endorsing all 9 depressive symptoms showed the greatest improvement compared with other combinations on depressive symptom scores (HRSD; \u0394z \u00bc \u00c0.48) but showed no relative improvement in work activities (WPAI-Work; \u0394z \u00bc.01) and only nominal relative improvement in mental/emotional health (SFHS-Mental; \u0394z \u00bc \u00c0.25). Individuals endorsing neither suicidality nor psychomotor symptoms showed the greatest relative improvement in mental/emotional health (SHFS-Mental; \u2206z \u00bc \u00c0.5) and quality of life (QLESQ; \u2206z \u00bc \u00c0.34) but no relative improvement in overall Note: 'Unique' refers to how many combinations appear at least once in the data; 'Disjoint' refers to how many combinations occur in at least 1 disjoint pair (i.e., two combinations that share no common symptoms). a Symptoms were defined as present when rated moderate or higher (2 or above on a 0-3 scale). b The PDSQ does not assess psychomotor retardation; CC and J for disaggregated PDSQ combinations should be considered upper bounds.\n\ndepressive symptom scores (HRSD; \u2206z \u00bc \u00c0.02).

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "The present study examined whether baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes differed in the STAR*D trial as a function of the specific combination of depressive symptoms for individuals meeting DSM criteria for major depression. Consistent with previous empirical investigations of symptom heterogeneity, we observed diagnostic combinations that shared no symptoms in common (i.e., disjoint combinations) in the STAR*D data irrespective of the method of defining diagnostic combinations.\n\nClustering results confirmed the hypothesis that multiple patterns existed among treatment outcome measures at baseline and in Phase 1 citalopram treatment change-score data; however, the fact that clusters varied largely by severity (particularly for change-score data) suggests the utility of dimensional models  (van Loo et al., 2012) . Furthermore, we partially confirmed the hypothesis that outcome patterns would differ as a function of diagnostic combination: some small but significant differences were observed between the most prevalent clinician-rated diagnostic combinations, but not among combinations derived from self-report. Clinician ratings may have shown an effect over self-report ratings due to greater precision and reliability of clinician ratings given their training and experience; alternatively, patients might interpret symptom questions idiosyncratically or show self-monitoring errors due to impaired concentration. These results provide preliminary evidence that the substantial heterogeneity documented in depression symptom presentations  (Fried and Nesse, 2015; Olbert et al., 2014; \u00d8stergaard et al., 2011)  carries implications for prognosis and treatment outcome.\n\nWith respect to measures of coherence, diversity, and heterogeneity, this analysis demonstrated moderate coherence, high diversity, and moderate to high intrinsic heterogeneity, consistent with previous work with other samples  (Olbert et al., 2014) . These results imply that a diagnosis of MDD conveys relatively little information about what particular symptoms the patient is likely to manifest. We also note that similar results were observed irrespective of the method of deriving diagnostic combinations (i.e., DSM clinician interview checklist, combinations derived from the IDS-30, and clinician-rated or self-report QIDS). The repeated detection of disjoint combinations and the consistency of coherence measures observed between datasets and between assessment modalities suggest that the existence of disjoint combinations, moderate coherence, and high diversity may   characterize the diagnostic category of major depressive disorder as currently defined in the DSM rather than reflecting sample-specific measurements. However, it must be noted that the STAR*D trial was designed to have broad inclusion criteria  (Rush et al., 2004) . This may have contributed to greater heterogeneity, and studies with more narrow inclusion criteria may have correspondingly greater homogeneity. However, despite the high diversity and heterogeneity among diagnostic combinations in the STAR*D dataset, the variations in citalopram outcomes between combinations were relatively small. For this reason, at this time we cannot recommend diagnostic combinations as predictors of citalopram response specifically or depression treatment outcome generally. These results are consistent with other studies finding depression subtypes to have little prognostic value for antidepressant treatment  (Arnow et al., 2015) .\n\nThis study was limited in several ways. First, our analyses did not control for overlap between diagnostic combinations, in essence (as with much previous research) treating combinations as distinct irrespective of their symptom overlap  (Fried and Nesse, 2015; Olbert et al., 2014) . In our view, however, the distinct clinical outcomes obtaining for different diagnostic combinations must be established and described prior to addressing symptom overlap; we understand this study as contributing to further characterization of between-combination heterogeneity rather than as solving the problem. Second, a major overall limitation consists in the binary measurement of depression symptoms. Collapsing symptoms into binary present/notpresent variables may result in outcome-relevant information loss, and within a given diagnostic combination substantial variation in symptom severity or subjective distress might exist among individuals endorsing that combination. Third, although the HRSD is the most frequently used depression measure in treatment outcome studies, it possesses questionable psychometric properties  (Bagby et al., 2004; Santor et al., 2006) ; the use of the HRSD to maximize generalizability and statistical power may have come at the cost of increased measurement error.\n\nFourth, these analyses examined only one phase of treatment over a relatively short period (12 weeks) for a single pharmacological intervention (citalopram). Hence it remains unknown whether diagnostic combinations might prove probative of long-term outcome, medication selection, or response to psychological rather than pharmacological intervention. Fifth, despite the large overall sample in the STAR*D trial, only a relatively small number of patients endorsed any given diagnostic combination; a majority of diagnostic combinations ($80%) were endorsed by only 30 or fewer individuals. For this reason, we could analyze only a small number of diagnostic combinations and had low observed power for analyses of self-reported diagnostic combinations. Sixth, we did not examine treatment trajectories (e.g., time to achieve response), which represent an additional potential domain of heterogeneity between combinations. Seventh, we did not control for clinical variables relevant to treatment response (e.g., anxiety symptoms), and future studies of treatment-response heterogeneity with greater power should further consider such variables. Finally, one specific shortcoming of PDSQ-derived combinations consists in the PDSQ's failure to probe psychomotor retardation; for this reason, CC and J for disaggregated PDSQ combinations should be considered upper bounds.\n\nThis study provides evidence that citalopram treatment outcomes vary as a function of diagnostic combinations, although the relationship does not appear strong enough to carry immediate treatmentplanning implications. However, given that the omnibus treatment results in the STAR*D trial were relatively poor overall  (Pigott et al., 2010) , it remains possible that the weak relationship between treatment outcomes and diagnostic combinations reflects an artifact of the specific treatment (i.e., citalopram medication) or trial design. Other clinical trials have observed substantially greater response rates  (Schramm et al., 2015) , and a stronger combination \u00c2 outcome effect might exist in such cases. In any event, at least at the level of descriptive phenomenology, these results appear to support the conclusion that depression is not a homogenous syndrome  (Fried and Nesse, 2015) . These results contribute to a growing understanding of symptom heterogeneity in major depressive disorder; as the nature and significance of such heterogeneity becomes better understood, prognosis and individually tailored treatments could be enhanced."
