      "text": "Low patient adherence is a major barrier to realizing the benefits of medications that have been shown to do more good than harm in clinical trials. Such trials are typically done among patients who are volunteers, and who are followed closely to assure high adherence. Benefits are greatly reduced or nullified in usual clinical practice where adherence rates are low. Interventions to improve adherence have the potential to multiply benefits for patients, but at the time of our previous review, Haynes 2008, no method of helping patients to follow self administered long-term treatments had been proven effective, actionable, and affordable in usual care settings.\n\nMany patients stop taking their medication in the first months following initiation, o en without informing their provider, with further attrition over time. In addition, many patients who continue their medication do not consistently take it as prescribed. As a result, adherence rates average around 50% and range from 0% to over 100%, and there is no evidence for substantial change in the past 50 years  (Sackett 1979; Gialamas 2009; Naderi 2012) .\n\nMedication non-adherence is o en defined as taking less than 80% of prescribed doses, although it has to be noted that nonadherence can also include taking too many doses, and it is associated with an increased risk for poor health, adverse clinical events, and mortality. Thus many people who could benefit from medications do not, and much of the public and private investment in health research and health care is undermined. To make matters worse, low adherence, even to placebo, is independently associated with an increased risk of death ('healthy adherer' effect)  (Simpson 2006) . Therefore, enhancing medication adherence is a priority and could improve patient outcomes, primarily through the effect of medications, but also possibly through the overall 'healthy adherer' effect."

We believe it is essential to have measures of both adherence and clinical outcomes, as ethical standards for adherence research dictate that attempts to improve adherence should be judged by their clinical benefits  (NHLBI 1982) . Studies that measure only adherence cannot show that patients are better off as a result, and studies that measure only clinical outcomes cannot verify that effects on adherence were important to achieving these outcomes.\n\nFurther, we described findings across disease conditions, as the clinical condition is not a major determinant of medication adherence, with the exception of psychiatric disorders  (Haynes 1979a) . Do note that studies targeting adherence for medications to treat psychiatric disorders are included in our review.\n\nOur 2008 update found, besides the expected variety in medical conditions and regimens, a large diversity and complexity of interventions and of measures for adherence and patient outcomes  (Haynes 2008) . Although some intervention types tended to improve adherence, no specific recommendations could be given, especially since high-quality evidence for consistent effects on both adherence and patient outcomes was lacking."

      "text": "With increasing numbers of efficacious self administered treatments being available, the need for effective interventions to improve adherence is ever more apparent. In recent years, research efforts to better understand the multifactorial barriers that influence patient adherence and to refine theoretical frameworks have been increasing. However, whether these efforts have led to the emergence of more effective interventions needs to be assessed by summarizing the high-quality RCT evidence to date. Many systematic reviews have been published a er our 2008 update, but all focused on a specific (demographic, disease, or medication) population, intervention, or on an even more specific combination of both. Generally, these reviews reported similar conclusions: some intervention components are potentially effective, but small sample sizes and suboptimal methodology o en prevented strong conclusions; the variety of adherence measures limited study comparability; and most studies lacked a theoretical underpinning  (van Dulmen 2007) .\n\nConsidering the substantial efforts in adherence research since 2007, and inconclusive evidence from other recent systematic reviews, we have updated our comprehensive systematic review. Based on publication rates over time in the previous review update, we predicted that we would find at least 50 additional RCTs, and thereby potentially improve our confidence for specific conclusions and recommendations."

As of 24 November 2013, no other comprehensive adherence reviews were registered in the Cochrane Database or PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ( http://  www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ ). We used a web-based database management system, developed by the Health Information Research Unit at McMaster University, to facilitate screening, data extraction, adjudication of disagreements, author review and confirmation of data, production of data tables, and production of data files for future research use. This system has been successfully used in conducting and completing several large, complex systematic reviews (Haynes 2010).\n\nStudies for this review were included if they were RCTs that provided unconfounded tests of interventions expected to affect adherence. A confounder is a characteristic that is extraneous to the primary question being addressed in the study, but which can influence the outcome and is unequally distributed between the groups being compared in the trial. For example, in one study  (Colcher 1972) , two groups received the same prescription for phenoxymethyl penicillin, but different instructions, providing an unconfounded comparison for the instructions, but a third group in"

For long-term regimens, we included negative trials with less than six months follow-up and at least 80% data completion on the grounds that initial failure is unlikely to be followed by success  (Sackett 1979) . The 80% data completion was required for both adherence and clinical outcomes, and for any outcome other than mortality, the denominator for determining data completion excluded those patients who died before the outcome assessment."

      "title": "Data collection and analysis",
      "text": "We imported data from the 2008 review into the update database, and checked the data for accuracy. Extracted data included items as provided in the tables from the previous Cochrane review  (Haynes 2008) : the 'Characteristics of included studies' table  (i.e. methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, additional  notes pertaining to any one of the aforementioned items, detailed assessment of risk of bias), and the 'Adherence and outcome' table (i.e. clinical problem, intervention, control, effect on adherence outcome, effect on clinical outcome). We extracted the same items for new included studies. In addition, we extracted items from the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for all included studies from the previous and current update  (Higgins 2011) . Two review authors independently extracted all new data, and an adjudicator resolved disagreements. We contacted primary or corresponding authors of all included RCTs to confirm extracted data and provide missing data.\n\nWe quantified review author agreement on study 'Risk of bias' criteria using the unweighted Cohen's kappa (k) coefficient  (Fleiss 1981) . We carried out all analyses using SPSS, version 20.0. When reporting results from individual studies, we cited the measures of association and P values reported in the studies. We interpreted P value < 0.05 as indicating statistical significance. Due to the extreme heterogeneity in clinical conditions, participant selection criteria, medical regimens, interventions, adherence measures, and clinical outcome measures, pooling results according to any of these characteristics would still leave highly heterogeneous groups. In support of this, we refer to the meta-analysis reported by the Ascertaining Barriers for Compliance (ABC) project team, which exclusively focused on RCTs that measured adherence by means of electronic medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) and still found a very high heterogeneity of effects (I 2 = 98.88%)  (ABC Project Team 2012) . Pooling of effects in our review was further undermined by the frequent use of complex interventions, which was already problematic for categorizing intervention types in the previous update. Studies also had very heterogeneous clinical outcomes; they also o en lacked clearly defined primary outcomes. We could not justify even plotting intervention effects without pooling in meta-analysis, as this would imply some degree of comparability among the studies. Rather, as a best case alternative, we conducted a narrative analysis of the studies with the lowest risk of bias, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011), for study design (random sequence generation and concealment of allocation), and for their primary clinical outcome (blinding of outcome assessor, as relevant for the outcome in question). We did not require low risk of bias for the primary adherence measure, as this would have resulted in discussion of very few studies, as most adherence measures have a high or uncertain risk of bias, notably because of lack of blinding.\n\nWe reported intervention effects in individual RCTs for all outcomes for a) adherence and b) clinical outcomes. We reported effects in the RCTs identified as low risk of bias as described by the authors, with a focus on the primary outcomes, and with comments on methodological issues that might have influenced results, such as absence of correction for multiple comparisons. We considered adherence and clinical outcomes to be the primary outcome if they were:\n\n1. indicated to be the primary outcome by the study author; OR 2. used in the study power calculation; OR 3. the first outcome described in the 'Results' section of the article."

We excluded five previously included RCTs: in the course of this review update, we identified that two did not address self administered medication  (Canto De Cetina 2001; Ran 2003) , one had less than 80% follow-up  (Van Servellen 2005) , one reported no data for clinical outcome (van Es 2001), and one was confounded  (Piette 2001) . Therefore, we included a total of 182 RCTs in the current update. The overall number of RCT participants was 46,962. However, this overall number does not reflect the strength of the evidence base, considering that we could not meaningfully combine results of included studies. The newly added studies represent a growth in the knowledge base of 150% in the past six years, with more than twice the number of trials than we had predicted based on publication rates in the 2008 review.\n\nKey features of all 182 RCTs are summarized in the table Characteristics of included studies. The most frequently targeted conditions in all RCTs were:\n\n\u2022 HIV/AIDS (36); \u2022 psychiatric disorders (29); \u2022 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (27); \u2022 cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk (21); \u2022 hypertension (17); and \u2022 diabetes (16).\n\nThe remaining studies targeted:\n\n\u2022 dyslipidemia (6); \u2022 antibiotics (4); \u2022 arthritis (3); \u2022 complex chronic care (3); \u2022 dyspepsia (3); \u2022 glaucoma (2); \u2022 oral anticoagulation (2); \u2022 osteoporosis (2); \u2022 tuberculosis (2); \u2022 acne (1);\n\n\u2022 cancer (1); \u2022 hepatitis (1); \u2022 iron supplementation during pregnancy (1); \u2022 liver transplant (1); \u2022 malaria (1); \u2022 oral contraceptives (1); \u2022 tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy (1); and \u2022 ulcerative colitis (1).\n\nAmong the 109 new RCTs, 80 were from high-income countries (44 from USA), 17 from middle-income countries, five from low-income countries, and seven from unknown geographic locations (World Bank classification,  http://data.worldbank.org/  about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups ). In a majority of new RCTs (67) the adherence intervention targeted more than one medication, while 27 targeted one medication (the number of medications was unknown for the remaining 15 RCTs). There were substantive differences across studies in settings, clinical disorders, treatment regimens, adherence interventions, adherence measures, and clinical outcome measures, so that there was insufficient common ground for quantifying differences between groups or estimating pooled effect sizes that would permit meaningful quantitative analysis of findings across studies. Instead, we indicated which differences were statistically significant for adherence or clinical outcomes between the groups compared in each RCT (see Analysis 1.1). Of note, some of the negative results were unconvincing because of low statistical power: 44 RCTs did not meet the minimal required sample size of 60 patients per treatment group to detect an absolute difference of 25% in adherence with 80% power  (Haynes 2008) ."

Four of these trials also had low risk of bias for measuring adherence, so we discuss these first, with the most recently published studies first, then the remaining 13 studies, again, with newest studies first.\n\nGray 2012 randomized 127 patients with newly diagnosed ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma to an individually tailored adherence intervention or care as usual. The intervention was delivered by a glaucoma trained nurse with an initial session to assess patient needs, beliefs, and potential solutions, and to devise a one-year individualized care plan that involved education, training, liaising with and training for informal caregivers and professional health care providers, and planning approximately five face-to-face or phone follow-up contacts with the nurse for reassessment. From 12 to 24 months follow-up no intervention was provided and both groups had usual care. The intervention group had a higher proportion of patients with 100% refill adherence (70% versus 43%; P value = 0.002) as measured by low risk of bias practitioner and pharmacist report at 12 months. Intraocular pressure values and changes in management were recorded from routine medical care charts. The mean intraocular pressure, and fluctuations in ocular pressure and changes in management, were not different at 12 months. At 24 months, adherence was not measured. The mean intraocular pressure was almost identical in the two groups, but the fluctuation of intraocular pressure was higher and changes in management more frequent in the control group. It is possible that the differences at 24 months were found due to chance, especially as it is unlikely that a significant effect would be observed one year a er stopping the intervention, while no effect was observed a er one year of intensive intervention.\n\nSolomon 2012 sent seven informational mailings addressing osteoporosis to 2097 low-income older adults who were initiating osteoporosis medication, and randomized them to receive eight phone counseling sessions by health educators using motivational interviewing techniques to promote adherence, or the mailings alone. The phone counseling intervention did not significantly improve the primary outcome, adherence as measured by the median medication possession ratio using low risk of bias pharmacy claims data. Further, secondary outcomes including medication persistence, and proportions with self reported fractures or falls were not improved. The authors indicated that the 113-day time lag between identifying persons initiating therapy in the database and making the first phone call in the intervention group was a missed opportunity, since many eligible or recruited persons had already stopped therapy before the first call.\n\nChung 2011 randomized 400 newly diagnosed HIV patients who were candidates for highly active antiretroviral therapy to one of four treatment groups in a 2 x 2 factorial design: 1) three adherence counseling sessions within one month of therapy initiation, or 2) a visual and audible alarm device, programmed by staff, to carry at all times during six months, or 3) both adherence counseling and the alarm device, or 4) neither counseling nor the alarm device (control). Counseling sessions, which followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes, had no significant effect on the proportion of participants who achieved adherence \u2265 80% or \u2265 95%, as determined using low risk of bias pill counts at pharmacy refill visits, but resulted in a lower hazard rate of viral failure. The authors hypothesized that the clinical benefit of counseling could relate to providing the sessions in advance of, and just a er, therapy initiation. The alarm device did not improve the adherence or viral outcomes.\n\nHaynes 1976 randomly allocated, through the minimization method, 38 patients who were both hypertensive and nonadherent (less than 80% of prescribed pills) at the end of a six-month trial to an intensive adherence intervention or control. The intervention included care provided at the work site, special pill containers, counseling, reminders, self monitoring of adherence and blood pressure, support groups, feedback and reinforcement for adequate adherence and blood pressurelowering, all administered with bi-weekly contacts by a lay program"

At six months follow-up, there was a significantly higher adherence in the intervention group, as measured by low risk of bias unobtrusive home pill count. The change in diastolic blood pressure a er six months was not statistically significantly different between groups (difference in change 3.5 mm Hg; P value = 0.12), although the small sample size might have meant insufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful difference. The authors discussed the possibility that simply the increased attention for intervention patients could have contributed to the improved adherence, rather than the specific intervention components. It has to be noted that medical therapy for intervention patients was more o en intensified at the end of the study, while the intervention coordinator was not allowed to contact treating physicians.\n\nEllis 2012 tested whether an average of 5.6 months of multisystemic therapy (MST), a highly intensive, home-based, tailored family intervention, improved treatment adherence and HbA1c levels compared with weekly phone support during 4.9 months, among 146 poorly controlled adolescent diabetics (mean HbA1c = 11.7%, where good control would be an A1c of 7% for most patients). In MST, therapists were expected to meet with families, their related contacts (e.g. extended family, physicians, and school personnel), or both, a minimum of two times per week at the beginning of treatment with an option for a reduced number of sessions at the end of treatment based on family progress toward treatment goals. Treatment was planned to last for approximately six months. All participants in the trial received standard medical care in addition to MST or telephone support. At seven and 12 months follow-up, the intervention lowered HbA1c and improved adherence (Diabetes Management Scale) as reported by the parent, but not as reported by the adolescent. As the authors acknowledged, it has to be evaluated whether such an intensive intervention is cost-effective, especially as the difference in improvements in HbA1c were relatively small (e.g. A1c -0.74%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48% to -0.01%, at 12 months) in view of the poor control at baseline (A1c 11.7%).\n\nFarooq 2011 randomized 110 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to receive family supervised treatment (STOPS) or care as usual. In addition to usual care, participants in the STOPS arm each had a key care supervisor, defined as any family member living with the individual for at least six months and providing support for the treatment as identified by the participant. Education was provided to the key care supervisor about the nature of the illness, misconceptions about treatment, the relationship between supernatural and biological causes of illness (some people believing in supernatural causes might think they cannot do anything about the disease), and the importance of continuing the medication, as well as basic skills in how to administer and supervise the medication. It was emphasized that participants should not be antagonized and violence should never be used in case of refusal to accept the treatment. Steps involved in collecting medicine from the treatment center, storage at home, administering tablets and their ingestion by the participant and how to confirm this were demonstrated. Intervention participants also received free medicines while control group members were le to their own means to obtain their medications. The proportion of patients with perfect adherence, as measured by a five-point self report scale supplemented by pill count data, was higher at three and 12 months in the intervention group, but not at six months. Supervised therapy also improved symptoms as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale and Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale. However, it was unclear to what extent free provision of medication in the intervention group for the study contributed to the effect, since control patients could only apply for free drugs through a regular care process (not for the study), if eligible.\n\nMorgado 2011 randomized 197 patients with arterial hypertension, who had been on antihypertensive therapy for at least six months, to receive either counseling from a hospital pharmacist at a specialized outpatient clinic, or regular care at a traditional hospital clinic without a hospital pharmacist. Hospital pharmacists interviewed patients, assessed problems with blood pressure control, educated patients, advised physicians on medication changes, and provided intervention patients with written educational material. Patients in the intervention group were also encouraged to bring all empty blisters and boxes of antihypertensive medication to clinic visits for recycling and to verify compliance with therapy. The intervention improved the primary outcome of proportion of patients with blood pressure controlled to target, and reduced the proportion of patients with low medication adherence as measured by a five-item questionnaire. The medical therapy advice from pharmacists to physicians might have contributed to the improved blood pressure control in addition to the improved adherence, although the authors report that there were no marked differences compared with the control group regarding therapy changes.\n\nLester 2010 randomized 538 patients newly initiating antiretroviral therapy, and who had access to a mobile phone and, if required, a partner able to read educational materials, to receive interactive short message service (SMS) or care as usual. Patients in the intervention group received a short education session on the intervention from clinicians, received an SMS every Monday asking \"How are you?\", and were required to respond within 48 hours to indicate that everything was fine or they had a problem. In case of no response within 48 hours or an indicated problem, the clinician called the patient. The intervention was based on existing mobile phone services and SMS messages were sent by available nurses or clinical officers; no personnel or SMS credits were provided specifically for the study. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the intervention improved the proportion of patients with self reported adherence greater than 95% as well as viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml).

Regarding peer support, clinic staff selected peer supporters who were also HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy, and had a high therapy adherence, regularly attended clinic visits, were socially skilled, and were able to participate in training and supervision. Peers were, as much as possible, matched to participants based on race/ethnicity, sex, and sexual orientation. During three months, aiming to use twice-monthly group meetings and thrice-weekly phone calls, peer supporters addressed barriers to medication adherence and potential solutions. Patients could choose to continue attending meetings and seeking assistance a er three months. The three months pager intervention involved automated individually tailored interactive messaging, addressing medication adherence, education, entertainment, and adherence measurement. Messaging frequency could be tailored to the patient's preference with a minimum of three daily messages in the first two months, which was tapered in the third month. At three months, the only significant effect was for self reported adherence in the peer support group, compared with care as usual. No effects were found of either peer support or the pager intervention on self reported adherence, electronically monitored adherence, and viral load and CD4 count as reported in routine medical charts, at six and nine months. The one significant effect was likely a chance finding, considering the testing of multiple outcomes at different time points and the absence of confirmation by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). The authors discussed that the lack of an effect could be related to the poor use of the intervention by participants, the high quality of usual care in this HIV-specialized clinic, and the inclusion of all patients on therapy rather than those with adherence problems only.\n\nSimoni 2007 randomized 136 HIV-positive patients with prescribed antiretroviral therapy to receive a peer-led social support intervention or standard care. The three months peer support intervention was of similar design to the intervention for Simoni 2009, with the difference that in the present study patients could not choose to continue attending meetings and seeking assistance a er three months. The intervention did not improve adherence as measured by self report and MEMS, nor did it lower HIV-1 RNA viral load values as routinely reported in medical charts, at three and six months follow-up. The authors discussed the possibility that the lack of an effect could relate to the poor use of the intervention by participants due to multiple barriers-including poverty, substance abuse, and insufficient time to establish trust between patient and peer supporter-limiting consistent attendance at meetings and receiving phone calls for adherence.\n\nWu 2006 tested the effect on adherence and mortality of pharmacist phone counseling, addressing medication adherence, lifestyle, and the next follow-up visit, versus usual care, among nonadherent stable patients on five or more chronic medications. Of 442 randomized patients, 236 had become adherent since screening. Adherence was measured by pharmacists using a structured questionnaire in combination with medication dispensing information: taking 80% to 120% of prescribed pills was considered adherent. A proportion of all medications for which the patient was adherent was calculated, but it was unclear how this was used since the authors only distinguished adherent and non-adherent. A er receiving six to eight pharmacist calls during two years, the intervention group had fewer baseline nonadherent patients who remained non-adherent, and more baseline adherent patients who remained adherent. The phone counseling intervention also reduced the risk of all-cause mortality from 18% to 11% (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.97; P value = 0.039). Considering that mortality is hard to improve solely with an adherence intervention, and the confidence interval for the relative risk is wide, this result needs to be replicated.\n\nWeber 2004 randomized 60 HIV patients, who were stable on a combination of at least three antiretroviral medications and had a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml, to a cognitive behavioral intervention or standard care. Patients in the intervention group were given contact information for a psychotherapist, and asked to schedule a first appointment. The psychotherapist and patient determined a visit schedule for the year, with a minimum of two sessions and maximum of 25 (median was 11). In addition, they would identify at least two treatment goals, of which medication adherence was one, which would be targeted with treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. The proportion of patients with adherence of 95% or greater as measured by MEMS, and self reported adherence as measured on a visual analog scale, was higher in the intervention group at 10 to 12 months, but the regression coefficients for change in MEMS adherence during the study were not different between intervention and control. Viral load and CD4 count were not different between groups, but the intervention group showed an improvement in mental state, as measured by a standardized questionnaire on experience and behavior. This study was designed as a feasibility study, with no reported sample size calculation, and it is unclear to what extent the study was powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes, or if significant effects would remain a er correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nLaporte 2003 randomized 86 patients who were hospitalized for a thromboembolic disease and needed oral anticoagulation for at least three months, to either intensive education or standard education on anticoagulation. Patients in the intervention group received visual educational material, daily visits from healthcare providers, and daily tests on their education for the duration of the hospitalization, all aimed at the importance of medication adherence and causes of anticoagulation instability. Control group patients received standard education without any of these features for the entire duration of hospitalization. Following discharge, no differences were found regarding correct bottle openings, timing of bottle openings or pill count, all measured using MEMS. In addition, no differences were found regarding the clinical effect of anticoagulants, e.g. proportion of values or the proportion of days the INR (international normalized ratio) values were within the therapeutic target range. The study used a factorial design and also randomized patients to anticoagulation with either warfarin or acenocoumarol, but these medication groups did not differ"

Intervention patients received a detailed 15-minute pharmacist counseling session at the start of therapy, addressing side effects, the importance of completing therapy, potential barriers and coping strategies related to adherence, and encouragement to call the pharmacist in case of problems, as well as a standard phone call by the pharmacist a er two to three days. Patients in the control group received a standard five-minute pharmacist counseling session at therapy initiation, describing the proper protocol to take the medication and providing an opportunity to ask questions. Self reported medication adherence and Helicobacter pylori eradication rate, as measured by carbon 14 urea breath test, were not different between the intervention and control groups at three months. The authors indicated that the lack of an effect could relate to enrolment of motivated patients who were doing well at baseline, the use of daily blister packs in all patients, which might have enhanced adherence, or spill-over of the intervention to the control group due to the same pharmacists applying the two treatments, both of which included counseling.\n\nNazareth 2001 randomized 362 hospitalized patients over 75 years, who were taking more than four medications at discharge, to either an intensive or a standard pharmacist discharge plan. Patients in the intervention group received an assessment by a hospital pharmacist, who evaluated therapy appropriateness and the patient's ability to manage the medications, and educated patients on appropriate adherence and how to liaise with important healthcare providers. An individualized discharge plan was devised containing the patient's medications and required adherence support, and copies were given to the patient and an assigned community pharmacist, family physician and other involved providers. A er 7 to 14 days the community pharmacist visited the patient at home to reassess therapy adherence and barriers, and intervene and schedule additional follow-up visits as deemed appropriate. Control group patients received standard discharge procedures by a hospital pharmacist, including a letter to the family physician. No differences were found at three and six months for hospital readmission, death, outpatient clinic visits, and family physician visits, nor for self reported measures including general well-being, satisfaction, adherence, medication knowledge, and medication hoarding. This study included old and high-risk patients, of whom 11% had a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 15 or less at baseline and 15% died during six months, leaving 74% of participants for interview on self reported measures at six months.\n\nWalley 2001 tested the effect of direct observation of therapy, and randomized 497 new sputum-positive tuberculosis patients to one of three arms: 1) direct observation by health workers six days per week during two months, 2) direct observation by family members, 3) self administered therapy, obtained by bi-weekly visits to a health facility. At seven to eight months, both direct observation intervention groups had comparable rates to the control group for the outcomes of cure (sputum-negative on two most recent occasions) and cure or treatment completion (no smear results on at least two occasions, but treatment completed). The authors indicated that the lack of an effect might be due to challenges such as the high rate of patients not being able to comply with direct observation of therapy by health workers, and the implementation of interventions for this study on top of a recently strengthened tuberculosis care system."

      "text": "The current review updated our 2008 version, Haynes 2008, with 109 new RCTs, a substantially larger number than expected from previous publication rates. To our knowledge this is the only comprehensive (not restricted to specific settings, medications, or diseases) systematic review of interventions to improve medication adherence based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed both adherence and clinical outcomes. Despite the more than two-fold increase in the knowledge base, the interventions and findings of these RCTs only slightly alter the conclusions of the previous version of our review. Compared with the previous update, we now: 1) report a lack of convincing evidence among studies with the lowest risk of bias; 2) no longer try to classify studies according to intervention type; 3) make our database available for collaboration on sub-analyses. The wide variety of settings, participants, intervention types, medications, adherence measures, and clinical outcomes precluded summarizing findings to reach reliable general conclusions. RCTs included in the current review reported effects that were inconsistent from study to study. A minority of lowest risk of bias RCTs reported improving both adherence and clinical outcome, but these typically had very complex interventions that would be difficult to implement in usual practice setting. Thus, as a qualitative generalization, methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems tested to date are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized. Therefore, the quest for effective and practical interventions to promote medication adherence and improve clinical outcomes must continue. In acknowledgement of the need for collective advancement, we make our database available for collaboration on sub-analyses.\n\nTo the extent that they represent true innovation, the increase of trials is most encouraging. Even when outcomes were improved, however, the effects were generally small. Effects were seldom assessed on major clinical events such as death or hospitalization, and when done these were rarely significant, albeit possibly due to insufficient study power. The diversity, complexity, and uncertain effects of the interventions, as well as the o en uncertain risk of bias for blinding treatment allocation and outcomes assessment, make generalizations about which interventions work and which do not problematic."

      "text": "Since the last update, some new or little studied intervention types have been reported. Although the technologies have been around for a while, we were now able to include several RCTs testing the effect of mobile text messages  (Simoni 2009; Hou 2010; Lester 2010; Boker 2012; Zolfaghari 2012) , and remote internet-based treatment support  (Chan 2007; van der Meer 2009) . Of the five RCTs testing the effect of mobile text messages, two were included in the lowest risk of bias group. Only Lester 2010 showed a significant effect, on antiretroviral therapy adherence and the clinical outcome of viral load in HIV patients. There may be potential to build on the opportunities provided by text messaging, including in lowresource settings. Simoni 2009 also targeted HIV patients, but did not show an effect of pager messages on adherence or viral load. The remaining three RCTs testing mobile text messages for oral contraceptives, acne therapy, and diabetes were not included in the lowest risk of bias group, and none had an effect on both adherence and the clinical outcome  (Hou 2010; Boker 2012; Zolfaghari 2012) . Further, Chan 2007, a study not included in the lowest risk of bias group, tested internet-based asthma telemonitoring for patients of 6 to 17 years, but found no effect on adherence or clinical outcomes. van der Meer 2009 tested internet-based asthma self management plus education among adults, whereby communication could also be done using mobile text messaging if preferred, and found no improvement in medication adherence, only moderate improvements in asthma control and lung function, and no clinically significant improvements in asthma-related quality of life and exacerbations. Further, no other RCTs testing the effect of internet-based disease telemonitoring made it through our selection process. Although both technologies have great potential to reach large population groups to improve adherence, further rigorous testing is necessary. Ongoing studies might strengthen the knowledge base and provide more details on how they could be better utilized. The present examples overall do not change our conclusion from the previous update that adherence research is lagging behind the rapid developments in technology, and that research methodology and evidence on their optimal use remain weak.\n\nAllied healthcare providers such as nurses and pharmacists are increasingly delivering part of, or the entire intervention. In our previous update we advised further exploration of their role, and hypothesized that if their roles can be expanded to include counseling patients to enhance medication adherence, this may be feasible in practice. Considering that physicians have limited time, and sometimes skills, to counsel patients on medication adherence repeatedly, shi ing these tasks to allied providers seems reasonable and potentially cost-effective. Several complex interventions involving allied providers were effective, but since they were o en only part of the intervention and delivered a variety of intervention enhancing services, their efficacy has to be determined for specific roles and tasks. In addition to the role of allied health professionals, several studies tested family/ social interventions, lay health mentoring, or group meetings. It seems worthwhile to explore further involving non-professional personnel, since the patient's social context is important to optimize chronic care, and might improve cost-effectiveness.\n\nAs mentioned, complex interventions were o en used in the new RCTs, typically involving intensive ongoing allied health care provider and social support, sometimes facilitating transitions in care. This seems logical considering that adherence is generally a complicated matter caused by multi-factorial barriers (ABC Project Team 2012; Kardas 2013), but also raises three primary concerns:\n\n1. complex interventions are usually compared with care as usual, while it remains to be seen if they are more effective than a simple intervention; 2. if effective, the entire complex intervention should be implementable in other settings, without requirement of excessive additional personnel and costs (implementation flexibility and external validity); and 3. if the latter is not feasible, the effects of individual components should be teased out, such as by a factorial design, in order to be able to determine if all components were required or to select the most effective ones.\n\nRelated to complexity, many RCTs used personnel and resources supported by research funds. For example, pharmacists would be specifically allocated to the intervention and reimbursed accordingly, but outside this research setting they might not be able or willing to dedicate this time to the intervention.

Regarding this, few adequate full costeffectiveness evaluations of adherence RCTs are being published (Oberje 2013). These will be needed if clinically important effects are documented.\n\nProcess evaluation of an effective complex intervention can be very useful to hypothesize which components were most effective and to identify individual or contextual barriers and facilitators to adherence  (Craig 2008) . However, we believe that this eventually requires direct comparison in an RCT, compared with usual care or a simple intervention. Two RCTs in the lowest risk of bias group, Simoni 2009 and Chung 2011, applied two different adherence interventions in a factorial design. This design allows testing of the separate effects of multiple intervention components, while also observing their additive effect. This will better inform which components are independently effective, or whether an effect is due to the combination of two components that individually might not be (very) effective. It has to be noted that to be able to test several components and their interactions with sufficient power, the required sample size has to be increased accordingly  (McAlister 2003) .\n\nOf note, the European Ascertaining Barriers for Compliance project published its final report in 2013 (Demonceau 2013), which also included a comprehensive systematic review including intervention RCTs assessing adherence outcome by means of electronically compiled measures. The authors used a taxonomy to label intervention components and tried to tease out the effect of each component, although they acknowledged that many interventions were complex, highly variable, and not easily summarized. Of the 65 included RCTs, 32 also assessed clinical outcome, with only four showing an effect on clinical outcome."

      "text": "There are likely many potential areas for which interventions are either in development or lacked high-quality RCT evidence with adherence and clinical outcomes at the time of our search. We will illustrate this with a selected example regarding cardiovascular prevention single-pill combination therapies, also since a recent Cochrane systematic review by Ryan et al showed promise for simplified dosing (Ryan 2014). Several of these combination pills, containing multiple proven cardiovascular medications, have already been developed and tested versus the same medications as individual therapies (Working Group on the Summit of Combination Therapy). These pills simplify therapy to only one pill per day, where most cardiovascular patients currently have to take at least four to five separate pills daily. The RCTs testing combination pills typically assessed effects on therapy persistence (e.g. not explicitly discontinuing), rather than daily pill adherence while still on medications, in addition to intermediate clinical outcomes such as blood pressure. However, an RCT published a er our search showed that self reported adherence as well as intermediate clinical outcomes (blood pressure, lipid levels) were somewhat improved with a cardiovascular combination pill  (Thom 2013) . That said, medication was provided free to the combination pill intervention group, while control group participants had to fend for themselves in acquiring their medications (almost half lacked insurance coverage), leaving uncertainty as to whether the improved adherence was due to simplified therapy or facilitated access to medication and cost-lowering. This study would be a candidate to make it into our next update, but the provision of polypills free of charge constitutes a more complex intervention than the authors highlighted. As a related example, in our previous review we indicated that there is some evidence that a dose frequency of one to two times per day may be associated with better adherence than three to four times per day, and advised better exploration of this dose frequency. None of the new RCTs with the lowest risk of bias addressed this issue, and we would like to highlight this important issue."

      "text": "To determine applicability to patient care, we only selected studies that measured both adherence and treatment outcome. This requirement has received the criticism that this resulted in a more negative message than some would like to see. It has been suggested that the findings would be more upbeat and positive if we included studies that measured only adherence. This criticism does not pertain to the purpose of this review, that is, to determine whether adherence interventions make a difference to clinical outcomes. It simply cannot be assumed that measures to increase adherence do more good than harm, even if they increase adherence. Nevertheless, we do agree that investigators who seek to advance the methods for enhancing adherence may find promising leads from studies that do not meet our criteria for measurement of both adherence and clinical outcomes.\n\nAttempts to increase adherence can have adverse effects (loss of privacy and autonomy, increased adverse effects of treatments)  (Simpson 2006) , and so on. Few RCTs assessed such potential adverse effects. Further, many interventions with an effect on adherence and surrogate clinical outcomes measured relatively short-term outcomes, typically at 6 to 12 months, which does not mean that their effect would be sustained or that they would lead to important clinical outcomes in the long run."

      "text": "A well-known problem with adherence studies is the inability to measure adherence accurately and reliably, making it harder to pick up true differences, which could have contributed to the variable effects we observed among RCTs. Most studies used patient self report measures, which are known to overestimate adherence  (Gordis 1979; Haynes 1980; Stephenson 1993) ; these studies are at especially high risk of bias when the patient is not blinded to the treatment allocation, which is usually the case. Some validated questionnaires are available, and should be used as much as possible if self report is chosen, but their accuracy and reliability are o en limited and depend on the context they are used in.\n\nIncreasingly, studies are using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) pill bottle caps. These caps contain a microchip that measures the date and time at which the bottles are opened, but do not register if the patient actually took the medication on those occasions. Although this method is more objective than self report, it could also function as an intervention (patients feel monitored) (Christensen 2009), and increase adherence in both groups, thus diminishing or concealing a true difference. It can also be 'gamed' by the patient who is aware of the MEMS function and wishes to keep non-adherence private.\n\nA potentially more objective measure that was used in some studies was pill count, which is especially appealing if it is done unannounced, at home, and in an unobtrusive way, in order to"

However, most pill counts are done on containers that the patient brings with them to a visit to a health professional, and in this circumstance counts can clearly be altered by the patient.\n\nA method that was regularly used, and that probably has the highest likelihood of maintaining blinding of patients and providers, was the use of routine pharmacy refill records. Although this method depends on the assumption that the patient is actually consuming the medication, and the only one doing so, it better allows adequate blinding of outcome assessors. In our view, using more objective measures such as pharmacy records is a productive step forward in the field of adherence research, as it will lead to further valid and reliable results. With electronic records available in most pharmacies, this option is increasingly available, inexpensive, and acceptable, providing that patient consent is obtained.\n\nIt is important to note that our review may miss the most severe form of non-adherence, among those who do not attend for needed care or enter trials. Patients dropping out of care are unlikely to be receiving any medication, and if those in care average about 50% adherence, keeping patients in care is arguably the most important adherence intervention at present. The same rationale can be used for keeping patients on medication, even if they do not attend clinic visits. Both assume, however, that for those who are prevented from dropping out or discontinuing medication, or who are returned to care or restart medication by intervention, adherence rates are sufficient to achieve clinically important benefits. This merits further testing."

      "text": "Consistent with the large variety in diseases and medications, many different clinical outcomes were reported. Most RCTs measured intermediate biological outcomes, such as blood pressure, serum cholesterol or HIV-1 RNA, or patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life, knowledge, beliefs, or attitudes. Very few studies examined major, patient-important, clinical endpoints such as death or hospitalization. The latter have the lowest risk of bias, as they are obvious and can easily be verified. Intermediate biological outcomes also o en have a low risk of bias, although this could be compromised if measurement methods differ among subjects, and outcome assessors are not blinded. For example, measuring blood pressure requires a protocol whereby a fixed number of measurements are taken according to a standardized process, and a provider who is aware of a participant being in the intervention group might (subconsciously or otherwise) alter this process or interpret readings differently. Self reported outcomes such as symptoms and quality of life are more prone to bias, even if using well-validated general and disease-specific tools to assess them. Finally, many studies reported self reported knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, o en in addition to more objective clinical outcomes. Although these types of outcomes can be used to further clarify mechanisms of effects, they are o en not validated or inadequately validated, are prone to self report or observer bias, and their measurement varies with time and clinical care experiences which limits their reliability."

      "text": "Many RCTs had inadequate power to detect a meaningful difference in adherence, and this did not seem to be improved among newly identified RCTs. As a general guide, studies with a single intervention group and control group would need to include at least 60 participants per group if they are to have at least 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 25% in the proportion of patients judged to have adequate adherence. According to this rule, the new RCTs were as likely to be underpowered (40% (44/109)) as RCTs in the previous update, and even among the 17 lowest risk of bias RCTs in the present update, four had insufficient power  (Haynes 1976; Laporte 2003; Weber 2004; Farooq 2011) . For example, in a study of 38 patients  (Haynes 1976) , there was a significant increase in adherence associated with the intervention and an interesting within-group reduction of blood pressure within the intervention group. However, the difference between the intervention and control groups for blood pressure change was not statistically significant. Underpowered studies are more likely to miss a meaningful difference in adherence, even when improving adherence substantially, and showing an effect on clinical outcomes is likely even harder. This is especially true for major events. If RCTs with hundreds or thousands of participants are needed to show that the medication has an effect on major outcomes compared with usual care, it is unlikely that improving adherence among patients who are prescribed the medication will have a substantial effect on major outcomes in a small sample size."

In particular, details of the methods of random sequence generation, concealment of treatment allocation, and blinding of the outcome assessors as relevant for the outcomes were o en not reported, and therefore we could not determine the risk of bias. As a consequence, it is possible that some of RCTs that we excluded from our narrative actually had a low risk of bias, but we were unable to determine this based on the manuscript, supplements, and (absence of) author response. The importance of adequate reporting is further illustrated by the initially included RCTs that were eventually discarded due to less than 80% follow-up a er repeated detailed review. The way these studies were reported was sometimes confusing for something as simple as follow-up rate, and the full picture was only revealed a er reading all the details, tables, figures, or supplements. Examples appear in the listing of studies excluded for cause in this review.\n\nTreatment arms, both intervention and control, were also not always described in sufficient detail. For example, while the report might state clearly that patients received reminders, the method of administering the reminder program might not be described, or might be described in some part of the text other than the section on the intervention. Most studies paid research staff to administer interventions, raising issues in generalizability to usual practice settings. This also raised the issue of attribution in many studies: if the control group received 'usual care', there would be no 'attention control' in the study and any effects observed could be due to either the intervention proper or simply the nonspecific effects of increased attention paid to the intervention group. Furthermore, some studies reported that the patients in the control group received 'usual care', but did not describe what that encompassed. If the standard medical care is already performing relatively well, it will be harder to show an improvement with the intervention. Therefore, to understand the trial results better, it is recommended to provide sufficient details on the intervention design and delivery, the assumed change process the intervention"

Among these 17 RCTs, only five improved both adherence and clinical outcome, which is comparable to the rate found among the 21 new RCTs in our previous update. If there is a common thread to these interventions, it is that they are complex and use frequent interaction with patients with a focus on adherence. However, these complex strategies for improving adherence with long-term medication prescriptions are not very effective, despite the amount of effort and other resources they can consume. There is insufficient evidence at present to conclude that newer intervention types, such as mobile text messaging and Internet-based care, can assist in improving adherence. There is no evidence that low adherence can be 'cured'.

Frameworks to assist in the development of complex interventions therefore advise preparatory qualitative assessments involving patients and other stakeholders, to understand better the problems and context  (Craig 2008) .\n\nDespite the steep increase in number of RCTs, the field of adherence improvement research has persistent methodological weaknesses. Rather than increasing the volume of research while repeating weaknesses, several study methodology issues need to be addressed to ensure that we are not missing any true effects or creating false positive findings. Investigators should make use of best-in-class adherence measures, such as prescription monitoring. More objective measures for adherence are needed to accurately determine intervention effects. Patients should be recruited because their adherence is low, not just because they are willing to participate. Researchers should design studies to minimize risk of bias as much as possible and clearly report their procedures, especially concerning co-interventions, such as additional staff supported by research funds. Another priority is attaining sufficient study power for clinical outcomes that are important to patients. Around 40% of all studies were underpowered, with less than 60 patients per treatment group, and this was a comparable rate to the previous update. Smaller studies may be appropriate until an innovation appears to have clinically"

At that point, the innovation should be tested in more substantial trials to document effects on clinically important outcomes (including adverse effects), feasibility in usual practice settings, and sustainability. If complex interventions show positive effects, it would be appropriate to test their components in factorial studies.\n\nA cure for non-adherence is nowhere to be seen, but treatments that obviate the need for ongoing adherence, such as implantable treatments with minimal adverse effects (e.g. intrauterine devices) could be worth pursuing. Intervention components that could be explored further include well-established and newer information and communication technologies on top of regular care, and specific or co-ordinated roles for allied health professionals.\n\nFinally, it is essential that researchers stop re-inventing the poorly performing 'wheels' of adherence interventions that we have seen to date. It seems that most adherence research is performed by clinicians and others who discover adherence problems while working within the context of the management of a specific disease condition, such as cardiovascular risk, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and the like. Low adherence with medications is a ubiquitous problem, found with self administered treatments for all medical conditions. Without considering what has been studied across disease conditions, researchers will find themselves with inadequate knowledge of what does not work, and will be unable to avoid repeating the painful lessons of adherence research to date. Rather, we need to begin with interventions that have shown some promise, or at least have not been tested with repeatedly negative results. The methods and innovations of adherence research must advance if we are to be able to help patients enjoy the benefits of modern therapeutics."

The support included the application of basic counseling skills including listening and validating the traumatic events, encouraging participants to take their medication, to seek support from family and friends, to attend formal counseling services, to read the pamphlet, use the diary, and return to the clinic for follow-up medication Control: STANDARD CARE Standard care consisted of psychological containment, medical examination, and collection of forensic evidence; HIV testing with pre-and post-test counseling; providing emergency contraception, treatment of sexually transmitted infections and PEP for HIV. Follow-up was arranged to collect further HIV PEP medication. All patients had an interactive information session to explain the content of the pamphlet, answer questions, and demonstrate initiation of the use of the medication diary. The pamphlet contained specific information about taking PEP after a sexual assault; a diary for the 28-day period on which pill taking was to be marked and contact information on support services.

Patients who were randomized to the intervention group were educated on their illness and their medication in a structured fashion, including discussion on risk of diabetes complications, proper dosage, side effects and storage of medications, healthy lifestyle and management of diabetes mellitus signs and symptoms through self monitoring. A printed leaflet to assist with the education program was developed and the patient was given a copy to take home. Supplementary leaflets containing information about hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also given to the patients if they suffered from these conditions. The educational advice was reinforced when patients came to the hospital pharmacy to collect their prescribed medicines on their monthly schedule. In addition, behavioral modification aspects of the Pharmacist Care intervention involved advice on the following: self monitoring of glycemic control (patients were encouraged to monitor their blood glucose levels 3 times per day, to record these values and bring a record book to all subsequent appointments); physical exercise (this involved initiation of an exercise plan that could be incorporated into the patient's daily schedule, after taking into consideration their level of fitness, e.g. 1-hour walk daily; diet (the patient was assisted with the identification of dietary behavior that adversely influences blood glucose control, lipid levels, weight management, and of the times of day when the patient was most vulnerable to overeating, and given improved understanding of the relative effects of certain food choices on blood glucose control); medication adherence (patients were asked about any problems that they had encountered with regard to taking their medication and were offered education and practical help to encourage them to take the medicines prescribed for them by their physician); and smoking cessation (patients were encouraged to stop smoking by advising them about the danger of smoking to health, with emphasis on the increased dangers of smoking in diabetic patients)\n\nControl: USUAL CARE Control group participants received normal care from medical and nursing staff.

Only 2 electronic monitors that measure the time and date of ICS use were available at the time of the study. Although no commercial monitor was available for fluticasone-salmeterol, the most frequent ICS prescribed to subjects during the study period, we were able to use the Diskus Adherence Logger (DAL). Fluticasone and beclomethasone administered by means of metered-dose inhalers were the next most frequently prescribed; for these, we used a commercial monitor, MDILog (Life Link Monitoring, Inc, Kingston, NY).\n\nApproximately 90% of study participants were prescribed an ICS that could be monitored with the DAL or MDILog. 14 patients were initially prescribed inhaled mometasone, but they were switched to a medication that could be monitored, fluticasone, during the study period with their physician's permission.\n\nWe truncated adherence at 100% for each monitoring period to control for multiple actuations over a very short period of time and to provide a better measure of adherence\n\nThe patient outcomes were asthma-related quality of life, asthma control, FEV1, hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Asthma-related quality of life (AQOL) was measured at visits 1, 5, and 8 with the Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. This 15-item questionnaire, reflecting well-being over the past 2 weeks, has a 7-point response scale that provides a mean summary score. A 0.5-unit change is considered clinically meaningful. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire has been shown to be a useful indicator of AQOL in low-income adults. Asthma control was measured at each visit by using the 7item version of the Asthma Control Questionnaire, which asks about symptoms over the past week. The score is the mean of all responses (0, total control; 6, extremely uncontrolled). The minimal important clinical difference is 0.5. A score of greater than 1.5 is considered inadequate control. Spirometry was obtained by using American Thoracic Society procedures for FEV1 and FVC.

Measurement of healthcare outcomes: 4 status scales were employed in assessing healthcare outcomes: the first assessed the severity of asthma symptoms during the past 7 days, the next focused on psychological/psychosomatic aspects of asthma (whether the patients were 'bothered' by asthma in the past 7 days), the next scale assessed the number of episodes of respiratory problems/diseases experienced in the last 3 months, and the final scale measured whether asthma had interfered with the patients' lives in the last 3 months (prevented them from doing something)\n\nNotes -"

As well, standard computer procedures were employed to create a stratified, blocked randomization schedule, which consisted of block sizes of 6 to ensure 2 out of every 6 patients in each stratum were assigned to each group. Immediately following randomization, staff collected baseline data and implemented the designated educational treatment\n\nBailey 1999 Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Participants All subjects were patients in the clinics of the UAB Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine with a primary diagnosis of asthma who met the following diagnostic criteria: (1) recurrent episodes of dyspnea or wheezing, (2) objective evidence of significantly increased resistance to airflow during episodes, (3) objective evidence of improvement in airflow when symptom-free, and (4) moderate to severe (rather than mild) asthma as assessed by their asthma care physician. New and current patients were included in the study; although patients who had participated in the earlier self management study were excluded Interventions UAB Asthma Self Management Program (n = 78): the core component of the UAB Asthma Self Management Program (ASMP) was a skill-oriented self help workbook, which patients were counseled about in a one-on-one session and during 2 asthma support group meetings. The workbook included information on physiology of asthma, asthma medications, identification and avoidance of triggers, detection of and response to asthma attacks, and asthma care services. The 1-hour counseling session included reviewing the workbook content and skills, identifying personal expectations, asthma triggers, and barriers to adherence, and practicing inhaler use until patients were able to do so correctly. Patients were also given peak flow meters and trained to use them for early detection of impending asthma attacks. Asthma support groups, facilitated by a health educator, consisted of 4 to 6 patients with asthma and, if possible, asthma control partners (spouses or close friends). Support group meetings were held once each month many patients came every month. Patients were encouraged to share asthma concerns, discuss adherence problems, and exchange patient-initiated solutions. Patients received 2 telephone calls and a follow-up letter at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, after the counseling session. The first telephone call allowed the discussion of problems and to collect baseline peak flow readings and to help determine their expected peak flow rates. The letter reinforced actions to take at different levels of peak flow readings. The second telephone call provided closure for the intervention. Overall, the intervention spanned about 6 to 8 weeks for patients. UAB Core-Elements Program (n = 76): this program consisted of a revised, shortened workbook that was given to patients. It was reviewed in a brief (15 to 20 minutes) one-to-one counseling session. Patients were trained to use inhalers and peak flow meters and rehearsed until these devices were used correctly. A follow-up telephone counseling session was conducted approximately one week later to review the patient's medication regimen and inhaler and peak flow meter skills. 2 weeks later, a follow-up letter was sent to patients, stressing the importance of adhering to the prescribed regimen and responding immediately to a drop in peak flow rate or other early signs of an attack Usual-care control group (n = 78): patients received the education that was the standard practice of their physician. They also received a standardized set of pamphlets that contained information about asthma. No steps were taken to ensure that patients read the pamphlets, and no special counseling, support groups, or telephone calls were provided Outcomes Compliance was measured using 2 4-item self reports, which were based on the prototype self report scale described by Morisky et al but were modified to be more applicable to asthma. The psychometric characteristics of the asthma therapy adherence scales were good to excellent. Adherence was analyzed in terms of the percentage of subjects with the highest possible scores on these scales. 4 clinical outcome measures addressed asthma status, specifically, the impact of asthma on respiratory symptoms and illnesses, functional status, and use of healthcare services. 2 scales addressed the severity of asthma symptoms in the past 7 days and the number of respiratory illnesses in the past 3 months. The functional impairment scale assessed the extent to which asthma had a negative impact on daily activities in the past 3 months. The scale for measurement of use of healthcare services classified patients as users if they had visited an emergency department for asthma and/or been hospitalized for asthma in the past 6 months. Other patients were classifies as nonusers. These measures also analyzed the percentage of subjects who obtained the highest possible score as users Notes -"

Families were trained to use the diaries and peak flow meters. Family Co-ordinators regularly called families to discuss their diary records. The second workshop used patients' diary records as illustrations of the relative effectiveness of controller medicines over rescue/quick-relief drugs in preventing asthma symptoms over time. Participants reviewed their own records of medicines and symptoms. The third workshop described asthma management as a 2-pronged effort of pharmacotherapy and trigger control. Between the first and second workshops, the Family Co-ordinator prepared families for their doctor visit.

Compliance rates with prescriptions for physical exercise and with endurance activity regiments (walking, swimming, bicycling) were measured by questionnaire. Compliance with prescriptions for energy conservation was measured by questioning whether patients spread their activities over the day to prevent fatigue. A test for joint protection performance was used as an indication for the level of compliance with the prescription of joint protection. Patients were asked to perform actions, representing relevant ergonomic principles. The test score ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents a poor performance and a 10 good performance Notes -"

The intervention consists of 3 45-to 60-minute group sessions, and individual tailored coaching sessions held at least once per week for 5 weeks. Sessions were delivered by trained health educators during the school day. In addition to teaching asthma management skills and ways to cope with asthma, the health educators encouraged students to see their medical provider for a clinical evaluation and treatment. The individual sessions reinforced the educational messages taught in the group, helped students identify and overcome barriers to managing their asthma, and coached students regarding their medical visits. The health educator offered to accompany the student to the medical visit to provide moral support, coaching, or advocacy when coaching failed. Medical providers received a presentation by experts in person or by telephone about a recommended change in therapy. The medical providers were first mailed a packet containing: a letter informing them that one of their patients was in the study and would be referred to him/her for a clinical evaluation; a blank asthma checklist the students complete throughout the intervention and bring to the visit with the provider; and a blank asthma action plan the provider is asked to complete.

(pg 1004) \"\n\nThe study has several limitations. We relied primarily on self reported data and did not corroborate self report data with objective data. Therefore, the potential self report bias found in our school attendance data may also be present in our other outcome data. Similarly, our case detection was by self report and thus has the potential for misclassification bias.\n\nBecause we targeted those with moderate and severe persistent asthma, the chance of enrolling a student who did not have asthma was low. However, we may have had false-negatives, missing students in need. Although recruitment of eligible students exceeded that in other asthma trials with urban adolescents (15), just less than 40% of eligible youth were not enrolled; this limits the extrapolation of study results to a larger population of urban, minority high school students with moderate to severe persistent asthma. We are also unable to extrapolate study results to other populations of high school students with asthma (e.g., white suburban adolescents with mild asthma) because we limited enrollment to minority youth with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The control group was a wait-list control group who received no attention. Although unlikely, it is possible that treatment benefits of ASMA were due to \"nonspecific therapeutic factors\", including the effects of attention and positive regard received by those in the intervention condition. At the same time, treatment differences may have been mitigated (1) if the consent process and/ or surveys fostered attention to treating asthma in the control students;\n\n(2) if participants received interim treatments from other sources, which we did not assess; and/or (3) if there was contamination of control subjects by the treated adolescents.

They were told that gradual discontinuation of antipsychotic medication was the best way to prevent the condition but if done abruptly carries a high risk of relapse and of precipitating TD. It was stated that the optimum maintenance treatment, taking into account its risks and benefits, was to use the lowest dose of antipsychotic drug that would keep them well.

When the alarm was switched on, it generated a single beep, which sounded once every 30 seconds for 60 minutes after the predesignated time, which was programmed into the device. The alarm stopped if the MDI was actuated or after 60 minutes if not taken. The device was programmed to emit the alarm at predetermined times twice a day. The AVRF also had a colored light, which was green before MDI use, changing to red once the MDI was taken. This function served to remind patients whether they had taken the MDI as scheduled.

In addition, patients had to be 18 or older, antiretroviral naive, agree to home visits, and plan to live in Kenya for at least 2 years Interventions Intervention: COUNSELING In the adherence counseling intervention, trained counselors administered 2 counseling sessions to participants prior to HAART initiation and a third session one month after HAART initiation. Counseling sessions around HAART initiation were based on a model of successful antiretroviral adherence promotion at a large University of Washington-affiliated HIV treatment program in Seattle, Washington.\n\nAll counseling sessions followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. In the first session, counselors explored personal barriers to good adherence and taught participants about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, antiretroviral medications, and the risks of treatment failure due to poor adherence. The second session occurred on a separate day and involved a review of a participant's understanding and readiness to begin antiretroviral medications. The third session allowed the counselor to examine practical and personal issues that the participant may have encountered on HAART. The adherence counseling intervention had been previously used and adapted at the same site in Kenya for over 2 years and was delivered in English and Kiswahili Intervention: COUNSELING PLUS ALARM Participants in counseling plus alarm group received both adherence counseling and alarm reminders. 3 adherence counseling sessions (2 prior to HAART initiation and 1 after HAART initiation) were conducted.

Patient outcomes included: 1) Beliefs about HAART measured using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-HAART specific version, which comprises 2 scales: HAART necessity scale which consists of 8 items assessing individuals' beliefs about their personal need for HAART for controlling their HIV, maintaining their health, and preventing illness, and HAART concerns scale which consists of 11 items which bring together a range of separate concerns about the potential adverse effects of HAART that have been identified across studies. Participants were presented with a series of statements about which they were told \"these are statements that other people have made about combination therapy\". They were then asked to rate their level of agreement with each item on a scale, where responses ranged from strongly agree (scored 5) to strongly disagree (scored 1). Scores for the individual items within each scale were summed to give a total scale score. A mean scale score was computed by dividing each scale by the number of items, giving a range of 1 to 5 for both necessity and concerns scales. This was done to facilitate comparison of scores between scales and to calculate a necessity-concerns differential (NCD) by subtracting concerns scores from necessity scores. The NCD score can be thought of as a crude indicator of the way the individual rates their perceived need for the treatment relative to their concerns about taking it. 2) HAART Intrusiveness Scale Consists of 10 items addressing the degree to which HAART is perceived to interfere with 10 aspects of daily life, each ranked on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low interference and 5 indicates high interference. A total score was computed by adding up responses to each item. For comparison with other scales, an average score was computed by dividing the total score by the number of items. Possible responses ranged from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating higher perceived intrusiveness. 3) Viral load was assessed at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after each patient initiated treatment using locally available method in each case. Viral load failure was defined as viral load >50 copies per milliliter at 48 weeks Notes -"

There were 2 follow-up assessments -at 60 to 90 days after MI and 120 to 180 days after MI. In diabetic patients, capillary glycemia was measured (Advantage reagent strips, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), lower limbs were examined, and adherence to prescribed oral antidiabetic agents and insulin was reviewed. Those patients who were still smoking were advised to stop smoking by the nurse and also by the cardiologist. No oral medication was prescribed in this regard since these drugs are not routinely provided by the Public Health System in Brazil. After the above-described procedures, the dietitian evaluated body weight and performed a nutritional review. This review was followed by reinforcement of healthy nutritional habits, which included information on the characteristics and amount of healthy meals according to each case and also lifestyle modification reinforcement. The management plan was formulated as an individualized therapeutic alliance among the patient and family, the physician, and other members of the healthcare team.

All patients also received some sort of asthma education that may have influenced the results. Also, the inhaled corticosteroid therapy was adjusted prior to randomization and this may have had an effect on the success of the intervention. (pg 4) \"The results of this study surprised us, as we had expected to find a greater decrease in asthma morbidity among patients who took part in the structured educational program. It can probably be explained by the fact that the control group may have been influenced by facilitating and reinforcing factors such as free medication and sustained care, including several follow-up visits with the educator, as described in the PRE-CEDE model contrary to what happened in one of our previous studies. In the present study, however, control patients were instructed on how to use their inhalers properly, and physicians could give information regarding allergenic and nonallergenic triggers if judged important. To differentiate the benefits of optimal asthma treatment from those of asthma education, inhaled corticosteroid therapy was adjusted prior to randomization using peak-flow monitoring. We agree that all patients received some degree of education during the run-in period, as optimization of therapy itself requires interaction with the patient to document symptoms and adjust or change medication if necessary, an inherently educational process. Although the control group received more than the usual care treatment, there were marked differences between control and educated patients, as none of the patients from Group C received the book Understand and Control Asthma, none were given a written action plan, and none took part in a structured educational program. Finally, none of these patients had a peak-flow meter at home after completion of the run-in period. Apart from physician's recommendations, no reinforcement was given by the specialized educator with regard to compliance in patients in Group C. Enrolled in this study were patients with moderate to severe asthma (daily respiratory symptoms) who required chronic use of inhaled corticosteroids to maintain good control of their illness. We did not select a very high-risk group of patients: these subjects did not have socioeconomic problems, nor had they had several visits to the emergency room or hospitalizations related to asthma in the year prior to enrollment. Previous studies have already shown that asthma morbidity can be decreased by education in these specific subgroups of patients. The results of our study do not rule out the possibility that education could decrease asthma morbidity under other circumstances. Indeed, this study was conducted in a tertiary care setting by asthma specialists, and had we conducted this study in patients with less optimal care or in high-risk\n\nCote 1997 (Continued) Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews populations, we might have obtained different results. Furthermore, referring the patient to a specialized asthma educator may help physicians to complete the educational interventions, sometimes difficult to provide in a busy clinic. In order to assess compliance with treatment, we supplied the medication at no charge throughout the study. As inhaled corticosteroids are expensive, some patients, particularly those receiving high dosages, cannot afford this treatment. Had the asthmatic subjects paid for their own medication, it is possible that compliance with treatment would have been lower among control patients than among patients from the two educated groups, and this might have biased the outcome of the control group.\" Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Adherence measure Unclear risk (PRIMARY) WEIGHT OF USED CANISTERS -Blinding information not provided Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Patient outcome Unclear risk (PRIMARY) DAYS LOST FROM WORK OR SCHOOL -Insufficient information about blinding provided Blinding of participants (performance bias) Adherence measure High risk (PRIMARY) WEIGHT OF USED CANISTERS -Although it states that canisters were weighed without patients knowing, the patient was still asked to bring in the canister.

In addition to standard treatment as for Group C treatment, patients in Group Limited Education (LE) were given a self action plan that was explained by the on call physician. The action plan used \"traffic lights\" (green, yellow, red) to describe specific states of asthma control based on Peak Expiratory Flow and symptoms and actions that the patient should take for each state (pages 1415 to 1416).

In addition to what patients in Group LE received, the patients in Group SE participated in a structured asthma educational program based on the PRECEDE model of health education within 2 weeks after their randomization. Briefly, this model takes into consideration 3 different issues that are important when dealing with health-related behaviors: predisposing factors (belief, attitude, knowledge); enabling factors (community resource, family support); and reinforcement. The teaching was provided individually or in small groups according to patient preference. The intervention focused mainly on self management.

After each medication was discussed and an action plan developed, the counselor ended each session by summarizing the discussion and the action plan agreed upon by the participant and counselor. Session 1 was completed in-person for all participants. Telephone sessions (for sessions 2 though 5) were conducted as needed for participants who were unable to meet the counselor in the clinic. Participants were paid USD 10 for completing the first MI session and USD 5 for each of the remaining 4 sessions. Participants in the intervention group also received a copy of the Get Busy Living video, a journal and a calendar Control: CONTROL Participants randomized to the control group received the usual adherence education provided at the clinic. 3 nurse educators employed at the HIV clinic provide comprehensive adherence education to patients who are initiating or changing ART.

MEMS consist of a microprocessor that is contained within the cap of the medication bottle. When the cap is opened, the date and time of opening are recorded and stored. These data are downloaded to a computer and used to calculate a variety of adherence measures. For the present study, 2 MEMS adherence rates were calculated. The first was based on the correspondence between the number of doses prescribed per day and the number of cap openings per day. The second was based on the number of cap openings occurring within one hour of the prescribed time for the dose.\n\nEach was converted to a percentage, i.e. per cent of doses taken and per cent of doses taken on schedule. Only one medication per person was monitored using MEMS. The staff selected the medication for monitoring using a predetermined list of possible medication combinations. MEMS caps have been used in a number of research studies assessing ART adherence and have been found to be a reliable and valid measure of adherence.\n\nThe patient outcomes were viral load and CD4 counts, assessed based on medical records, where viral load was measured by the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test, and CD4 cell count was determined by the BD FACSCalibur system.

Sessions covered the following topics related to chronic disease self management: 1. Overview of self management 2. Exercise and physical activity 3. Pain and fatigue management 4. Healthy eating on a limited budget 5. Medication management and 6. Finding and working with a regular doctor. During the sessions, peer educators modeled appropriate behaviors and responses, and participation from each group member helped model behavior and improve motivation for other members. Attendees are taught to develop short-term \"action plans\" for choosing domains of health behavior change. This process involves identifying a problem that is of particular concern, listing ideas for solving the problem, and then developing a plan outlining specific, short-term goals for improvement. 2 certified mental health peer specialists participated in a community-based, 5-day chronic disease self-management program (CDSMP) master training course to become master trainers in the CDSMP program.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Interventions Intervention: MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION MBSR aims to teach participants to respond to stressful situations \"mindfully\" -a state in which one focuses on the present moment, accepting and acknowledging it without getting caught up in thoughts that are about the situation or emotional reactions. This enables people to respond to the situation by making conscious choices to respond instead of reacting automatically. The MBSR program consists of the following elements: (1) individual pre-program intake interviews performed by the course instructor with each participant, lasting 30 minutes; (2) 8 weekly classes of 2.5 to 3 hours; (3) an all-day silent retreat during the 6th week of the program; and (4) daily home assignments including a minimum of 45 minutes per day of formal mindfulness practice and 5 to 15 minutes of informal practice, 6 days per week for the entire duration of the course. The total in-class contact is approximately 30 hours, and the total home assignments are a minimum of 42 to 48 hours. In addition, one to 2 additional individual interview sessions may be provided, at instructor discretion, to individual participants during the course. In addition to teaching mindfulness practices, the course includes didactic presentations that include information on stress physiology and stress reactivity. The course also addresses the effects of perception, appraisal, and attitude on health habits and behavior and on interpersonal communication Control: STANDARD CARE Control group received standard care and went through the same assessment procedure as the intervention group Outcomes The measures of adherence were AIDS Clinical Trials Group self report adherence measure to assess pills and doses skipped in the last 3 days for each ART medication and a visual analog scale (VAS) developed by Walsh et al to assess 30-day adherence. The instruments were administered as audio computer-administered self interview (ACASI) and computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) at 3 time points: baseline, 3 and 6 months\n\nThe patient outcomes were side effects, perceived stress, depression, positive and negative affect, and mindfulness assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Side effects was measured using a AIDS clinical trial group checklist in which respondents were asked whether they had experienced each of 25 possible symptoms in the preceding 30 days, and whether they attributed these to their ART medications, their HIV infection, or to other causes. Symptoms were coded as: 0 = did not experience the symptom versus 1 = experienced the symptom; the individual symptoms were then summed to create overall counts of symptoms and symptoms attributable to ART medications. To measure severity, participants were asked how much each symptom bothered them (on a Likert-type scale: 0 = not present; 1 = present but does not bother me; ranging to 4 = present and bothers me terribly). Average symptom bother scores were computed as the mean of these individual Likert items to quantify the overall average bother and bother attributable to ART medications. Residual plots of the sum of symptoms attributable to ART medications variable appeared skewed and heteroskedastic in our data, so log transformation was applied to this outcome. The residual plots of log-transformed symptoms attributable to ART and their average related bother/distress appeared close to normal and homoskedastic. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Perceived stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), was used to assess the intensity of positive and negative affect during the previous week. Mindfulness was assessed using a 5-factor mindfulness questionnaire. The instruments were administered as audio computer-administered self interview (ACASI) and computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) at 3 time points: baseline, 3, and 6 months Notes -"

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Methods Randomized controlled trial Participants The study location was Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA 74 participants were randomized to the intervention group and 72 participants were randomized to the control group\n\nThe inclusion criteria were between 10 and 18 years old with type 1 or 2 diabetes for at least 1 year that required management with insulin, a current HbA1c of 8% or higher, a mean HbA1c of 8% or higher during the year before the study entry, and residing in a home setting\n\nThe exclusion criteria were moderate or severe mental retardation, psychosis, not English speaking, or unable to complete study measures in English Interventions Intervention: MULTISYSTEMIC THERAPY Patients in the MST group received both standard medical care and treatment sessions by 5 masters-level therapists trained to have sufficient knowledge regarding diabetes to enable them to conduct diabetes adherence interventions with families. Treatment included 1-hour family treatment sessions, skills practice (e.g. spending 15 minutes in home to observe a caregiver implementing a reward or consequence as part of a behavior plan), attending school meetings to provide information to staff regarding diabetes care (e.g. 1 to 2-hour staff training), and attending clinic visits with families (2 hours or more) Control: TELEPHONE SUPPORT Control patients (telephone support) received an initial home visit where the program was explained to the adolescent and primary caregiver by either a master level therapists or doctoral students in clinical psychology or social work. Weekly phone calls (approximately 30 minutes each) focused on emotional support for diabetes care using client-centered, nondirective counseling, assessing adherence to diabetes for the previous week, reviewing readings in the blood glucose meter, and helping the adolescent identify solutions to any barriers in their diabetes care. Non-diabetes-related problems such as peer, school, or family relationship problems were also addressed during the call if desired by the adolescent. Telephone support therapists completed the same formal diabetes education training completed by MST therapists Outcomes The measures of adherence were parent-reported adherence and patient-reported adherence using the Diabetes Management Scale, a questionnaire that measures a broad range of diabetes management behaviors (insulin, diet, blood glucose, symptom response). The questionnaires were administered to parents and patients by a trained research assistant in the participants' homes at baseline and at 7 and 12 months (6-month follow-up) The patient outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), as measured by a pediatric endocrinologist every 3 to 4 months Notes ClinicalTrials protocol found Risk of bias Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk (pg 208) Minimization used: \"Randomization... using a permuted block algorithm to ensure equivalence across treatment condition.

Mailed letters were reserved for patients who were successfully controlled or had been recently contacted. Information delivered during follow-up was patient specific and did not require that a standard content be covered. Reasons for follow-up included 1) To communicate relevant laboratory results, including proximity to individual targets; 2) To monitor clinical status within 7 to 10 days after the initiation or change of a drug; 3) To monitor clinical status within 7 to 10 days after experiencing an adverse event; 4) To ensure that the patient was able to procure necessary follow-up appointments; 5) To provide patients with clinical goal reminders, disease-specific information, or timely topics using periodic mailers. Emphasis was placed on conducting short follow-up contacts that reminded and reinforced the importance of drug adherence and clinical targets.

All feedback was provided to PCPs using the electronic medical record. Progress notes reporting failed trials requested an electronic co-signature from the PCP. If the patient did not respond to the initial antidepressant, the pharmacist conducted a medication history and provided pharmacotherapy recommendations to PCPs via an electronic progress note (Step 2). The pharmacist also provided non-scripted medication management over the phone to patients experiencing severe side effects or problems with nonadherence. If the patient did not respond to 2 antidepressants trials, the protocol was to recommend a telepsychiatry consultation followed by additional treatment recommendations to the PCP (Step 3)\n\nControl: USUAL CARE Control groups received usual care.

Prior to administering the follow-up survey, a study psychiatrist examined the patients VA electronic medical records to determine what antidepressants had been prescribed (or refilled) during the previous 6 months. The most recently prescribed/refilled antidepressant medication was recorded prior to the follow-up interview and the adherence questions referred to the antidepressant explicitly by name. Research assistants asked all patients with an active prescription if they were currently taking the medication. If the patient was currently taking the medication, the interviewers asked how frequently they took the medication in the previous month and if they took the dosage prescribed. Patients were classified as adherent if item responses indicated they took the full dosage > = 80% of the days in the previous month\n\nThe patient outcomes were treatment response, remission, health status, and quality of life. Treatment response and remission were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Response is measured dichotomously as a 50% improvement in depression severity between baseline and follow-up. Remission is defined dichotomously as SCL-20 < 0.5. Health status was measured by the change in the physical health and mental health component scores (PCS and MCS) of the Short Form (SF12V) between baseline and follow-up. Improvement in health-related quality of life was measured by the change in the Quality of Well Being (QWB) score. Measures were taken at 6 months and 12 months follow-up."

Nurses were advised to answer any questions of the patients and to encourage them to state any point of view contrary to that of the doctor.

Physicians were requested to rate compliance of their patients on a 4-point scale ranging from \"poor compliance\" to \"very good compliance\". MARS rating below the median score of 8 were considered to indicate poor compliance; rating of 8 or above were considered to indicate good compliance. Physicians were requested to rate compliance of their patients on a 4-point scale ranging from \"poor compliance\" to \"very good compliance\". Physicians were requested to make unannounced measurements of plasma levels of the prescribed antipsychotics at 6 months and 18 months after discharge. The estimates of compliance by patients and physicians as well as results of the plasma levels were dichotomized into good and poor compliance. A \"conservative\" algorithm was applied in order to obtain an overall measure of compliance for every patient and point in time. Overall compliance was considered \"good\" if patients and physicians agreed in their (positive) estimates. In all other cases (incongruence of ratings, both rating poor compliance), compliance was rated as \"poor\".

We believe, however, that our study does not suffer from the limitations of classical cluster trials (e.g. selection bias), since individual patients were 'randomly' sent to that ward of a pair that had free beds available and were not selected according to any patient characteristics. \u2022 We used broad inclusion criteria, which resulted in many patients being included who were afterward considered incapable of making reasonable decisions, but which shed light on the percentage of patients that can successfully be reached with this intervention. \u2022 This trial was not performed in a university setting but in state hospitals, which led on the one hand to a higher amount of lacking (selfreport) values and which limited the amount of questionnaires that could be administered (e.g. an objective measure of the decision making capacity), but which on the other hand now enables us to argue that the intervention is feasible in normal patient care and with 'normal', non-selected patients.\n\n\u2022 The intervention took place as 'soon as possible'.

Shortly after the children were diagnosed as an asthmatic, 3 meetings (one every week for 3 weeks) took place and a follow-up meeting took place 6 months later. 3 pediatricians, 3 nurses and 2 psychologists were involved in these sessions: one nurse was present on all occasions, and the doctors and psychologists on 3 each. The goal of all the meetings was to reach the parents' \"main worry\" and, apart from teaching about asthma, the following key question was asked: \"What is asthma to you?\" The use of dialogue and peer education, whereby the group was encouraged to share personal experiences was emphasized. The control group, as well as the intervention group, received basic education about asthma and its treatment, including how to use the Nebunette, and information on environmental control at the first visit to the clinic. They received a written treatment plan where the principle was high dose (0.2 mg x 4 of budesonide for 3 days) initially and then, in association with URTI, stepping down the therapy to the lowest possible dose according to the status of the child. The treatment was stopped if the child had no asthma for 6 months Outcomes Compliance was measured in the following ways: 1) parents and doctors estimated adherence on a visual analog scale (VAS) at inclusion, at 6 months, and after 18 months; 2) adherence was measured between the 12-and 18-month follow-up visits using a diary in which the parents recorded the consumption of medicines, asthma symptoms, and other illnesses; 3) all the Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) with budesonide used during this period were weighed and the real consumption was estimated; and 4) the adherence according to parents was calculated as the number of doses given according to the diaries/the number of doses prescribed * 100. The verified adherence was defined as the real number of doses/the number of doses prescribed * 100. The verified adherence was considered acceptable if the index was 50 to 150 and poor if the index was <50\n\nThe following clinical outcomes were assessed: 1) parents estimated their children's asthma problems during the last 6 months, after 6 months and after 18 months on another VAS; 2) 3 doctors classified the children according to GINA guidelines including medication in 4 groups: mild, moderate, rather severe, and severe at inclusion, after 6 months and after 18 months; 3) during the first 6 and last 6 months of the 18-month-long study, the parents noted how many days the child was hospitalized and how many times they had to seek emergency help due to asthma; and 4) frequency of exacerbations, defined by the need for parents to stay at home to take care of their child due to asthma symptoms Notes - The nurses carried out the randomization and the 3 doctors that were involved in the group sessions also performed the follow-up visits.

In the first half of the session, patients' laboratory and blood pressure results were reviewed and action planning was introduced. In the second half, patients received brief training in basic peer communication skills and were paired with another age-matched patient in their cohort. Peer partners were encouraged to call each other at least once a week using an interactive, voice-response-facilitated telephone platform that recorded call initiation, frequency, and duration; enabled partners to contact each other without exchanging telephone numbers and to set periods during which calls could be blocked; and generated automated reminders every 7 days if no peer calls were attempted. During a reminder call, patients could be transferred automatically to their peer partner's number. The system also allowed patients to leave voice messages for research staff or care managers. At the end of the initial session, patients were given a DVD that demonstrated peer communication skills and a diabetes self management workbook that they could use to help guide their peer telephone calls. Patients were also offered 3 optional 1.5-hour group sessions at months 1, 3, and 6. These were completely patient-driven sessions at which patients were encouraged to share concerns, questions, strategies, and progress on their action plans. Sessions were facilitated by a care manager and a research associate. Research associates were present to help maintain intervention fidelity by encouraging nondirective facilitation of group discussions and to complete a checklist of key areas covered and communication skills used in each session Control: NURSE CARE MANAGEMENT (NCM) At baseline and 6-month follow-up, all study patients had their HbA1c level and blood pressure checked and were informed of the results and the most recent cholesterol values were in their medical record. Patients in the NCM group then attended a 1.5-hour session, led by a care manager, to review their laboratory and blood pressure results, ask questions, and receive information on VA care management services. They were provided their assigned care manager's contact information and encouraged to schedule follow-up telephone calls or face-to-face visits with that care manager. Each patient was also provided with diabetes self-management educational materials. Patients in the NCM group thus received enhanced usual care, because even though they would all be eligible for nurse care manager support at the study sites, many patients are not aware of and do not avail themselves of this service unless referred by their physician"

First, we included only male patients. Although peer-support interventions have been found to be more acceptable to women than men, research also suggests that similar peers are more likely to have mutually supportive peer relationships. Peersupport initiatives may thus be especially effective among patients with common identity bonds, such as shared experiences, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, or religious faith. We targeted veterans in the same age cohort, who often have a common sense of identity because of their shared military experience within a specific sociohistorical context. Future studies should attempt to replicate this study in other, sex-mixed samples of patients and examine the effectiveness of different peer-support models among patients with a range of self-management challenges. The success of our intervention can help guide other efforts to combine periodic group sessions, care management support, and peer communication to initiate and support other behavior changes in diabetes or other conditions that require high levels of self-management (such as obesity, heart failure, chronic pain, or physical inactivity). Second, our intervention lasted only 6 months; future studies should test peer-support interventions over longer periods. One advantage of peer-support interventions is their potential to provide flexible, longer-term selfmanagement support. Third, although the nurse care managers and all other providers were blinded to the study's hypotheses, the nature of the intervention prevented blinding\n\nHeisler 2010 (Continued) Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to treatment group. We also cannot exclude treatment bias, because the same care managers provided care to patients in both groups. However, we would expect that the nurse care managers would want to show their current provision of care to be superior to between-patient support, so the most likely effect of any treatment bias would be toward the null. Of note, this intervention focused exclusively on activating patients to improve their self-management.\n\nA more powerful intervention would also target provider behavior, such as by encouraging providers to initiate or intensify medication. Finally, our intervention had a relatively low rate of uptake.

It was designed to empower women to make decisions and develop strategies about taking ART as prescribed and consistently using risk reduction behaviors, such as condom use and to overcome resistance/ambivalence to both. The sessions lasted about 1.5 to 2 hours, and were led by trained MI nurses. The first and last session focused on both adherence and risk behavior, 3 sessions were devoted to adherence only and 3 to risk reduction behaviors only, including a session on disclosure which is important to risk reduction as well as adherence. Each session included a discussion of goals and goal setting related to the topic. MI techniques were incorporated into every session. In keeping with the autonomy support spirit of MI, participants as a group chose which topic they wanted to address first. The majority of groups (n = 14) chose medication adherence as the first topic\n\nControl: HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAM The control group sessions were equivalent in length and time to the MI group and were led by trained nurses and a health educator. This group used health education techniques of lecture/discussion/educational games and focused on nutrition, exercise, stress recognition, and women's health issues tailored to the HIV positive woman. Participants received a manual containing content and supplementary materials for each session. Adherence and risk reduction behaviours (RRB) were not addressed in the health promotion program (HPP) and facilitators were instructed to redirect the group if these issues came up"

Families were given customized written guidelines including insulin doses for hyperglycemia and for varying carbohydrate loads. At the completion of the program, parents were expected to identify problems and to know when to call their nurse practitioner for assistance in insulin dose adjustment, for sick-day management, or for advice in co-ordination of the diabetes regimen. Patients in the ED + TCM group received both the standard care in clinic and the education program described above. They also received weekly telephone calls for 3 months or until the first clinic visit and then bimonthly calls for 3 months from the study co-ordinator.

One subject requested to leave the study. The remainder were dropped from the study after repeated attempts by the study coordinator to have the family complete the protocol with its required clinic visits, HbA1c blood work, and paperwork. Although the research design with its original sample size accounted for differences in subjects' ages, the smaller sample size could not. Because there was a big difference in diabetes management and parent and child interactions around diabetes depending on age, without the power of the original sample size, our results may not reflect accurate comparisons. As well, the subjects completing the study may have represented a biased sample because they were not necessarily representative of patients and families in poor control. Another limitation of the study was using unstandardized assessment tools versus standardized assessment tools.\n\nThe research team elected to use the ADH, TEAM, and KNOW as they were assessment tools already integrated into the clinical practice of the Diabetes Center for Children. Data collection was simplified, however; these tools do not have the psychometric properties established for standardized tools. Obtaining data points at the times specified in the protocol proved to be difficult when done in real-life terms with subjects and their families. The study was designed to obtain data at baseline and then in two 3-month intervals. Although the study coordinator was very flexible in meeting families' scheduling needs, there were frequent b no-shows Q in the clinic, thus, requiring rescheduling of appointments. The 3-month interval at times stretched to 4-to 6-month intervals between data points. Finally, the study design did not control for telephone contacts between clinicians and families in the ED or SC groups. Because all subjects were in relatively poor control, clinicians often elected to have families call in to review blood sugars.

Psychiatrist attended a 90-minute training session during which they were informed about the rationale for taking into account the spiritual dimension in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and how to conduct a spiritual assessment. They were made aware of how their own religious and spiritual experiences could influence their identity and world view, as well as how their attitudes toward such experiences might introduce biases into clinical assessment and treatment. Finally, psychiatrists were reminded to show respect for patients with different religious and spiritual backgrounds. Psychiatrists used a semi-structured interview guided by the following topics: religious and spiritual history, effects of illness on spirituality or religiousness, current spiritual or religious beliefs and practices, subjective importance of religion in general, subjective importance of religion in coping with the illness, synergy of religion with psychiatric care. After each assessment the psychiatrist met with 2 of the authors, a psychiatrist and a psychologist of religion. In these sessions the individual patient was discussed for 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the clinical context. The participating psychiatrist reported the outcome of his or her spiritual assessment and was given guidance and advice, similar to clinical coaching; when needed, a more thorough discussion from a psychotherapeutic perspective was undertaken Control: USUAL CARE \"For the control group, psychiatrists were instructed to avoid speaking about religious issues during the three-month follow-up period unless patients spontaneously brought up the subject.\" (pg 81)"

Only patients in the intervention group received additional attention from the psychiatrists, who explored and discussed patients' personal beliefs, which may have introduced significant bias.

Furthermore, psychiatrists received supervision only for patients in the intervention group, and supervision itself could have altered patients' outcomes.

Self management sessions were held by a certified asthma educator and respiratory therapist. The sessions consisted of asthma facts and medication actions and individualized components such as verbal and graphic interpretation of spirometric results, peak flow trends, metered dose inhaler technique error, and skin allergen results (with Janson 2009 Cochrane Library Trusted evidence.

The peak flow monitor was modified for the intervention group to use a traffic light analogy and correlated to a simple written action plan Control: SELF MONITORING ALONE Control patients attended the same number of visits as intervention patients, but control visits were only for data collection. During each phase of the trial, all participants measured morning peak flow with an electronic peak flowmeter (Airwatch; iMetrikus, Carlsbad, Calif) and also recorded their daily values in a diary. All participants were told that higher peak flow numbers meant their airways were more open and lower numbers meant their airways were more closed. An electronic medication monitor, which concealed readings from the subject (Doser CT; MediTrack, Hudson, Mass), was placed on each ICS inhaler. Participants also monitored daily symptoms, night-time awakenings, and tabulated ICS and inhaled b-agonist (IBA) use in the diary.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews reported a level of side effect distress on a previously used symptom/side effect checklist equivalent to the upper 40% of a prior sample Interventions Intervention: BALANCE PROJECT EXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTION The intervention was 5 60-minute individual counseling sessions with each session designed around topics relevant to ART side effects coping. Intervention sessions followed a standard structure and set of activities, but were individually tailored to participants' specific life contexts, stressors, and goals. Participants received USD 30 at the 3-month assessment if they completed all 5 sessions prior to that assessment interview. The intervention was delivered between months 3 and 6 of the study Control: USUAL CARE Control group participants received treatment as usual and received no active psychosocial interventions prior to the final trial assessment interview Outcomes The measures of adherence were self reported Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group and visual analog scale.\n\nAdult AIDS Clinical Trials Group assesses missed pills over the prior 3 days. This measure has been used widely with diverse samples and the short-term recall period has been associated with long-term clinical outcomes. The measure was computerized for ACASI administration to minimize the social desirability associated with adherence reporting. Mean 3-day adherence was calculated by dividing the number of pills reported as being taken by the number of pills that were prescribed in the regimen. Secondly, visual analog scale assesses 30-day adherence, reporting separately for each drug along a continuum anchored by \"0%\" to \"100%\".This measure has shown to be correlated with other measures of adherence, such as medication event monitoring systems and a 30-day time frame has recently been supported as preferable to other approaches of self report. For the visual analog scale, the mean per cent adherence was calculated across all drugs in the participant's regimen. Assessments were completed at 1 week (baseline) and at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months for both intervention and control groups\n\nThe patient outcomes were the extent to which patients took side effect medication, as measured by the SECope. Follow-up assessment interviews were scheduled at 3 (second baseline interview), 6, 9, and 15 months for both the intervention and control groups. Interviews were conducted using laptop computers in private settings in research offices. Procedures involved a combination of audio computer-assisted self interviewing (ACASI) and computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) using the Questionnaire Development System. The SECope is a 20-item measure that assesses strategies for coping with HIV treatment side effects, and includes a scale for Taking Side Effect Medications Notes -"

First, the experimental design used a treatment as usual comparison rather than a matched attention control condition, so it is impossible to determine the potential confounding effects of increased attention by Johnson 2011 (Continued) Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews trial staff in the experimental condition rather than the control condition. Further, the assessment did not capture comprehensive data on access and use of adherence resources outside of the trial, a construct that is gaining attention in adherence research. Second, the use of self reported adherence data, while supported by validity studies has been questioned in HIV research as being inflated because of recall, social desirability, and other biases. To minimize the biases inherent in self reported data, we employed several techniques. We used conservative cut-offs of validated measures of adherence that have demonstrated meaningful relationships with important outcomes, such as viral load, in other studies. ACASI interviewing for the adherence portion of the interview was used, thereby removing the interviewer's presence and minimizing social desirability bias. Such approaches to computerized adherence assessment have shown favorable effects in other studies. Despite these strategies, it should be noted that the use of self reported adherence outcomes remains a limitation of the study, and results may have differed if other adherence assessment approaches had been used. Third, because the study used a convenience sample rather than a probability based sample, there are limits of the degree to which findings are generalizable to other populations. Related, the sample was predominately male, and thus caution should be exercised when generalizing the findings to women. Finally, because the eligibility criteria did not select based on levels of adherence at baseline, there was a limit of the degree to which patients could improve on their adherence, as some reported perfect adherence at study entry. However, even with the potential ceiling effect of adherence scores in the sample, the intervention was shown to significantly protect against the likelihood of subsequent nonadherence.\n\n\" (pg 89) Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Adherence measure Low risk (PRIMARY) SELF REPORT -QUESTIONNAIRE -Data were collected via computerized interview.

The durability of behavioral outcomes may prove more optimistic when the intervention is delivered in clinical care given the opportunities for ongoing support. Another limitation of this trial was its reliance on self reported measures for sexual risk and biological outcomes. Although the consistency of findings supports the study's internal validity, further testing of this intervention should be undertaken with biological endpoints. We emphasized ecological validity in designing the intervention, focusing on simple and lowcost strategies for reducing risk and improving adherence. Although we strived to maintain implementation simplicity, the intervention included 2 individual and 5 group sessions.

In this game, players control a nanobot, \"Roxxi\", in 3-dimensional environments within the bodies of young patients with cancers that commonly are diagnosed in AYA. Game content was engineered to address behavioral issues that were identified in literature reviews and preproduction targeting studies as critical for optimal AYA patient participation in cancer treatment. Video-game play includes destroying cancer cells and managing common treatment-related adverse effects such as bacterial infections, nausea, and constipation by using chemotherapy, antibiotics, antiemetics, and a stool softener as ammunition. To win, players control the nanobot, Roxxi, to ensure strategically that virtual patients engage in positive self care behaviors, such as taking oral chemotherapy to fight cancer cells, taking antibiotics to fight infection, taking stool softeners to prevent bowel perforations, practicing good mouth care to combat mucositis, using relaxation techniques to reduce stress, and eating food to gain energy. Neither the nanobot nor any of the virtual patients \"die\" in the game. If players \"fail\" at any point in the game, then the nanobot powers down and players are given the opportunity to try the mission again. Players had to complete missions successfully before moving on to the next level. Participants were instructed to play for at least 1 hour per week during the 3-month period Control: COMMERCIAL VIDEO GAME The control patients were provided a commercial video game -a PC version of Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb served as the control game because the play structure and controller interface closely resembled that of Re-Mission"

Before the first study visit, the intervention patients were provided a book and videotape developed by the study team that was aimed at increasing patient education and enhancing self treatment of their depression. They were also scheduled for 2 visits with a depression specialist (one 90-minute initial session and one 60-minute follow-up session) in the primary care clinic. 3 addition telephone visits at 1, 4, and 8.5 months from session 2 with the depression specialist and 4 personalized mailings (2, 6, 10, and 12 months) were scheduled over the following year. The mailed personalized feedback contained a graph of patients' Beck Depression scores over the course of the intervention program and checklists for patients to send back to the depression specialist, including early warning signs of depression and whether they were still adhering to their medication plan. The depression specialist reviewed monthly automated pharmacy data on antidepressant refills and alerted the primary care physician and telephoned the patients when mailed feedback or automated data indicated they were symptomatic and/or had discontinued medication. The ultimate aim of the intervention was to have each patient complete and follow a 2-page written personal relapse prevention plan, which was also shared with his/her primary care provider. Follow-up telephone calls and mailings were geared toward monitoring progress and adherence to each patient's plan. Usual care for most patients was provided by the GHC family physicians in the 4 primary care clinics and involved prescription of an antidepressant medication, 2 to 4 visits over the first 6 months of treatment, and an option to refer to GHC mental health services. Both intervention and control patients could also self refer to a GHC mental health provider Outcomes Measurement of compliance: patients' adherence to antidepressant medication was measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization by a telephone interviewer.

A high rate of patient refusal and drop-out would not be unexpected with this relatively unselected and highly disturbed patient sample, of which 59.5% were admitted involuntarily.\n\nIn fact, the actual initial refusal rate was I5%, and subsequent attrition by onethird included only 11 overt refusers. The therapy sessions were very well accepted by patients, with all those recruited completing the course of therapy. Substantial follow-up drop-out rates have been re-ported in: (a) drug studies; (b) prospective studies of inner-city samples where at least 10% relocate beyond catchment area boundaries each year; and (c) studies of psychosocial interventions in similar populations  (Tarrier et al, 1993) . Longer follow-up periods inevitably lead to greater attrition. A practical issue is that of tracking subjects for follow-up in a highly mobile inner-city sample. Another methodological issue concerns the measure of compliance. This was an indirect composite measure based on information from a number of sources, which correlated strongly at each time point with measures of treatment attitudes, lending it concurrent validity. A mean advantage for the compliance therapy group of between one and two points on the observer-rated compliance scale is a clinically meaningful difference (for example it could amount to the difference between a patient with a bipolar disorder accepting lithium with some supervision rather than being reluctantly maintained on a less appropriate depot medication schedule). However, it may be argued that lack of a direct compliance measure is a weakness in this study, though all these measures have their drawbacks. Pill counts have been widely used in the past even though despite the well-recognised potential for inaccuracy  (Rudd, 1976; Kane, 1983; Pullar et a[, 1989 ). Furthermore, they are time-consuming, demanding of manpower, and ultimately not particularly suitable for: (a) in-patient studies where medication is largely administered by staff; (b) studies involving patients on depot medication; (c) patients with individually tailored regimes. Serum assays are expensive, invasive and are not available for the full range of antipsychotics; we believe their use in this study would have further adversely affected the drop-out rate. Urine tests for a drug or its metabolite may overestimate compliance with drugs like antipsychotics with a long half-life (Churchill, 1985); al-Kemp 1998 (Continued) Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews so currently available assays may not detect some antipsychotics at the lower dose range. Both serum and urine assays are of limited value in assessing partial compliance  (Babiker, 1986) . While simple self report compliance measures are poorly predictive of behavior, Hogan et a1  (1983)  found that DAI ratings could accurately assign 89% of a large out-patient sample to compliant and non-compliant groupings. Observer bias Observer bias was another potential problem. The initial ratings and most of the three-month follow-up ratings of functioning and compliance were made by the research psychiatrist (R.K.) who was not blind to treatment status, though the compliance ratings were based on information from impartial sources including community psychiatric nurses and out-patient doctors on the clinical teams. However, all sixmonth, 12-month and 18-month ratings on the other hand were carried out by two researchers trained in their use, who were blind to treatment status. Inspection of the results shows consistency between ratings over the serial points, and satisfactory inter-rater reliability coefficients were obtained. Despite these shortcomings, the findings suggest that compliance therapy does have a measurable and positive effect on treatment adherence.\"\n\nBlinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Adherence measure\n\nUnclear risk (PRIMARY) NURSE ASSESSMENT -7 POINT SCALE -(pg 414) \"Compliance. Initial compliance was rated blind to intervention status by the patients' primary nurse according to a seven-point rating scale.\" However, the following is also indicated in the article: \"The initial ratings and most of the three-month follow-up ratings of functioning and compliance were made by the research psychiatrist (R.K.) who was not blind to treatment status\" (pg 418) The clinical pharmacist ensured that the patient knew the indications and doses of each medicine, and was able and willing to use the inhaler devices prescribed. The clinical pharmacist also discussed with the intervention patients the importance of simple exercises that patients can do at home (e.g. upper and lower limb exercises and relaxation techniques), symptom control (pursed lip technique) and the technique for expectoration (huff and puff technique). The pharmacist demonstrated these techniques and then asked the patients to carry out the techniques to ensure that they fully understood how to perform them. A booklet on these techniques was prepared to assist in the education session and the patients were given a copy to take home with them. Advice, using the motivational interviewing technique, was provided to the patients who still smoked and referral to a special smoking cessation program run within the hospital was made. A customized action plan for acute exacerbations, including advice to GPs to provide a prescription for an antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and an oral corticosteroid to be initiated promptly by patients for exacerbations,was developed for each patient. The clinical pharmacist through motivational interviewing attempted to increase the intervention patients' self efficacy to manage or avoid breathing difficulty while participating in certain activities. The interventions were tailored according to the preliminary assessment, i.e. checklists of patients' needs were prepared by the research pharmacist and forwarded to the clinical pharmacist to discuss with the patients. The initial intervention lasted for approximately 1 hour for nonsmoker patients and slightly longer for patients who currently smoked. At each outpatient clinic visit (every 6 months arranged by the hospital consultant), intervention group patients received reinforcement of the education on COPD and its treatment from the clinical pharmacist. In addition, follow-up telephone calls by the clinical pharmacist to reinforce the education and motivate the patients to achieve their goals were made at 3 and 9 months, i.e. between outpatient clinic appointments Control: USUAL CARE Control patients received usual hospital outpatient care from medical and nursing staff"

Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews strate the effect of an intervention, such as pharmaceutical care, because patients belonging to the control group are more likely to have better outcomes than the overall population. However, even in a small study population, results showing a statistical significance probably resulted from the pharmaceutical care provided. Because of the randomized design, patients of the intervention and control group visited the outpatient clinic at the same time and were able to exchange written and oral information. Moreover, patients in the control group received the basic immunosuppressant from the same hospital pharmacist as the intervention group. If those patients had questions or problems, not caring for them would have been unethical. Finally, it has to be discussed if it is necessary and justifiable not to tell the patients that we will be examining their compliance? Apart from the ethical problem, the high dropout rate caused by using pill boxes results from not informing the patients how the MEMS system works. However, this method is essential to receive valid data. Otherwise, patients could easily manipulate the results. To protect the patients' privacy, all data were coded and documented anonymously. Physicians and staff who cared for the patients had no access to the data, and the study design was approved by the ethical committee. Pill counts proved to be unfeasible, especially during the first weeks following transplantation, when the dose of the immunosuppressive drug was changed frequently. Therefore, documentation was time consuming and probably incomplete. However, this method was helpful for confirming the electronic data. Results of serum concentration measures also confirmed the MEMS results, especially because this method is a direct method of measuring compliance and proves ingestion of the drug. The questionnaire designed by Morisky was easy to administer and analyze. The biggest disadvantage is that the results are subjective. The number of patients assessed as compliant was much higher with the survey than with electronic compliance measurement. However, the questionnaire might be helpful in detecting compliance problems in daily clinical practice. Patients reporting to have forgotten their drug intake, or to have stopped their drug intake when feeling better, can be instructed especially on these issues. We were not surprised that only few patients reported to have forgotten to take their immunosuppressants.

Elements of the standard intervention package consisted of self monitoring of medication taking using adherence diaries; regular individual and group education by peer-workers using patient education leaflets and tabletop flip-charts; and late attendee tracing. The treatment supporters were usually family members-usually a partner, mother, daughter, sister, brother, friend, or neighbor/friend-who were chosen by the patient with the assistance of the health workers, had accepted the patient's HIV status and were confidantes. These individuals were committed to support the patient with ART for a long time, had gained the patient's trust over time, and commanded respect.

Treatment supporters were educated with the following WHO Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness (IMAI) educational materials: Patient Education Flipchart, Patient Education Cards, and Caregiver Booklets. They were also educated on how to remind the patient to take their medicine, be present at the follow-up appointments, remember all important test results and clinic history over time, and to accompany patient to support group meetings if possible.\n\nTreatment supporter meetings were also held at the clinic every 2 or more weeks to deal with issues of burn out, patient non-adherence and other barriers to treatment and adherence Control: STANDARD ADHERENCE INTERVENTION Patients randomized to the control arm did not have a treatment supporter but otherwise received the same standard adherence intervention package including the ongoing existing health education and adherence counseling support that all patients received during routine monthly clinic visits.

Our study was originally powered to detect a 15% increase in adherence after the intervention, but then adherence levels were higher than anticipated for the control group thereby rendering the small but 'real' increase in adherence between the two groups statistically non-significant. It is possible this study was likely underpowered for adherence outcomes. Considering the fact that very high levels of adherence were exhibited by both treatment groups, any small difference could be of clinical and substantive importance.\n\nWe were not able to corroborate attendance and adherence monitoring with more objective indicators such as immunological, virological or clinical outcomes because of financial constraints particularly the cost of additional laboratory monitoring in this set-Kunutsor 2011 (Continued) Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ting. The clinic-based pill count measure though less objective compared to Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps and HIV viral loads, it has been reported to be correlated with viral loads. Considering the fact that all participants were willing to identify treatment supporters, i.e. they all reported disclosure before enrollment, it is possible this could have attenuated potential benefits of treatment supporters since disclosure alone is a major predictor of adherence; it may be that we collected data from a cohort of highly motivated people who were prepared to gain the most from ART. The data was derived from a single site and so the results may not be generalizable to the whole country. Despite the various limitations, our study findings are very important and lend support to the results reported by\n\nTaiwo et al. in their randomized trial on treatment partners, that the use of patient-selected treatment supports is associated with improved adherence.\" Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Adherence measure Unclear risk (PRIMARY) PILL COUNT -Blinding not mentioned Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Patient outcome High risk (PRIMARY) CLINIC ATTENDANCE -Author's note: adherence assessors were not blinded.

(pg 204) \"This study had several limitations. A usual-care arm would have been helpful to further substantiate the improvement in SBP found in both intervention arms.\n\nIn recent studies involving patients with elevated baseline SBP levels, however, levels dropped by 2, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 14 mm Hg with usual care, reductions considerably smaller than the approximately 20-mm Hg SBP reduction in both groups of our study. In an effort to pattern our study intervention to standard clinical care, we used blood pressures measured by medical assistants at the office visit. This approach may have introduced more random error creating a bias toward not finding a difference between study arms. It is unlikely that it affected the result to the point of masking a true significant difference, however. The potential impact on the before-after analysis would be toward the null hypothesis, making our results a conservative estimate of actual change from baseline to 6 months.\n\nThe association between number of coaching encounters and SBP reduction, while supportive of a true effect of health coaching, relied on observational data and could reflect confounding by unmeasured variables. Although we expected health coaching to improve medication adherence, self reported adherence decreased over the course of the study. Two factors may explain this seemingly paradoxic finding. First, on the basis of coaches' reports, many patients at baseline did not know their medications well enough to accurately report adherence. Second, patients may have become more truthful as they developed trusting relationships with their coaches. Also, self reported adherence correlates poorly with more objective adherence measures.\"\n\nBlinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Adherence measure Low risk (PRIMARY) SELF REPORT -INTERVIEW -The outcome was self reported by the participants.

Therefore, this excellent medication adherence rate observed in the present study might not be applicable to general Japanese hypertensive patients. In addition, many participants were not newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, but rather had been treated with antihypertensive drugs for several years.25 Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that merely participating in a clinical trial significantly increases adherence.26 Even considering these limitations, however, the findings of the present study are largely new and provide important information on medication adherence regarding a combination pill of antihypertensive drugs\" -p.1420-1421 \"Electronic monitoring seems to be the most accurate method to evaluate medication adherence. 27 Unfortunately, however, the cost of this device precluded its use in the present study.

An agreed individualized self-management plan was determined, with written instructions using the 'Sheffield Asthma Card'. This also contained a telephone contact number. Each patient was given a peak low meter to take home and instructions on monitoring, with documentation of predicted peak low measurement and parameters for altering treatment, as well as clear written guidelines on when to seek emergency care. Home intervention was based upon a combination of symptoms and peak low recordings and all guidance offered throughout the educational program was based on the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for the management of asthma in adults.

This was an exploratory study for which the sample size was not powered to detect a clinical difference relating to flare-ups. We acknowledge that our definition of a flareup is based on the unscheduled hospital appointment or admission, which is open to challenge. In addition, the sample recruited contained a low proportion of people assessed as nonadherent at baseline. However, our findings suggest a useful area for future research involving a larger sample size of people with lower baseline adherence levels and collection of more detailed data relating to flare-ups in order to further investigate the question of clinical impact. Additionally, a general problem with evaluating complex interventions is that it is difficult to accurately assess the contribution made by the various components. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that combining adherence enhancing interventions tailored to individual patients was an effective way of improving persistence with 5-ASA medication. The difficulty of accurately measuring adherence to 5-ASA medication has been previously confirmed in our program of work; however, the objective measure used was probably the most appropriate method available for evaluating the intervention. We are unable to confirm whether the positive trend, but lack of significance, for results relating to changes in health beliefs was due to the small sample size or to the limited effectiveness of those aspects of the intervention aimed at addressing patient perceptions; further studies exploring methods of modifying health beliefs are therefore required. It could be suggested that our study does not take account of the potential impact of once-daily dosing regimes for patients with UC. Simplification of treatment can lead to improved patient adherence in a variety of disorders, and similar results have been reported in the treatment of UC. While we acknowledge that once-daily regimes were not available to patients in our study, we do not believe that this reduces the validity of our findings. A range of factors influence the prescribing decisions made by clinicians, including national and local guidelines, cost, and availability. Moreover, a survey of 100 Canadian patients with UC revealed that factors such as medication efficacy and safety were rated as being more important than those related to the dosing regime or cost. In this survey, speed of symptom relief and infrequency of side effects were rated as the most important factors when considering UC medication. 37 It may also be pertinent to note that changing to a once-daily dosing schedule could potentially lead to an actual decrease in adherence, as a single missed dose would equate to a full 24 hours of missed therapy. Finally, the need to consider cost-effectiveness in the evaluation of adherence interventions has been suggested. 13 While formal assessment of cost-effectiveness was not within the scope of the present study, the actual costs could be described as relatively low since the intervention involved only a brief educational session and provision of inexpensive leaflets and practical reminders.\n\nIt would therefore seem reasonable to suggest that the intervention could be implemented in routine clinical care at relatively low cost\".

Taking adherence is the percentage of prescribed medication taken and measures deviation from the physician's prescription. Scheduling adherence measures the day-to-day deviation in the timing of administration. A medication prescribed for once-daily administration would need to be administered within 24 hours of the previous dose, whereas medications prescribed for twice-daily administration would need to be administered within 12 hours of the previous dose. Scheduling adherence measures the reliability or consistency of dosing over time. Refill adherence as the medication possession ratio by using prescription records from the Regenstrief Medical Record System. Results for 1 year, incorporating the 9-month intervention period and the 3-month postintervention period was computed. Patients came for refills at approximately 2-month intervals. Considering the carry-over effect of the intervention that stopped at 9 months, the intervention effect on medication supplies would extend to 11 to 12 months. Hence, the 12-month period adequately reflects the effect of the intervention. Self reported adherence was determined for the previous month at baseline and 9 months by using validated questionnaires.

A dose was considered taken if the lever of the DA was depressed and recorded beta4 hours from that patient's median dosing hour (as determined from the DA data). Because we recognized from our previous study that the device has the potential to make extra recordings when the lever is depressed erroneously, we did not count more than 1 dose taken per eye per day in our adherence rate calculation.

AMF stands for adherence monitoring with feedback and ABC stands for asthma basic care. These patients received 1. Objective feedback of medication adherence: electronic medication feedback. The AEs were trained to provide non-threatening, supportive feedback on adherence to encourage a partnership with the family; 2. Goal-setting: families were encouraged to set asthma control goals (e.g. no coughing at night) and weekly adherence goals. The AEs assisted families in setting age-appropriate expectations regarding the child's ability to self manage asthma; 3. Reinforcement for attaining adherence goals: the importance of positive reinforcement. When the child attained the adherence goal, the AE provided a small reward (e.g. crayons). When it was not achieved, the AE worked with the family to identify barriers and taught problem-solving skills. 4. Strategies for self monitoring medication use: families were taught to monitor adherence and asthma symptoms by using behavioral charts and symptom diaries. When possible, the AE highlighted the relationship between improvements in adherence and asthma outcomes Control: USUAL CARE Patients received an asthma education booklet and resource guide that provided information about low-cost asthma care providers, social services, legal services, and other resources.

Self reported adherence was collected from caregivers. Caregivers reported how the child administered the medication (e.g. 2 puffs twice a day), then estimated how often the child missed doses in the previous 7 days. Percentage self reported adherence was calculated as use/prescribed use x 100%. For pharmacy-based adherence, by using a protocol described by Butz et al, the number of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) refills per quarter was abstracted from pharmacy records for the year before and after randomization. The number of canisters dispensed was converted to therapeutically equivalent values so that 1 canister represented a 1-month supply of ICS. The quarterly ICS refill rates were defined as the number of ICS canisters dispensed quarterly. These analyses included the quarter before enrollment (the baseline value) through the 4th quarter after randomization. An ICS refill rate of 3.0 is equivalent to 100% adherence for the quarter. Self reported adherence data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months, while pharmacy records were requested at baseline and 12 months and data for baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months obtained\n\nThe clinical outcomes were caregiver reports of asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, or chest tightness/discomfort), night-time awakenings, ED visits, hospitalizations, and courses of oral corticosteroids in the previous 6 months.

In addition, there might also be an increase in the overall patient care by other care providers due to a lack of blinding in the pharmacist's activities.\" -(pg 34 \"This study has a number of limitations. Expectations and needs of this specific group of patients were not considered while planning for the interventions. The randomization method used was apparently not optimal as more women were drawn into the study group and more patients in the control group took single antidiabetic agent and tended to have higher pill count. Net A1C reduction set in the study may be too large to be obtained with the interventions. We measured two points of A1C, i.e., at the baseline and at the end, and as a consequence there was a lack of observation that could have possibly led to a more accurate trend of A1C change. The pill count method to gauge medication adherence may be inadequate. Though blinding to the randomization groups, the physicians and nurses were aware of pharmacist carrying out the study thus increases in overall care might be possible. Our intention was not to affect or evaluate the process of physician care for diabetes but it would be useful to measure changes in their diabetes management that may also have an impact on the outcome measures.\n\nThe pharmacist's extra input involved combined strategies. Thus, it was impossible to label which component was associated with the improvements although multifaceted interventions were proved to enhance patient outcomes in diabetes care. It should be borne in mind that the management of diabetes mellitus in real practice is life-long and complex in nature.

This team was located offsite and convened once a week and as needed by telephone or in person. The depression care team communicated with treating clinicians via electronic medical record progress notes. The DCM communicated with patients via telephone. The HITIDES depression care team made treatment suggestions. Treatment decisions were made by the HIV or mental health clinicians at each site. The DCM delivered the following intervention components: participant education and activation, assessment of treatment barriers and possible resolutions, depression symptom and treatment monitoring, substance abuse monitoring, and instruction in self management. The DCM used prewritten scripts, which are standardized instruments that were supported by the web-based decision support system during these telephone encounters. The intervention used a stepped-care model for depression treatment. At any time, HIV health care providers were free to refer participants directly to specialty mental health care. The DCM conducted telephone-based monitoring every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. The NetDSS system identified potential treatment non-response as (1) antidepressant regimen adherence of less than 80% during the past 14 days, (2) counseling non-adherence of less than 75% during the past month, (3) participant report of severe adverse effects during 2 consecutive DCM encounters, (4) participant report of a 5-point increase in depression severity from the enrollment PHQ-9 score based on 2 consecutive DCM encounters, or (5) lack of participant response during an 8-week antidepressant or 12-week counseling trial Control: USUAL CARE Usual care depression treatment was provided by HIV or mental health clinicians without involvement of the HITIDES depression care team.

The sociocultural approaches to family education include explanations of the concept of schizophrenia from a cultural perspective and an attempt to correct negative attitudes toward modern treatment. The family education and drug intervention was delivered as a package. The drug intervention program includes drug counseling [from Table  1 ] clear instruction about dose, frequency and possible side effects, the role of carers in supervision of medication at home, and close monitoring of compliance by a drug intake check-list presented in every follow-up visit. Both groups of patients received routine prescription of medication. It should be noted that 1 psychiatrist treated the intervention group throughout the study, and a 2nd psychiatrist treated the control group throughout the study. Patients in each group were followed up on the same schedule; monthly for the first 3 months and then every 6 weeks in the next 9 months Outcomes Measurement of compliance: measured at the end of 6 months and 1 year after initiation of the intervention. Medication compliance was assessed through a semi-structured interview with the carer and examination of the amount of unused medication. A home visit was made to assess unused medication \"in doubtful cases\". Drug compliance was measured globally as a percentage of the total prescribed drug dosage actually taken during the previous 6 months. The compliance was reported on a 6-point ordinal scale, with 1 indicating non-compliant, 2: 25% compliant, 3: 50% compliant, 4: 75% compliant, 5: 90% compliant and 6: 100% compliant. 90% compliance was considered to be an ideal level Measurement of clinical health outcomes: measured at the end of 6 months and 1 year after initiation of the intervention. Frequency of symptoms exacerbation, psychosocial functioning and behavioral difficulties were measured. Symptomatic exacerbation was determined by BPRS ratings. A rating of 5 or above in one or more of the psychoticism scales indicated an exacerbation.

The session content included structured discussions and instruction, as well as specific problem-solving and couple-communication exercises. Key components included education about the importance of adherence to avoid viral resistance and maintain health, identifying patterns of non-adherence, developing communication and problem-solving strategies to overcome adherence barriers, optimizing partner support, and building confidence in the couple for achieving and maintaining improved adherence. Standard care patients received attention to adherence-related issues from a multidisciplinary treatment team. Dosing, common side effects, and the importance of adherence to the regimen as prescribed were discussed. Patients were instructed to contact the clinic to speak with either their medical provider or a nurse if they had difficulties with the regimen.

During the first call, the pharmacist assessed the patient's antidepressant knowledge and beliefs and clarified or explained issues that were not understood by the patients. Pharmacists rated the severity of their concerns and made suggestions on how to handle adverse effects, difficulties remembering or paying for medications, and other concerns. Also, the pharmacists accessed the patient's treatment goals or areas in which they hoped the medication would help, and how the medication was being used during the week before the telephone call. Pharmacists were expected to follow-up on any indication of medication non-adherence, inquire on why the doses were missed and make recommendations to increase medication compliance. The second and third telephone calls took place approximately 1 and 2 months after the initial call and on average, required 12 and 11 minutes to complete. During these calls, study pharmacists used the monitoring tool to guide their follow-up on any concerns identified in earlier calls and made new recommendations as needed.\n\nPharmacists reviewed current adherence, whether any new adverse effects or concerns had developed, and evaluated the patient's progress in their medication goals.

Each subject found to be less than 95% adherent according to the EDM data was 'flagged' for counseling with a clinic physician or nurse utilizing the EDM information immediately following regular clinic visit activities. The data were provided to both the subject and his/her clinician as a printout summarizing the per cent of doses taken, the per cent of doses taken on time, and a visual display of doses taken by time. This process of flagging and counseling was specific to each clinic visit. In each counseling session, the clinician reviewed the EDM printout with the subject, explored reasons for missed or off-time doses, and inquired about problems or challenges the subject might be having. Beyond this, counseling sessions did not follow a script. This was designed to accommodate each clinician's counseling style, allow for an individually focused discussion of adherence behavior, and encourage each subject-clinician pair to devise personalized strategies to improving adherence. In this regard, the EDM feedback provided data to inform and thereby enhance the counseling, but did not dictate precisely how the counseling should be performed. In the event that subjects did not immediately offer reasons for missed or off-time doses, clinicians were advised to say: ''Let's talk more about any problems that you had last month.'' Most counseling sessions were completed within 10 to 15 minutes. The intervention period was 7 to 12 months Control: STANDARD CARE Control group participants provided their electronic drug monitors (EDM) data at their monthly visits to the study team members and received standard care. Standard care in China included completing self reports of adherence and attending counseling session with clinician if self reported adherence indicated less than 95% adherence.

Although consideration was given to provision of home-based M-DOT, formative research revealed that patients were concerned this would undermine their privacy and confidentiality. They also believed that clinic visits would provide beneficial access to healthcare workers, so M-DOT services were provided during twice-weekly clinic visits. To enhance convenience, participants could select 1 of 6 health centers for their M-DOT visits. At each visit, participants met with M-DOT observers (nurses) who observed ingestion of the patient's ART dose, inquired about difficulties encountered, and provided individualized adherence support. Used medication containers were also collected, pill counts recorded, and medication dispensed for the subsequent 3 or 4 days. During the monthly clinic visits, efforts were made to ensure that participants in the M-DOT and control group received equal contact time with study staff to minimize the likelihood that any differences observed would be due to nonspecific effects of increased attention given to the intervention group. CHW traced M-DOT participants who missed visits and brought medications to participants who were unable to visit the facility.\n\nAfter cessation of M-DOT at week 24, patients had no further contact with M-DOT observation centers.

After ART initiation, patients visited treatment centers every 4 weeks for follow-up. At the first 2 follow-up visits, general adherence counseling was provided, as was discussion of specific emerging problems with side effects or medication intake; thereafter, counseling was tailored to individual needs.

The intervention was delivered online but the structure was similar to the telephone programs tested in earlier studies. After randomization, participants received a welcome letter describing the program and it contained general advice about the antidepressants medication and self care for depression. Monitoring contacts were scheduled 2, 6, and 10 weeks later. At each monitoring contact, there was an outreach message from the nurse containing a link to an online assessment. The assessment included the PHQ depression questionnaire and questions regarding use of antidepressant medication, side effects, and reasons for medication discontinuation. Those not responding were sent up to 2 reminder messages. For each assessment completed, an algorithm generated a suggested response based on PHQ depression score, current antidepressant use, and side effects. The care manager could tailor this suggested response using information in the medical record or in messages since the last contact. The care manager communicated with the treating physician using an electronic messaging system within the electronic medical record. In consultation with the physician, the care manager might facilitate follow-up visits, support changes in medication, or facilitate referral for specialty care (including urgent referrals in case of suicidal ideation or severe symptoms). Each of the 3 care management contacts included this cycle: outreach message from the care manager, patient completion of online assessment, structured response from the care manager, and follow-up communication with the patient and physician as needed. The care manager's messages to patients included brief support but no formal psychotherapy. Patients were free to send additional messages or telephone the care manager if needed.

Nearly 80% of Americans have home internet access, 29 and surveys find high interest in e-mail communication with health care providers. 30 Financial incentives authorized by the 2009 Recovery Act may further increase availability of online health communication, especially if those incentives define meaningful use of electronic records to include online patient-provider communication. 31 Nevertheless, disadvantaged populations may have less access to online health services. In our sample of patients starting antidepressant treatment, those not registered for online services more often lived in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Approximately half of those registered to use online services enrolled in this trial, compared to 60% to 65% participation in similar trials of telephone care management. Non-participation may have reflected reservations about online depression follow-up or reservations about participation in a clinical trial. Participation may have been greater if (as in previous trials of telephone interventions) the initial invitation had come from the patient's health care team rather than a researcher and was followed by vigorous telephone outreach. The overall completion rate for care management contacts was approximately 85% compared to 95% in previous telephone programs. Despite these lower completion rates, clinical benefits (considering all patients randomized) were similar. This study was conducted in an integrated health care system with shared records of medical and mental health care as well as established collaborative relationships between primary care and mental health providers. The efficiency and clinical benefit of this program might be difficult to replicate outside of an integrated system. Follow-up in the usual care group was more intensive than in typical primary care practice, probably reflecting both above average follow-up rates in this setting 2,5 and a greater likelihood of research participants to return for follow-up.

At the time of enrollment, participants were assigned to individual peers by study staff based on peer availability and presumed compatibility. In the group setting, participants had the opportunity to interact face-to-face with their assigned peer and meet the other peers and participants, with the goal of benefiting from the discussion of the shared experiences of the group. The meetings were designed to identify barriers to HAART adherence and generate problem-solving strategies to overcome them. Other emerging themes included life issues that impact adherence, including HIV status disclosure, dating, substance use, and struggles with mental health issues. One of several research staff members co-ordinated the groups by making reminder phone calls, preparing the meeting room, and providing refreshments. With assistance from the peers, they facilitated the meetings by refocusing the discussion on adherence-related topics when appropriate. Otherwise, they refrained from interfering with the group process and the exchange of support among peers and participants, resulting in predominantly peer led groups. Participants received a USD 15 incentive for attending each of the 6 sessions. All were welcomed to continue attending thereafter but were provided neither reminder phone calls nor monetary incentives for additional meetings. Between group meetings, peers were instructed to call each of their study participants weekly to provide more in-depth one-on-one attention and feedback. Phone calls also were better suited for participants with confidentiality concerns and those who had difficulty traveling to the clinic or had scheduling conflicts with the set meeting times. Peers were instructed not to initiate contact with participants after the 3month intervention period, but they were allowed to respond to requests for contact from the participants at their own discretion."

A computer program allowed for the timing of all text messages to be specified up front and then sent automatically without any further intervention from study staff. At randomization, the study co-ordinator distributed a 2-way pager and customized a message schedule to the participant's daily medication regimen, which was confirmed by the clinic pharmacist. In addition to dose reminders, 3 other types of text messages were sent: (1) educational;\n\n(2) entertainment (jokes or thoughts for the day); and (3) adherence assessments. There was some flexibility in the frequency and content of messages to accommodate participants' differing needs and schedules, but there was a minimum of 3 pager messages sent daily to participants for the first 2 months. Pages gradually tapered in the last month of the 3-month intervention to avoid a rebound in non-adherence. A confirmation return page was requested for every message sent.

Between the first contact and the end of the 3-month intervention, the participants were asked to wear the pager at all waking moments.

If the pager was lost or failed, it was promptly replaced at no cost to the subject Control: USUAL CARE Before initiation of HAART, all clinic patients who are naive patients or off HAART for more than 6 months are required to complete the HAART protocol, a clinic-based program designed to provide education regarding HAART and adherence and to identify and correct adherence barriers before HAART initiation. The HAART protocol involves a series of 3 separate appointments with a pharmacist, nutritionist, and case manager after an initial meeting with a provider and before a final meeting when the provider decides whether to prescribe HAART. During these preliminary interviews, patients are given social and mental health referrals as appropriate, a daily medication schedule, and information on medication side effects and techniques to help manage them. All participants in each of the study's 4 arms participated in the HAART protocol if they had not received it in the last 6 months. There were no time or attention-control activities"

MEMS records were used to calculate on-time openings and the longest documented days of continuous on-time openings. The medication adherence questionnaire was a self report of patient's adherence for the previous day and the past 3 days for each medication. This measure was administered weekly throughout the study. Pills were counted for one selected HAART medication at baseline to reflect the initial stock, then weekly to track adherence, and after refills to account for new pills added to the bottle. All adherence measures were collected by research assistants during in-person meetings with participants\n\nThe patient outcome was the SF-36, a 36-item self administered instrument that evaluates health-related quality of life in 8 dimensions, including: physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and reported health transition. It provides 2 summary measures; a Mental Health Summary Scale and a Physical Health Summary Scale, which were utilized as the primary outcome measures of self reported health. The SF-36 was administered monthly (baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20). Plasma HIV-1 RNA (viral load) was quantified from monthly blood draws using the Quantiplex bDNA Assay. Viral load results typically are widely variable, therefore they present raw results and log-10 transformed values. A decrease of at least 0.5 in log 10 viral load is considered consistent with improvement and not within the range of laboratory error. CD4+ lymphocyte counts, a type of white blood cells or T-cells vital to immune function, was obtained at baseline, weeks 12 and 20 from blood samples sent to the hematology section of San Francisco General Hospital clinical laboratories. HIV infection leads to a progressive reduction in the number of T-cells with CD4 receptors, and the CD4 count is used as a staging indicator for treatment decisions. When there are fewer than 200 CD4+ T-cells per microliter of blood, a person is diagnosed with AIDS.

A therapist's manual describes all the areas, the skills corresponding to each area, and the training strategies for each session. The trainers were 2 psychologists who used 6 learning activities to teach patients skills acquisition: (1) introduction and explanation of the skills to be taught, including preparing and motivating patients to participate actively in the learning activities;\n\n(2) demonstration of the skills by one of the therapists, followed by a question-and-answer segment that allowed for clarification; (3) role playing: patients practiced the skills by role playing during sessions; (4) role playing feedback to allow patients to identify the resources needed to perform the skills in the real world; (5) practice of skills in their natural environment; and (6) at the beginning of the following session a segment was dedicated to verifying the practice of the skills in the community; this information was registered in a skills learning check-up list. The learning activities were similar to the 7 instructional techniques proposed for teaching social and instrumental skills to the severely mentally ill. These were modified to 6 learning activities for the participants of the present study. Patients participated in group sessions, 8 patients per group, with a time limit of 1 hour 15 minutes, once a week for a total of 48 sessions during 1 year of PSST. To verify that each treatment area was being covered systematically and adequately, a therapist fidelity evaluation form was used. Family therapy (FT) consists of 2 parts: the first was psychoeducation, which included 8 group sessions where all the patients' relatives received information about the illness, symptoms and medication management.

To obtain these data, patients were asked if they had taken their AP medication during treatment according to their psychiatrist's instructions. This information was verified using 2 sources: the patients' psychiatrist and the patients' medical records. Compliance occurred when patients took their AP medication in the full prescribed dose by their treating psychiatrist. A criterion of adequate compliance was determined when patients had taken at least 80% of the prescribed AP medication verified by all 3 sources.\n\nThe patient outcomes were symptomatology, psychosocial functioning, global functioning, relapse, rehospitalization and adherence to intervention therapy. Symptomatology was assessed using the PANSS, which is a validated 30-item scale. The Spanish adaptation consists of 3 subscales: positive (7 items), negative (7 items) and general psychopathology (GPS) (16 items). Each item is scored from 1 (absence of psychopathology) to 7 (extremely severe). Psychosocial functioning (PSF) was measured using the Psychosocial Functioning Scale (PSFS). Functioning was assessed in 5 areas (occupational, social, money management, marital, and familial), and the patient's global psychosocial functioning (GPSF) was also assessed. PSF evaluates role performance through the level of satisfaction reported by the patient in the above-mentioned areas of functioning. The instrument is composed of a total of 35 items. Each item is scored from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (very unsatisfied). A low score indicates better psychosocial functioning. Global functioning was evaluated using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale in DSM-IV, which measures the combination of 2 elements: (1) symptom severity, and\n\n(2) any serious impairment in psychological, social and occupational functioning on a mental healthillness continuum (level of functioning). To evaluate intervention adherence, 2 elements were considered: (1) patients' attendance at sessions was registered to measure their percentage of attendance during the intervention, and (2) the level of therapeutic adherence was obtained by considering the number of patients who completed the intervention, compared with those who dropped out. To determine the corresponding therapeutic adherence, the levels of therapeutic adherence must be verified. The percentage of desertion (non-adherence) was obtained by considering the number of patients who dropped out in comparison with the number of patients who initiated the intervention. Independent interviewers, properly trained in all research instruments and unaware of which study group the patients belonged to, evaluated the 2 groups under study: initial and final (12 months) assessments.

However, our a priori CAM included components related to ingestion and still showed robust increases with the intervention. In addition to patients with schizophrenia, we included patients with bipolar disorder on long-term antipsychotics. These patients had lower levels of psychotic symptoms at baseline, which could potentially limit our ability to detect symptomatic changes. However, decreases in PANSS scores from baseline to 12 months were similar for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We note that the increase in overall dose from improved adherence may simply have been too small to impact symptoms (25% more outpatient days with medications ''on hand''), the follow-up period may have been too short to fully capture the benefits of increased adherence, or the relatively stable outpatients enrolling in this study may have been receiving the maximum benefit from their antipsychotic medications despite incomplete adherence. Patients with SMI may need broader-based interventions than those focused on medication adherence if their outcomes are to be improved. Other Limitations Measures of adherence in this study are approximations of actual adherence behaviors. A direct measure of patients' medication taking behavior would be the ultimate gold standard but is seldom achievable in adherence research.33 Although our participation rate is similar to that of most RCTs, patients recruited into a randomized trial may not be typical of all patients with SMI. More paranoid patients or those who were completely unwilling to take medications may have been underrepresented in the study sample-and this should be considered when generalizing study results to clinical populations. However, study participants' reported attitudes toward antipsychotic medications were similar to those reported for another population of patients with schizophrenia.25 Our study was not double blind, and a blinded assessment of outcomes would have been desirable.

CAT strategies are tailored to the specific cognitive impairments and behavioral approaches to goal-directed activity exhibited by each participant. Environmental supports in Full-CAT treatment were based upon an assessment of neurocognitive function, behavior, adaptive functioning, and the environment. Interventions for each functional deficit were based on 2 dimensions, (1) level of impairment in executive functions and (2) whether the overt behavior of the individual during performance of goal-directed activity was characterized more by apathy, disinhibition, or a combination of these styles. According to the CAT model, individuals with poor executive functioning need high levels of structure and more obviously placed environmental cues, while those with somewhat better executive functioning need less structure and more subtle cues. Individuals with apathetic behavior benefit from environmental supports that cue and sequence behavior, those with disinhibition benefit most from the removal of distracting stimuli, and those with mixed behavior benefit from a combination of these strategies. Assessment results yield one of 6 CAT classifications for which interventions can be targeted. Once an individual's CAT classification was determined, strategies for specific functional problems were chosen from the manual. CAT interventions were established, trained, and maintained in the home during weekly visits from a CAT therapist/trainer. Patients in Full-CAT were seen once weekly for 30 to 45 minutes. The treatment lasted for 9 months and then the patients were followed up for 6 months after the withdrawal of home visits.

In future studies including a baseline period of assessment for medication adherence prior to randomization would be important.

Moreover, assessments of medication adherence involve error that may overestimate or underestimate actual adherence. Methodological problems with pill counts and pharmacy records are outlined elsewhere.29 The fact that medication adherence improved, while psychotic symptoms did not suggests that our notions about adequate adherence and optimal dosing may have been formed in the ambiguous environment of partial adherence or negotiation and may need to be altered to maximize the outcomes of our patients.

The study team developed a branching disease management algorithm based on DM and HTN guidelines from the VA, American Diabetes Association, and the American Heart Association. The algorithm was programmed into the device and focused on diet, exercise, smoking cessation, foot care, advice for sick days, medications, weight management, preventive care, and behavior modification and lifestyle adjustments.\n\nA schedule was established for each prompt set so that subjects received both standard prompts each day and a rotation of questions and educational content. Follow-up was for a period of 12 months Intervention: LOW-INTENSITY GROUP In the low-intensity group, subjects were instructed to measure BP daily and BG as directed by their physician. Subjects in this group responded to a small subset of questions from the larger set of questions used with the high-intensity group. Every day, subjects in this group were asked, \"Have you taken all your medications as prescribed?\" In addition, subjects were prompted with one additional question each day focused on diet, exercise, foot care, or medication side effects. These questions did not use the branching algorithm used for the high-intensity group, rather they used yes/no or multiple choice responses Control: USUAL CARE Usual care subjects scheduled follow-up appointments with the primary care clinic in the usual manner.

The first, and prevailing, strategy was self administered treatment, in which each patient collects drugs fortnightly from the most convenient health facility. The second was health worker direct observation of treatment, i.e. supervision by a health worker at a health facility when the patient met criteria for access to the facility, and by a community health worker at or near the patient's home otherwise. The access criteria, determined from the exploratory studies, were that the return journey from the patient's home to the health facility was a distance of less than 2 kilometers, a duration of less than 2 hours, and a cost of less than 10 rupees; and for unmarried women, an accompanying relative was to be available. The patient nominated the health facility most convenient for him or her. If the access criteria were met, a health worker at that facility was identified to supervise treatment; otherwise, a community health worker local to the patient's home and acceptable to the patient was chosen as supervisor. The supervisor was oriented on his or her role by a visiting field officer. The patient was then expected to attend the health facility or community health worker 6 times per week in the initial 2-month intensive phase to take the drugs.

During the final year of the study, pharmacists were paid USD 50 per month for high rates of compliance with the pharmaceutical care protocol (viewing data on the study computer for 90% of patients and documenting actions for 75% of patients). Patients in the pharmaceutical care group received a peak flow meter, instruction about its use, and monthly calls from research personnel to obtain current PEFR results. The peak flow meter monitoring control group (group 2) also received a peak flow meter, instructions about its use, and monthly calls to elicit PEFRs. However, PEFR data were not provided to the pharmacist. Patients in the usual care group received neither peak flow meters nor instructions in their use; during monthly telephone interviews, PEFR rates were not elicited. Pharmacists in both control groups also had a 4-hour training session although the topics were different and they received no components of the pharmaceutical care program Outcomes Compliance measures were made at baseline, at 6 month and 12 months by face-to-face interview using 2 validated measures: a single-item indicator (proportion of noncompliance), and a 4-item scale ranging from 0 (low) to 4 (high) noncompliance. Self report had been found to be valid when inquiries were made in a non-threatening manner Clinical health outcomes included: peak expiratory flow rates, breathing-related emergency department or hospital visits, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), medication compliance, and patient satisfaction Notes -Risk of bias Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Randomization done using random number table.\"...Within each triplet, we used a random-number chart to assign drugstores to 1 of 3 study groups.\" (pg 1595) Allocation concealment (selection bias) Unclear risk Cluster-randomized \"...Within each triplet, we used a random-number chart to assign drugstores to 1 of 3 study groups.\" (pg 1595) Selective reporting (reporting bias) Unclear risk No protocol available; although it appears that everything was reported it is difficult to determine this without a protocol Other bias Low risk The study seems to be free of other types of bias Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Adherence measure Unclear risk (PRIMARY) SELF REPORT -INTERVIEW -Baseline, 6-, and 12-month interviews were conducted by blinded interviewers \"Interviewers, blinded to study group assignment, obtained informed consent and conducted baseline interviews\". \"After completing an interview, the laptop computer used to administer interviews revealed the patient's study group assignment.\" \"in-person follow-up interviews at 6 and 12 months to assess outcomes by individuals blinded to study group.\" Possible loss of blinding because group assignments were revealed in the laptop after the baseline interview(pg 1597) Weinberger 2002 (Continued) Cochrane Library Trusted evidence.

Researchers used identical standardized interventionist scripts\n\nWilson 2010 Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and materials. The patient's asthma history was elicited using a standardized patient information form, the patient's level of asthma control was classified, and asthma education was provided. Once treatment was negotiated, patients were instructed in the correct use of the relevant inhaler medication devices using methods previously shown by this team to improve inhaler technique and eliminate common usage errors. At the end of session 1, a written asthma management and action plan was created, and potential barriers to medication adherence were elicited and addressed using motivational interviewing techniques. Any subsequent changes made at session 2 or in a follow-up phone call were documented in the plan. The SDM model implemented the 4 key defining features. The care manager elicited the patient's goals for treatment and relative priorities regarding symptom control, regimen convenience, avoidance of side effects, and cost. The patient was then shown a list of the full range of regimen options for all levels of asthma severity, based on the then-current national asthma guidelines and KP pharmacopeia. These options differed with respect to the number and type(s) of medications, dosing, and schedule. Using a simple worksheet, the patient and clinician then compared the pros and cons of all of the options the patient wished to consider, which included the option of continuing the patient's current regimen to arrive at a treatment that best accommodated the patient's and care manager's goals. A SABA was always prescribed for rescue use as needed. If indicated, treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease was negotiated Intervention: CLINICIAN DECISION MAKING Session 1 of the intervention involved prescribing the patient a therapy rather than negotiating a therapy. In session 2 (1 month after session 1), and in 3 brief phone calls 3, 6, and 9 months later, patient progress was assessed and medications were adjusted, as necessary, using the assigned care management approach. Researchers used identical standardized interventionist scripts and materials. The patient's asthma history was elicited using a standardized patient information form, the patient's level of asthma control was classified, and asthma education was provided. Once treatment was decided (CDM), patients were instructed in the correct use of the relevant inhaler medication devices using methods previously shown by this team to improve inhaler technique and eliminate common usage errors. At the end of session 1, a written asthma management and action plan was created, and potential barriers to medication adherence were elicited and addressed using motivational interviewing techniques. Any subsequent changes made at session 2 or in a follow-up phone call were documented in the plan. In the CDM model, the care manager prescribed an appropriate regimen based on the patient's level of asthma control, and explained that decision to the patient. A SABA was always prescribed for rescue use as needed. If indicated, treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease was prescribed Control: USUAL CARE Usual asthma care at KP medical centers was based on a stepped-care approach to pharmacotherapy with the aim of long-term asthma control, as recommended by the National Asthma Education Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 2. At some KP sites, physicians also had the option to refer patients to an asthma care management program, typically of less than 6 months' duration, in which a licensed health professional (non-physician) provided asthma education and addressed adherence and other medication use and self management issues in a manner similar to, but less structured than, the CDM intervention. However, asthma care management was neither a required aspect of usual care nor necessarily available at all BOAT sites, and current participation in that program was an exclusion criterion for the study. Once enrolled in BOAT, usual care and SDM or CDM patients (after the intervention phase) still had access to KP's existing care management services, if available, based on their physician's referral"

Both had substantial training in coaching methods as well as masters-level degrees in social work or psychology. Coaches each had over 100 hours of experience of individualized coaching with type 2 diabetes patients and had previously facilitated diabetes coaching groups. Participants randomized to the coaching condition had an initial telephone session with their coach within 2 weeks of the baseline visit. They were then offered 30-minute coaching sessions by telephone (8 weekly calls, 4 biweekly calls, and a final call 1 month later) for a total of 14 sessions. Participants were paired with the same coach throughout the intervention. During the initial telephone call, participants were asked what was important to them in terms of diabetes care, how well they were managing their health, and what they perceived to be their challenges or areas of required support. Patients were guided in creating a vision of health, and long-term goals were discussed that aligned with that vision. To facilitate learning, participants randomized to IH coaching received a binder of educational materials at the initial assessment visit. Contents included materials from Glax-oSmithKline's Adherence Starts with Knowledge\u00ae (ASK-20) and Essential Connections\u00ae as well as information from Duke Integrative Medicine. These were referenced throughout the interactions of the study. The ASK-20 is a brief survey that helps practitioners quickly identify and target reasons patients may not be adhering to prescribed medication regimens. It is accompanied by materials on topics relevant to self management such as symptom recognition, self care, and disease risk factors. Duke Integrative Medicine provided information regarding nutrition, stress management, and tips on how to best utilize time with the coach. Additional materials came from Essential Connections, a resource of tools for coaches to facilitate motivational interviewing techniques and behavior change, linking topics of interest with patients' readiness to change and relevant education content Control: USUAL CARE Control group participants received usual care, with no additional materials or correspondence Outcomes The measures of adherence were self reported Morisky Adherence Scale.

Current Therapy: patients in the CT group (as well as those in the other groups) received standard diabetes therapy from pediatric endocrinologists, including an examination by a physician and a GHb assay at least quarterly; 2 or more daily injection of mixed intermediate-and short-acting insulins; self monitoring of blood glucose and recording of test results; diabetes self management training; a prescribed diet; physical exercise and an annual evaluation for diabetic complications. Education and Support: in the first 3 months of the study, families attended 10 groups meetings that provided diabetes education and social support. A social worker at 1 center and a health educator at another center served as group facilitators. Panels of 2 to 5 families began and completed 10 sessions together; the parents and the adolescent with the diabetes attended the sessions. Family communication and conflict resolution skills were specifically excluded from session content, because these are the primary targets of BFST. Each session included a 45-minute educational presentation by a diabetes professional, followed by a 45-minute interaction among the families about a topic led by the facilitator. A monetary incentive, outlined below, was also provided to patients in this group. BFST: adolescents and caregivers in this group received 10 sessions of BFST. BFST consisted of 4 therapy components that were used in accordance with each family's treatment needs as identified by the project psychologists and was based on study data and family interaction during sessions. The 4 therapy components included problem-solving training, communication skills training, cognitive restructuring and functional and structural family therapy. A monetary incentive was also provided to patients in this group. Monetary incentive -to maximize completion of data collection, families were paid USD 100 (USD 50 for parent, USD 50 for adolescent) on completion of each evaluation.

PS comprised 4 30-minute sessions. The individualized intervention involved 4 interactive steps, usually 1 per research session. For the 158 participants who reported missing doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the goal was to improve adherence. For the 7 participants who declared adherence to the prescribed regimen, the goal was to maintain adherence. The first PS step consisted of defining the problem: improving or preserving adherence to ICS use within the patient's unique context and orientation. Problem orientation facilitated the adoption of a rational, positive, and constructive appraisal of how to achieve adherence, with non-adherence being presented as a problem to be solved. PS was presented as a means of coping with problems more generally and modifying attitudes or beliefs that inhibit or interfere with attempts to solve problems. It was a motivational technique to help the participant view the occurrence of prob-ASTHMA EDUCATION: Patients attended 4 30minute sessions, conducted by a research co-ordinator. Each session was about an asthma education (AE) topic unrelated to self management, adherence, or inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. The topics covered, 1 at each session, were the following: (1) the proper technique for using an albuterol rescue metered-dose inhaler and a dry powder inhaler or spacer, depending on the patient's medications; (2) the use of peak flow meters; (3) common asthma triggers; and (4) the pathophysiology of asthma.

This first step involved breaking problems into small achievable pieces. The second step was brainstorming for alternative solutions.

For the 4th step, the chosen solution was evaluated and revised. As part of this intervention, downloaded data from monitored ICSs were shared with the participant in a nonjudgmental fashion at each visit. At these sessions, subjects followed the same PS steps for addressing an additional problem of their own choosing, such as increasing physical activity.

The visits were designed to improve knowledge and understanding of HIV infection, to identify and resolve real and potential barriers to medication adherence, and ultimately to improve adherence. Spanish-speaking case managers, incentives, notebooks with stickers and pill-swallowing training were also part of the home visit training sessions In the clinic setting for control group (n = 17), the physician, nurse and social worker provided standard medication adherence education at clinic appointments generally scheduled at 3month intervals. Phone follow-ups and a single home visit were planned if the staff felt they were needed. Visual aids for remembering medications, medication boxes, beepers, and general technical and emotional support were regularly offered. The clinic nurse contacted the family by telephone when the patient was starting a new medication, was having difficulty with adherence, or needed clarification and support.

The second workshop used patients' diary records as illustrations of the relative effectiveness of controller medicines over rescue/quick-relief drugs in preventing asthma symptoms over time. Participants reviewed their own records of medicines and symptoms. The third workshop described asthma management as a twopronged effort of pharmacotherapy and trigger control. Between the 1st and 2nd workshops, the Family Co-ordinator prepared families for their doctor visit. The Family Co-ordinator accompanied families to the doctor visit where he intervened if the family failed to communicate a thorough asthma history.

The intervention consists of 3 45-to 60minute group sessions, and individual tailored coaching sessions held at least once per week for 5 weeks. Sessions are delivered by trained health educators during the school day. In addition to teaching asthma management skills and ways to cope with asthma, the health educators encourage students to see their medical provider for a clinical evaluation and treatment. The individual sessions reinforce the educational messages taught in the group, help students identify and overcome barriers to managing their asthma, and coach students regarding their medical visits. The health educator offers to accompany the student to the medical visit to provide moral support, coaching, or advocacy when coaching fails. Medical providers received a presentation by experts in person or by telephone about a recommended change in therapy. The medical providers were first mailed a packet containing: a letter informing them that one of their patients was in the study and would be referred to him/her for a clinical evaluation; a blank asthma checklist the students complete throughout the intervention and bring to the visit with the provider; and a blank asthma action plan the provider is asked to complete.

The intervention was delivered by a team consisting of an endocrinologist, a cardiologist, a nurse and a dietician. There were 2 follow-up assessment -at 60 to 90 days after MI and 120 to 180 days after MI. In diabetic patients, capillary glycemia was measured (Advantage reagent strips, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), lower limbs were examined, and adherence to prescribed oral antidiabetic agents and insulin was reviewed. Those patients who were still smoking were advised to stop smoking by the nurse and also by the cardiologist. No oral medication was prescribed in this regard since these drugs are not routinely provided by the Public Health\n\nSystem in Brazil. After the above-described procedures, the dietitian evaluated body weight and performed a nutritional review.

The goal of these sessions was to help participants gain an understanding of their medication-taking behaviors and the actions necessary to successfully maintain a high level of adherence. The counselor used a MI script to guide the interaction with the participants. During the session participants were encouraged to identify and discuss barriers to adherence, to express and resolve ambivalence about taking medications, and to support motivation to attain or maintain adherence. After each medication was discussed and an action plan developed, the counselor ended each session by summarizing the discussion and the action plan agreed upon by the participant and counselor.

Healthy eating on a limited budget 5. Medication management and 6. Finding and working with a regular doctor. During the sessions, peer educators modeled appropriate behaviors and responses, and participation from each group member helped model behavior and improve motivation for other members. Attendees are taught to develop shortterm \"action plans\" for choosing domains of health behavior change. This process involves identifying a problem that is of particular concern, listing ideas for solving the problem, and then developing a plan outlining specific, short-term goals for improvement. 2 certified mental health peer specialists participated in a community-based, 5-day CDSMP master training course to become master trainers in the CDSMP program.

This enables people to respond to the situation by making conscious choices to respond instead of reacting automatically. The MBSR program consists of the following elements: (1) individual preprogram intake interviews performed by the course instructor with each participant, lasting 30 minutes; (2) 8 weekly classes of 2.5 to 3 hours; (3) an all-day silent retreat during the 6th week of the program; and (4) daily home assignments including a minimum of 45 minutes per day of formal mindfulness practice and 5 to 15 minutes of informal practice, 6 days per week for the entire duration of the course. The total in-class contact is approximately 30 hours, and the total home assignments are a minimum of 42 to 48 hours. In addition, one to 2 additional individual interview sessions may be provided, at instructor discretion, to individual participants during the course. In addition to teaching mindfulness practices, the course includes didactic presentations that include information on stress physiology and stress reactivity.

Goals were documented in the patient records. When any of the risk factors were uncontrolled, the pharmacist alerted the patient by telephone and mail, and the physician was notified through the patient's medical record and face to face (when possible). Patients received continuous follow-up by the pharmacist at a minimum of every 8 weeks by telephone, mail, electronic mail, or face to face appointments. Mailed letters were reserved for patients who were successfully controlled or had been recently contacted. Information delivered during follow-up was patient-specific and did not require that a standard content be covered. Reasons for follow-up included 1) To communicate relevant laboratory results, including proximity to individual targets; 2)To monitor clinical status within 7 to 10 days after the initiation or change of a drug; 3) To monitor clinical status within 7 to 10 days after experiencing an adverse event 4) To ensure that the patient was able to procure necessary follow-up appointments 5) To provide patients with clinical goal reminders, disease-specific information, or timely topics using periodic mailers.

The nature of this intervention is to identify and address, through interventions, an individual's deficits in adherence-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. The intervention activities consisted of 20 different interactive activities that would be selected by the participants according to their goals. Patients on average spent 26 minutes to complete the full intervention with an average of 8 min dedicated to adherence intervention modules. Participants received USD 20 for completion of each session.

The intervention involved 5 types of providers: (1) PCPs located at CBOCs; 2) consult telepsychiatrists located at parent VAMCs; (3) an off-site depression nurse care manager (RN); (4) an off-site clinical pharmacist (PharmD); and 5) an off-site supervising psychiatrist. The consult-telepsychiatrist accepted consultations or referrals from PCPs. The supervising psychiatrist provided clinical supervision to the care manager and clinical pharmacist via weekly face-to-face meetings. Patients and providers could choose either watchful waiting or antidepressant treatment (Step 1). Nurse care manager encounters were conducted via telephone and were scripted to enhance standardization and reproducibility. During the initial care management encounter, patients were: (1) administered the PHQ9 symptom monitoring tool; (2) educated and activated using a semi-structured script4; and 3) assessed for treatment barriers using semi-structured scripts for endorsed barriers. Follow-up encounters to monitor symptoms, medication adherence, and side effects were scheduled every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. Non-adherent patients or those experiencing severe side effects were administered semi-structured scripts.3 A trial was considered to have failed in the acute phase if the patient: (1) was non-adherent to the medication, (2) experienced severe side effects, (3) experienced 5-point increase in their PHQ9 score, or (4) did not respond (50% decrease in PHQ9 score) after 8 weeks of antide-months.

All feedback was provided to PCPs using the electronic medical record. Progress notes reporting failed trials requested an electronic co-signature from the PCP. If the patient did not respond to the initial antidepressant, the pharmacist conducted a medication history and provided pharmacotherapy recommendations to PCPs via an electronic progress note (Step 2). The pharmacist also provided non-scripted medication management over the phone to patients experiencing severe side effects or problems with non-adherence. If the patient did not respond to 2 antidepressants trials, the protocol was to recommend a telepsychiatry consultation followed by additional treatment recommendations to the PCP (Step 3) (n = 177 patients (3 practices)) Friedman 1996 Hypertension Telephone-linked computer system (TLC)an interactive computer-based telecommunications system that converses with patients in their homes between office visits to their physicians (n = 156) Regular medical care (n = 145) Yes Yes Gallefoss 1999 Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) An educational intervention consisting of a specially constructed patient brochure, 2 2-hour group sessions (separate groups for asthmatics and patients with COPD) concentrating on pathophysiology, anti-obstructive medication, symptom awareness, treatment plans, and physiotherapy.

In addition to standard asthma care, intervention group subjects were offered up to 8 months of individual visits within a 12-week period. Although the proposed intervention was unique in its design, to increase the internal validity of the study, the Compliance Therapy Model was used to provide the underpinning theoretical framework. This model encompassed the Transtheoretical Model of Change, Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles, providing a flexible short-term intervention using patient's individual reasons for nonadherence as a guide to plan intervention content. The model used a non-confrontational technique which elicited self motivation and provided a process to resolve ambivalence towards medication taking (n = 9) STANDARD ASTHMA CARE: All participants received standard asthma care at the difficult asthma service but the control group did not receive any further intervention.

The healthcare assistants contacted their patients by telephone twice a week in the first month and then once a month for the following 11 months. They monitored depression symptoms and adherence to medication by using the Depression Monitoring Context List. Healthcare assistants also encouraged patients to follow self management activities, such as medication adherence and activation for pleasant or social activities.

A printed 16-page booklet covering the pros and cons of oral versus depot formulation, first-versus second-generation antipsychotics, psychoeducation, and type of socio-therapeutic intervention was presented to the patients through the head nurse of the ward as soon as the psychiatrist in charge considered them able to cooperate. Trained nurses assisted the patient to work through the booklet. Within the decision aid, patients were asked to write down their experiences with previous antipsychotic medication and to indicate their preferences regarding the different options on each topic. Nurses were advised to answer any questions of the patients and to encourage them to state any point of view contrary to that of the doctor.

In the first half of the session, patients' laboratory and blood pressure results were reviewed and action planning was introduced. In the 2nd half, patients received brief training in basic peer communication skills and were paired with another age matched patient in their cohort.

Patients in the NCM group then attended a 1.5-hour session, led by a care manager, to review their laboratory and blood pressure results, ask questions, and receive information on VA care management services. They were provided their assigned care manager's contact information and encouraged to schedule follow-up telephone calls or faceto-face visits with that care manager.

The system also allowed patients to leave voice messages for research staff or care managers. At the end of the initial session, patients were given a DVD that demonstrated peer communication skills and a diabetes self management workbook that they could use to help guide their peer telephone calls. Patients were also offered 3 optional 1.5-hour group sessions at months 1, 3, and 6. These were completely patient-driven sessions at which patients were encouraged to share concerns, questions, strategies, and progress on their action plans.\n\nSessions were facilitated by a care manager and a research associate. Research associates were present to help maintain intervention fidelity by encouraging nondirective facilitation of group discussions and to complete a checklist of key areas covered and communication skills used in each session (n = 126) with diabetes self management educational materials. Patients in the NCM group thus received enhanced usual care, because even though they would all be eligible for nurse care manager support at the study sites, many patients are not aware of and do not avail themselves of this service unless referred by their physician (n = 119) Henry 1999 H.

Where appropriate, pharmacists educated the patient/carer about heart failure and their drugs and gave basic exercise, dietary, and smoking cessation advice. They also encouraged completion of simple sign and symptom monitoring diary cards (including monitoring body weight), removed discontinued drugs (with the patient's consent), fed back recommendations to the general practitioner, and fed back to the local pharmacist any need for a drug adherence aid (for example, a Medidos or Dosett container). We provided all pharmacists with a detailed manual describing the expected components of their visit and asked them to deliver education in line with advice given in the British Heart Foundation's booklet Living with Heart Failure, which they le with patients after the first visit. Pharmacists completed a standardized visit form during each visit. 1 follow-up visit occurred at 6 to 8 weeks after discharge to review progress and reinforce original advice.

It was designed to empower women to make decisions and develop strategies about taking ART as prescribed and consistently using risk reduction behaviors, such as condom use and to overcome resistance/ambivalence to both. The sessions lasted about 1.5 to 2 hours, and were led by trained MI nurses. The first and last session focused on both adherence and risk behavior, 3 sessions were devoted to adherence only and 3 to risk reduction behaviors only, including a session on disclosure which is important to risk reduction as well as adherence. Each session included a discussion of goals and goal setting related to the topic. MI techniques were incorporated into every session. In keeping with the autonomy support spirit of MI, participants as a group chose which topic they wanted to address first. The majority of groups (n = 14) chose medication adherence as the first topic (n = 104) HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAM: The control group sessions were equivalent in length and time to the MI group and were led by trained nurses and a health educator.

Psychiatrist attended a 90-minute training session during which they were informed about the rationale for taking into account the spiritual dimension in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and how to conduct a spiritual assessment. They were made aware of how their own religious and spiritual experiences could influence their identity and world view, as well as how their attitudes toward such experiences might introduce biases into clinical assessment and treatment. Finally, psychiatrists were reminded to show respect for patients with different religious and spiritual backgrounds. Psychiatrists used a semi-structured interview guided by the following topics: religious and spiritual history, effects of illness on spirituality or religiousness, current spiritual or religious beliefs and practices, subjective importance of religion in general, subjective importance of religion in coping with the illness, synergy of religion with psychiatric care. After each assessment the psychiatrist met with 2 of the authors, a psychiatrist and a psychologist of religion.

Self management sessions were held by a certified asthma educator and respiratory therapist. The sessions consisted of asthma facts and medication actions and individualized components such as verbal and graphic interpretation of spirometric results, peak flow trends, metered dose inhaler technique error, and skin allergen results (with strategies to control specific personal environmental exposures). The peak flow monitor was modified for the intervention group to use a traffic light analogy and correlated to a simple written action plan (n = 45) SELF-MONITORING ALONE: Control patients attended the same number of visits as intervention patients, but control visits were only for data collection. During each phase of the trial, all participants measured morning peak flow with an electronic peak flowmeter (Airwatch; iMetrikus, Carlsbad, Calif) and also recorded their daily values in a diary. All participants were told that higher peak flow numbers meant their airways were more open and lower numbers meant their airways were more closed. An electronic medication monitor, which concealed readings from the subject (Doser CT; Med-iTrack, Hudson, Mass), was placed on each ICS inhaler. Participants also monitored daily symptoms, night-time awakenings, and tabulated ICS and inhaled b-agonist (IBA) use in the diary.

The pharmacist also completed a medication table designed specifically to discuss types, indications, doses, frequency of administration, and possible side effects for each prescribed medication. The importance of simple exercises symptoms control and the technique for expectoration were discussed with the intervention patients. A booklet on these techniques was prepared to assist in the education session and the patients were given a copy to take home with them. The clinical pharmacist used the motivational interviewing technique with the aim of improving adherence to the prescribed treatment. Patients who still smoked were referred to a special smoking cessation program within the hospital (n = 66) TREATMENT AS USUAL: Controls did not receive pharmacists care (n = 67) Yes for improving adherence to medication at 6 months No for change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and BMI at 6 months.

Intervention patients were educated individually by the clinical pharmacist (in a structured fashion) on COPD, their prescribed medication, the importance of adherence, inhaler technique (written information was provided) and the management of COPD symptoms. The clinical pharmacist ensured that the patient knew the indications and doses of each medicine, and was able and willing to use the inhaler devices prescribed. The clinical pharmacist also discussed with the intervention patients the importance of simple exercises that patients can do at home (e.g. upper and lower limb exercises and relaxation techniques), symptom control (pursed lip technique) and the technique for expectoration (huff and puff technique). The pharmacist demonstrated these techniques and then asked the patients to carry out the techniques to ensure that they fully understood how to perform them. A booklet on these techniques was prepared to assist in the education session and the patients were given a copy to take home with them. Advice, using the motivational interviewing technique, was provided to the patients who still smoked and referral to a special smoking cessation program run within the hospital was made.

The clinical pharmacist through motivational interviewing attempted to increase the intervention patients' self efficacy to manage or avoid breathing difficulty while participating in certain activities. The interventions were tailored according to the preliminary assessment, i.e. checklists of patients' needs were prepared by the research pharmacist and forwarded to the clinical pharmacist to discuss with the patients. The initial intervention lasted for approximately 1 hour for non-smoker patients and slightly longer for patients who currently smoked. At each outpatient clinic visit (every 6 months arranged by the hospital consultant), intervention group patients received reinforcement of the education on COPD and its treatment from the clinical pharmacist. In addition, follow-up telephone calls by the clinical pharmacist to reinforce the education and motivate the patients to achieve their goals were made at 3 and 9 months, i.e. between outpatient clinic appointments (n = 86) Kimmel 2012 No specific clinical problems; patients just needed to be on warfarin LOTTERY-BASED INCEN-TIVES: Patients in the intervention group were offered financial incentives to remain adherent. All patients were provided with an Informedix Med-eMonitor System, which has a display screen and separate medication compartments in which to place their warfarin. The monitor connects to an analog telephone line. CONTROL: Patients in the control arm were set up with the Med-eMonitor in order to measure medication adherence.

The pharmaceutical care program usually started about 1 week before discharge from the transplant surgery unit. The hospital pharmacist met with the patient 3 to 4 times and educated him on different issues regarding immunosuppressive medication, for example, action of the drugs, side effects, interactions, vital signs, laboratory data, and discharge medication. On discharge, the hospital pharmacist handed out and explained written information, including a discharge medication plan, information regarding the immunosuppressive therapy, and a diary for documenting vital signs and laboratory data. During the first year after transplantation, the patient met the pharmacist at least once per quarter year and at maximum once per month.

Elements of the standard intervention package consisted of self monitoring of medication taking using adherence diaries; regular individual and group education by peer-workers using patient education leaflets and tabletop flipcharts; and late attendee tracing. The treatment supporters were usually family membersusually a partner, mother, daughter, sister, brother, friend, or neighbor/friend-who were chosen by the patient with the assistance of the health workers, had accepted the patient's HIV status and were confidantes. These individuals were committed to support the patient with ART for a long time, had gained the patient's trust over time, and commanded respect. Patients were asked to bring their chosen treatment supporter to the ART clinic for the health worker to explain about ART, adherence and treatment support. This includes commitment, confidentiality, knowledge on HIV and ART related needs, and perhaps emergency resource needs such as money, help with STANDARD ADHERENCE INTERVENTION: Patients randomized to the control arm did not have a treatment supporter but otherwise received the same standard adherence intervention package including the ongoing existing health education and adherence counseling support that all patients received during routine monthly clinic visits.

On Monday morning of each week, the site nurse or clinical officer sent a text message via SMS to patients in the intervention group to inquire about their status and thus to remind them about the availability of phonebased support. Regular, structured mobile phone communication between healthcare workers and patients could improve patient outcomes by both reminding patients to take their ART and by providing support to the patients. Patients in the intervention group were instructed to respond within 48 hours that either they were doing well or that they had a problem. The clinician then called patients who said they had a problem or who failed to respond within 2 days. Participants were instructed that healthcare workers were available to respond during clinic hours only (n = 273) USUAL CARE: Control group is standard care.

Strategies for overcoming these barriers were also discussed. Sessions lasted for 20 to 30 minutes and were intended to deliver individualized support to each patient. At the end of the session patients were offered an educational leaflet to take away. Patients had the option of being accompanied to these educational sessions by a relative or friend and any accompanying person was also offered a leaflet specifically written for relatives and friends. During the session patients were offered a free choice of up to 3 practical adherence enhancing interventions; simplifying of dosing regime, medication reminder charts, visual medication reminders for refrigerators and bedside cabinets, daily electronic pill box organizers with alarms, weekly electronic pill box organizers, weekly non-electronic pill box organizers, mobile telephone alarm setup, taking into consideration that practical problems and adherence may change over time. Participants had the option of changing these interventions at any time during the study and at weeks 4 and 24 they were formally asked whether they wished to change the interventions. 1 brief follow-up telephone call was made to patients in the intervention group at week 4. During the midstudy visit a 10-minute reinforcement session was held during which the importance of adherence to prescribed 5-ASA medication was reiterated, beliefs regarding medicine-taking were reassessed, and any practical problems were discussed.

The pharmacist dispensed enough of the patient's medications to last approximately 2 months. The intervention lasted 9 months. When medications were dispensed, the pharmacist provided patient-centered verbal instructions and written materials about the medications. Each medication category had an icon associated with it. The same icon appeared on the container label and lid and on the written patient instructions. The pharmacist monitored patients' medication use, health care encounters, body weight, and other relevant data by using a study database. Information about patients was communicated as needed to clinic nurses and primary care physicians by faceto-face visits, telephone, paging (physician only), and e-mail (physician only). An interdisciplinary team of investigators trained the intervention pharmacist. The in-USUAL CARE: Control groups received usual care. Usual care participants were aware of the purpose of the study.

All obtained data were summarized in a personal risk-factor passport: a graphical presentation of the patient's calculated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. It also showed the target risk that could be reached if all the patient's modifiable risk factors were optimally treated, as well as the standard ageand gender-related risk. 10-year risk and target risk were calculated using the Framingham risk score. The risk-factor passport contained the most recent ultrasound image of the patient's carotid artery, as well as an example of a healthy and an unfavorable image of the carotid artery, which were both explained and discussed by the nurse practitioner.

Patients randomized to the Positive Affect (PA) intervention group were given the same workbook as those in the PE group but with an additional chapter that addresses the benefits of positive moments in overcoming obstacles to medication adherence. Also, these patients received 2 forms of PA during bimonthly telephone calls. First, they were asked to identify small things in their lives that invoke positive feelings in them and were then instructed to incorporate these positive thoughts into their daily routine. The positive thoughts were further reinforced during subsequent bimonthly telephone calls. Second, the patients received unexpected small gi s mailed to them before each telephone call. This strategy was based on the potential of the receipt of unexpected gi s to induce positive feelings. For self affirmation induction, the patients were asked to remember their core values and proud moments in their lives whenever they encounter situations that PATIENT EDUCATION: Patient Education (PE) control group received a culturally tailored educational workbook designed (1) to enhance patients' knowledge about hypertension, (2) to improve self management behaviors, and (3) to support goal-setting. On receipt of the workbook, trained Research Assistants (RAs) reviewed each chapter with the patients and then asked them to sign a behavioral contract that asked them to make a commitment to taking their medications as prescribed. Subsequent to this session, each patient received bimonthly telephone calls, during which the RAs assessed the patient's behavioral contract and confidence to take their medications as prescribed. These assessments served as the basis for reviewing and counseling the patient on perceived barriers to medication adherence.

AMF stands for adherence monitoring with feedback and ABC stands for asthma basic care. These patients received 1. Objective feedback of medication adherence: electronic medication feedback. The AEs were trained to provide non-threatening, supportive feedback on adherence to encourage a partnership with the family; 2. Goal-setting: families were encouraged to set asthma control goals (e.g. no coughing at night) and weekly adherence goals. The AEs assisted families in setting age-appropriate expectations regarding the child's ability to self manage asthma; 3. Reinforcement for attaining adherence goals: the importance of positive reinforcement. When the child attained the adherence goal, the AE provided a small reward (e.g. crayons). When it was not achieved, the AE worked with the family to identify barriers and taught problem-solving skills. 4.

The HIV depression care team consisted of a registered nurse depression care manager, a clinical pharmacist, and a psychiatrist. This team was located offsite and convened once a week and as needed by telephone or in person. The depression care team communicated with treating clinicians via electronic medical record progress notes. The DCM communicated with patients via telephone. The HITIDES depression care team made treatment suggestions. Treatment decisions were made by the HIV or mental health clinicians at each site. The DCM delivered the following intervention components: participant education and activation, assessment of treatment barriers and possible resolutions, depression symptom and treatment monitoring, substance abuse monitoring, and instruction in self management. The DCM used prewritten scripts, which are standardized instruments that were supported by the Web-based decision support system during these telephone encounters. The intervention used a stepped-care model for depression treatment. At any time, HIV health care providers were free to refer participants directly to specialty mental health care. The DCM conducted telephone-based monitoring every 2 weeks during acute treatment and every 4 weeks during watchful waiting or continuation treatment. The USUAL CARE: Usual care depression treatment was provided by HIV or mental health clinicians without involvement of the HITIDES depression care team.

Each subject found to be less than 95% adherent according to the EDM data was 'flagged' for counseling with a clinic physician or nurse utilizing the EDM information immediately following regular clinic visit activities. The data were provided to both the subject and his/her clinician as a printout summarizing the percent of doses taken, the percent of doses taken on time, and a visual display of doses taken by time. This process of flagging and counseling was specific to each clinic visit. In each counseling session, the clinician reviewed the EDM printout with the subject, explored reasons for missed or off-time doses, and inquired about problems or challenges the subject might be having. Beyond this, counseling sessions did not follow a script. This was designed to accommodate each clinician's counseling style, allow for an individually-focused discussion of adherence behavior, and encourage each subject-clinician pair to devise personalized strategies to improving adherence. In this regard, the EDM feedback provided data to inform and thereby enhance the counseling, but did not dictate precisely how the counseling should be per-STANDARD CARE: Control group participants provided their electronic drug monitors (EDM) data at their monthly visits to the study team members and received standard care.

To enhance convenience, participants could select 1 of 6 health centers for their M-DOT visits. At each visit, participants met with M-DOT observers (nurses) who observed ingestion of the patient's ART dose, inquired about difficulties encountered, and provided individualized adherence support. Used medication containers were also collected, pill counts recorded, and medication dispensed for the subsequent 3 or 4 days. During the monthly clinic visits, efforts were made to ensure that participants in the M-DOT and control group received equal contact time with study staff to minimize the likelihood that any differences observed would be due to nonspecific effects of increased attention given to the intervention group. CHW traced M-DOT participants who missed visits and brought medications to participants who were unable to visit the facility. After cessation of M-DOT at week 24, patients had no further contact with M-DOT observation centers.

The intervention was delivered online but the structure was similar to the telephone programs tested in earlier studies. After randomization, participants received a welcome letter describing the program and it contained general advice about the antidepressants medication and self care for depression. Monitoring contacts were scheduled 2, 6, and 10weeks later. At each monitoring contact, there was an outreach message from the nurse containing a link to an online assessment. The assessment included the PHQ depression questionnaire and questions regarding use of antidepressant medication, side effects, and reasons for medication discontinuation. Those not responding were sent up to 2 reminder messages. For each assessment completed, an algorithm generated a suggested response based on PHQ depression score, current antidepressant use, and side effects. The care manager could tailor this suggested response using information in the medical record or in messages since the last contact. The care manager communicated with the treating physician using an electronic messaging system within the electronic medical record. In consultation with the physician, the care manager might facilitate follow-up visits, support changes in medication, or facilitate re-USUAL CARE: Controls received usual care and did not receive any additional care other than what was normally available, which included follow-up in primary care or specialty referral for psychotherapy or medication management.

At the time of enrollment, participants were assigned to individual peers by study staff based on peer availability and presumed compatibility. In the group setting, participants had the opportunity to interact face-to-face with their assigned peer and meet the other peers and participants, with the goal of benefiting from the discussion of the shared experiences of the group. The meetings were designed to identify barriers to HAART adherence and generate problem-solving strategies to overcome them. Other emerging themes included life issues that impact adherence, including HIV status disclosure, dating, substance use, and struggles with mental health issues. One of several research staff members coordinated the groups by making reminder phone calls, preparing the meeting room, and providing refreshments. With assistance from the peers, they facilitated the meetings by refocusing the discussion on adherence-related topics when appropriate. Otherwise, they refrained from interfering with the group process and the exchange of support among peers and participants, resulting in predominantly peer led groups. Participants received a $15 incentive for attending each of the 6 sessions. All were welcomed to continue attending thereafter but were provided neither reminder phone calls nor monetary incentives for additional meetings.

A computer program allowed for the timing of all text messages to be specified up front and then sent automatically without any further intervention from study staff. At randomization, the study co-ordinator distributed a 2-way pager and customized a message schedule to the participant's daily medication regimen, which was confirmed by the clinic pharmacist. In addition to dose reminders, 3 other types of text messages were sent: (1) educational; (2) entertainment (jokes or thoughts for the day); and (3) adherence assessments. There was some flexibility in the frequency and content of messages to accommodate participants' differing needs and schedules, but there was a minimum of 3 pager messages sent daily to participants for the first 2 months.

Patients met with a registered nurse or trained research assistant who provided medication coaching once during the baseline phase and then every 2 weeks throughout the study. Patients were provided with a hard copy of their MEMS data throughout the study. During baseline, patients met a research assistant twice weekly to provide the MEMS data. At the end of the baseline phase, patients in the voucher phase continued to meet twice weekly with a research assistant, for a total of 24 visits. When patients opened their medication caps as scheduled, they received vouchers that were exchangeable for goods and services for each correctly taken medication dose. The value of the voucher increased for each correctly taken dose in a row, but reset to the original value if a dose was missed. Patients could earn up to USD 1172.40 if they took all their medication correctly throughout the study COMPARISON: Patients in the comparison group began with a 4-week baseline phase, where they received a MEMS monitor for one of their HAART medications. Patients met with a registered nurse or trained research assistant who provided medication coaching once during the baseline phase and then every 2 weeks throughout the study.

It is composed of 7 treatment areas: (1) symptom management, (2) medication management, (3) social relations, (4) occupational, (5) money management, (6) couple relations, and (7) family relations. A therapist's manual describes all the areas, the skills corresponding to each area, and the training strategies for each session. The trainers were 2 psychologists who used 6 learning activities to teach patients skills acquisition: (1) introduction and explanation of the skills to be taught, including preparing and motivating patients to participate actively in the learning activities;\n\n(2) demonstration of the skills by one of the therapists, followed by a question-and-answer segment that allowed for clarification; (3) role playing: patients practiced the skills by role playing during sessions;\n\n(4) role playing feedback to allow patients to identify the resources needed to perform the skills in the real world;\n\n(5) practice of skills in their natural environment; and (6) at the beginning of the following session a segment was dedicated to verifying the practice of the skills in the community; this information was registered in a skills learning check-up list. The learning activities were similar to the 7 instructional techniques proposed for teaching social and instrumental skills to the severely mentally ill. These were modified to 6 learning activities for TREATMENT AS USUAL: Control group was treatment as usual, which was provided at the Schizophrenia Clinic of the INPRF by 2 clinical psychiatrists, who were blind to the 2 treatment conditions.They provided 20-minute monthly appointments during a 1-year period, controlled the prescription of their AP medication based upon the assessment of their psychotic symptoms, checked their medication compliance, recorded their attendance to the consultations, and registered all this information in their clinical files (n = 49)\n\nYes for improving adherence to antipsychotic medication at 12 months in patients with schizophrenia Yes for improvement in symptomatology, psychosocial and global functioning, reducing relapse, rehospitalization and dropout rates Cochrane Library Trusted evidence.

To verify that each treatment area was being covered systematically and adequately, a therapist fidelity evaluation form was used. Family therapy (FT) consists of 2 parts: the first was psychoeducation, which included 8 group sessions where all the patients' relatives received information about the illness, symptoms and medication management. The second part consisted of 4 sessions for each family, including the patient, oriented to problem-solving as needed by each family to improve communication skills, the recognition and management of warning signs of relapse, the importance of medication and its side effects, compliance with AP medication, and keeping appointments with physicians. 2 family therapists conducted the FT.

Patients monitored their asthma weekly by completing an electronic version of the Asthma Control Questionnaire on the website and instantly received feedback on the current state of their asthma control along with advice on how to adjust their treatment according to a predefined algorithm and treatment plan. Selfmanagement education consisted of both webbased and face-to-face, group-based education. Web-based education included asthma information, news, frequently asked questions, and interactive communication with a respiratory nurse specialist. All patients were offered 2 groupbased education sessions, which lasted 45 to 60 minutes, for patients in the Internet-based self management group within 6 weeks after entering the trial.

CAT strategies are tailored to the specific cognitive impairments and behavioral approaches to goal-directed activity exhibited by each participant. Environmental supports in Full-CAT treatment were based upon an assessment of neurocognitive function, behavior, adaptive functioning, and the environment. Interventions for each functional deficit were based on 2 dimensions, (1) level of impairment in executive functions and (2) whether the overt behavior of the individual during performance of goal-directed activity was characterized more by apathy, disinhibition, or a combination of these styles. According to the CAT model, individuals with poor executive functioning need high levels of structure and more obviously placed environmental cues, while those with somewhat better executive functioning need TAU: Patients are seen monthly to every 3 months for brief medication visits.

Individuals with apathetic behavior benefit from environmental supports that cue and sequence behavior, those with disinhibition benefit most from the removal of distracting stimuli, and those with mixed behavior benefit from a combination of these strategies. Assessment results yield one of 6 CAT classifications for which interventions can be targeted. Once an individual's CAT classification was determined, strategies for specific functional problems were chosen from the manual. CAT interventions were established, trained, and maintained in the home during weekly visits from a CAT therapist/trainer. Patients in Full-CAT were seen once weekly for 30 to 45 minutes. The treatment lasted for 9 months and then the patients were followed up for 6 months after the withdrawal of home visits. CAT therapists were individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees in psychology or related fields trained using a combination of didactic and in vivo strategies.

The study team developed a branching disease management algorithm based on DM and HTN guidelines from the VA, American Diabetes Association, and the American Heart Association. The algorithm was programmed into the device and focused on diet, exercise, smoking cessation, foot care, advice for sick days, medications, weight management, preventive care, and behavior modification and lifestyle adjustments. A schedule was established for each prompt set so that subjects received both standard prompts each day and a rotation of questions and educational content.

In session 2 (1 month after session 1), and in 3 brief phone calls 3, 6, and 9 months later, patient progress was assessed and medications were adjusted, as necessary, using the assigned care management approach. Researchers used identical standardized interventionist scripts and materials. The patient's asthma history was elicited using a standardized patient information form, the patient's level of asthma control was classified, and asthma education was provided. Once treatment was negotiated, patients were instructed in the correct use of the relevant inhaler medication devices using methods previously shown by this team to improve inhaler technique and eliminate common usage errors. At the end of session 1, a written asthma management and USUAL CARE: Usual asthma care at KP medical centers was based on a stepped-care approach to pharmacotherapy with the aim of longterm asthma control, as recommended by the National Asthma Education Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 2. At some KP sites, physicians also had the option to refer patients to an asthma care management program, typically of less than 6 months' duration, in which a licensed health professional (non-physician) provided asthma education and addressed adherence and other medication use and self management issues in a manner similar to, but less structured than, the CDM intervention. However, asthma care management was neither a required aspect of usual care nor necessarily available at all BOAT sites, and current participation in that program was an exclusion criterion for the study.

Any subsequent changes made at session 2 or in a follow-up phone call were documented in the plan. The SDM model implemented the 4 key defining features. The care manager elicited the patient's goals for treatment and relative priorities regarding symptom control, regimen convenience, avoidance of side effects, and cost. The patient was then shown a list of the full range of regimen options for all levels of asthma severity, based on the then-current national asthma guidelines and KP pharmacopeia. These options differed with respect to the number and type(s) of medications, dosing, and schedule. Using a simple worksheet, the patient and clinician then compared the pros and cons of all of the options the patient wished to consider, which included the option of continuing the patient's current regimen to arrive at a treatment that best accommodated the patient's and care manager's goals. A SABA was always prescribed for rescue use as needed. If indicated, treatment of allergic rhinitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease was negotiated (n = 204) CLINICIAN DECISION-MAKING: Session 1 of the intervention involved prescribing the patient a therapy rather than negotiating a therapy.

They were then offered 30-minute coaching sessions by telephone (8 weekly calls, 4 biweekly calls, and a final call 1 month later) for a total of 14 sessions. Participants were paired with the same coach throughout the intervention. During the initial telephone call, participants were asked what was important to them in terms of diabetes care, how well they were managing their health, and what they perceived to be their challenges or areas of required support. Patients were guided in creating a vision of health, and long-term goals were discussed that aligned with that vision. To facilitate learning, participants randomized to IH coaching received a binder of educational materials at the initial assessment visit. Contents included materials from Glax-oSmithKline's Adherence Starts with Knowl-edge\u00ae (ASK-20) and Essential Connections\u00ae as well as information from Duke Integrative Medicine. These were referenced throughout the interactions of the study. The ASK-20 is a brief survey that helps practitioners quickly identify and target reasons patients may not be adhering to prescribed medication regimens. It is accompanied by materials on topics relevant to self management such as symptom recognition, self care, and disease risk factors. Duke Integrative Medicine provided information regarding nutrition, stress management, and tips on how to best utilize time with the coach.

Treatment intensity was increased for patients failing to respond to lower levels of care by involving a greater number of intervention personnel with increasing mental health expertise. The intervention involved 5 types of providers: (1) PCPs located at CBOCs; 2) consult telepsychiatrists located at parent Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs); (3) an off-site depression nurse care manager (RN); (4) an off-site clinical pharmacist (PharmD); and 5) an off-site supervising psychiatrist. The consult-telepsychiatrist accepted consultations or referrals from PCPs. The supervising psychiatrist provided clinical supervision to the care manager and clinical pharmacist via weekly face-to-face meetings. Patients and providers could choose either watchful waiting or antidepressant treatment (Step 1). Nurse care manager encounters were conducted via telephone and were scripted to enhance standardization and reproducibility. During the initial care management encounter, patients were: (1) administered the PHQ9 symptom monitoring tool; (2) educated and activated using a semi-structured script4; and 3) assessed for treatment barriers using semi-structured scripts for endorsed barriers.
