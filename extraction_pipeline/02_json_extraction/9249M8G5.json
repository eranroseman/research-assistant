  "title": "Adherence Monitoring and E-Health: How Clinicians and Researchers Can Use Technology to Promote Inhaler Adherence for Asthma",
  "abstract": "In the past decade, rapid technological developments have advanced electronic monitoring devices (EMD) for asthma inhalers beyond simple recording of actuations to providing adherence promotion features and detailed information about patterns of medication use. This article describes currently available EMDs, discusses their utility and limitations in assessing adherence, and describes the potential for EMD-based adherence promotion interventions in clinical settings. To date, the main use of EMDs has been in clinical research. In selected populations, simple EMD-based adherence interventions, delivered either through clinician-to-patient feedback about medication use or by direct-to-patient reminders for missed doses, can significantly improve adherence. Further work is now needed to determine the impact of EMDs on clinical outcomes and their cost-effectiveness and feasibility for different clinical settings, including in disadvantaged populations. If this evidence can be provided, then the use of EMDs could expand into the management of asthma in populations with high health care costs, eg, severe asthma. In the future, medication monitoring could help distinguish poor treatment response from poor adherence, guide prescribing decisions, and prompt providers to discuss barriers to adherence; electronic health records may provide the gateway for integrating medication-use monitoring into digital chronic care management.",

Dispensing data can provide an estimate of maximum overall inhaler use in a given period,  13  but few countries have complete dispensing registers, and, unlike electronic monitoring devices (EMD),  14  these records cannot confirm timing of use and have limited sensitivity to change in Abbreviations used AAD-Adaptive aerosol delivery DSS-Data storage spirometer EMD-Electronic monitoring device FDA-US Food and Drug Administration GPS-Global positioning system ICS-Inhaled corticosteroid LCD-Liquid crystal display MDI-Metered-dose inhaler PLS-Patient login system pMDI-Pressurized metered-dose inhaler adherence patterns.

      "text": "Most currently available EMDs (Table  I ) are designed for pressurized metered-dose inhalers. Because of the wide variation in inhaler design, the majority of EMDs only function with 1 specific inhaler type. Most EMDs are retrofitted to commercial inhalers, with only 2 electronic nebulizers (not used routinely for asthma) with integrated adherence monitoring. With some EMDs, data collection may be concealed; ethical issues should always be considered in this context.  15 MD functionality is no longer limited to actuation recording. Some devices record inspiratory flow data (eg, the Turbuhaler [AstraZeneca, Sodertalje, Sweden] or pneumotachograph device), which may be useful for exploring relationships between inhaler technique and poor outcomes in patients with good adherence, although it cannot substitute for a face-toface check of inhaler skills.  16 Some EMDs offer interactive features such as customizable ringtone reminders for promoting adherence (eg, SmartTrack; Nexus 6, Auckland, New Zealand)  17  and direct data uploading to a secure Web site or via Bluetooth [Bluetooth SIG, Kirkland, Wash] connection to a cellphone (eg, Asthmapolis [Madison, Wis], which also allows global positioning system tracking) (Figure  1 ). Remote data uploads reduce data loss and allow patients and/or providers to monitor adherence data without the need for clinic visits."

The impact of adherence feedback on asthma outcomes such as asthma control and emergency department visits across these studies was inconsistent. Most studies demonstrated improvement in adherence during the feedback intervention. One exception was a study that compared asthma education with adherence feedback plus problem solving among disadvantaged inner-city adults with moderate-to-severe asthma,  34  with whom electronically monitored adherence did not differ among groups. This may have been due to complex issues that are difficult to address in disadvantaged populations.\n\nLimitations of existing studies include high adherence in some control groups, possibly due to self-selection of motivated volunteers in research environments, free medication, and/or frequent study visits. Awareness of adherence monitoring may inflate adherence, and, although analysis of early evidence suggests that this lasts only for approximately 7 days,  24  more data are needed.

      "title": "Direct-to-patient adherence reminder interventions utilizing EMDs",
      "text": "Direct-to-patient reminders about medications can help patients with chronic illness to establish medication-taking routines and increase engagement with self-management.  35 Two published randomized controlled studies investigated the effectiveness of inhaler reminders for improving adherence. In one 6-month study in adults with asthma, the EMD beeped for up to an hour if the dose was not taken by a patient-determined time, and a light changed color once the dose was taken.  36 Adherence over weeks 13 to 24 was significantly higher in the reminder group compared with the control group (93% vs 74%; P < .0001). The second study, in children, of 8 weeks' duration and reported only in an abstract, had twice-daily inhaler reminders that rotated through 14 different ringtones (cow mooing, movie themes etc).  37 Median adherence in the last 2 weeks of the study was significantly higher in the reminder group (92.0% vs 51.5%; P < .0001). Neither study showed significant differences in asthma outcomes.\n\nThese studies are limited by a lack of baseline adherence data and relatively high adherence in control groups, which perhaps reflects selection bias. These studies suggest the potential for reminders to positively change adherence behavior, but much more evidence from longer pragmatically designed trials is needed to assess the clinical impact, especially in real-world practice populations."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "With the rapid development of communications technology and increasing awareness of the importance of patient-centered care, interest in remote monitoring of chronic illnesses is growing among physicians and consumers.  38, 39 Technology in EMDs for inhaled asthma medications has advanced, with devices now offering customizable reminder systems, Internet and/or cellphone applications, inspiratory flow recording, global positioning system tracking, and feedback to health professionals and patients via Web-based interfaces, e-mails, and/or text messages. However, more evidence is needed to establish the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of EMDs for use in clinical practice and to clarify the populations and clinical contexts in which they may improve asthma outcomes or reduce health care costs.\n\nEMDs have a unique role in monitoring adherence and in investigating related health outcomes by providing information about the pattern of medication use that is unobtainable from other methods. This is important in light of recent evidence that intermittent use could be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use for asthma control in some patients.  20, 21 In addition, EMDs can contribute to adherence promotion, either through direct reminders or as part of a behavioral intervention, with benefits remaining up to 2 years,  31  although benefits may not be sustainable once feedback is removed.  2  EMD intervention studies have been conducted in a variety of populations, ranging from research volunteers to inner-city minorities with major socioeconomic disadvantage, but there is still a paucity of studies outside research settings that can assess acceptability and feasibility in real-life practice.  22 Most EMD intervention studies to date have not been able to demonstrate changes in clinical asthma outcomes or have been unable to link improved adherence with better health outcomes.  34 This may partly relate to the brevity of the interventions, differing asthma phenotypes that require differing treatment intensities,  40  inappropriate prescribed doses, a potential lag of several months between poor adherence and negative asthma outcomes,  41  \"ceiling\" or threshold effects in response to ICS,  26  and the tendency for improved adherence in the lead up to an exacerbation.  4 Population-based evidence tends to support the relationship between poor adherence and poorer asthma outcomes,  3, 5  but the current evidence from intervention studies remains weak."

      "title": "What are the evidence gaps?",
      "text": "Existing EMD studies have essentially represented proof-ofconcept studies for their use in adherence monitoring and promotion. Most have been conducted in research environments with technical support for device checking and data handling, with trained clinicians having time to deliver appropriate counseling. Feasibility data are needed from normal clinical settings because significant barriers to implementation of adherence feedback interventions may be concealed in research studies in which patients and clinicians are actively recruited and reimbursed for participation. Patients, particularly those from disadvantaged populations, may fail to attend clinic visits and lose EMDs, and health care professionals may lack the resources and time to review patients' adherence data and provide counseling.  22 onger-term, larger studies are needed to determine whether adherence improvements can be sustained and to demonstrate which feedback interventions can reliably improve asthma outcomes to ensure that these relatively costly interventions produce useful outcomes beyond the research setting.  42 t the present time, a key barrier to implementation of adherence interventions is the lack of evidence for sustained improvements in asthma outcomes. Longer, larger, or moretargeted studies may show clinical benefit in those patients for whom poor adherence drives poor asthma control, so EMD research will be important for facilitating the identification of patients who would benefit from adherence interventions."

      "title": "What are the most promising areas for use of EMDs?",
      "text": "The greatest potential use for EMDs in coming years appears to lie in 3 main areas: personal patient-driven use, clinical management of difficult-to-treat asthma, and clinical research. Results of recent surveys indicate a substantial appetite for personal patient-driven health monitoring in populations aware of e-health and technological developments.  38 Several EMD manufacturers report engaging in direct-to-patient marketing, and their customers use EMDs as dose counters, to monitor controller medication use, or to set inhaler reminders. This market is likely to largely comprise patients with high health literacy  43  and to exclude disadvantaged and minority populations, but its existence may facilitate progress on hardware and software design and connectivity issues.\n\nIn clinical practice, the most promising indications for EMDs lie in the management of severe asthma,  42  which is associated with high health costs. In particular, EMD data could help identify asthma that is poorly controlled due to poor adherence with ICS.  1  These data could generate cost savings by better informing prescribing of expensive add-on therapies, such as biologic agents, in which the EMD cost may be less than 1 month's treatment. EMD data could prompt discussion of adherence barriers and identify who might benefit from flexible ICS dosing strategies.  1, 44 However, feasibility issues in populations with diverse medical and social problems, complicated by poverty and low health literacy, must be investigated, including the patient's ability and willingness to use EMDs and appropriately engage with interventions, and the design of acceptable feedback strategies.  22 sthma is an area of major health disparity. The worst asthma outcomes and adherence are seen among those who have difficulty obtaining even basic medical care and who are unlikely to have access to EMD interventions.  45, 46 Benefits to these populations from EMD utilization will most likely stem from the information gathered from EMD research to inform public health initiatives that target these disparities.\n\nIn research, use of EMDs may allow greater insight into heterogeneity of treatment response to controller medications and risks associated with overuse of reliever medications,  19  particularly in real life rather than select populations. Other high priorities for research include identifying the impact of the pattern of inhaler use (eg, regular, irregular, intermittent),  4, 18, 25  on adverse events (eg, overuse when symptomatic), particularly in early-phase trials of inhaled medications, and clinical asthma outcomes."

      "title": "Limitations of current EMDs",
      "text": "Health care consumers need to be aware of potential pitfalls when using new gadgets. There is only a small range of reliable EMDs, particularly for dry powder inhalers, and some devices are vulnerable to changes in inhaler design. EMDs need to be reliable and user friendly, but technology develops quickly, and it may not be feasible to publish performance data for every model; standardized quality-control processes, performed prior to EMD issue to patients and after return, are necessary to identify faults and to reduce the risk of device failure.  22, 47 Other current limitations include the cost of the device and data transfer services,  42  and the diverse software and Web platforms used by different manufacturers, which make it difficult to assess adherence across available medications. EMD data can be complicated to synthesize. Manufacturers are increasingly offering analytic options with their software, but there is a need for standardized evidence-based adherence metrics to facilitate consistent analysis and reporting. Finally, EMD data are only useful if the EMDs are used as intended by patients; however, people may share medications and may break, lose, or tamper with the EMD, which renders the data less useful."

      "title": "Moving EMDs from research into clinical practice: what is needed?",
      "text": "EMDs are considered to be too complicated and expensive to incorporate into routine clinic practice,  22  but, with rapidly improving technology, the cost and complexity should decrease while reliability increases. Cost may be offset by savings seen with improved asthma outcomes, particularly in severe asthma when the cost of increased health care is extremely high.  42 Other barriers to the use of EMDs in the clinic include the lack of reimbursement for devices, staff time, training, and patient counseling.  22 A useful model may be the reimbursement of continuous glucose monitors for juveniles with diabetes, where increasing research evidence for effectiveness is leveraging insurance coverage.  48 iven the existing evidence for effectiveness of EMD-based interventions in improving adherence and the limitations identified above, further well-designed studies are needed to strengthen this evidence, particularly to clarify the link between improved adherence and improved asthma outcomes. Large-scale implementation studies in a range of populations and health contexts are needed for a robust examination of EMD costeffectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability. Such evidence would potentially support EMD interventions as a reimbursable clinicbased or self-management activity.\n\nInitial implementation data from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, where adherence feedback is routinely delivered in a specialized adherence unit for adolescents show that it is feasible to use EMD data within these specialist appointments and that the approach is accepted well by patients and families.  48 However, more EMD studies are needed to build an evidence base around the most-effective feedback formatting. Further, it is plausible that conflict situations may arise if the patient's self-reported adherence does not concord with feedback data. In research studies that used EMD feedback, the staff was trained in nonthreatening, supportive adherence communication  2, 10, 23, [31] [32] [33]  and had time for such counseling. Development of suitable tools and training for clinical settings will also be needed, both for optimal device management and to facilitate health professional-patient communication. Health professionals should already have many communication skills needed to facilitate conversations about medication adherence, but formalized training is often necessary to understand when and how to use specific skills most effectively; indeed, in a recent meta-analysis the odds of patient adherence were 1.62 times higher in patients of trained than of untrained physicians.  49 overnments and health care organizations must ensure that budgets, systems, and staff are ready for an increasingly digital environment to take advantage of this new era of personalized health care management,  39  and the introduction of electronic health records may provide a gateway. Data from EMDs may be interfaced with electronic records to allow the seamless transition of care between different health settings, development of management plans personalized for the patient based on his or her adherence data, and promote patient autonomy over his or her own health care. In the meantime, EMDs already offer standalone adherence monitoring, personal computer software, and Internet applications that can be used by clinicians and researchers to better support and understand patients' asthma self-management. More research is needed to identify the clinical contexts in which this can be both feasible and cost effective."
