  "title": "Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER): Development of a Conceptual Framework",
  "abstract": "Background: Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are computer programs that simulate human conversations by using predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation. \n Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care. \n Methods: We followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study. \n Results: The Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cutting",

      "text": "Conversational agents (CAs) are computer programs that use text, speech, and other input modalities to enable communication with users  [1] . They can be accessed through a variety of ways, such as social media platforms (eg, Facebook Messenger), websites, and smartphone apps, or deployed using stand-alone digital devices (eg, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri). The interactive nature of CAs makes them acceptable to a diverse group of users  [2] [3] [4]  and a preferred tool in a number of disciplines, including customer service, retail, and e-commerce  [5] [6] [7] .\n\nIn health care, CAs are increasingly used to assist in various tasks, such as patient education, self-management of chronic conditions, and routine task automation (eg, appointment booking), and support health professionals' decision-making for diagnosis and triage  [3, [8] [9] [10] . More recently, CAs have seen large-scale implementation with the introduction of Babylon's artificial intelligence (AI)-based symptom checker CA to the UK National Health Service and to Rwanda's National Health Insurance Scheme  [11] . CAs have the potential to support health care delivery, improve access to health care services, and automate tasks  [12] , and they may also reduce health professionals' workload  [13] .\n\nCAs vary in complexity and capability. There are 3 design dimensions used to classify CAs: purpose, communication channels, and response generation architecture  [6] . According to purpose, CAs can be classified into task-or goal-oriented CAs, which respond to a limited number of tasks within a prespecified domain, or non-task-or non-goal-oriented CAs, which are potentially able to respond to an unrestricted variety of user requests  [6] . Communication channels can commonly be divided into 2 main types: text-based or voice-based CAs.\n\nResponse generation architecture can be broadly classified into 3 groups: rule-based and retrieval-based CAs, which produce a response by selecting it from a pool of predetermined responses either following simple rules to match phrases or identifying specific keywords in the text  [6, 14, 15] , and generative-based CAs, which use AI algorithms to develop a contextual response informed by the system's previous and ongoing learning  [6, [14] [15] [16] . Although all 3 groups may involve the use of AI algorithms  [6] , rule-based CAs allow developers greater control over the conversation content and flow, which is a useful feature when developing CAs for health care. By contrast, AI algorithms, particularly neural networks, may develop decisions that are not explainable or understood by the end user, a phenomenon referred to as the black box  [17] . In health care settings, the black box effect may lead to biased or erroneous decision-making and patient harm  [18] , which may limit the use of AI. A new field of explainable AI is currently emerging that aims to provide justification for algorithm predictions and increase system transparency, although the validity of results for individual patients should be carefully considered  [19] .\n\nCAs can be deployed using a variety of digital devices, including smartphones. The widespread availability of smartphones in high-income countries and increasingly in low-and middle-income countries  [20]  makes them an ideal interface to deliver CA interventions. Smartphones offer users the possibility of continuous and dynamic monitoring of health conditions in a private space and at the time of their convenience  [21]  not only of subjective, self-reported data but also of objective, sensor-based data. Furthermore, smartphones allow for the delivery of interventions according to user needs  [22] . CA interventions are complex and often require lengthy, costly design and development processes led by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals, computer scientists, and app developers, which may limit the number of teams able to engage in CA development, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. However, mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly SMS text messages delivered using mobile phones, are effective in delivering health care interventions, especially in low-resource settings  [23, 24] .\n\nSeveral frameworks for the design and development of mHealth interventions currently exist, offering guidance at every step of the cycle, from the conceptualization of user needs  [25, 26]  to the development of the digital health intervention  [25] [26] [27] . These frameworks focus on generic, app-based interventions without a conversational interface. However, Zhang et al  [28]  described a framework for the development of AI-based CAs to deliver behavior change interventions that may require significant deployment of resources, including a large, multidisciplinary team, and close supervision of the AI algorithms to prevent unintended and potentially harmful effects on the users. However, to date, no conceptual framework for the design, development, and evaluation of rule-based CAs has been published despite a growing interest in the use of CAs in health care settings."

      "text": "CAs constitute a specific type of digital intervention characterized by the use of a conversational interface, often led by an agent with a distinct personality as evidenced by its tone of speech, method of interaction, and visual representation, which is often associated with higher levels of engagement with the user. These features and the ubiquity of smartphones support the need for a framework that is accessible to large as well as smaller research teams with limited resources to guide CA development, including the distinct design and development challenges of CAs such as the creation of dialogs and the look and personality of the agent, grounded in current best evidence. Therefore, this research aimed to develop a conceptual framework for the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care."

The CA temporal profile will also determine the type of objectives included, broadly classified as short term or long term  [101] . A short-term objective refers to an outcome to be completed as soon as the interaction with the CA ends, such as medication reminders  [30] . A long-term goal would involve several CA-user interactions being completed over a period, as in mental health interventions to promote mental well-being in the general population  [3]  or young people with cancer  [70] . Complex CA interventions may include short-and long-term goals, such as CA Vik  [30]  providing medication reminders (short-term goal) and health education (long-term goal) to patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, Kowatsch et al  [73]  used prompts and reminder SMS text messages to enhance children's discipline and routine, which are essential for the self-management of asthma."

It is important to generate a detailed and accurate portrayal of the target user, including gender, age group, cultural beliefs and socioeconomic concerns, digital and health literacy, access to digital devices, and smartphone penetration rate. If the intervention is educational, a knowledge test should be implemented  [73] . The acceptability of CAs by the target population and the perceived risk of using a CA for health care matters should be evaluated, particularly for severe or highly stigmatizing conditions [102] such as mental health disorders  [103, 104] ."

In general, giving a name and profile picture to the CA may enhance its social presence and user acceptance [107], although its effect appears to be small  [106] . In health care settings, using a human-like avatar rendering realistic features, including medical attire, may increase user satisfaction [105], although avatars displaying highly realistic features may upset users and decrease engagement, an experience referred to as the \"uncanny valley\"  [108] .\n\nStudies have consistently shown that CAs displaying empathy, relational behavior, and self-disclosure enhance the user experience  [78, 105]  and increase the working alliance  [109] . Conversely, users would notice if the CA did not convey empathy  [69] .\n\nAcceptability may be further enhanced if the CA design acknowledges the specific cultural or demographic traits of the target population  [73]  or offers options to personalize the interface (eg, offering a male and female persona)  [31, 73] . Alternatively, CAs may explicitly disclose their identity  [70]  to reduce user expectations about their capabilities. Finally, CA personality should align with its intended function. For example, health care CAs often display one of two personality types: a more approachable, empathic coach-like personality, particularly if delivering behavior change interventions  [77]  supporting self-management of chronic disorders  [73, 78]  and mental health conditions  [3] , or a health care professional persona to emphasize the legitimacy of the CA and its content  [1] ."

      "text": "The language recommended for text-based interventions should be encouraging, positive, friendly, polite, and light-hearted and may include light humor while at the same time being formal  [110] . To maintain the flow of the conversation, it may be advisable to use visual cues such as successive moving dots signaling that the CA is \"typing\" the next message.\n\nThe text should be written in clear, short sentences using simple language and avoid scientific jargon. The National Institutes of Health recommends that patient education materials be written at or below the sixth-grade reading level (ages of 11 and 12 years) to reach a diverse range of individuals with varying levels of literacy  [111] . The readability of the text can be assessed using a scale such as the Flesch-Kincaid grade level to determine its suitability  [112] . Furthermore, the CA should use the target population's native language in its communications  [75]  and, if needed, the conversational content may be translated to one or more languages, particularly if the CA will be deployed in multiethnic, multilanguage societies.\n\nWith regard to the tone of the conversation, despite the text-based nature of the CA, it may be advisable to simulate more casual, verbal speech while avoiding the use of \"textese\" [113], a form of abbreviated written or typed language characterized by unconventional spelling and grammar (eg, \"tonite\" instead of \"tonight\") and abbreviations and contractions (eg, \"pls\" instead of \"please\" or \"wanna\" for \"want to\")  [114] . Furthermore, words written in full capital letters should be avoided as they equate to shouting  [110] .\n\nEmojis may be used to articulate emotions or other expressions more efficiently than text  [70] . However, emojis are vulnerable to varied interpretations across cultures and contexts and should be used mindfully. Fadhil et al [115]  noted a context-specific nature of emojis whereby they increased efficacy in a mental health intervention but did not help in promoting physical well-being.\n\nCAs designed to address sensitive topics such as HIV and AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, or mental health disorders may emphasize the confidential nature of the messages or include code words to protect users' privacy. This is particularly relevant in low-and middle-income settings, where family members may share a single smartphone  [116] ."

Alternatively, as presented in the study by Stasinaki et al  [79] , the CA may be fitted with multiple channels, where the user can converse with the CA in one channel and directly with an HCP in another.\n\nPeer support is recognized to play an important role in promoting adherence to self-management interventions  [117]  and a further point of human involvement to be considered. The CA intervention may include an additional communication channel for users to interact, share experiences, and receive peer support. For example, Wang et al  [75]  developed a WeChat intervention to support smoking cessation where the CA not only responded to individual users but also acted as a group moderator."

Each channel possesses its own set of complexities, and the decision regarding the delivery channel should be based on the target population needs and the expertise of the CA development team  [118] . If the research team does not include app developers or computer scientists, the CA may be embedded in a messaging platform or may be developed using a CA development platform that offers templates or other design solutions for individuals with no previous programming knowledge  [5, 118] , such as Chatfuel, ManyChat, and others. CAs are generally web-based, and some of these platforms are free of charge. Alternatively, if the team expertise or project budget allows, the CA may be delivered through a stand-alone app. This approach offers design flexibility, such as a variety of data collection sources including smartphone sensors, health programming interfaces, connected medical devices, and patient self-reported data  [119] . The combination of subjective patient reports with objective, real-time data may reduce users' responsibility to update their progress and at the same time receive relevant, dynamic coaching based on the current data  [120] , which in turn may increase adherence to the intervention.\n\nIn addition, factors associated with the target population may also affect the selection of the most suitable delivery channel and operating system (eg, Android or Apple's iOS). For example, Kamita et al  [71]  implemented their CA on the messaging platform \"LINE\" as it was the most popular social network service in Japan, and Wang et al  [75]  selected WeChat, the most common messaging app in Hong Kong."

Moreover, if the CA targets populations for whom reading might be challenging, such as older adults or visually impaired individuals, text-to-speech assistive technology may be incorporated into the app.\n\nVisual aids such as images or videos are useful to adapt content to audiences with lower educational attainment [121], deliver personal narratives relevant to the end users (eg, young people with cancer), or decrease the amount of textual information  [76] . When using multimedia content, it is important to use high-resolution files to avoid pixelated or blurred images.

Therefore, strategies for message delivery and frequency could be adapted to suit the CA intervention.\n\nJust-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) leverage smartphone sensor data to \"provide the right type (or amount) of support at the right time\"  [22] . Smartphone sensor data would determine and even predict \"states of vulnerability\" (susceptibility to negative health outcomes) [144] and \"states of receptivity\" (the capacity to receive, process, and use the intervention) [120] in the user when the intervention may be required and more useful. This novel approach may be particularly useful for behavior change interventions supporting a healthy lifestyle, such as increasing physical activity or adhering to a healthier diet, or supporting substance use remission  [22, 120] .

To ensure the validity of the results, the process must use a robust methodology that is adequate for the intervention design  [15] . In digital health interventions, a commonly used evaluation methodology is the multiphase optimization strategy by Collins et al  [145, 146] .\n\nThe CA evaluation follows 3 distinct stages representing the intervention development process. The initial iterations of the CA may be evaluated using one or more usability testing methods [147] aiming to produce a minimum viable prototype. Once this working prototype is ready, pilot and randomized trials may ensue to assess the effectiveness of the CA  [148] . Several aspects of CA evaluation were discussed in 36% (20/55) of the studies in our reviews  [25, 26, 28, 33, 71, 73, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [97] [98] [99] [100] .\n\nThe evaluation design may include one or more aspects of the CA functionalities, including clinical or technical attributes and user experience. The outcomes should be clearly defined and include widely used and validated outcome measurement tools whenever possible to improve the comparability and reproducibility of the research results. Examples of outcome measurement tools include the Patient Health Questionnaire-9\n\n[149] to screen for depression, the Flourishing Scale [150] to assess psychological well-being, the Brief Pain Inventory  [151]  to assess pain intensity and its interference in activities of daily living, and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised  [152]  to evaluate the CA-user working alliance."

In the initial stages, formative evaluation aims to assess the viability of the digital tool by assessing its usability, usefulness, and user experience [154] using one or more qualitative or quantitative research designs. Qualitative methods include surveys, interviews, focus group discussions, and \"think aloud\" protocols  [147]  in which users express their opinions about the product as they use it. Quantitative methods include closed-ended questionnaires, task completion assessments, and A/B testing  [147, 155] . An A/B test, split test, or controlled experiment compares two or more versions of a product to evaluate the intervention components that perform better or are preferred by the user  [155] . This stage relates to the screening and confirming stages in the multiphase optimization strategy  [145, 146] , which use a fractional factorial design to assess which components should be included in the digital intervention and the best dosages to use in a more cost-effective fashion. Finally, microrandomized trials are another novel methodology that is particularly useful for assessing and optimizing the delivery of JITAIs  [156] . Microrandomized trials allow the randomization of multiple components to occur at multiple times triggered by predefined decision points  [156]  and have been used to evaluate CA interventions, as reported by  Kramer et al [119, 157] ."

In health care interventions, the concept of \"intended use\" is preferred, and it should be clearly defined during the CA design and development stage for the subsequent adherence measurements to be meaningful. Increased adherence to an intervention may be related to its increased effectiveness  [75, 160] , although the data are not conclusive  [3, 161, 162] .\n\nUser engagement with the CA may be evaluated using data metrics such as the times the user opened the app, time spent interacting with the CA, the extent of the dialog, or the number of screens opened if the CA also includes other functions  [70] . Chaix et al  [30]  measured use duration, interest in various educational contents, and level of interactivity as indicators of engagement. Nevertheless, researchers should consider the challenges of defining engagement with digital interventions, which may include other user-related variables such as the severity or stage of the disease as well as the long-term engagement with the CA  [163] .\n\nOther aspects of CA use, such as underused or missing topics or CA functionalities not working as intended, may also be assessed. CA use analytics are often embedded in host platforms. Commercial platforms such as ManyChat [164] may offer a variety of built-in analytics tools such as the number of times the CA is accessed. Some of these platforms offer free-of-charge services. For health care CAs, the open-source MobileCoach platform  [35]  offers flexible, customizable use analytics."

It is a dynamic concept comprising the intention to engage with the novel CA, the actual interaction with the CA, and the postengagement satisfaction  [165] .\n\nAcceptability is a subjective term that is generally assessed using questionnaires or other qualitative methods such as focus groups or interviews. For example, Kowatsch et al  [73]  evaluated the acceptance of a CA to support asthma self-management using a 7-point Likert scale (strongly agree-strongly disagree) for perceived usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment, and use intention, and Echeazarra et al  [68]  used a survey with questions on ease of use, preference for the CA over existing methods, CA usefulness for its intended purpose, and whether the user had stopped using it as measures of acceptability and satisfaction. Furthermore, Gabrielli et al  [69]  facilitated a participatory design workshop where suggestions for improvement were provided via open-ended questions, and Ly et al  [3]  conducted semistructured interviews on the benefits, opportunities, and challenges associated with the CA for mental health. Yan et al [166] described a very involved process of evaluation of an mHealth intervention to promote physical activity. A focus group discussion was organized whereby each SMS text message was displayed and participants were required to respond either with \"Yes, I like it\" or \"No, let's change it to make it better.\" This voting was then followed by a discussion in which suboptimal messages were improved and the strengths of effective messages were noted. Finally, participants may also be questioned about their willingness to recommend the conversation to others, which is a good indicator of satisfaction and acceptability  [70] .\n\nSeveral aspects of user engagement and acceptability may be measured using one of several app quality rating tools, of which the most commonly used one is the Mobile App Rating Scale  [167] . The use of standardized, validated rating scales may improve the reproducibility of this research area and facilitate the reporting of trial results, although they are not specific for CAs."

Although it is often mentioned that one of the potential advantages of digital health interventions, particularly in the long term, may be a significant decrease in health care costs [172], the upfront expenses of developing the digital intervention might be substantial. For example, Kowatsch et al  [73]  reported upfront expenses of approximately US $250,000 to develop a CA to support asthma self-management in young patients. The development costs will vary conditional to the type and functionalities of the CA, the use of a messaging platform or development as a stand-alone app, and the number of team members, among other aspects. Despite the increasing importance of conducting economic evaluations of digital health care interventions, only 2% (1/55) of the studies included in our reviews reported economic evaluation data  [73] .

The research methods, including pragmatic trials, participatory action research, and mixed methods studies, aim to assess the intervention \"acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, coverage, and sustainability\" [174-177]. Important considerations include the need to upgrade the systems to adapt to higher traffic, personnel to provide long-term system maintenance and updates, and the costs these changes may incur  [25, 26] . Furthermore, the team should consider CA intervention commercialization strategies, including engaging HCPs, health insurers, or governmental organizations if aligned with the health care focus of the intervention  [26] .\n\nFinally, the team should be aware of and comply with the current regulatory frameworks for digital health interventions. Increasingly, countries are developing national policy frameworks to regulate the evaluation, use, and commercialization of digital health interventions  [178] , particularly if the intervention is considered a digital therapeutic  [179] . Digital therapeutics refer to \"evidence-based therapeutic interventions that are driven by high-quality software programs to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease\" [179], may require a provider's prescription to be accessed  [179] , and often require approval from official regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States  [180]  and the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne mark in the European Union (EU)  [181] ."

They share the general principles of involving users during the design process, although the steps involved in the process and the type and extent of end-user involvement may differ. They include but may not be limited to human-centered design  [183, 184]   End users include patients, caregivers, HCPs, or other relevant stakeholders. There are several benefits of including end users as part of the CA development team, such as a better understanding of users' and communities' needs, development of culturally sensitive products, and improved communication between the different stakeholders  [188, 189] . This, in turn, may increase compliance with the intervention and improve health-related outcomes  [190] . For example, to develop a CA to promote positivity and well-being in young people after cancer treatment, Greer et al  [70]  conducted interviews and focus groups with young adults treated for cancer to refine the informational content.\n\nDuring the evaluation stage, thinking-out-loud usability testing is another example of a user-centered design methodology in the design of digital health interventions, including CAs  [191] .\n\nThe role of user-centered design in the development of digital health interventions has been repeatedly emphasized by several frameworks included in our review (36/55, 65%)  [25, 26, [36] [37] [38] [39] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] 62, 69, 70, 73, 76, [82] [83] [84] [85] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] 110] ."

Health information is considered personal, sensitive information that should be protected at all times. The level of data protection should align with the data collected by the CA, if any. Therefore, the functionalities of the CA will determine the type of sensitive data to be collected and guide the inclusion of data protection software such as firewalls and encryption.\n\nIn general, developers should minimize the amount of personal and sensitive information collected from users by asking specific questions to avoid oversharing or simply providing predetermined responses instead of using free text. Furthermore, all CAs should include a privacy policy that is brief and written in clear language outlining the data collected and the uses of these data. All data must be encrypted during transit (when the message is being sent) and at rest (when the message has been delivered)  [192] . The platform on which the CA will be deployed may also vary according to the CA functionalities. For example, a CA collecting users' personal data should not be deployed on proprietary or messaging platforms as the platform data management policies may not be clearly reported  [65]  or data sharing with third parties may occur without informing the user  [193] . This might create an ever-increasing digital footprint, potentially allowing for user identification from data aggregation rather than actually identifiable information  [194] .\n\nA 2020 framework for governing the responsible use of CAs in health care highlighted the importance of safeguarding data privacy, including user health data, history of interactions, and disclosure of user data even if unintended  [195] . In addition, the framework highlighted the user's right to access their personally identifiable information, the requirement of user consent before recording or saving health-related data, and the preclusion of using the stored data as a means of surveillance or to discriminate users against health care privileges or coverage  [195] ."

These laws' jurisdiction is generally limited to the issuing country; however, the GDPR applies to any EU citizen within or outside the EU. The GDPR, which went into effect in 2018, is an overarching law that aims to enhance the rights of individuals over their personal data, defined as any data that may allow for the identification of a person on their own or combined with other data, including pseudonymized data  [196] . Alternatively, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is industry-specific and applies only to health-related data  [197] . Other countries have adopted their own data protection laws and regulations. In Singapore, the Personal Data Protection Act is a baseline regulatory framework informing the collection, distribution, and use of personal data  [198] .\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned GDPR, children's data are generally more stringently safeguarded. For example, in the United States, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  [199]  requires that verifiable parental consent be obtained by all digital operators (not restricted to health care) collecting data from children (aged <13 years). Similar considerations are included within the GDPR and the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act, with the caveat that, in some European countries, parental consent is required for children and adolescents aged <16 years."

User-centered design and privacy and security were included as cross-cutting considerations, which are relevant at every stage of the framework.\n\nThis framework was based on the comprehensive analysis of 36 mHealth frameworks, 5 CA taxonomies, and 14 primary studies reporting on the design and development of rule-based health care CAs. The framework was applied in a web-based pilot study using a CA deployed on Facebook Messenger. The existing mHealth frameworks provided general guidelines to develop mHealth interventions for health care, from the characterization of the target population to evaluation, with emphasis on the application of user-centered design techniques in all stages of development. Concurrently, the CA taxonomies provided focused on several aspects of CA design and evaluation as well as the impact of design features on CA-user interactions.\n\nConsidering the multifaceted nature of embodied CAs, we decided to focus on CAs that are nonembodied."

      "text": "The existing frameworks for the design and development of mHealth interventions provide detailed guidance in all steps of the intervention development, starting with an understanding of the needs and the profile of the end users through a review of existing literature or formative research  [67] , and they emphasize the need for patient and public involvement to make the intervention as relevant to the target population as possible  [90, 98] . These frameworks also described the importance of conducting iterative evaluations to identify limitations before testing the mHealth intervention in a larger-scale trial  [28, 98, 99] . However, the literature on the design and development of CAs was restricted to the development of taxonomies that were not limited to health care describing CA design platforms  [5] , classification of CAs according to the approach to conversation design  [67] , characteristics of embodied agents  [66] , or the impact of CA characteristics on user interactions  [32] . Moreover, the taxonomy by Denecke et al  [65]  referred to health care CAs, but they focused exclusively on CA evaluation. Therefore, a conceptual framework guiding the development of health care CAs was needed to expand previous mHealth frameworks with elements particularly relevant to CAs, such as personality development, converting evidence-based content into conversations, and using novel research designs for evaluation. Furthermore, our framework focused particularly on the development of the CA, including personality, display of empathy, and disclosure of its identity as a computer-generated entity without human involvement, and on the development of dialogs guided by up-to-date evidence-based information sources.\n\nThis framework described the development of rule-based CAs, allowing the research team total control of the conversation and dialog flow. There are several reasons for this. First, our framework presents easy-to-follow steps that could be applied\n\nJMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 10 | e38740 | p. 11  https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/10/e38740 (page number not for citation purposes) Dhinagaran et al JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH"

Second, we aimed to provide guidance for the development of goal-oriented CAs aimed at delivering health education content or simple interventions aimed at improving healthy lifestyle choices or self-management behavior and, therefore, prioritize control over the conversation content using a rule-based paradigm, albeit less engaging, over AI algorithms that have yet to become truly explainable. Although the concepts of identity creation, conversational flow, and delivery are important, their relative relevance to varying target populations is still unknown. In addition, more research on the assessment of health care chatbot interventions can help inform the ideal health-related outcome measures and digital data sets required for a comprehensive evaluation. Finally, although this framework is comprehensive and many components may apply to AI CAs, a separate framework is needed to describe specific aspects relevant to AI CAs, such as dialog development using machine learning or natural language processing techniques, voice versus text parsing, and many others."

Therefore, this framework provides an overview of the main steps required to develop a rule-based CA.\n\nThe descriptions and examples presented in the conceptual framework focused on CA interventions for end users to support either a healthy lifestyle or the management of a chronic condition, as derived from the literature reviews and our experience developing a CA. Nevertheless, the design and development principles discussed in this study could apply to other relevant user groups such as caregivers and health care professionals.\n\nFurthermore, this framework is focused on rule-based CAs and, although it may guide researchers in the development of particular aspects of AI CAs, it does not provide guidance on the development of AI-based conversations. In addition, the economic, social, and behavioral characteristics of different populations may limit its generalizability."

Drawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides the first attempt to fill this void. The process was divided into 8 iterative steps arranged in 3 overarching groups and complemented by 2 cross-cutting considerations. Future research should explore aspects of CA development such as the use of behavior change theories and privacy and safety concerns. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity."

Moreover, although the use of theories in the design of behavior change interventions is favored and may increase the effectiveness of the intervention [77,200], it is still unclear which behavior change theories or techniques are better suited for CA-led interventions. Alternatively, because of the interactive nature of CAs, it would be appropriate to assess whether behavior change interventions previously proved effective in traditional face-to-face settings are equally effective when led by a CA."
