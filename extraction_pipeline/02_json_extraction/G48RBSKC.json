  "title": "Optimising the implementation of digital-supported interventions for the secondary prevention of heart disease: a systematic review using the RE-AIM planning and evaluation framework",
  "abstract": "Background mHealth technologies are now widely utilised to support the delivery of secondary prevention programs in heart disease. Interventions with mHealth included have shown a similar efficacy and safety to conventional programs with improvements in access and adherence. However, questions remain regarding the successful wider implementation of digital-supported programs. By applying the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to a systematic review and meta-analysis, this review aims to evaluate the extent to which these programs report on RE-AIM dimensions and associated indicators. \n Methods This review extends our previous systematic review and meta-analysis that investigated the effectiveness of digital-supported programs for patients with coronary artery disease. Citation searches were performed on the 27 studies of the systematic review to identify linked publications that reported data for RE-AIM dimensions. All included studies and, where relevant, any additional publications, were coded using an adapted RE-AIM extraction tool. Discrepant codes were discussed amongst reviewers to gain consensus. Data were analysed to assess reporting on indicators related to each of the RE-AIM dimensions, and average overall reporting rates for each dimension were calculated. \n Results Searches found an additional nine publications. Across 36 publications that were linked to the 27 studies, 24 (89%) of the studies were interventions solely delivered at home. The average reporting rates for RE-AIM dimensions were highest for effectiveness (75%) and reach (67%), followed by adoption (54%), implementation (36%) and maintenance (11%). Eleven (46%) studies did not describe relevant characteristics of their participants or of staff involved in the intervention; most studies did not describe unanticipated consequences of the intervention; the ongoing cost of intervention implementation and maintenance; information on intervention fidelity; long-term follow-up outcomes, or program adaptation in other settings.",

      "text": "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a multi-component program that is designed to optimise cardiovascular risk reduction, foster compliance to healthy behaviours, and promote an active lifestyle for people with cardiovascular disease  [1, 2] . Introduced in the late 1960s, there is a substantive evidence base supporting CR as a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for the secondary prevention of heart disease  [3, 4]  and it is now routinely recommended across a wide range of cardiac diagnoses. While centre-based CR programs have been shown to be effective in reducing hospital admissions and improving health-related quality of life  [3, 5] , reported referral, access, and participation rates have been sub-optimal  [6, 7] .\n\nThe use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in support of CR and secondary prevention programs has increased in recent years. An increase accelerated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when access to centrebased programs was limited. Integrating mHealth, which includes mobile and wireless technologies, wearables, mobile apps  [8] , and more recently, the use of sensors and AI  [9] , into home-based and hybrid models of secondary prevention has shown similar safety and efficacy to centre-based programs  [10] . Such digital-supported secondary prevention programs have shown increases in adherence  [11]  and positive effects on behavioural and psychosocial outcomes  [11, 12] . However, unifying evidence for the overall impact of these programs on health outcomes is lacking, especially in programs that incorporate novel technologies  [11] .\n\nA recent systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of digital-supported secondary prevention programs, assessing if programs using mHealth reduced readmissions and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease  [13] . The review found that programs using mHealth may be effective in lowering hospital visits and readmissions, but there was no evidence for reduced mortality outcomes. The authors reflected that assessment of longer-term effectiveness and program scalability may be hindered by non-generalisable study populations and short follow-up periods. Thus, while digital supported secondary prevention programs have become more common and have demonstrated efficacy, translatability beyond the research setting is unclear.\n\nThe Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) model has proven to be a useful planning an evaluation framework to evaluate the degree to which interventions report on internal (i.e., accuracy of research methods and findings) as well as external validity (i.e., generalisability and translatability) factors  [14] . RE-AIM has been successfully applied to systematic and scoping reviews that have evaluated threats to the transferability of a multitude of digital-supported health interventions to practice, including those for mental health  [15, 16] , diabetes self-management  [17] , chronic disease  [18] , physical activity  [19] , and vaccination promotion  [20] . To our knowledge, there has been no review reporting on the implementation of digital-supported interventions to improve health outcomes and the secondary prevention of heart disease.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the extent to which RE-AIM dimensions and associated internal and external validity indicators are reported in the included studies of the systematic review and meta-analysis by Braver et al.  [13] , as such knowledge would offer guidance to improve the wider implementation and optimisation of digitalenabled secondary prevention programs."

All search results were imported into Endnote 20 software and duplicate records were removed. Remaining records were exported into Covidence, a cloud-based systematic review program  [22] .\n\nTitles and abstracts were examined for eligibility independently by two reviewers (AI and CL), with a third reviewer (CM) adjudicating any discrepancy. Non-English language publications and publications reporting on work other than the original studies included by Braver et al. were excluded. Conference abstracts, reviews, book chapters were also excluded. The full text of the remaining publications was obtained and screened. Publications were included if they described any additional data to that reported in the studies included studies of Braver et al., such as secondary analyses, long-term follow-up results, or cost-effectiveness analyses. The inclusion criteria for eligible studies are presented in Table  1 .\n\nBraver et al. initially identified 27 unique studies to be included in their systematic review, they later decided to exclude nine studies as there was no usual care disease management plan as the control group, however, we included all the 27 unique studies in our review since the control group program was not relevant to our study aim.

[23] . Minor modifications were made to previously used RE-AIM item definitions to ensure that the description of the indicators for each of the five RE-AIM dimensions were relevant and unambiguous  [16, 19] . The resulting 25-item coding sheet, consisting of the five RE-AIM dimensions and corresponding indicators is presented (Table  2 ).\n\nFor reach, the coding sheet included the target population, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, participation rate, and the representativeness of the participants. One indicator was added to assess reasons for not participating, as this information might provide insight into any unanticipated negative consequences of the intervention. Effectiveness was evaluated with eight indicators, including the impact of the intervention (primary and secondary outcomes, as well as measures of quality of life); the reporting of results for at least one follow-up; intent to treat assessment; intervention satisfaction; any unanticipated consequences; and participant attrition. Adoption consisted of three indicators. Two related to the intervention location (home, centre-based, hybrid, or other) and the staff delivering the intervention. One item was added to collect information about the individuals delivering the intervention, such as their characteristics, qualifications, level of expertise and uptake. The indicators used to assess implementation included duration and frequency of intervention, the ongoing cost of intervention delivery, and the extent to which the intervention was delivered as intended. We expanded this final item by asking for details of any adaptations made, to get insight into how the intervention worked in specific contexts  [24] . In addition, we included an item to document whether theory-based approaches were used, as it is recognised that when a study is informed by theory, the probability of successful implementation and sustainability of an intervention increases  [23, 25] . Finally, to document maintenance, four indicators were used, which included  Reach-Individual level The number, proportion, and representativeness of participants Target population The process by which the target population was identified and recruited for participation in the intervention Inclusion criteria Characteristics that determined if a potential participant was eligible to participate Exclusion criteria Characteristics that determined if a potential participant was not eligible to participate Participation rate Sample size divided by the number of eligible participants exposed to recruitment strategies Reasons for not participating Reasons provided for not participating in intervention Representativeness Comparison of characteristics of the study participants to target population Effectiveness-Individual level The impact of the intervention on important individual outcomes, including quality of life, negative outcomes and on attrition Primary outcome of intervention Description of primary outcome measure Secondary outcome of intervention Description of secondary outcome measure Quality-of-life as secondary outcome\n\nThe study includes a measure of the quality of life as secondary outcome measure"

In addition, we calculated the indicator reporting rate for each RE-AIM dimension by dividing the total of \"yes\" scores for that dimension by the total number of indicators in the dimension. The reporting comprehensiveness of the studies was assessed using tertile cut-off points, as done in previous reviews using RE-AIM  [27] . Studies that scored between 18-25 indicators (72-100%) were considered to have a high reporting quality, studies that scored 9-16 indicators (36-68%) were of moderate quality, and those that scored 0-8 indicators (0-31%) reflected low quality.\n\nIn addition, we calculated the average reporting rates of the indicators for each dimension."

None of the 27 studies explicitly described the target population, a finding echoed in similar reviews  [16, 17, 19, 57] . The use of convenience sampling methods in trials often makes it not possible to draw conclusions on the representativeness of the sample and consequently, limits generalisability of digital-supported interventions to different sociodemographic groups. The exclusion criteria of the studies, as defined elsewhere  [13]  placed several restrictions that reduced access for vulnerable populations, including the elderly, the culturally and linguistically diverse, and those with no access to a smart device or no connectivity to the Internet. Whitelaw et al.  [58]  also reported some common participant-level barriers in the uptake of digital health technologies in cardiovascular care, including difficult-to-use technology, poor Internet connection, and fear of using technology. The relatively low median participation rate (41%) among the studies implies the existence of participant-level access barriers. This rate is lower than the median or average rates provided by other systematic reviews reporting on the RE-AIM dimensions of digital health interventions, which range from 51%-70%  [16, 17, 19] . Interestingly, the observed low participation rate is similar to traditional, face-to-face programs (REF).\n\nDigital-supported programs aim to increase access and uptake to secondary prevention care. This finding suggests that these novel programs may not be achieving their desired goals and more research is needed to understand the factors impacting participation. Further, attrition rates were low compared to traditional programs, suggesting that digital-supported programs may enhance adherence once patients participate. This may be an important factor explaining the benefits of mHealth supported secondary prevention programs and further supports the findings from our previous review  [13] .\n\nAll the studies evaluated were digital-supported interventions for secondary prevention of heart disease and consequently the primary and secondary outcome measures of the interventions were predominantly clinical and behavioural in nature. Reporting of broader outcomes, such as quality of life and participant satisfaction, was rare, even though these outcomes can provide insight into improving the quality of the delivered care as well as intervention compliance  [59] . Critical evaluation of the impact of intervention delivery was less clear. In most of the studies, attrition was low, however, a few studies reported much higher attrition. Common reasons provided for attrition related to either clinical deterioration (being medically unwell or death) or participant withdrawal. Yet, it was not always apparent if a withdrawal was related to the use of the technology in the intervention or to other circumstances.\n\nImproving the functional capacity, wellbeing, and health-related quality of life of people diagnosed with heart disease requires long-term lifestyle modifications, including adherence to prescribed medical treatments. However, any long-lasting effect on outcomes could not be assessed for most studies, as the long-term maintenance of individuals' behaviour and health states was only reported in a minority of the studies. The ability of digital technology to improve care and increase uptake and equitable access to secondary prevention requires more evidence about long-term maintenance of effects.\n\nAdoption assesses the setting and staff delivering the program. Reporting mainly focused on the intervention location and few details were provided about the characteristics of staff delivering the intervention, their willingness and motivation to be involved, and if any training was provided. Digital-supported interventions for the secondary prevention often include some clinical oversight and so a failure to report details of delivery agents fails to inform what resources may be needed to deliver future interventions. This makes translation difficult to other settings and as such, decreases the probability that the intended behaviour change will be adopted and maintained  [20] . Typically, studies that examine clinical or behavioural outcomes fail to report the organisational level dimensions of the RE-AIM framework (adoption, implementation, and maintenance)  [60] . To ensure that healthcare organisations enable their workforces to use digital methods in service delivery design and implementation must attempt to close the gap between an organizations' adoption of digital methods relative to their digital ability  [61] .\n\nFactors related to the implementation dimension provide insight into the feasibility and replicability of the intervention  [60] . In our review, we found no available information on adaptations made prior to, during, and after program implementation, even though Stirman et al.  [24]  highlighted that this information is required to understand how to adapt interventions to different contexts while retaining critical components. In addition, almost no use was made of frameworks to inform the delivery of the interventions, while their use has been recognised as being vital to the implementation and sustainability of novel eHealth solutions, in which people, technology, and context are intertwined  [62] . Similar to other reviews  [17, 19, 20] , none of the studies reported the costs of intervention implementation. This lack of reporting eliminates a monetary reference point for future researchers when considering designing similar strategies.\n\nOverall, Maintenance was the most underreported dimension of the framework. Few studies reported maintenance of effect at the individual level. No study reported organisational level maintenance, which is the extent to which the intervention has become a part of routine health care practices  [63] . Also, none of the included studies reported ongoing costs of program delivery. Teams designing interventions find planning for and assessing maintenance difficult  [14] , however, for an intervention to become institutionalised or part of the routine organisational practices, a greater emphasis on recognising external validity factors is needed. There may also be shortfalls in funding that cut interventions short and inhibit the evaluation of maintenance. The general lack of long-running large digital health projects hinder alternative insight into the durability of used digital resources  [64]  and therefore, the sustainability and generalisability of interventions.\n\nThe lack of information on external validity factors in most trials inhibits the evaluation of factors that influence program access and uptake and sustained implementation of interventions and their wider replication in different settings or with more diverse populations. Failing to report factors inhibits the opportunity to improve program uptake and access for disadvantaged populations. Additionally, none of the studies reported the costs involved with intervention implementation or the ongoing costs of program delivery, which eliminates the use of monetary information necessary for decision making. We recommend the use of hybrid trial designs that combine clinical effectiveness trials with implementation and have the potential to rapidly translate the evidence into real-world settings  [65] , and that to improve long-term sustainability and determine ongoing costs, intervention studies must report across all RE-AIM indicators."

      "title": "Improvements to the RE-AIM framework",
      "text": "Currently, there is a lack of consistency and accuracy in the reporting of many RE-AIM dimension indicators, hindering intervention replication and translation  [23, 66] . In conducting our review, some modifications, including the addition of indicators, were made to the RE-AIM framework (described in the \"Methods\" section). The nature of digital-supported interventions necessitated these changes so that the framework could be applied to the specific characteristics, delivery, and implementation of such interventions. For example, additional information was collected about individuals delivering the intervention, such as the staff acceptability of the intervention. This addition was needed because the rapid development of digital health technologies is profoundly changing the way healthcare is delivered. Positive consumer acceptance and adoption (from both patients and clinicians) is impacting staff approaches to health occupations, tasks, and functions."

      "text": "This review is the first that we are aware of to evaluate the process and implementation of digital-supported interventions in the secondary prevention of heart disease. By using a framework adapted to fit the specific characteristics of digital-supported interventions, we were able to systematically assess the extent to which each of the included studies reported on internal and external validity criteria. This process provided a comprehensive insight into the generalisability, translatability and scaleup of the interventions to wider populations and settings.\n\nThe changes made to the RE-AIM framework allows its application to the reviewed interventions, however, those changes have yet to be tested for reliability and validity.\n\nWhile we attempted to systematically identify any publications that would provide additional RE-AIM data, it is possible that some were missed. Furthermore, we based our conclusions solely on the extent to which the RE-AIM indicators were reported in the publications and we did not contact authors for missing information. Finally, as we only included English peer-reviewed publications, we might have missed studies published in other languages."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "The lack of reporting of external validity factors in mHealth-supported interventions inhibits the evaluation of factors that influence program access and uptake and sustained implementation of interventions. As such, it cannot be assumed that reported outcomes are generalisable. A failure to report inhibits the opportunity to improve program uptake and access for disadvantaged populations and the wider replication in different settings or with more diverse populations. Additionally, none of the studies reported the costs involved with intervention implementation or the ongoing costs of program delivery, negating the use of financial information in decision making. We recommend that future approaches to digital supported secondary prevention of heart disease should adopt hybrid trial designs to report relevant RE-AIM dimensions and associated indicators to improve the translatability of empirical evidence to real-world settings."
