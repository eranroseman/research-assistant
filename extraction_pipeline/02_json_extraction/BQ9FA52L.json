  "title": "Effectiveness of Digital Diabetes Management Technology on Blood Glucose in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes at Home: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) face elevated morbidity, mortality, and care costs. Digital self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) can automatically upload data to apps, share the data with health care providers, reduce errors, and aid long-term diabetes management. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of digital diabetes management techniques based on digital SMBG on blood glucose in patients with T2DM at home. \n Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, China Biomedical Literature Database, and Cochrane Library for articles published from the establishment of each database to December 25, 2023. Data were extracted independently by 2 researchers (YX and NX), and the risk of bias in individual trials was rated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane). Results: Twelve studies were included, involving 1669 participants. The meta-analysis found that in the digital diabetes management group, hemoglobin A 1c (mean difference [MD] -0.52%, 95% CI -0.63% to -0.42%; P<.001), fasting blood sugar (MD -0.42, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.19 mmol/L; P<.001), 2-hour postprandial blood sugar (MD -0.64, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.32 mmol/L; P<.001), and BMI (MD -1.55, 95% CI -2.92 to -0.17 kg/m 2 ; P=.03) were each improved compared to the control group. Conclusions: Digital diabetes management has been shown to effectively improve blood glucose levels and BMI in individuals with T2DM in home settings. A key feature of successful digital health interventions is the frequent SMBG by patients, supported by dedicated health care professionals who provide timely, personalized, and responsive guidance.",

      "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder primarily characterized by persistent hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance or inadequate insulin secretion  [1] . The International Diabetes Federation  [2]  reported that the global prevalence of diabetes reached 533 million cases in 2022, with projections indicating a surge to 783 million by 2045, of which over 90% are expected to be T2DM cases  [3] . This condition often manifests insidiously, progressing over an extended period, with chronic hyperglycemia as its hallmark clinical feature  [4] .\n\nPoorly controlled blood glucose levels over time can inflict severe damage on vital organs and tissues, including the heart, brain, and kidneys  [5] , leading to debilitating complications that significantly compromise patients' health and quality of life  [6] .\n\nT2DM is a lifelong condition, and short-term treatment is insufficient to achieve effective blood sugar control. Patients require lifelong management and a long-term, standardized approach to home care  [7, 8] . International scholars universally agree on the importance of home management for individuals with T2DM  [9] . Research by Yan et al  [10]  has highlighted the high demand among patients with diabetes for home blood glucose monitoring, a finding consistent with the observations by Simsek et al  [11]  regarding chronic disease management in older adult populations. An increasing number of patients now seek personalized, home-based guidance from health care professionals (HCPs), underscoring the pivotal role of the home environment in diabetes rehabilitation  [12, 13] . Moreover, studies demonstrate that home blood glucose self-monitoring effectively improves glycemic control and reduces the risk of long-term complications  [14] .\n\nTraditionally, home blood glucose management has relied on clinician-led, face-to-face consultations. However, such offline consultations are time-consuming for HCPs and impose economic burdens on patients. In addition, these short-term interactions often fail to adequately support patients' long-term self-management efforts, rendering them less effective  [15] .\n\nMobile internet technology has brought about a revolution in diabetes management by introducing digital platforms designed for home-based patients with T2DM. Digital diabetes management entails using advanced tools to gather self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) data, which is subsequently sent to HCPs for analysis and feedback. This technology simplifies blood glucose monitoring and boosts patient-provider communication  [16] . Research indicates that it allows HCPs to assess data in real time, reducing the necessity for outpatient visits and easing the burden on both health care facilities and patients  [17] .\n\nDespite its benefits, the manual entry of SMBG data during home care remains time-intensive, particularly for older adult patients, and is prone to errors, including transcription inaccuracies or intentional misreporting  [18, 19] . In addition, HCPs often face challenges in interpreting SMBG data to identify lifestyle or treatment issues. Recent advancements in SMBG devices now allow automatic uploads of blood glucose measurements to secure digital health applications accessible to HCPs  [20] [21] [22] . Real-time monitoring of this data enables timely interventions when abnormal readings are detected, thereby facilitating more accurate management of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Furthermore, this technology supports long-term diabetes care by informing adjustments to insulin, diet, and exercise regimens  [23] .\n\nCurrently, no meta-analysis has systematically assessed the effectiveness of digital SMBG-based diabetes management technologies. Evaluating the impact of these technologies on blood glucose control in home settings is essential for understanding their utility in managing T2DM. This study aims to synthesize global research findings through meta-analysis, examining the effects of digital SMBG-based diabetes management on glycemic control in home-based patients with T2DM. The results are intended to provide evidence to support the broader application of digital SMBG technologies in home care environments."

      "text": "Inclusion criteria were formulated based on the populations, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) framework:\n\n1. Populations: Participants with T2DM\n\n2. Interventions: Patients used a digital blood glucose management system that allowed for the automatic upload of SMBG data from home to a secure platform via Bluetooth or other wireless technologies, and HCPs provided timely and responsive personalized guidance 3. Comparisons: Traditional home blood glucose monitoring methods (including routine outpatient follow-up, blood glucose monitoring logs, etc) 4. Outcomes: Hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (PBG), and BMI. HbA 1c is the gold standard for long-term blood glucose control, reflecting the average blood glucose levels over the past 2 to 3 months. FBG can present information on blood glucose in the fasting state, which helps to understand basic glucose metabolism. Measuring the PBG can evaluate the body's ability to handle the glucose load after a meal and provide insights into the PBG regulation. BMI is a practical tool for assessing overall body fat, which is associated with health risks caused by obesity and metabolic disorders, and the included studies reported at least one of these findings. 5 . Study design: Randomized controlled trials Exclusion criteria included (1) studies involving patients with gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes, (2) review or discussion papers, and (3) studies with insufficient data."

      "text": "This meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of digital diabetes management technology based on digital SMBG for home-based patients with T2DM. The findings demonstrated significant improvements in HbA 1c , FBG, PBG, and BMI. Key features of effective digital health interventions include frequent patient engagement in SMBG and timely, personalized guidance provided by specialized HCPs.\n\nStudies have shown that while the compliance rate for blood glucose control among patients with T2DM during hospitalization can reach as high as 80%, this rate significantly decreases by 25% to 30% once they are discharged and transition to home self-management  [40, 41] . Consequently, there is an urgent need to support home-based patients with T2DM in managing blood glucose fluctuations  [42] . This study demonstrates that compared with traditional home blood glucose management, digital diabetes management technologies can significantly improve blood glucose levels in home-based patients with T2DM. Twelve studies  [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  reported improvements in HbA 1c levels among home-based patients with T2DM following the use of digital diabetes management technologies, 7 studies reported that digital diabetes management technologies effectively improve FBG levels  [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , and 5 studies examined the impact on PBG levels  [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . In conclusion, digital diabetes management technologies play a pivotal role in blood glucose management for home-based patients with T2DM and should be widely implemented in clinical practice. Ongoing focus on blood glucose monitoring is essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels in these patients  [43] .\n\nAt the same time, the meta-analysis results of this study suggest that digital diabetes management technologies can reduce the BMI of home-based patients with T2DM, consistent with the findings of a systematic review by Marcolino et al  [44] . However, the heterogeneity in this study is relatively high. Sensitivity analysis, conducted by excluding studies one at a time, indicated that the variability may be due to differences in intervention durations. Subgroup analysis based on intervention duration showed that when the intervention lasted less than 3 months, it effectively improved BMI. In contrast, when the intervention duration exceeded 6 months, no similar improvement was observed. Given the relatively small sample size, future large-scale, double-blind randomized controlled trials are needed to further validate the impact of digital diabetes management technologies on BMI.\n\nWith continuous innovation in sensor, microelectronics, and data analysis technologies, researchers have been actively"

      "text": "RenderX investing in research and development. Meanwhile, the market's strong demand for convenient and efficient blood glucose monitoring has spurred the rapid development of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology. Medical staff assist patients in accessing blood glucose data via supporting mobile apps to formulate treatment plans. CGM technology offers continuous, dynamic blood glucose data, enabling a comprehensive grasp of blood glucose fluctuations, allowing timely detection of asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and contributing to optimized treatment plans and prevention of diabetes complications.\n\nNonetheless, CGM technology has limitations. Its equipment is costly, making long-term use unaffordable for some patients. In addition, frequent blood glucose checks may cause psychological stress in some, negatively affecting blood glucose control. Therefore, SMBG continues to play an indispensable role in diabetes management. SMBG offers patients immediate blood glucose readings at specific time points, enabling prompt adjustments to diet, exercise, or insulin dosage to maintain glucose levels within a safe range and prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Furthermore, compared to CGM, SMBG devices are simpler, more affordable, and thus more accessible to a broader patient population, especially those with limited financial resources or relatively stable glucose fluctuations. SMBG also promotes active patient participation, increasing their awareness of disease management and enabling them to better understand the impact of daily factors on blood glucose levels. This process fosters improved lifestyle adjustments, enhances confidence in glucose control, and strengthens compliance with self-management regimens.\n\nAmong the 12 included randomized controlled trials, only 2 studies evaluated the impact of SMBG frequency on blood glucose levels  [28, 36] , so a meta-analysis was not conducted. Both studies demonstrated that more frequent home blood glucose monitoring improved blood glucose control in home-based patients with T2DM. We observed that the frequency of SMBG in the intervention group was significantly higher than in the control group, and the digital diabetes management technology notably enhanced blood glucose control. Tomah et al  [45]  reported that higher SMBG frequency correlated with greater improvements in HbA 1c , suggesting that the frequency of measurements may directly influence clinically relevant outcomes, with 4 to 8 measurements per day being the most effective. Similarly, Mannucci et al  [46]  found that SMBG was more effective when a structured monitoring plan was implemented, and HCPs used the collected data. None of the 12 randomized controlled trials included in this study considered the frequency of contact with HCPs as an outcome measure to assess improvements in blood glucose levels. As a result, a meta-analysis could not be conducted. However, an analysis of the intervention strategies in these studies revealed that the frequency of contact with HCPs was higher in the intervention group than in the control group. In addition, a systematic review found that SMBG without support from HCPs did not yield significant clinical benefits  [47] . This lack of benefit may be attributed to treatment inertia, where poor adherence to lifestyle changes and prescribed medications is common among patients with T2DM  [48, 49] . When feedback from HCPs is minimal, patients may feel anxious and uncertain when faced with poor SMBG control. In conclusion, digital diabetes management technologies, along with SMBG supported by HCPs, can significantly improve blood glucose control in home-based patients with T2DM.\n\nThis study advocates for the promotion of digital diabetes management technologies based on digital SMBG for home-based patients with T2DM. Such technologies can help eliminate transcription errors associated with manual data entry and offer increased convenience for patients, especially older adult individuals with T2DM, who may struggle with inputting blood glucose values due to poor vision or limited dexterity. This technology provides an age-friendly solution for blood glucose management. In addition, for older adult patients who live alone or have limited mobility, HCPs can remotely monitor blood glucose data, offer timely care, and quickly detect and address hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. This improves the continuity and responsiveness of diabetes management. Furthermore, the use of digital devices in clinical practice can reduce the workload of clinical nurses and enhance overall work efficiency. Thus, it is recommended that this technology be widely implemented in both home and clinical settings to improve the safety and efficiency of diabetes management."

      "title": "Comparison to Previous Work",
      "text": "The results of this meta-analysis align with those of previous studies on the effectiveness of digital diabetes management technology for improving blood glucose levels in home-based patients with T2DM. However, in many previous studies, SMBG devices required manual data entry for glucose measurements, whereas this study focuses on digital SMBG technologies capable of automatic data uploading  [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . To date, no other meta-analysis has specifically evaluated the application of digital diabetes management technology based on automatic SMBG for home-based patients with T2DM.\n\nIn addition, the results of this study revealed that digital diabetes management technology can significantly reduce BMI levels in home-based patients with T2DM, consistent with the findings of a systematic review by Marcolino et al  [44] . However, several other systematic reviews suggest that digital diabetes management technology has no significant effect on BMI improvement  [57] [58] [59] . This discrepancy highlights the need for future high-quality, large-sample studies to further investigate the impact of digital diabetes management technology on BMI. Such studies should explore potential differences in results due to variations in patient populations, intervention measures, and follow-up durations. Moreover, standardizing research methodologies and evaluation criteria will enhance the comparability and reliability of findings, providing a stronger evidence base for determining whether this technology can effectively improve BMI in patients with T2DM."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "This systematic review and meta-analysis has several notable strengths. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first meta-analysis to evaluate digital diabetes management techniques based on digital SMBG for improving blood glucose levels and BMI in home-based patients with T2DM. Second, a comprehensive search of multiple databases was conducted, with strict adherence to established methodological tools to ensure the reliability and transparency of the research process. Third, this study included a detailed subgroup analysis of BMI outcomes, confirming that the duration of intervention significantly influences the effectiveness of digital diabetes management technologies in home-based patients with T2DM. Finally, by analyzing multiple outcome indicators, this review provides a more comprehensive understanding of the role of digital health in diabetes management, offering valuable references for clinical practice.\n\nWe also acknowledge that this meta-analysis has some limitations. First, confined to Chinese and English literature, it excluded non-English and Chinese materials, failing to reflect global research. Future reviews should cover more languages. Second, most selected studies lack blinding details, risking measurement biases. Future research must focus on blinded outcome evaluation to minimize performance biases. Third, the HbA 1c funnel plot asymmetry indicates publication bias. Future studies should use multicenter, large-sample, randomized controlled trials for reliable results. Fourth, done over a year ago, the study may miss recent research due to the field's rapid development, and lacking timeliness. Future research needs constant updates. Fifth, 8 (67%) of the 12 studies were from China, with regional limitations as China's medical resources and telemedicine acceptance differ from elsewhere. Future studies should include more diverse regions to boost conclusion generality."

      "title": "Future Directions",
      "text": "Overall, future digital health research can fill the existing gaps and improve the approach in 5 key areas. First, for the diabetes management technology based on SMBG, continuous exploration should be carried out on its advantages in blood glucose control. In particular, the impact of SMBG supported by HCPs on blood glucose should be assessed to tap more potential. Second, the intervention measures should be elaborated in detail so as to achieve the maximum degree of reproducibility and universality in different clinical contexts. Third, a comprehensive evaluation system will be constructed, covering aspects such as cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and technology availability. This system is used to measure the value of intervention measures for the sustainable development of digital health in diabetes management. Fourth, researchers should be encouraged to study the differences in the efficacy of different population subgroups or provide patient-level data, enabling future reviews to identify the patient characteristics related to treatment outcomes. Fifth, researchers should actively collect and report patients' views on the intervention measures to improve the design basis."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This meta-analysis demonstrates that digital diabetes management technologies can effectively regulate blood glucose levels, improve glucose metabolism, and reduce BMI in patients with T2DM. However, due to the variation in intervention strategies, frequencies, and content across the included studies, future research should prioritize multicenter, large-sample, high-quality randomized controlled trials to refine and standardize these interventions. Notably, effective digital health interventions share a common characteristic: frequent patient engagement in SMBG, supported by HCPs who provide timely and personalized guidance."
