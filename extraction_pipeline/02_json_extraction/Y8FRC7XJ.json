  "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in patientreported experiences related to emergency department (ED) care using a postdischarge text messaging survey. \n Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of patients discharged from the ED using an automated text messaging platform to assess patient experience and impact of race on ED care. The study was conducted for 7 weeks between August 6 and September 24, 2021. Participants included adults (aged \u226518 years) discharged from 2 urban, academic EDs with an active mobile phone number in the electronic health record. The primary outcome of interest was patient-reported impact of race on overall rating of ED care. Secondary outcomes included overall satisfaction with care and perceived impact of race on components of care, including respect, communication, and quality of care. A 6-point Likert scale was used, and chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to analyze responses. Results: A total of 590 (14%) discharged patients consented, and 462 patients completed the entire survey; the mean age was 43 years (SD 17.3); 67% were women, and 60.0% were Black. Black patients reported a higher overall rating of ED care (median 5 [3, 5]; P = 0.013). Proportionately, when compared with White patients, more Black patients reported that race negatively impacted the rating of care (10.8% vs 1.4%; P = 0.002). More than a quarter of Black patients (27.4%) reported race highly impacting being treated with respect (P = 0.024), and 22.4% reported a high impact on quality of service (P = 0.003) when compared with White patients. \n Conclusion: Health systems lack methods that specifically identify patient experiences of racism. We demonstrate the feasibility of using text messaging to collect patient-reported experiences of racism. For a significant number of Black patients, race negatively impacted their care, including communication, quality, and respect.",

      "text": "To eliminate experiences of racism within their walls, health systems need data to know when, where, and how these experiences are happening. Yet there are few examples of systematic approaches to measuring patients' experiences of racism after individual clinical encounters. Although experience surveys offer the opportunity for patients to include general comments on their care, to our knowledge many of these surveys do not specifically include questions on experiences of racism in clinical encounters. In that vacuum, patients and their family members have begun using third-party online review platforms, such as Yelp or Google, to share their experiences of racism in healthcare.  10 These organic uses of existing platforms, developed for a different purpose, point to a gap and need for methods to intentionally track and understand patients' experience of racism in their care."

      "title": "LIMITATIONS",
      "text": "The study has several limitations. It was conducted in a single academic health system and across 2 urban EDs during a fixed span of time. Although incorporating data collection via text messaging into routine care allowed us to solicit responses from all patients, selection and nonresponse bias remain present in that individuals must opt in to the text messaging survey. The response rate for this digital method of engaging patients was 14%, which, although not high, is comparable with published data on ED experience survey response rates.  [14] [15] 5] [16]  It remains difficult to compare the findings reported here as specific surveys exploring the intersection of racism and clinical care are limited and the scale used here was adapted from prior literature. Furthermore, participants needed to have a listed phone number in the EHR and regular access to a text message-capable device, and the \"digital divide\" has been documented to have a disproportionate effect on Black Americans.  17 ture efforts to develop methods of engaging patients to understand their health care experiences specific to race would also benefit from assessing heterogeneity in patient responses and accounting for degree of nonresponse. This study did not assess race or ethnicity concordance between clinicians and patients. Nonetheless, this study is among the first to prospectively engage and begin to investigate patient-reported instances and perceptions on race and acute care in a remote and automated fashion immediately after an ED visit. Among those responding, we rely on self-report here, so patients could be altering their responses, although of note no clinical changes were made to an individual's care as participants were notified that data collection was only for research. The demographics of the study population did not allow for sufficient comparisons for other racial or ethnic minorities or those of mixed-race background and thus we focused on those identifying as Black or White. Future research would benefit from investigating the experiences of individuals from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. In addition, the responding population had a higher proportion of women and White individuals compared with those not responding. A larger scale study is needed to further explore this variation.\n\nThe study also has strengths in that it applies a novel, \"low-tech\" method (eg, simple text messaging) to engage patients and collect patient-reported information to inform healthcare in a meaningful way.\n\nIt did not burden clinical staff with consenting and collecting data from patients. This approach is patient centered and easily administered post-encounter and provides health systems with a method of expanding the core concepts of learning health systems and continuous quality improvement."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This study tested an automated text messaging platform to assess experiences of racism after discharge from an ED visit. The study had 4 key findings. First, we demonstrate the ability to engage patients to understand the intersection of their clinical care and race. Second, we find an early signal and key difference in how Black and White patients perceive the impact of their race on received ED care. Third, Black patients who report race negatively impacting their care cite respect, quality, and communication as significant manifestations of racism.\n\nFourth, an overall positive patient ED care experience may mask the racism some patients experience.\n\nEssential to reducing the burden of racism in healthcare is a way to identify its existence. Creating opportunities for patients to share when and how they felt race impacted their care is important for identifying areas for remediation and may serve as longitudinal measures of progress. Indeed, ongoing systematic assessments of perceived racism may in themselves help patients feel heard. This study highlights that patients are willing to share their experiences and that these insights can be obtained quickly. Patient experience survey response rates remain persistently low, especially in emergency medicine where response rates have been documented from 10% to 15%.  14, 15 This study had a similar response rate. Immediacy in collecting patientreported experience is important as it may lessen recall bias and in today's digital era provides for potential rapid-cycle improvement to identify problems in care delivery.  18 Next steps can explore how specific questions related to patient perceptions of racism in their care can be included in larger scale, widely adopted patient experience surveys to collect and integrate these data to inform operational change.\n\nOur respondents were representative of the patient population served in a large, urban, academic ED that includes a majority Black patient population. In this initial work, we begin to see the differences in how Black and White patients experience ED care. Although limited by the approach and single institution design, we note that 1 in 10 Black patients believed that their race negatively impacted their ED care, including the respect they were treated with, communication, and the quality of care received. In contrast, 1 in 50 White patients reported their race negatively impacting their care.\n\nLastly, overall patient experience and experiences of racism are likely intertwined. We noted high patient-reported scores on overall care but substantially lower scores among those reporting racismassociations that would have been otherwise missed. Intentional questions using the terms \"race\" and \"racism\" drew out these differences.\n\nImportant next steps will investigate the deeper clinical and narrative context of these experiences to inform institutional and clinical change.\n\nOngoing work from this research team includes a qualitative follow-up investigation to help explore these patient narratives. Institutions must make efforts to highlight a focus on race, racism, and patient experience to illicit the information needed to advance equity and dismantle racism.\n\nHealth systems lack approaches to identify patients' experiences of racism. We demonstrate early signals in patient-reported experiences of racism from a novel, scalable, and patient-centered approach.\n\nDeveloping ways to identify racism in clinical care will bolster equitable and quality care. These approaches can identify specific areas for improvement and serve as overall measures of institution-wide efforts to combat racism."
