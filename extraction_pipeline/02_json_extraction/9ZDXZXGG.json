      "text": "Background: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments measure health status in a variety of domains. With the proliferation of mobile phones, delivering PROs across patient-friendly platforms (eg, apps, text messaging) may increase completion rates, particularly among children. The purpose of this study was to validate the collection of common knee PROs in sports medicine with text messaging by correlating text-messaging responses with paper delivery in adolescents. Methods: Patients presenting to a hospital-based pediatric orthopaedic sports medicine clinic with a knee injury were enrolled prospectively. Paper versions of the Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form and the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (Pedi-Fab Scale) were completed during initial clinic visits. Over the next 72 hours, patients completed the text message delivery of the Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab Scale. Correlations between paper and text message delivery of the 2 PROs were assessed.\n\nResults: Ninety-one patients (mean age: 16.0 \u00b1 2.0 y; 48% females) enrolled in the text-messaging study, with 55 (60.4%) completing the Pedi-Fab Scale, 48 (52.7%) completing the Pedi-IKDC, and 39 (42.9%) completing both PROs. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the paper and mobile phone delivery of the Pedi-Fab Scale was 0.95 (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.97). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the paper and mobile phone delivery of the Pedi-IKDC was 0.96 (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.98). Average Pedi-Fab scores on paper (M = 12.7) and mobile phone (M = 12.3) were not significantly different (P = 0.52). Similarly, average Pedi-IKDC scores on paper (M = 68.8) and mobile phone (M = 67.7) were not significantly different (P = 0.41). Average completion time for the text delivered Pedi-Fab and Pedi-IKDC were 102 \u00b1 224 and 159 \u00b1 155 minutes, respectively. High school enrollment (P = 0.025), female sex (P = 0.036), and race (P = 0.002) were significantly associated with text completion of Pedi-IKDC. Conclusions: Text message delivery using mobile phones permits valid assessment of Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab scores in adolescents. Questionnaire delivery by automated text messaging allows asynchronous response and may increase compliance and reduce the labor cost of collecting PROs. Level of Evidence: Level III-prospective cohort study.\n\nKey Words: text message, patient-reported outcome, knee, adolescent, pediatric (J Pediatr Orthop 2020;40:e91-e95)\n\nT here is a trend toward obtaining patient-derived out- comes assessments in various clinic settings and populations.  1, 2 Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures allow patients to report their overall or condition-specific health, well-being, and function. The field of orthopaedic surgery benefits immensely from PRO instruments, where routine follow-up and functionality assessment is required to determine treatment efficacy and allows providers to interpret and individualize patients' recovery protocols.  3 nee disorders are commonly treated in this field, and 2 PRO instruments, the Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC) Subjective Knee Form and the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (Pedi-Fab Scale) reliably assess symptomatology, function, and overall activity level in children after a knee injury. 4, 5  Both instruments are unique to children and adolescents and capture valuable clinical information which are typically not assessed in available adult scoring systems. Some instruments used in orthopaedics have been validated across multiple delivery platforms, including verbal, telephone, and in-office computer touchscreen interfaces. 6, 7  Despite the availability of multiple delivery platforms, no investigation has attempted to validate the Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab Scale instruments using modalities outside of the clinic setting, which could reduce time and labor for both providers and patients.\n\nTraditionally, orthopaedic patients have been evaluated within a face-to-face clinic visit. Mobile phone technology presents an opportunity to communicate with patients outside of the clinical setting and obtain valuable and reliable PRO data. Pediatric patients may be a target population for this communication method, as the mobile phone has become the favored communication modality for the majority of American teenagers.  8 Using a mobile phone interface to deliver health-related questions may be more familiar and convenient to pediatric patients whereas simultaneously reducing the resources required to collect such information.\n\nTechnological advances have prompted health care systems to communicate with patients outside of the traditional hospital setting, and it is important to understand the benefits and limitations of mobile phone technologies before applying them in clinical practice. No previous studies have attempted to validate text message or software-driven delivery of the Pedi-IKDC or Pedi-Fab Scale instruments on mobile phones outside of a hospital setting. Only 1 previous study characterized use patterns of automated mobile phone messaging technology when assessing pain ratings of adult orthopaedic patients outside of the hospital.  9 The purpose of this study was to validate the collection of common knee PROs in sports medicine with text messaging by correlating text-messaging responses with paper delivery in adolescents. We hypothesized that there would be (1) a high correlation between PROs collected by automated delivery of text messages on mobile phones versus paper delivery and (2) no difference in completion based on patient demographics of PRO instruments collected by automated delivery of text messages on mobile phones."

      "text": "After Institutional Review Board approval, patients presenting to a hospital-based pediatric orthopaedics sports clinic for a knee injury were screened and prospectively enrolled over the course of 1 year at a single pediatric center. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients aged 11 to 18 years with an isolated knee injury, most commonly a sports-related injury. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing a same-day office procedure, underwent surgery within the previous 90 days, and/or had no access to a mobile phone.\n\nPatients were approached and informed consent was obtained in clinic. The patients were blinded as to the order of questionnaires to prevent patients from artificially providing the same answers by paper and text. Paperbased versions of the Pedi-Fab Scale and the Pedi-IKDC Subjective Knee Form questionnaires were administered and completed during patients' clinic visits on study day 0 (SD = 0). Subjects' mobile phone numbers and paper questionnaire responses were inputted into REDCap, a secure, HIPAA-compliant web-based application designed to support data capture for research.  10 Delivery of the text message versions of the questionnaires through REDCap were scheduled according to the patients' desired time of delivery. Over the next 72 hours (SD = 1, 2, and 3), subjects received and completed the Pedi-Fab Scale and Pedi-IKDC. The mobile phone version of the Pedi-Fab Scale was administered in 1 day and the Pedi-IKDC mobile version was broken up into 2 sections, because of the length of the survey, and administered over a 2-day period. The order for the delivery of 2 questionnaires was randomized through REDCap. On the basis of a precedent health care research study,  11  a daily maximum of 3 reminder messages were sent to the patients only if they had not started the questionnaire within 1 hour of the initial text message delivery.\n\nThe paper and text message questionnaires were scored for each subject and the averages and SDs of the whole cohort were calculated. The Pedi-Fab Scale score ranges from 0 to 30  12  and the Pedi-IKDC score ranges from 0 to 100, in which a lower score indicates a lower level of function and higher level of symptoms.  5, 13 A paired samples t test was performed correlating the paper and text scores for each survey, and the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between the paper-administrated and text-administrated scores for each subject were calculated using a 1-way analysis of variance. An ICC > 0.75 represented excellent reproducibility, an ICC of 0.4 to 0.75 represented good reproducibility, and an ICC < 0.4 represented poor reproducibility.  14 A power analysis was conducted at 80% power and \u03b1 = 0.05, and it was determined that a sample size of at least 39 subjects were required to differentiate an ICC value of 0.8, excellent reproducibility, from an ICC of 0.6, good reproducibility.  9 land-Altman plots were made to visualize agreement between the 2 questionnaire administrations by plotting the differences of paper and text scores versus the mean paper and text scores for each questionnaire. Linear regressions predicting the difference in scores from the mean scores were performed to test for proportional bias. Secondary analyses were conducted to examine associations between patient demographics and text compliance. \u03c7 2 and Fisher exact test were used for categorical variables, that is, sex, race, grade level, cell-phone provider, and survey randomization order; Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for continuous variables including age and paper score. P <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical tests were performed on IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).  14"

      "text": "A total of 91 subjects were enrolled (48.4% females and 51.6% males). The average age was 16.0 \u00b1 2.0 years (range, 11.1 to 18.9 y). Of the 91 subjects, 55 (60.4%) completed the text message Pedi-Fab Scale and 48 (52.7%) completed the text message Pedi-IKDC; 39 (42.9%) completed both questionnaires. One Pedi-Fab Scale and 5 Pedi-IKDC text-compliant subjects were removed from the validation analysis because the corresponding paper-administered survey responses could not be scored. Of the evaluable sample, the average paperadministered Pedi-Fab Scale score was 12.7 \u00b1 10.1 and was not significantly different from the text-administered Pedi-Fab Scale score of 12.3 \u00b1 9.7 (P = 0.52). The ICC between the paper and text Pedi-Fab Scale scores was 0.95 (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.97).\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the average paper-administered Pedi-IKDC (68.8 \u00b1 23.2) and text-administered Pedi-IKDC (67.7 \u00b1 22.5) (P = 0.41). The ICC between the paper and text Pedi-IKDC scores was 0.96 (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.98). Bland-Altman plots showed that the majority were within the 95% agreement limits. The linear regression indicated that there was no proportional bias for Pedi-Fab Scale (P = 0.55) and Pedi-IKDC (P = 0.56) questionnaires.\n\nThere were no demographics that were significantly associated with text completion of the Pedi-Fab. The average time from start of survey to end of survey for the mobile-administered Pedi-Fab Scale was 102 \u00b1 224 minutes (range, 2 to 1431 min); 6 subjects (11% of the compliant cohort) completed the survey in 5 minutes or less, the amount of time usually allotted for the paperadministered survey in clinic. This pattern suggests that breaks were taken by the majority of patients for this survey. For Pedi-IKDC, age, sex, race, and grade level were associated with text compliance, in which older subjects (P = 0.046), female subjects (P = 0.036), white subjects (P = 0.002), and high schoolers (P = 0.025) were more likely to complete the mobile-administered Pedi-IKDC (Table  1 ). The average time from start of survey to end of survey for the Pedi-IKDC was 159 \u00b1 155 minutes (range, 7 to 614 min); only 1 patient completed the survey in < 10 minutes, suggesting that the majority took breaks while responding.\n\nFor both PROs, cell-phone provider, order of delivery, and corresponding paper scores did not have a significant difference between compliant and noncompliant patients. In terms of when patients became noncompliant, 72% were noncompliant on the first day of administering the Pedi-IKDC survey, in which all but 1 did not complete any questions. For Pedi-Fab, 97% of the noncompliant cohort did not complete any questions. The majority that did not attempt any questions for Pedi-IKDC also did not attempt any questions for the Pedi-Fab. There was no pattern of specific questions, in either of the PROs, when patients stopped answering and became noncompliant."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "PRO instruments measure a patient's health status in a variety of domains; and the delivery of these instruments have become an important constituent of health care, particularly in sports medicine in which PROs are commonly used to evaluate treatment efficacy and outcomes.  1, 3, 15, 16 The knee is one of the most commonly injured joints, and as the rate of younger-aged sports participation increases, we see an increased rate of knee injuries in the pediatric population.  [17] [18] 8] [19]  In 2011 and 2013, the Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab Scale were created to permit evaluation of a broad range of knee and sportsrelated injuries, with each assessment tailored to capture important variables unique to children and adolescents that were not captured in the available adult scoring systems, such as level of play and coach/trainer supervision.  12, 20 ith the proliferation of mobile phones and text messaging, especially in adolescents and teenagers, 8 the administration of pediatric PROs across patient-friendly platforms may increase completion rates by allowing patients to complete the PROs on their own time. Completion of such PROs outside of clinic may reduce administrative costs for providers and shorten turnover times in patient rooms. In congruence with the rise of telemedicine, previous studies have evaluated and validated the use of mobile phone text-messaging capabilities for collecting patient health information in the form of PROs, postoperative pain and medicine use, and physical health activity.  1, 6, 9, [21] [22] 2] [23] [24]  No studies have validated the collection of the common pediatric knee PROs with text messaging in sports medicine. Our primary aim was to validate the text message delivery of the Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab Scale by correlating text-messaging responses with traditional paper delivery in adolescents and young adults.\n\nThe investigation validated our hypothesis as we found a high correlation between the PROs collected by text message and by traditional paper delivery. We report excellent reproducibility between delivery of the PROs through text message and paper for both the Pedi-IKDC and the Pedi-Fab Scale. We found similar ICC levels as a previous study by Anthony et al,  9  which validated text message delivery of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and the short form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH), 2 PROs for the adult population, by correlating it to paper delivery. Similarly, our findings conclude that automated text message delivery of PROs is a valid method, and we support the collection and assessment of Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab Scale data through text message.\n\nIn addition, our study shows that delivering the PROs by text message allows patients to complete the questionnaires on their own time, which may be more convenient for the patients compared with the traditional paper form. The majority of our cohort appeared to take breaks throughout the duration of the text-message portion of the study. This raises the question of whether or not patients prefer text message delivery over paper forms because of the possibility for asynchronous response. When given the choice, patients may prefer to respond to queries when their schedule permits, not necessarily in 1 continuous block of time. Further investigation regarding patient preferences for synchronous versus asynchronous response is needed. This investigation supports the findings from Anthony et al  9  that automated delivery of PROs through mobile phones is a valid method for collecting patient data even when the patients are intermittently involved in other activities. As other studies have noted, there is an increase in pressure to care for patients in the most efficient and cost-effective manner,  21  so utilizing devices that patients already own to communicate with them outside of clinic throughout the day is advantageous to sports medicine.  1, 6, 22, 23 n addition to validating the delivery method, we analyzed completion rates and demographics associated with compliance. We found that 60.4% of the subjects were compliant for the text-delivered Pedi-Fab Scale and 52.7% were compliant for the text-delivered Pedi-IKDC. Also utilizing the automated delivery of text-messaged PROs of similar length to the Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab, previous authors found completion rates of 77% and 75% for the delivery of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and QuickDASH to adults.  9 Unlike the previous study, we utilized reminder text messages; however, our completion rates were still lower. With regards to the Pedi-Fab Scale compliance, there were no patient demographics that were significantly associated with text completion. However, for the Pedi-IKDC, high school students, female sex, and race were significantly associated with text completion. Previous studies that analyzed text response rates found no significant associations between compliance and age, sex, and level of education.  1, 9 One study in which the text-messaging study procedure lasted 7 days for an adult cohort, found that females responded at a significantly higher rate than males.  21 Further investigation is required to determine if collection of PROs in children should be restricted to high school students given the higher response rate.\n\nCompared with the Pedi-Fab Scale, the Pedi-IKDC has about twice as many questions, which may be why we start to see significance in association with certain demographics and compliance. According to cellphone use data in teenagers, the most active text message users are high school-aged females.  8 ur study found that teenage females were the most active text message responders; therefore, teenage females may be more likely to remain engaged in a longer text-messaged questionnaire than teenage males and middle school-aged subjects. To encourage homogeneity in compliance rate among cohorts of different demographics, we recommend producing survey question sets that are relatively concise and can aptly be delivered through paper, text message, or any other platform. Appropriate font and format optimization for mobile phones is also important to the design of future PROs. Additional work also may involve validating text message delivery of other PROs in the pediatric population, such as the QuickDASH questionnaire.\n\nThis study had several limitations. First, we had a relatively homogenous sample in which subjects were of similar age, geographical locations, and knee functionality. Bias may have been introduced through a ceiling effect, as many patients reported high knee functionality and the Pedi-IKDC scores were more skewed to the right. Second, not all of the subjects participated in sports. This may have affected their interpretation of the Pedi-Fab Scale, which utilizes sports terminology that the patients may not have been familiar with unless they participated in sports. Nonetheless, these limitations are present within the paper versions of the PROs.\n\nText message delivery using mobile phones allows for valid assessment of Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab score in the pediatric population, 2 important PROs in pediatric sports medicine. In addition to providing synonymous results with paper delivery, delivery by automated text messaging allows patients to respond on their own time, which may increase compliance among high school students while also reducing the labor cost of collecting PROs."
