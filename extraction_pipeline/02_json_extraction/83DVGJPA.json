The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a mobile phone text-message intervention to improve dietary behavior in people undergoing hemodialysis.\n\nStudy Design: Six-month randomized feasibility study.\n\nSetting & Participants: Patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis across 2 health districts in Sydney, Australia.\n\nInterventions: Participants randomized to the intervention received 3 text messages per week in addition to standard dietary care for 6 months. The usual care group received standard dietary care.\n\nOutcomes: The primary outcomes were feasibility measured using recruitment and retention rates, acceptability of the intervention, and adherence to dietary recommendations. Secondary exploratory outcomes included information on certain clinical parameters related to dietary management of patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis.\n\nResults: 130 people were recruited; 48% of eligible patients (130 of 272) consented to participate, and 88% (115 of 130) completed the study. Semistructured interviews evaluating acceptability identified 5 themes: clear and comprehensive, engaging with consistent and relevant content, maintaining attention with timely reminders, sustaining interest through ongoing care, and generic messages inadequate to prompt dietary change. There was no difference in adherence to dietary recommendations across treatment groups (odds ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.55-2.72]; P = 0.6). Secondary exploratory analyses suggested reductions in dietary intake of single nutrients (potassium, phosphorus, sodium, protein), interdialytic weight gain, and phosphate binder use among intervention participants compared with participants assigned to standard care.\n\nLimitations: Our feasibility study was of short duration. Adherence was based on self-reported data. Generalizability to populations receiving maintenance hemodialysis outside of an urban, Australian setting is unknown.\n\nConclusions: A simple mobile phone textmessaging intervention was feasible and acceptable to patients. Further investigation of the impact on patient-reported and clinical outcomes is warranted.\n\nFunding: Funding for the study was provided by a Sydney Medical School Foundation Grant and the Centre for Transplant and Renal Research at Westmead Hospital.\n\nTrial Registration: Registered at Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with study number ACTRN12617001084370.\n\nC hronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 13% of the population.  1, 2 Dietary management plays an important role in preventing the progression of CKD, managing complications such as high blood pressure, reducing symptom burden, and managing electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with CKD have identified nutrition and lifestyle interventions as high priorities for research.  3 ietary management for people receiving hemodialysis is particularly challenging because patients have to integrate general healthy eating recommendations with additional complex and restrictive dietary requirements such as modifying protein, fluid, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus intake.  4 People receiving hemodialysis report that they lack the confidence and the skills to make dietary choices.  [5] [6] ] [7]  Although dietary self-management may be most effectively achieved through frequent, individualized education with a dietitian,  8, 9  access to renal dietitians is variable and may be limited.  [10] [11] 1] [12]  Furthermore, one-off didactic education sessions can be overwhelming and difficult to comprehend, particularly at the time of diagnosis.  6, 7 iven the high use of mobile phones and the internet, there is increasing interest in the use of these technologies to enhance nutritional care. In chronic disease populations, interventions using telehealth  13  and mobile phone text messaging  14  have led to improvements in dietary behaviors (eg, increased fruit and vegetable intake and a reduction in sodium intake) and other clinical outcomes such as reductions in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and weight. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a mobile phone text-message intervention to improve dietary behavior in patients receiving hemodialysis."

Content of the messages included advice, information, and motivation and support to improve renal dietary behaviors (related to potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and fluid) and general healthy eating and lifestyle behaviors. Text messages were semipersonalized based on baseline dietary intake and clinical parameters (Item S3) from baseline to 3 months. All intervention participants received general healthy eating and lifestyle messages from 4 months to 6 months. All participants had the opportunity to withdraw at any time via text message."

      "text": "The primary outcomes were feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to dietary recommendations (Item S4). Feasibility was measured using recruitment rate and retention rate. Adherence to dietary recommendations was defined as participants meeting 3 of the 4 dietary guideline recommendations with respect to protein, potassium, phosphorus, and sodium (Item S4). Dietitians who served as outcome assessors were blinded to participants' allocation and not involved with the clinical care of the participants assessed dietary intake using the validated 24-hour dietary recall methodology.  18 Before 3-and 6-month reviews, participants were sent a text message reminding them not to reveal their allocation to the outcome assessors. Dietary recalls were conducted in person or via telephone, with food models to assist with portion size estimations for dialysis days and nondialysis days, at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Dietary recalls included the intake of nutritional supplements. Dietary intake data were then analysed with Xyris Software Foodworks, version 9 (using the Australian Food and Nutrient Database in 2011-2013 and AusFoods and AusBrands in 2017).\n\nTo determine acceptability and to undertake a process evaluation  19  of the KIDNEYTEXT intervention, we conducted semistructured interviews with 25 participants sampled from the intervention group after completion of the 6-month follow-up. The process evaluation will be published separately. We undertook purposive sampling to achieve broad diversity of demographic and clinical characteristics. As we recruited participants, we monitored the characteristics and targeted recruitment of patients based on the demographic or clinical characteristics required to PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY Dietary management is a central component of care for people receiving hemodialysis. Mobile phone text messaging is widely used in the population and offers a potential avenue to enhance current nutritional care. KIDNEYTEXT was a 6-month randomized controlled study that evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of text messages to alter dietary behaviors. This intervention was feasible and acceptable. It showed promise at improving dietary parameters and may impact other clinically important outcomes such as fluid management. Larger trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. obtain wide variability of responses. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using principles of grounded theory and thematic analysis, one author (J.S.) coded the transcripts using HyperRESEARCH software (version 3.3; ResearchWare Inc) and inductively identified concepts. Investigator triangulation was undertaken whereby another investigator (A. Tong) read the transcripts and discussed the preliminary themes to ensure these reflected the full range and depth of the data collected. Similar concepts were grouped into themes."

For secondary categorical outcomes, we used logistic models for each time point, adjusting for the baseline measurement and adjusted for the stratification variable. Similarly to the continuous variables, an additional analysis modeled these outcomes longitudinally (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) using a logistic mixed model with a participantspecific random intercept, adjusting for the stratification variable and including the interaction involving time and trial arm to compare the changes in the outcomes over time between the 2 groups.\n\nThe 95% CIs for means, proportions, and ORs are model based unless stated otherwise.

Among individuals who consented to participate, 88% (115 of 130) completed the study. Three intervention participants (3%) requested text messages to be paused, with reasons given including being too busy to read messages and having enough information. Nine participants in the intervention group (11%) and 6 participants in the usual care group (14%) did not complete the study. Reasons for not completing the study are shown in Fig 1 . Adherence to Renal Dietary Guidelines At baseline, 28 participants in the intervention group (34%) and 18 in the usual care group (46%) were adherent with 3 or more dietary guidelines.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "A simple mobile phone text intervention targeting dietary behaviors is feasible. There was a high rate of recruitment and retention, with 48% of eligible people consenting to be involved in the study and 88% of participants completing the study, with only 2% asking to be withdrawn from the study and 2% requesting text messages to be paused. Participants reported the intervention to be acceptable and were satisfied and engaged with the text messages.\n\nThe most substantial barriers to recruitment into the study included not having access to a mobile phone, having insufficient command of English to read and understand the text messages, and not being interested in participating in research. These barriers are generally consistent with the literature regarding challenges of recruitment into nephrology studies.  22 Potential methods by which to improve recruitment in a future trial could be to design an adaptive, randomized study clustered by dialysis unit with the intervention embedded into current renal nutrition services to promote buy-in from clinicians, enrolling patients through trusted clinicians and enhancing the participation of dialysis staff in the development and implementation of the intervention.  [22] [23] [24]    KIDNEYTEXT was deemed acceptable by participants, with self-reported high levels of satisfaction and engagement. This was also seen in another trial conducted in CKD that used a combination of telephone consultations and mobile phone text messages (ENTICE).  25 In both our study and ENTICE, participants reported that the interventions prompted dietary behavior change and found the frequency of text messages and duration of intervention satisfactory, with text-message content being relevant and comprehensible. KIDNEYTEXT had a recruitment rate of 48% and a low withdrawal rate of 2%. Similar findings have been reported in other studies that used eHealth interventions to alter dietary behaviors, with a 35% recruitment rate  25  and 5% withdrawal rates.  25, 26 These findings indicate a good uptake and acceptance of eHealth interventions in CKD and hemodialysis populations, which justifies the conduct of larger and longer-duration trials to establish effects on long-term outcomes. The adherence definition in KIDNEYTEXT did not reach statistical significance. Our finding is in contrast to results from a prior study, TEXTME, which was a 6-month randomized controlled trial conducted in coronary heart disease. 14 TEXTME demonstrated significant improvements in dietary intake with the use of a one-way mobile phone text-messaging intervention. This study demonstrated that significantly more intervention participants (93%) adhered to 4 or more of the 8 dietary guidelines compared with usual care participants (75%).  27 There were no data available to guide a sample size calculation for dietary adherence for the KIDNEYTEXT study. The sample size calculation underestimated adherence to dietary guidelines in usual care. The KIDNEYTEXT study has provided useful data for future studies when considering dietary intake and dietary adherence as a primary end point.\n\nWe detected some promising signals in secondary exploratory outcomes of KIDNEYTEXT that will need to be evaluated in future trials. The intervention group showed a progressive reduction in dietary sodium intake from baseline to 6 months. Consistent with these results, KIDNEYTEXT demonstrated a significant improvement in fluid management in intervention participants. There was a significant difference in average IDWG and the proportion of participants meeting IDWG targets at 6 months. Our findings are supported by results from prior studies. Interventions using digital self-monitoring tools with or without individualized dietary counseling have been conducted in dialysis populations  26, 28  and showed modest reduction in average daily sodium intake of 197 (95% CI, -540.76 to 116.85) mg at 4 months  29  ; however, the strength of this evidence was considered to be low. A meta-analysis demonstrated reduction of IDWG by an average of 0.13 (95% CI, -0.27 to 0.01) kg/d in hemodialysis populations through self-monitoring eHealth interventions; however, the evidence was considered to be of low quality.  29 n KIDNEYTEXT, we noted an unintended decline in protein intake, with intervention participants reducing their protein intake and usual care participants maintaining their protein intake. Given the significant reduction in dietary phosphorus intake, this result is not unexpected, as there is a large overlap in foods containing both protein and phosphorus. Whereas there was a significant reduction in protein intake in the intervention group, there was no change in nutritional status in either study arm.\n\nThe quality of life in the KIDNEYTEXT intervention group was not anticipated to be different than that in the usual care group given the short time frame of the study. Quality-adjusted life-years, collected for economic evaluations, account for the change in quality of life during follow-up of the study, and were the same in both groups. The EuroQol 5-Dimension utility values in the intervention (0.7) and usual care (0.8) groups were higher than values commonly reported for people receiving hemodialysis.  30 e strengths of KIDNEYTEXT include its randomized design that focused on feasibility evaluation of a simple mobile phone text-messaging intervention to alter dietary behaviors in the hemodialysis population. There are some limitations to our study. First, this was a small study of short duration. This study was designed to confirm feasibility, with our results indicating that text messages can produce dietary change, which justifies the need for a larger study to confirm results and long-term acceptability and outcomes. Although participants were asked not to share messages, it is unknown whether participants shared text messages with patients who were in the control group, which may have led to unintended change in behaviors (ie, contamination). However, should this have occurred, the differences in dietary behaviors would likely be diluted. Additionally, dietary intake data were measured using patients' self-reports. Self-reported dietary intake may not accurately reflect an individual's actual intake, but we used validated 24-hour dietary recall methodology to standardize dietary intake assessment and minimize bias. Finally, generalizability to hemodialysis populations outside of an urban Australian setting may vary depending on the availability of specialist dietitians. Future trials should include measures to determine the impact on these outcomes.\n\nAlthough further evaluation is needed to confirm our findings, this study indicates that mobile phone text messaging is feasible and acceptable in a CKD population. This simple intervention has the potential to be used in everyday practice by dietitians and renal units to enhance current nutritional care, particularly in settings in which access to renal dietitians is limited. Further evaluation of the impact of mobile phone text messaging in other CKD groups, (ie, CKD stages 3-5, conservative management, peritoneal dialysis, and transplantation) is required. Our results suggest that phosphate and fluid management (assessed by IDWG) may be best targeted with supportive dietary text messages. KIDNEYTEXT indicated improvements in the proportions of intervention participants who met phosphate and IDWG guidelines by 15% and 17%, respectively. This approaches the threshold of a 25% improvement in adherence that was determined to be clinically significant. Recommendations for the design of a larger clinical trial in hemodialysis are outlined in Box 1.\n\nTraditional (ie, face-to-face) interventions to alter behaviors such as dietary sodium intake  [31] [32] [33]  and fluid management  34  are resource-intensive, requiring frequent (eg, weekly or every two weeks) contact with practitioners. In practice, access to renal dietitians may be limited, with dietitians citing a lack of resources to provide adequate support and counseling.  [10] [11] 1] [12]  In our study, at baseline, fewer than 70% of participants had seen a dietitian in the past year, and only half saw a dietitian during the 6-month follow-up. A simple, feasible, and acceptable mobile phone text-messaging intervention aimed at improving dietary behaviors in a hemodialysis population may be a useful interim measure used in conjunction with individualized face-to-face counseling. Our feasibility study justifies a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a mobile phone text-messaging intervention on important patient-centered and clinical outcomes in hemodialysis.\n\nData Sharing: Individual participant data that underlie the results reported in this article, after deidentification, will be made available beginning 9 months and ending 36 months following article publication.
