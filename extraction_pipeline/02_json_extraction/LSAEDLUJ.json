      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Background Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems based on transformer architectures, designed to process and generate human language by modeling the probabilistic relationships between tokens in a sequence. Unlike traditional AI models, LLMs are pre-trained on massive datasets, enabling them to learn complex linguistic patterns and adapt to diverse tasks through fine-tuning or prompting. This differentiates LLMs from broader categories like generative AI and neural networks, which may encompass non-linguistic or less context-sensitive models  [1] .\n\nLLMs can be categorized into three primary types:\n\n\u2022 Encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, DeBERTa): Specializing in understanding text for tasks such as classification and sentiment analysis. \u2022 Decoder-only models (e.g., GPT-series, PaLM):\n\nExcelling in text generation and language modeling. \u2022 Encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5, ChatGLM):\n\nDesigned for tasks requiring both understanding and generation, such as summarization and translation.\n\nIn healthcare, LLMs have shown potential in various applications. For instance, ChatGPT has demonstrated utility in medical education by generating differential diagnoses and answering exam-style questions, achieving performance comparable to human experts in USMLE tests. Similarly, models like MedPaLM-2 and MedPrompt have been fine-tuned for specific medical tasks, ranging from electronic health record (EHR) analysis to generating patient discharge summaries. Despite these advances, challenges such as mitigating biases, ensuring data security, and addressing ethical concerns remain critical for their broader adoption  [1] . The advent of large language models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT in healthcare marks a significant shift, potentially transforming medical practices across patient data management, clinical research, and direct care. As digital technologies progress, research explores LLMs' practical applications and efficacy within clinical environments. Notable studies, including those by Cascella et al., assess ChatGPT's implementation viability, revealing its broad utility from enhancing patient communications to aiding clinical decision-making  [2] .\n\nLLMs promise substantial advancements by swiftly processing extensive medical literature and data, potentially revolutionizing decision support systems, personalizing interactions, and supporting complex tasks like surgical planning as Tustumi et al. discuss  [3] . Such innovations aim not only for increased efficiency but also for improved diagnostic accuracy and patient management. Yet, deploying these sophisticated tools invites critical discussions on their reliability, security, and ethical use, especially given the sensitive nature of healthcare. As highlighted in Nature Medicine, these technologies present both significant opportunities and challenges in the medical field  [4] . Furthermore, Lahat and Klang argue that LLMs can help meet rising demands for specialized medical services and enhance telehealth, crucial for addressing global health disparities  [5] .\n\nThe rising importance of LLMs necessitates improved evaluation frameworks and interdisciplinary efforts to enhance their clinical integration and ensure safety and effectiveness . This systematic review aims to examine the evaluations of LLMs within medical and clinical fields."

The process involved answering 11 key questions, as outlined in Table  (Table 1 ), ensuring a thorough and unbiased review of evaluation of LLM performance in healthcare contexts.\n\nTitles and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers to assess relevance against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full-text articles of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and independently evaluated by the same reviewers. Any disagreements regarding study eligibility were resolved through discussion. If consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted to adjudicate and reach a final decision.\n\nThe percentages represent the proportion of studies within each group that evaluated a specific parameter. This approach ensures a clear understanding of how widely a parameter was assessed in relation to its group context.\n\nHuman evaluation methods varied across studies, including expert raters, peer evaluations, and crowdsourcing. However, few studies reported using standardized rubrics or guidelines, which may affect reliability and consistency. This variability highlights the need for more standardized evaluation frameworks to ensure uniformity in future assessments. While this review focuses on identifying evaluation parameters, future studies could systematically categorize and analyze evaluation methods."

      "title": "Study selection and data extraction",
      "text": "A comprehensive search across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, arXiv, and IEEE Xplore yielded 25,156 studies, from which 2754 duplicates and 328 additional records were removed (Fig.  1 ). This resulted in 22,074 records being screened by title and abstract, leading to the exclusion of 20,198 for not meeting inclusion criteria. Following this, data extraction was performed on 1876 articles that passed the initial screening. Of these, 586 articles were excluded due to reasons such as inaccessible abstracts or full texts, lack of DOI, duplication, and nonoriginal research types.\n\nFollowing a detailed full-text review, an additional 529 articles were excluded. Ultimately, this rigorous and meticulous effort culminated in 761 articles from which data was fully extracted, as documented in Appendix Table  (Table    S2 ). [This appendix table represents a cornerstone of the study, containing the most comprehensive data compilation from the included articles. Due to its considerable length and detail-spanning over 100 pages-it could not be incorporated into the main manuscript but is made available in its entirety to ensure transparency and to highlight the exhaustive work underlying this research. Readers are strongly encouraged to consult Appendix Table  S2  to fully appreciate the depth and scope of the extracted data.]\n\nThe evaluation of publications from 2019 to 2025 shows a notable exponential increase in research output, particularly evident from 2021 onwards. In 2019, only 1 article was published, increasing to 3 in 2020, 6 in 2021, 7 in 2022, and dramatically rising to 160 in 2023. This trend continued into 2024, with 557 articles published, followed by 27 articles in early 2025, highlighting a marked growth in research activity over this period."

These methodologies must also address critical concerns such as data privacy, ethical implications, and risks posed by inaccuracies or biases. Additionally, the unique demands of healthcare require LLMs to interpret and generate specialized medical content with high reliability and contextual relevance  [6, 7] . This study highlights a dramatic increase in research interest in LLMs in healthcare, with publications surging from a single study in 2019 to 557 in 2024. This exponential growth underscores the expanding capabilities and clinical potential of LLMs, particularly in diagnostics, decision support, medical education, and patient communication. However, the lack of standardized evaluation tools, variability in study designs, and ethical concerns such as data privacy and hallucination risks represent key barriers to effective evaluation of LLMs in clinical settings. Addressing these issues requires interdisciplinary efforts and the development of robust frameworks tailored to clinical contexts  [8] [9] [10] ."

Yet, the limited assessment of these models highlights the necessity for standardized evaluation frameworks to enable effective comparisons  [17] . . The evaluation of LLMs in healthcare reveals significant variations in research focus and application, underscoring the critical need to align research priorities with clinical demands. Surgery emerged as the most frequently evaluated specialty, representing 28.2% of all studies, reflecting its prominent role in healthcare. However, critical specialties such as cardiology (1.9%) and emergency medicine (2.7%) remain significantly underrepresented despite their global importance. These findings highlight the necessity for future research to target high-burden and underserved areas to maximize the potential impact of LLMs in clinical practice."

      "text": "The analysis of subspecialties within surgery emphasizes the dominance of ophthalmology (25.0%), orthopedics (20.0%), and urology and otolaryngology (14.1% each). Despite their importance, general surgery (5.5%) and other subspecialties, including neurosurgery and vascular surgery, were evaluated far less frequently, highlighting potential gaps in research coverage. Similarly, internal medicine-a key specialty-was the second most evaluated area (15.2%), with oncology (47.1%) leading among its subspecialties. However, other critical areas, such as nephrology (5.0%) and pulmonology (2.5%), were minimally represented, signaling the need for broader evaluations within this domain. Future research should focus on aligning LLM evaluations with the specific clinical needs of diverse medical specialties to ensure their effective and responsible integration into healthcare practice  [4, 6] ."

      "title": "Parameter evaluations",
      "text": "A total of 2,239 parameter evaluations were identified, with accuracy emerging as the most frequently assessed metric (419 instances, 21.78%). This reflects the critical importance of producing precise and reliable outputs in clinical settings. Other frequently evaluated parameters, such as readability (95 instances, 4.29%) and reliability (46 instances, 2.53%), emphasize the need for outputs that are both clear and dependable. Less commonly assessed parameters, including safety, bias, and appropriateness, highlight areas requiring more focused research to address potential risks and ethical challenges in clinical applications.\n\nOur grouping framework, based on language, application purposes, and evaluation methods, revealed distinct patterns in LLM usage and assessment:\n\nGroup A-e and Group A-ne studies collectively emphasized accuracy as a key evaluation parameter, with usage rates of 21.78% and 22.99%, respectively. This reflects the critical need for precise and dependable outputs, regardless of whether the language focus was exclusively English or included non-English languages. Group A-ne studies, which included non-English languages, showed a higher focus on performance (6.95%) and comprehensiveness (3.20%), reflecting the challenges of evaluating multilingual capabilities.\n\nGroup B-h, involving direct human evaluations, emphasized accuracy (21.64%) and correctness (1.80%), highlighting the role of expert validation in ensuring the clinical utility of LLM outputs.\n\nGroup B-nh, which relied on automated or indirect evaluations, focused on metrics like completeness (2.81%) and quality (2.76%), reflecting the need for reliable outputs in contexts without human oversight.\n\nGroup C, addressing educational applications, placed significant emphasis on readability (6.48%) and comprehensiveness (3.29%), crucial for effective knowledge dissemination.\n\nGroup D, targeting examination and evaluation purposes, highlighted accuracy (24.31%) and correctness (3.10%) as key metrics, underscoring the importance of dependable outputs in high-stakes contexts.\n\nThese group-specific analyses provide valuable insights into how LLMs are assessed across diverse research contexts, reflecting the tailored objectives and priorities of each group. Notably, the limited focus on ethical parameters like safety and bias across all groups highlights a critical gap that must be addressed to ensure equitable and responsible LLM integration."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The evaluation of LLMs in healthcare highlights their varied applications and categorization by language and methods. Nonetheless, several issues persist, including an excessive focus on accuracy, which does not adequately capture the complexity of model performance in clinical settings. Essential factors like safety, fairness, and bias are often neglected, and many studies rely on closedended tasks, failing to mirror the complexity of clinical decision-making which requires comprehensive, openended reasoning  [8, 18] .\n\nAdditionally, the categorization of studies by language and purpose reveals varied applications of LLMs and underscores a lack of standardized evaluation practices. This fragmentation impedes a unified understanding of LLMs' capabilities across medical fields. Moreover, the application of LLMs in clinical settings faces challenges, as the lack of domain-specific training data can cause inaccuracies, especially in precise fields like radiology or genetics  [6, 19] .\n\nA notable limitation of this study is the restriction of the search strategy to titles of published studies. This approach, while providing a focused scope, may have excluded relevant studies identifiable through abstracts. Future systematic reviews in this domain should consider expanding the search strategy to include both titles and abstracts to ensure a more comprehensive capture of eligible studies.\n\nThe lack of standardized definitions for some evaluation parameters and the variability in human evaluation practices are recognized as limitations of this review. While this work identifies trends in parameter usage and grouping criteria, future research should explore standardizing these definitions and frameworks within specific medical specialties or model types. Some findings, such as the distribution of clinical specialties and target audiences, provide contextual insights but are not directly aligned with the primary focus on evaluation methods. Future reviews could streamline the analysis to align more closely with evaluation frameworks."

      "title": "Future directions and perspectives",
      "text": "To fully realize the potential of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, future efforts should prioritize several key areas. First, enhancing interpretability is critical to developing transparent models that clinicians can trust for reliable decision support. Establishing robust validation frameworks tailored to the complexities of clinical settings is equally essential to ensure the accuracy and applicability of LLM outputs. Ethical considerations, such as safeguarding data privacy, mitigating bias, and addressing the societal impacts of automation, must also be a primary focus. Additionally, the evolving roles of healthcare professionals require exploration, as these technologies may shift their responsibilities from decision-makers to supervisors of AI-generated insights. To mitigate risks associated with misuse or overreliance on LLMs, the development of comprehensive governance frameworks is imperative, ensuring their deployment aligns with ethical and safety standards. Finally, addressing barriers to adoption, including resource constraints and resistance to change, will require interdisciplinary collaboration and targeted education efforts to foster acceptance and successful integration into healthcare practices."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "This systematic review underscores the expanding role of LLMs in clinical medicine, highlighting their potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics, education, and patient care. While their applications are diverse, critical challenges remain, including the need for standardized evaluation frameworks, attention to ethical considerations, and the underrepresentation of high-priority medical specialties. Addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration and robust governance will be essential for the responsible deployment of LLMs. Future research should focus on enhancing model interpretability, tailoring evaluations to clinical complexities, and addressing disparities in specialty-specific applications. By aligning technological advancements with clinical needs, LLMs can drive significant improvements in healthcare outcomes."
