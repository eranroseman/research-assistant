  "title": "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Behavioral Economic Incentive Programs for Goal Achievement on Healthy Diet, Weight Control and Physical Activity: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background Healthy diet, weight control and physical activity to reduce obesity can be motivated by financial incentives (FI). Behavioraleconomic approaches may improve the incentivization effectiveness. This study compares and ranks the effectiveness of standard and behavioral incentivization for healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity promotion. Purpose To investigate whether behavioral-economic insights improve incentivization effectiveness. Methods A systematic search of Medline and Scopus was performed from database inception to December 2020. Study characteristics, program designs, and risk ratio (RR) were extracted. A two-stage network meta-analysis pooled and ranked intervention effects. Results There were 35 eligible RCTs. For diet-weight control, standard FI, deposit contract (deposit), lottery-based incentive (lottery), and standard-FI + lottery increased goal achievement compared to no-FI but only deposit was statistically significant with pooled RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.21 (0.94, 1.56), 1.79 (1.04, 3.05), 1.45 (0.99, 2.13), and 1.73 (0.83, 3.63). For physical activity, standard-FI, deposit, and lottery significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI, with pooled RRs of 1.38 (1.13, 1.68), 1.63 (1.24, 2.14) and 1.43 (1.14, 1.80), respectively. In a follow-up period for physical activity, only deposit significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI, with pooled RRs of 1.39 (1.11, 1.73). Conclusion Deposit, followed by lottery, were best for motivating healthy diet, weight control and physical activity at program end. Postintervention, deposit then standard-FI were best for motivating physical activity. Behavioral insights can improve incentivization effectiveness, although lottery-based approaches may offer only short-term benefit regarding physical activity. However, the imprecise intervention effects were major concerns. \n Lay summary Healthy diet, weight control and physical activity to reduce obesity can be motivated by financial incentives (FI). Behavioral-economic approaches may improve the effectiveness of FI programs. This study aims to investigate whether behavioral-economic insights improve incentivization effectiveness for healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity promotion. We conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), then pooled the interested results, compared and ranked the effectiveness of standard and behavioral incentivization programs by a two-stage network meta-analysis. There were 35 eligible RCTs. For diet-weight control, standard FI, deposit contract (deposit), lottery-based incentive (lottery), and standard-FI + lottery increased goal achievement compared to no-FI but only deposit was statistically significant. For physical activity, standard-FI, deposit, and lottery significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI. In a follow-up period for physical activity, only deposit significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI. In conclusion, deposit, followed by lottery, were best for motivating healthy diet, weight control and physical activity at program end. Post-intervention, deposit then standard-FI were best for motivating physical activity. This shows that behavioral insights can improve incentivization effectiveness, although lottery-based approaches may offer only short-term benefit regarding physical activity.",

      "text": "Obesity and overweight represent a substantial health burden that leads to the development of metabolic syndrome  [1, 2]  and non-communicable diseases, e.g., diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases  [3, 4] . Obesity and overweight are preventable through healthy diet and regular physical activity  [3] . However, unhealthy dietary behaviors  [5]  and insufficient physical activity are omnipresent  [6]  despite conventional interventions which have mostly focused on legislation (e.g., banning partially hydrogenated oils), taxes (e.g., sweetened beverage tax) and subsidies (e.g., fruit and vegetables), and information provision  [7] [8] [9] [10] . In addition, financial incentives (FI)  [11, 12]  have also been used to improve the effectiveness of promotions of healthy diet and physical activity. However, their effectiveness is largely dependent on their design  [7, 11, 12] . As such, FI programs informed by behavioral economics  [13, 14]  may represent a more efficacious approach than a standard FI program to promote healthy diet and physical activity.\n\nBehavioral economics combines insights from economics and psychology to understand particular heuristics that human brain uses to cope with the large burden of complex choices, which lead to predictable systematic biases and errors. Such better understanding of human decision-making provides opportunities for influencing choices that take better account of how people actually respond  [15]  because the predictable biases can be used to help or nudge people make better choices. Such interventions involving FI include such as deposit contracts (participants risk losing money if they do not meet goals which is effective because people dislike losses more than we like gains of an equivalent amount), lotterybased incentive (meeting goals makes participants eligible for a lottery prize which is effective because people overweight small probabilities), regret lottery (all participants eligible for a lottery ticket but only those meeting goals are eligible to receive the prize which is effective because seen one's ticket drawn and not being eligible for the prize creates an intense regret feeling), and other types of incentive schemes.\n\nA previous meta-analysis  [16]  was published in 2015 and included seven studies to compare the effectiveness of weight loss between standard FIs, deposit contracts and regret lotteries. We described a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA)  [17]  to consider these interventions with additional FIs including price incentives, lottery-based incentives, and group-based payments for several outcomes. The current study focused solely on goal achievement outcomes in healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity by comparison of standard and behavioral economic FIs; the probabilities of being the best interventions for these outcomes were estimated and ranked."

Review methods were described in the published protocol  [17]  but are summarized briefly below:\n\nStudies were identified from Medline via PubMed and Scopus databases up to December 2020. Two reviewers (SB and OP) independently selected studies, disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (AT).\n\nSearch terms were constructed based on interventions and outcomes (more details in Supplementary Table  1  and published protocol  [17] ). A two-step study selection was performed: First, individual studies from the systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis (SRs/MAs) were selected. Second, relevant individual studies published since the previous SR/MA were selected from the searches. Systematic reviews were selected if they compared behavioral economic incentive programs with any FI program comparisons (e.g., standard monetary (or equivalent) rewards, price incentives, deposit contract, lottery-based incentive, regret lottery, group-based payment or no incentive), and had any outcome of improvement of healthy diet, weight control, and/or physical activity. Selection of individual studies were based on the following criteria: compared any pair of interventions defined above; interventions were directly implemented on cluster/subject levels; assessed any outcome of improved healthy diet, weight control, and/or physical activity including actual weight, weight change, and others; and published in English or other languages amenable to Google translate.\n\nGiven the significant number of studies identified, this report focused on randomized control trials (RCTs) with outcomes of goal achievement on healthy diet, weight control and physical activity (Fig.  1 )."

None of the RCTs included reported group-based payments, only a small number considered lottery-based incentives and regret lottery, which therefore necessitated amalgamation into a single outcome referred to as lottery. As such, four interventions were considered including no FI, standard FI, deposit contract (called deposit), and lottery."

Inflation rates for each country  [19]  with an exchange rate for purchasing power in US dollars (USD PPP)  [20]  were calculated for 2020.\n\nRoB for randomized trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2)  [21] , with disagreement resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (AT)."

As such, relative treatment effects for all possible pairwise comparisons were estimated beyond what would normally be possible through conventional direct meta-analyses approaches. A two-stage network meta-analysis was applied to assess relative treatment effects using a consistency model with common between-study variance  [25] . Interventions were coded as 1, 2, 3, 4 for no FI, standard FI, deposit, and lottery, respectively. Mixed relative treatment comparisons between all FIs were then estimated accordingly. The probability of being the best FI program for goal achievement (i.e., highest RR) was estimated using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) method. The probability of goal achievement for each treatment was estimated with 1000-replications and an average probability estimated ranging between 0 and 100%, with a greater value reflecting a higher rank  [26] . Inconsistency assumptions were evaluated by a design-treatment interaction model  [25] . All analyses were performed using STATA software V.17.1; a p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

Three RCTs  [27] [28] [29]  were further excluded leaving 35 RCTs  (16 and 19 RCTs for diet-weight control and physical activity, respectively) for further details, see Supplementary Fig.  1 . Only inclusion of two studies  [31, 32]  was questioned by both reviewers (SB and OP), and this was solved by discussion and consensus. Comparison pairs (i.e., intervention vs comparator) of goal achievement in diet-weight control and physical activity are described in Table  1  and Supplementary Fig.  2 .\n\nAll studies were conducted in high-income countries: 26 (74.3%) in the USA, 7 (19.4%) in Europe and 2 (5.9%) in Asia. Study participants from 16 studies had metabolic syndrome including overweight, obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension (45.7%). Mean age ranged from 18 to 80.4 with median of 45.1 years; percentage of female ranged from 5.3% to 91.5% with a median of 69.5% (Supplementary Table  2 ).\n\nCriteria of goal achievement included percentage weight loss (N = 9), absolute weight loss/control (N = 5), choosing healthy snack (N =1), and self-weighing (N = 1) for dietweight controls; steps (N = 12) and gym visits (N =7) for physical activity. Incentives were paid for process (N = 23), outcome (N = 10), and both (N = 6). The size of financial incentive per day in USD PPP ranged from 0.03 to 38.5 with a median of 1.5. The maximum size of lottery prize ranged from 51 to 356.8 with a median of 103.6 USD PPP. Program duration ranged from 7 days to 1 year with a median of 3 months and payment frequency ranged from daily to every 3 months with a median of every week. Supplementary components included knowledge provision in the form of a booklet/ brochure (N = 2), one-time education class (N = 3) and repeated classes (N = 4); counselling (N = 5); feedback (N = 24); self-monitoring (N = 14) (Supplementary Table  2 )."

A meta-analysis was applied (Supplementary Figure  4 ) indicating deposit and lottery significantly led to goal achievement more often than no FI with pooled RRs [95% confidence interval (95%CI)] of 1.99 (1.36, 2.92) and 1.34 (1.01, 1.80), respectively. In addition, standard FI and standard FI+lottery also performed better than no FI but this was not significantly, with pooled RRs of 1.20 (0.93, 1.53) and 2.22 (0.58, 8.49), respectively.\n\nNineteen RCTs  [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64]  compared effects of interventions on achievement of physical activity goals (Supplementary Figure  2 ). These effect sizes were pooled across studies indicating standard FI, deposit and lottery were significantly more likely to achieve goal than no FI (1.46 (1.18, 1.79), 1.63 (1.31, 2.03) and 1.44 (1.20, 1.73) respectively, Supplementary Figure  5 ). In addition, deposit was 1.16 (0.98, 1.38) times more likely to achieve goal than standard FI but this was non-significant.\n\nDegree of heterogeneity (I 2 ) of pooling was estimated, see Supplementary Table  3 . For diet-weight control, the I 2 values were high (78.66%) in standard FI, moderate (53.69% and 60.05%) in standard FI+lottery and lottery. For physical activity, heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 71.31%) in only standard FI vs no-FI but none for the remaining. None of heterogeneity sources could be identified by a meta-regression (Supplementary Table  4 ). However, subgroup analysis by size of FI per day showed that higher median FI provided greater effect than lower median FI (Supplementary Figure  6 ), suggesting that as expected, higher financial incentives are more likely to provide a stronger effect than lower financial incentives on goal outcomes for both diet and physical activity. Likewise, additional subgroup analysis showed that the effect of lottery was higher if incentive duration was <180 days, knowledge was provided, and performed in a clinic.\n\nA small study effect was evaluated by Egger's test (Supplementary Table  3 ) and funnel plots (Supplementary Figure  7  and  9 ) indicating asymmetry of the funnel on pooling of lottery vs no-FI (p = .03) for diet-weight control and standard FI vs no-FI (p < .001) for physical activity. Contour-enhanced funnel plots (Supplementary Figure  8  and 10) were then constructed for both comparisons indicating that asymmetry was likely due to genuine heterogeneity not just to study size."

      "text": "We performed a NMA to assess the effects of FIs on goal achievement for diet-weight control and physical activity using data from 35 RCTs. Findings suggested that the best interventions for diet-weight control goal achievement at the end of the program were deposit, followed by standard FI+lottery, lottery, and standard FI (compared to no FI). These interventions, with the exception of standard FI+lottery, were also best for physical activity goal achievement. In addition, the benefits of deposit persisted for 2 weeks to 6 months beyond the end of the intervention. In general, goal achievement for healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity is dependent not only on type of FI but also on the time period beyond the intervention ends. For instance, deposit, lottery, and standard FI were best for  physical activity goal achievement during intervention implementation but only the effect of deposit persisted 4 months after the program had ended, suggesting integrating behavioral insight regarding loss aversion can improve incentive program effectiveness  [16, 67, 68] . In addition, deposit increased goal achievement by 47% compared to standard FI; this would have been a clinically significant effect but it did not reach statistical significance. Although lottery represented the second-best option at program end, its effect diminished thereafter suggesting that while lottery generated some shortterm benefits, these were less sustainable in the longer term.\n\nAt the beginning of a lottery program, participants may have overestimated the probability of winning the prize and therefore were highly motivated. When people realize the true expected value of the prize over time, the motivating effect then faded out  [53] .\n\nOur findings were consistent with those from a previous meta-analysis which found that deposit had the best effect, followed by lottery and standard FI compared to no FI in healthy goal achievement  [16] . Although deposit represented the most effective FI, it may face uptake problems given that participants risk losing money if they do not meet goals  [61, 69] . Allowing participants to set their own deposit amount aligned with their income may resolve this issue. Nevertheless, deposit is considered fairer and less controversial as individuals finance their own healthy behaviors  [67] .\n\nAccording to the self-determination theory, both intrinsically (e.g., pleasure, interest, or challenges) and/or extrinsically motivations (e.g., rewards, commands, or legally restrictions) determine health behaviors  [70] . The effect of financial reward, which acts as an external motivation, depends on how the rewards are perceived, e.g., either as supportive, informational, or controlling  [71, 72] . If it is perceived as controlling, it might undermine intrinsic motivation leading to unsustainable health behavior change. On the contrary, if it supports or reinforces intrinsic motivation, its effect can last beyond the program end. Financial incentive program, which contains supportive communication and allows participants to have their autonomy on the implementation, might have long-term effect on health behaviors  [71] .\n\nPrevious meta-analysis evidence  [73]  for traditional interventions such as media campaigns for behavioral change showed only very small effects on diet and exercise (pooled coefficients of 0.05), which was substantially lower than clinically-based interventions of education and counselling (weighted average effect size of 0.51 for diet-weight control)  [74] . Other behavioral economic interventions may also prove efficacious as suggested through another recent meta-analysis  [75]  demonstrating the effectiveness of nudges in both health and food domains with average standardized effects of 0.34 and 0.65, respectively. These interventions provided positive effects similar to deposit contracts in our study, although these could not be directly compared.\n\nOur findings were based on RCT data conducted in developed countries, so application of this evidence in developing countries should be considered with caution. Previous evidence shown that people with low incomes tend to favor lottery compared to those on higher income  [76, 77] . Therefore, lottery programs may represent a more feasible option in middle-/low-income countries. Furthermore, RCTs are needed to compare the effectiveness of different types of FIs in middle-/low-income countries, given the current paucity of studies available.\n\nOur study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first NMA synthesizing evidence from all available standard and behavioral FI programs (deposit and lottery including regret lottery) for goal achievement on healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity. FI effects were also assessed beyond the program conclusion, where information was available. However, some limitations could not be avoided. First, some comparisons in NMA were based on only small number of both RCTs and included subjects that met the inclusion criteria, particularly for three of the six comparisons for diet-weight control (number of subjects of 38 to 208) and two of the six comparisons for physical activity (number of subjects of 41 to 139) which were based on data from two studies or less that contributed to the NMA. As a result, estimates of intervention effects were imprecise leading to major concerns for suggestion of deposit and standard FI versus lottery. This lessens the confidence in conclusion for these particular comparisons. However, the conclusion for the other comparisons is not affected as the results from the pairwise direct meta-analysis and NMA are quite similar. Second, the effects of FI programs were subject to low/moderate heterogeneity and the small number of RCTs included were not amenable to sub-group analysis to identify and reduce heterogeneity. Third, approximately 50% of the intervention effects estimated from our NMA had moderate levels of confidence while the remainder had low levels in line with the CINeMA reporting protocols. Our results should therefore be updated when further RCTs have been published."

      "text": "Behavioral FIs, namely deposit, followed by lottery approaches, represented the best incentives for goal achievement in healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity on program completion. In the longer term, deposit, followed by standard FI, provided the best options for goal achievement for physical activity beyond the intervention timeframe. However, these intervention effects are major concerns due to imprecision. Further update NMA should be performed. Behavioral insight about loss aversion may improve the effectiveness of incentive programs for healthy diet, weight control and physical activity. While lottery-based approaches may provide only potential short-term benefits in the context of physical activity."
