  "title": "Pharmacist interventions to improve hypertension management: protocol for a systematic review of randomised controlled trials",
  "abstract": "Introduction Hypertension management remains a major public health challenge in primary care. Innovative interventions to improve blood pressure (BP) control are needed. One approach is through community-based models of care with the involvement of pharmacists and other non-physician healthcare professionals. Our objective is to systematically review the evidence of the impact of pharmacist care alone or in collaboration with other healthcare professionals on BP among hypertensive outpatients compared with usual care. Because these interventions can be complex, with various components, the effect size may differ between the type of interventions. One major focus of our study will be to assess carefully the heterogeneity in the effects of these interventions to identify which ones work best in a given healthcare setting. Methods and analysis Systematic searches of the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica (Embase) and Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases will be conducted. Randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of pharmacist interventions on BP among outpatients will be included. Examples for pharmacist interventions are patient education, feedback to physician and medication management. The outcome will be the change in BP or BP at follow-up or BP control. Results will be synthesised descriptively and, if appropriate, will be pooled across studies to perform meta-analyses. If feasible, we will also perform a network meta-analysis to compare interventions that have not been compared directly head-to-head by using indirect evidence. Heterogeneity in the effect will be evaluated through prespecified subgroup and stratified analyses, accounting notably for the type and intensity of interventions, patients' characteristics and healthcare setting. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required as the results will be drawn from currently available published literature. Outcomes of the review will be shared through peer-reviewed journal and used for implementation policy. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021279751. .",

Recent data that several healthcare jurisdictions might have reached a plateau in the percentage of treated and well-controlled hypertensive patients.  3 Innovative interventions to improve BP control are therefore needed in primary care, where management of hypertension takes place.\n\nOne approach is a greater use of communitybased models of care with the involvement of pharmacists and other non-physician"

      "text": "\u21d2 This systematic review will provide updated evidence on the effect of pharmacist intervention on blood pressure management. \u21d2 Heterogeneity in the effect of these interventions will be carefully evaluated which will help the implementation of effective interventions in various healthcare setting. \u21d2 We will assess the comparative effectiveness of each intervention compared with each other by using direct and indirect evidence. \u21d2 Due to the expected heterogeneity and complexity of both interventions and usual care, a sharp contrast between interventions might be difficult and the feasibility of the network meta-analysis might be limited. \u21d2 The review methods were carefully planned according to current guidelines (Cochrane and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) and prospectively submitted to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) to minimise risk of bias related to study design and conduct and insure adequate reporting of results in the completed review.\n\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n\nOpen access healthcare professionals.  4 5  Pharmacists are highly accessible healthcare professionals and a valuable asset in the management of hypertension.  6 7 The US Community Preventive Services Task Force has recommended team-based care, including pharmacists, to improve BP control.  8 Further, recent hypertension guidelines, notably the 2017 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association as well as the 2018 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension, recommend the involvement of pharmacists for the team-based care management of hypertension.  [9] [10] ] [11]  A recent umbrella review (ie, a review of reviews) found that community pharmacists can improve clinical outcomes in a wide array of chronic diseases, including diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.  12 The authors of this review concluded however that further studies were needed to assess the impact of specific interventions on given outcomes, and that is actually what we aim for in the current review that we will conduct. In 2014, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 14 224 patients and found that pharmacist interventions-alone or in collaboration with other healthcare professionalsimproved BP management.  13 Since then, new studies have been conducted to evaluate different types of interventions, notably using e-health and digital tools.  14 15 Our review indicated also that pharmacist interventions had differential effects on BP, from very large to modest or no effect. Reasons for this large heterogeneity could not be clearly explained. It might be not surprising that the effect size may differ between the type of interventions, but it is key to try to identify what works best: is the intensity of intervention linked to the effect size? Are characteristics of the patients or specific setting associated with a large effect?\n\nTo address these questions, and toward the efficient implementation of this type of interventions in different healthcare setting and jurisdictions,  16  updating evidence and explaining this heterogeneity is needed. In addition, with a view to identify what intervention works best, we will assess the feasibility of performing a network metaanalysis. This method allows estimate the comparative effectiveness of each intervention against each other by using direct and indirect evidence and rank interventions.  17 One key element will be to determine the effect on BP according to the duration and intensity of interventions. Hence, we have shown previously that the effect on BP could be larger if the intervention was done at least monthly.  13 Further, we will also assess whether there is an effect once the intervention is over. Hence, we have recently shown in a trial conducted in Switzerland that an effect on BP was seen 6 months after the end of a 6 months team-based care intervention involving pharmacists.  18 This is one major element to assess the long-term effect of this type of interventions."

First, an initial limited search of MEDLINE (Ovid) is undertaken using the search terms 'Pharmacist intervention', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital', 'Pharmacies', 'Pharmacy', 'Hypertension', 'Blood pressure'. Second, an analysis of the text words contained in each article's title, abstract and index terms is undertaken to expand the list of search terms. Based on the results of this analysis, a more thorough search is conducted in the chosen databases. The search strategy for MEDLINE (table 2) was created first and is then adapted for each database, including all identified keywords and index terms. Third, the reference lists of all included studies selected for critical appraisal is searched by hand and cited reference searches for all included studies will be conducted in Web of Science in order to find any additional studies not identified during the initial search processes.\n\nThe electronic databases to be searched include:\n\n1.

Random sequence generation.\n\n2. Allocation concealment.\n\n3. Blinding of participants and personnel. 4. Blinding of outcome assessment. 5. Completeness of outcome data. 6. Selective outcome reporting (intention-to-treat and follow-up). 7. Other bias (eg, baseline imbalance inpatient characteristics).\n\nWe will classify the risk of bias for each domain as either 'low', 'unclear' or 'high' and provide information from each study together with the reasons for our evaluation in the risk of bias tables.  19 Given the type of RCTs included in our review, blinding the participants and personnel is not feasible; only the outcome assessment can be blinded. In contrast, personnel blinding is impossible in cluster randomised trials. When blinding is not possible, evaluation is performed in each area; however, it will not be considered as an important domain when evaluating the entire RCT. We will resolve any disagreements through discussions. There is some consensus that these items can be applied for evaluation of studies across diverse clinical areas.  25 he quality of BP measurement will be also systematically assessed along three criteria: (1) use of clinically validated BP measurement devices; (2) training of outcome assessor; (3) measurement of BP out of the office. Criteria will be assessed as 'low', 'unclear' or 'high'.  19 e will resolve any disagreement in quality assessment through discussions and involvement of an arbitrator where necessary.\n\nThe risk of bias for cluster randomised trials will be assessed according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,  19  which are as: 1. Recruitment bias 2. Baseline imbalance. 3. Loss of clusters. 4. Incorrect analysis. 5. Comparability with individually randomised trials.\n\nWe will derive an overall study risk of bias as follow. A judgement of high risk of bias in one or more domains will be considered as a 'high risk' study, a judgement of low risk of bias in most domains will be considered as a 'low risk' study, and a judgement of unclear risk of bias in most domains as an 'unclear risk' study. When considering treatment effects, we will take into account the risk of bias for the studies that contribute to that outcome."
