  "title": "Mobile Telephone Text Messaging for Medication Adherence in Chronic Disease A Meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Adherence to long-term therapies in chronic disease is poor. Traditional interventions to improve adherence are complex and not widely effective. Mobile telephone text messaging may be a scalable means to support medication adherence. OBJECTIVES To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the effect of mobile telephone text messaging on medication adherence in chronic disease. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (from database inception to January 15, 2015), as well as reference lists of the articles identified. The data were analyzed in March 2015. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials evaluating a mobile telephone text message intervention to promote medication adherence in adults with chronic disease. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently extracted information on study characteristics, text message characteristics, and outcome measures as per the predefined protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Odds ratios and pooled data were calculated using random-effects models. Risk of bias and study quality were assessed as per Cochrane guidelines. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. \n RESULTS Sixteen randomized clinical trials were included, with 5 of 16 using personalization, 8 of 16 using 2-way communication, and 8 of 16 using a daily text message frequency. The median intervention duration was 12 weeks, and self-report was the most commonly used method to assess medication adherence. In the pooled analysis of 2742 patients (median age, 39 years and 50.3% [1380 of 2742] female), text messaging significantly improved medication adherence (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.52-2.93; P < .001). The effect was not sensitive to study characteristics (intervention duration or type of disease) or text message characteristics (personalization, 2-way communication, or daily text message frequency). In a sensitivity analysis, our findings remained robust to change in inclusion criteria based on study quality (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.21-2.29; P = .002). There was moderate heterogeneity (I 2 = 62%) across clinical trials. After adjustment for publication bias, the point estimate was reduced but remained positive for an intervention effect (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.39). \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mobile phone text messaging approximately doubles the odds of medication adherence. This increase translates into adherence rates improving from 50% (assuming this baseline rate in patients with chronic disease) to 67.8%, or an absolute increase of 17.8%. While promising, these results should be interpreted with caution given the short duration of trials and reliance on self-reported medication adherence measures. Future studies need to determine the features of text message interventions that improve success, as well as appropriate patient populations, sustained effects, and influences on clinical outcomes.",

      "text": "A dherence is defined as the extent to which a patient correctly follows a prescribed therapy. Adherence is the medically preferred term because it reflects active involvement of the patient and a therapeutic alliance between the patient and his or her physician.  1 This term is in contrast to compliance, which reflects more unidirectional connotations.  1, 2 Adherence to long-term therapies in developed countries is typically reported to be approximately 50% at 1 year after initiation of therapy, with worse rates in lower socioeconomic groups and in developing countries.  3, 4 Poor adherence has been linked to successive hospitalizations, increased need for medical interventions, morbidity, and mortality.  5 In addition, medication nonadherence results in increased health care cost, with estimates from North America of approximately $100 billion being spent annually and $2000 spent per patient per year in excess physician visits.  6 nterventions that improve adherence may have far greater effect on the health of a population than any improvement in specific medical treatment.  7 A review article by Haynes et al  8  concluded that almost all interventions that were effective for long-term care were complex and not widely effective. There is widespread need for convenient and feasible innovations to help patients remain adherent to medications.  9 In recent years, mobile health (mHealth) has emerged as a strategy to improve the implementation of evidence-based medicine and support public health by using mobile digital devices.  10 The usefulness of this medium has been explored to improve treatment adherence. Electronic reminders can be delivered in various forms. The use of mobile apps (software applications) requires specialized devices (smartphones, tablet computers, or personal digital assistants).  11 Other media for reminders are pagers or dedicated devices for audiovisual reminders. However, their availability within usual health care is low and presents a challenge for translation into routine clinical practice.\n\nMobile telephone text messaging may be a more feasible platform to deliver electronic reminders in practice. The technology is old and therefore can be delivered to any existing mobile telephone. Subscription to mobile telephones is ever increasing. According to one estimate, there were approximately 7 billion mobile subscribers by the end of 2014, roughly corresponding to the global population.  12 This technology is increasingly used by people from all socioeconomic classes,  13, 14  age groups,  13  and continents.  15 n recent times, text messages have been widely used as a reminder and support in various health programs. While previous reviews have shown favorable effects of text messaging, only narrative reviews of text messages without meta-analysis  16, 17  and a meta-analysis  18  that included a diverse range of electronic interventions (text messages, audiovisual reminders, pagers, and beepers) have been published to date. The aim of this review was to estimate the effect of text messaging on medication adherence in adults with chronic medical disorders. Secondary aims were to describe and examine the effect of characteristics of text message interventions, including frequency of messaging, interactivity, and customization, and to describe perceptions and acceptability to participants."

We excluded studies based on the following criteria: (1) the primary intervention under consideration was not limited to text messages, (2) the focus was solely disease management or education and did not report medication adherence or reported only surrogate outcomes (eg, CD4 cell count or glycated hemoglobin level), and (3) the study involved psychiatric, military, or institutionalized patients.

Otherwise, we combined trial arms (ie, text message vs non-text message arms).

We used individual patient data when available. If only aggregate data were available, we used estimates of treatment difference and their variance.  23 We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each primary study and used random-effects models to pool estimates. We also calculated Cohen d as a magnitude of the effect size. Cohen d values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are generally considered as small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.  24 e used the I 2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. An I 2 statistic exceeding 50% with P < .05 was interpreted as representing substantial heterogeneity.  25 We assessed publication bias using funnel plot symmetry and Egger regression intercept. If publication bias exists, the funnel plot is asymmetric, with Egger test P < .05. We used the trim-and-fill method by Duval and Tweedie  26  to impute the missing studies. We performed subgroup analysis based on study and text message characteristics.\n\nThere are no clear guidelines or criterion standard recommendations on how to assess medication adherence or define adherence outcomes.  27, 28 Our primary analysis was to examine the effects of text message interventions on medication adherence. We defined adherent patients as those individuals determined to be adherent as defined by the individual included trials. For trials that reported multiple measures of adherence, we selected the most objective measure of adherence according to a predefined hierarchy (ie, electronic monitoring over pill count over self-recall, as well as a continuous scale over a dichotomized scale.  18"

      "text": "We identified 16 RCTs that investigated the effect of text messaging on medication adherence in patients with chronic disease. We found that text message interventions increased medication adherence, with an approximate doubling of the odds of patients' achieving adherence to their medication regimens. This increase translates into adherence rates improving from 50% (assuming this percentage as the baseline rate in patients with chronic disease from the literature in developing countries  3, 7  ) to 67.8%, or an absolute increase of 17.8%. Given the simplicity of the intervention and potential scalability, this finding suggests that text message-based in-terventions could have substantial potential to improve medication adherence in patients with chronic disease. Our findings are consistent with previous observations that text messaging can be a useful tool for behavioral change in disease prevention 44 and monitoring and management.  45, 46 Our analyses indicated the presence of publication bias. However, even after taking this bias into account, the effect estimate was still significantly positive. There was also substantial heterogeneity noted, which is likely because of several reasons, including clinical heterogeneity (true variation of effect arising from variation in the characteristics of the text message interventions and variation in the patient populations). Nevertheless, there is also likely methodological heterogeneity, most likely arising because of variability in the ways outcomes were defined and measured in each study. Improving medication adherence is a challenge. Various interventions targeting medication adherence have been reported, including patient education and counseling, allied health support (pharmacist-based or nurse-led interventions), use of reminders (beepers, pagers, smartphone apps, and automated telephone calls), packaged medications, and frequent clinic visits.  1  Successful strategies usually involve multimodal combinations. However, implementing such complex combination methods is resource intensive and may not Another area of interest is the effect of text message characteristics. The characteristics of interventions in this metaanalysis varied substantially. While certain characteristics of text message-based programs such as increased message frequency and 2-way communication have been suggested to improve outcomes, we found no significant heterogeneity of effects across subgroups within this review. However, the results of a comparative analysis between these subgroups should be interpreted with caution and regarded as inconclusive because of sparse data available for analysis. However, some aspects are noteworthy. Interventions that delivered personalized messages showed a moderate effect size (Cohen d, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P < .01), which suggests that sending a text message with one's preferred name may increase acceptance and participant engagement. There was no significant difference between daily text messages (Cohen d, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.17-0.79) compared with less frequent messaging (Cohen d, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13-0.57), which is contrary to concerns raised in other studies 37,48 that daily reminders may lead to habituation and response fatigue. However, one possible explanation is that response fatigue may be a feature of longer-duration interventions, while the median length of studies in this review was 3 months.\n\nOverall, the text message intervention had high acceptance rates. The patients in our meta-analysis were middleaged (age range, 31-64 years), and 50.3% (1380 of 2742) were female. Most studies did not report the educational or socioeconomic status of the participants. Hence, there were insufficient data to determine whether these individual characteristics may be associated with variation in response.\n\nWhile there has been mounting evidence largely in favor of texting interventions, many questions remain unanswered. There is a need for future high-quality studies to address more comprehensively what features of programs make them more effective. For example, is there greater benefit with more text message sophistication such as fixed-frequency or real-time medication monitoring, matched short message service with medication times, varied message content, personalization, and 2-way communication? Also, do text message-based interventions work better in some groups of patients compared with others? For example, do they vary based on participant characteristics such as nonadherence, cultural background, type of disease, educational level, and socioeconomic class? This information will help inform how best to formulate text message-based interventions for different patient cohorts.\n\nOne unique feature of text message interventions is the ability to offer confidential and unobtrusive support, which is an advantage of text messaging over other electronic reminders such as pagers or beepers. In the study by Hardy et al, 30 one-third of the control subjects objected to the use of beepers, which provoked curiosity from people around them and violated confidentiality. This concern was not reported in association with the text message intervention arm in any study, perhaps because of widespread use and recognition of conventional text message alert tones, which are less likely to arouse curiosity among peers. There is still a potential for problems in the case of unattended mobile telephones without password lock or smartphones with a message preview function, but these concerns can be managed with appropriate participant training.\n\nThere are several limitations of our meta-analysis. First, this study is subject to publication bias, although the effect of publication bias is likely small based on the fail-safe N test by Orwin.  49 This test provides an estimate of the number of missing studies. At a generally acceptable threshold of 0.1 for the effect size, this value was 34, which means that we would need to locate an additional 34 studies with a mean standard difference in means of 0 to bring the combined standard difference in means to below 0.1. Second, the adherence levels that defined patients as adherent varied among the studies. For example, these thresholds in HIV studies were 90% in the study by Pop-Eleches et al 37 vs 95% in the study by Lester et al;  32  and in CVD studies they were 80% in the study by Wald et al 41 vs 95% in the study by Quilici et al  38  . If the threshold is lowered, it can overestimate the effect of text messaging on adherence and vice versa. Third, many studies used self-reporting to determine the outcomes, which carries the possibility of recall bias and social desirability bias. Self-recall is commonly used to measure adherence owing to the convenience, the lack of a criterion standard, and the challenges of recording behaviors objectively. However, it tends to overestimate adherence, and there is no consensus on optimal recall periods (3 days, 7 days, or 1 month).  50 Social desirability bias may also be an important consideration in the studies included given their cultural diversity. Fourth, the RCTs identified in our metaanalysis had short intervention duration and follow-up (median, 12 weeks), and none of the studies reported data on adherence behavior beyond the end of the trial or completion of the intervention. The short duration of the trials suggests uncertainty about the duration of the effect, the time-effect relationship, and the continuation or decay of the effect after the intervention is withdrawn. While our meta-analysis identified a positive effect of text messaging on medication adherence in the short term, it is uncertain if this influence will translate into longer-term effects on adherence behavior or on clinical outcomes.\n\nText Messaging for Medication Adherence in Chronic Disease Original Investigation Research jamainternalmedicine.com (Reprinted) JAMA Internal Medicine March 2016 Volume 176, Number 3"

      "text": "We found that mobile telephone text messaging increased adherence to taking medications among middle-aged patients with chronic disease. The ease of use, instantaneous relay of information, and boundless reach make it an attractive tool for public health. While our analyses indicate some heterogeneity across clinical trials, this finding is likely because of variation in the characteristics of the interventions studied and in the definitions of outcomes among the studies. These results should be interpreted with caution given that most trials were of short duration and that most used self-reported outcome measures. Hence, uncertainty remains about the effect size of text messages over longer periods and on objective measures of outcome. Future research on the benefit of different features of text message interventions, the longevity of the effect, and the influence on objective clinical measures of outcomes are needed to help better identify the role of text message interventions to improve medication adherence in chronic disease care."
