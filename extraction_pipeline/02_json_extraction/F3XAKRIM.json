  "title": "Economic Evaluations of Digital Health Interventions for the Management of Musculoskeletal Disorders: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are widespread in many countries and their huge burden on the society has necessitated innovative approaches such as digital health interventions. However, no study has evaluated the findings of cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Objective: This study aims to synthesize the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions for people with MSDs. Methods: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, AMED, CIHAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Centre for Review and Dissemination were searched for cost-effectiveness of digital health published between inception and June 2022 following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. References of all retrieved articles were checked for relevant studies. Quality appraisal of the included studies was performed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. Results were presented using a narrative synthesis and random effects meta-analysis. Results: A total of 10 studies from 6 countries met the inclusion criteria. Using the QHES instrument, we found that the mean score of the overall quality of the included studies was 82.5. Included studies were on nonspecific chronic low back pain (n=4), chronic pain (n=2), knee and hip osteoarthritis (n=3), and fibromyalgia (n=1). The economic perspectives adopted in the included studies were societal (n=4), societal and health care (n=3), and health care (n=3). Of the 10 included studies, 5 (50%) used quality-adjusted life-years as the outcome measures. Except 1 study, all the included studies reported that digital health interventions were cost-effective compared with the control group. In a random effects meta-analysis (n=2), the pooled disability and quality-adjusted life-years were -0.176 (95% CI -0.317 to -0.035; P=.01) and 3.855 (95% CI 2.023 to 5.687; P<.001), respectively. The meta-analysis (n=2) for the costs was in favor of the digital health intervention compared with control: US $417.52 (95% CI -522.01 to -313.03). \n Conclusions: Studies indicate that digital health interventions are cost-effective for people with MSDs. Our findings suggest that digital health intervention could help improve access to treatment for patients with MSDs and as a result improve their health outcomes. Clinicians and policy makers should consider the use of these interventions for patients with MSDs.",

      "text": "Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), which comprise a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative conditions affecting the muscles, ligaments, joints, tendons, peripheral nerves, and supporting blood vessels, are widespread in many countries  [1] . The burden of MSDs is substantial and increasing globally, particularly in the most economically deprived countries  [2] . According to The Global Burden of Disease Study 2017  [3] , the point prevalence and associated death rates of MSDs were 4151.1 and 1.0 per 100,000 population, respectively. According to Safiri et al  [3] , the prevalence estimate of MSDs was higher among females and increased with age; further, MSDs led to about 30.8 million disability-adjusted life-years worldwide, which is an increase of 3.4% from 1990 to 2017. Low back pain (LBP) is the main contributor to the overall burden of MSDs, but other contributors are rheumatoid arthritis (14 million), amputations (175 million), neck pain (222 million), osteoarthritis (343 million), and fractures (436 million)  [4] . The cost of managing MSDs in the United States was estimated to be US $213 billion in direct and indirect costs, that is, 1.4% of the US gross domestic product, in 2011  [5] . It also cost the United Kingdom economy \u00a310.2 billion (US $12.62 billion) in direct costs to the National Health System in 2017  [6] .\n\nIn response to the growing burden of MSDs, the World Health Organization launched \"the Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative\" in 2017  [7] . This initiative draws attention to the importance of strengthening health system to provide rehabilitation, which is defined as a set of intervention designed to optimize functioning and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions in interaction with their environment. One of the innovative approaches to deliver rehabilitation to patients with MSDs is through the use of digital technologies. Digital health interventions may help overcome barriers to both delivering health care and care for chronic conditions  [8] . Digital health interventions may include any intervention accessed through a computer, a smartphone, or any other hand-held device. Thus, digital health interventions have the advantage of being user flexible, where patients could receive care remotely without having to travel  [9] .\n\nCompared with traditional models of care, digital health interventions are reported to have added benefits in providing evidence-based first-line care, low cost, and scalable patient education delivered via apps or web platform across a wide range of conditions  [10, 11] . Digital health intervention has also demonstrated its clinical benefit in the management of patients with MSDs  [12] . To identify the most effective intervention with the least expenses, it is necessary to compare the costs and effectiveness of various digital health interventions. Apparently, there are no reviews that appraise individual studies and summarize results of the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions on patients with MSDs. Therefore, this study was aimed to analyze evidence to identify whether digital health interventions are a cost-effective option for patients with MSDs."

We defined digital health interventions to include targeted client communication; personal health tracking; and on-demand information services delivered by apps, web-based software, or websites. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR; ie, cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; ie, clinically relevant outcome such as pain intensity, disability, global perceived effect/recovery) were outcomes of the studies. The exclusion criteria were nonmusculoskeletal pathology, nondigital health interventions, study protocols, case studies/discussion papers, pilot studies, conference abstracts, and studies where the ICER was not calculated."

The full texts of the identified studies were checked against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed and graded using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument  [14] . The QHES instrument consists of 16 items with scores ranging from 1 to 9, and the total score of the instrument is 100. During the assessment process, if the included study satisfied the criterion of an item, the study received an item-specific score; otherwise it received a score of 0. Each question has a weighted point value ranging from 1 to 9, which is used to generate a summary score from 0 to 100. As no standardized interpretation of the QHES exists, we adopted the score of 75-90 as good quality and a score of 90 and above as excellent quality, as applied by Tran and colleagues  [15] . Two reviewers (TG and FF) participated in the study selection and methodological quality assessment. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus with the third reviewer (CM)."

A random effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the results from the individual studies. Because of the statistical evidence of heterogeneity across the included studies, a random effects model was chosen  [16] . The assessment of heterogeneity was based on the I 2 statistic. If substantial heterogeneity was present (ie, I 2 >50%), we tried to find an explanation for this heterogeneity.\n\nAll costs were converted to US dollars using purchasing power parities  [17] . We adjusted the cost data to the reference year (2021) using the consumer price index from the World Bank website  [18] . The intervention was considered cost-effective and not cost-effective when it was more effective and less costly and less effective and more costly compared with a comparator treatment, respectively  [19] ."

A statistically significant mean difference in disability (mean difference -0.176; 95% CI -0.317 to -0.035; P=.01) and QALY (mean difference 3.855; 95% CI 2.023 to 5.687; P<.001) was identified. The meta-analysis for the costs of 2 studies  [24, 25]  favors the digital health intervention compared with the control condition (mean difference -US $0.339; 95% CI -0.610 to -0.187; P<.001"

      "text": "Two studies  [27, 28]  documented the cost-effectiveness of digital health intervention on patients with osteoarthritis. A digital, structured, and individualized treatment program and telephone-based health coaching service were the contents of the digital health interventions. The included studies indicated that patients have improved their health-related quality of life, pain intensity, disability, and physical function due to the interventions. Although 1 of the included studies  [27]  reported that the digital intervention was not cost-effective, a study conducted in the United States  [28]  indicated that it is potentially cost-effective in osteoarthritis.\n\nThe digital, structured, and individualized treatment program reported on average a reduction in experienced pain from 5.7 to 3.2 (a reduction by 2.5 points on a 0-10 scale, or a 44% reduction) after 12 weeks  [30] . Based on the cost-effectiveness ratio, the intervention arm was associated with 8705 SEK (US $805.92) per effect improvement. From the societal and health care perspectives, the mean cost difference between the telephone-based health coaching service and control were US $1197 (95% CI -2887 to 6106) and US $493 (95% CI -3513 to 5363), respectively  [27] . For QALYs and all clinical measures of effect, the probability of the telephone-based health coaching service being cost-effective compared with usual care was less than 0.36 at all WTP values. Based on the cost-effectiveness ratio from the health care system perspective, there was an annual cost of US $71.00 and US $31.00 per 1-unit improvement in physical functioning and in pain, as measured by the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, respectively  [28] ."

The digital health interventions include therapist-supported treatment comprising about 100 pages divided into 8 modules of self-help material, cognitive-behavioral intervention with email contact of the therapist, and transdiagnostic psychological intervention delivered via the internet. The clinical outcomes were disability, health status (fibromyalgia), physical functioning, and pain. All these studies reported that digital health interventions were cost-effective. For a unit reduction (\u226530%) in disability, depression, anxiety, and pain, a self-guided internet-based intervention and control or clinician-guided intervention costs from Aus $404 (US $273.05) to Aus $808 (US $546.09) and Aus $88 (US $59.48) to Aus $225 (US $152.07), respectively  [21] . Taking the societal and health care perspectives, the cost-effectiveness ratio between the internet-delivered pain management group and the control group was US $15,295 and US $2211 for 1 additional responder to treatment, respectively  [26] . Compared with control, the internet-based cognitive-behavioral intervention showed a saving of \u20ac40 (US $43.12) per additional point improvement gained on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale  [29] ."

      "title": "Key Findings",
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on critically appraising the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions for patients with MSDs. A total of 10 studies from 6 countries were included. The results of our analysis show that there is strong evidence to support that digital health interventions are cost-effective. From a societal perspective, telephone-based weight loss support provided using an existing nondisease-specific 6-month weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective in comparison to usual care for patients with osteoarthritis  [27] . However, it should be noted that health service delivery systems are not the same in different countries. Moreover, cost-effectiveness results may differ from 1 region to another, as countries have differences in demography and epidemiology.\n\nNicholl and colleagues  [31]  conducted a systematic review to critically appraise published evidence concerning the use of interactive digital health interventions to support self-management of LBP. These authors indicated that no information on cost-effectiveness was reported. However, a recently published review  [12]  has demonstrated that digital health interventions have some clinical benefits in the management of MSDs and may contribute positively toward reducing its multifaceted burden to the individual, economy, and society.\n\nA substantial difference exists in the applicability of digital health interventions in high-income as well as low-and middle-income countries  [32] . For example, telerehabilitation, in the form of a mobile phone app platform extension exercise, may be a practical intervention in geographically remote areas  [23] . Consistent with our findings, taking a lifetime perspective, the use of a mobile app for the self-management of heart diseases by patients with heart failure (in a Spanish region) appeared cost-effective compared with usual care  [33] . Although the type of digital health interventions is one of the influential cost drivers  [34] , it seems that they are cost-effective in both high-and low-income countries.\n\nSome of the main reasons for the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions are early identification of a disease using technology and savings made on direct nonmedical costs or indirect costs. Further, prevention of disease progression and its costly health outcomes could be possible through early detection of a disease. For example, those conditions that have been promptly detected or identified could receive intervention or treatment to prevent its progress. Furthermore, using digital health interventions may enable clinicians to reduce time spent for each patient, which in return reduces overall health care resources and in turn burden on the society.\n\nA meta-analysis could not be performed for most of the included studies in this current review. This is because the included studies used different time horizons, different clinical outcomes, and did not present mean or SD for costs. However, it was possible to pool effectiveness and cost data from 2 studies  [24, 25] . From a societal perspective, compared with the control group, the meta-analysis results of these 2 studies suggest that the digital health intervention is more effective and less costly. This suggests that digital health interventions are cost-effective compared with control. Among other parameters, it is important to consider the transferability of the cost-effectiveness results from other countries before using them in the decision-making process. Therefore, this review could provide useful information that digital health interventions are cost-effective and policy makers can apply regional cost-effectiveness data to their local decision-making."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "There are certain strength and limitations to this study. In this review, we used a systematic approach such as the screening of numerous databases, the involvement of multiple reviewers, and assessment of methodological quality of the studies. Only English language studies were included. Therefore, it is possible that relevant literature published in other languages may have been excluded. Only a small number of studies met the inclusion criteria. It was also not possible to perform a meta-analysis for most of the included studies due to the adoption of different time horizons and different clinical outcomes; further, many studies did not present mean or SD for costs  [35] . Besides, the quality of the included studies indicates that there is a need to interpret the cost-effectiveness results with caution. Finally, we found just 1 study precluding any meaningful conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions. Overall, the findings of this review should be generalized only after taking local information such as perspective, time horizon, currency, and gross domestic product specific for each country into account  [36] ."
