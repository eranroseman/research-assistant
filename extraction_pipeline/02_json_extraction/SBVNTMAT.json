  "title": "Applying Community-Based Participatory Research Principles to Global Oral Health: A Case Study from Costa Rica",
  "abstract": "Background: Resource-limited communities across the globe face dramatic health disparities augmented by the shortcomings of translating research into practice. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) empowers communities through research and engagement to generate knowledge and improve global oral health. This case study presents findings and methods from a CBPR oral health project with an Indigenous Community in Costa Rica (La Casona). Methods: Interviews were conducted with public health dentists, community stakeholders, and community health leaders. Qualitative content and direct coding analysis of 8 interview transcripts was used to develop initial themes. Initial themes were grouped into final themes with representative quotations with framework analysis. Results: Final themes identified included health education, financial status, structural influences on health, diet and nutrition, sociocultural characteristics, and environmental factors. Community partners guided development of a conceptual framework identifying common protective factors and common risk factors for oral health in La Casona. Conclusion: This study is an example of CBPR that explores interconnected determinants of oral health in La Casona and uniquely identifies common protective factors in addition to common risk factors for oral health. Practical Implications: Dental practitioners can apply the CBPR principles applied for this study in other clinical and research initiatives to better align with the WHO Strategic Objectives.",

Achieving oral health for all individuals requires an understanding of the nuances of individuals and communities through research. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is one way to understand these nuances to achieve oral health through engaging and empowering communities. CBPR prioritizes developing partnerships directly with stakeholders to drive the research process.  [3] [4] 4] [5] [6]  CBPR consists of the following stages: determining contexts with local partners, developing group dynamics and equitable partnerships, developing and implementing interventions and research, and assessing and evaluating outcomes.  3 CBPR has been described with different names in the literature, including participatory research, participatory action research, action science, action inquiry, cooperative inquiry, participatory evaluation, and empowerment evaluation.  7, 8 CBPR enhances the usefulness, validity, quality, and relevance of research by utilizing community partner local knowledge and lived experience.  7, 9 Some challenges of CBPR include lack of trust, power inequity, cultural and value differences, and difficulty proving intervention success.  7 The following project is a case study from Costa Rica of applying CBPR principles to global oral health. Its purpose is to engage local stakeholders input to analyze the risk and protective factors contributing to community-wide oral health."

      "text": "Interamerican Center for Global Health/Centro Interamericano para la Salud Global (CISG) is an international academic research and education center in Costa Rica. In 2016, collaborators from CISG and Harvard CONTACT David O. Danesh david.danesh@nationwidechildrens.org Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at  https://doi.org/10.1080/19424396.2024.2330558 . School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) worked to develop educational programs for trainees. The collaboration resulted in an innovative experiential global health course hosted in Costa Rica. The experiential course, called Global Health Extension Course: Perspectives from Costa Rica, was a five-day elective intensive course in rural Costa Rica building on competencies and themes from a didactic global health course at HSDM.  10, 11  Course participants (authors DOD and RL) connected with public health dentist (author GABM) who works directly and serves indigenous communities throughout La Casona. Author GABM spent years building rapport with community leaders, including authors DBP and MBB, through informal collaborations and through his work with Hands for Health (H4H). H4H is a local Costa Rican nongovernmental organization (NGO) that recruits local health professionals and health promoters to focus on improving the health of the communities in the Coto Brus region of Costa Rica. This case study presents findings from a CBPR oral health project with an indigenous community in Costa Rica called La Casona.\n\nLa Casona is a community within the Coto Brus Indigenous Territory which extends near the frontier between Costa Rica and Panama. Most of the Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 people live in small villages dispersed throughout the region.  12 La Casona is in the Coto Brus canton of the Puntarenas province in southeastern Costa Rica, about 40 kilometers from the Costa Rican-Panamanian border. Though the Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 are Indigenous to Costa Rica and Panama, the Echandi-Fernandez Treaty in 1941 established the border without considering the Indigenous populations.  12 There are five Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 territories in Costa Rica (Coto Brus, Abrojo Montezuma, Altos de San Antonio, Alto Laguna de Osa and Conte Burica).  13 The Indigenous territory of Coto Brus has a population of about 2,500 Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9, with approximately 370 living in La Casona community.  14 However, most Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 people, about 170,000, live in Panama.  12 During the coffee harvest season beginning in September, families will typically travel from Panama to work in Costa Rica.  12 emperatures average around 23 degrees Celsius throughout the year, and there is normally a rainy season from May to December and a dry period in March and April.  14 oads connect La Casona to other communities in Coto Brus; yet, the roads significantly deteriorate during the rainy season.  14 The Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 share a strong traditional culture, adhere to two Indigenous languages, Ng\u00e4bere and Buglere or Bokot\u00e1, and utilize a traditional kinship system in reference to grandparents.  13 It is a patriarchal culture and women often give birth to their first child between age 13-17.  14 Most of the population practice Catholicism or an Indigenous religion known as Mama Tata or Mama Chi.  14  Within La Casona, there is a health center clinic staffed by physicians, traditional healers, dentists, and other health care providers as part of the Costa Rican \"Equipos B\u00e1sicos de Atenci\u00f3n Integral en Salud\" (EBAIS) health system. EBAIS is also used to refer to the individual health clinic."

      "text": "The case study began when project authors discussed possibilities to contribute to H4H initiatives in La Casona. Prior to traveling to Costa Rica for the course, the first step of a CBPR approach was utilized by partnering with community stakeholders from La Casona to determine the research context. Determining the research context included defining a research question, creating an interview guide, developing a conceptual framework, and assessing determinants of oral health in La Casona. In 2017, H4H launched a public health educational initiative called, \"Oral Health Protection Program for Vulnerable Indigenous Population of Coto Brus,\" to improve oral health in the Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 population. H4H utilizes strong relationships with community leaders, health care providers, traditional healers, and families built over years to provide culturally-sensitive dental care and oral health education that respects community traditions.\n\nProject authors collaborated over numerous video conferences and e-mail communications, as well as review of existing oral health reports, government sources, policy papers and reports gray literature by local NGOs to complete an environmental analysis of La Casona. This initial review served as a basis for an interview guide prior to the entire team convening in Costa Rica.\n\nA standard written informed consent (Appendix 2) was developed for study participants in their preferred language (Spanish or English). This project was reviewed and approved by both the Harvard Institutional Review Board and the Centro de Desarrollo Estrat\u00e9gico e Informaci\u00f3n en Salud y Seguridad Social (CENDEISSS) prior to attending the course. CENDEISSS is a department of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS) which oversees health research and bioethics topics of the public health services in Costa Rica."

A total of seven hours of interviews were conducted and audio recorded with seven key stakeholders recorded. Due to the small size of the community, we determined saturation point had been reached after stakeholder interview responses became repetitive.

Without an understanding of La Casona's unique historical and sociocultural context, interventions for oral health and overall health will unlikely reach their full potential. By utilizing the conceptual framework developed through this project, community interventions could target common protective factors such as the local health center (EBAIS), school meal programs, locallygrown nutritious food, sources of income including government subsidies and informal work, integration of cultural beliefs and traditional healers, access to drinking water, and engagement with community health organizations. Possible interventions could include nutrition education and agricultural initiatives which facilitate the cultivation of community, school, and family gardens. Common risk factors include transportation and geographic barriers for some families despite the presence of an EBAIS.
