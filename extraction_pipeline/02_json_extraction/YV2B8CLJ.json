      "text": "In the course of a search for microbial metabolite which would be protective against infection of rice by Piricularia oryzae and Ophiobolus miyabeanus, an antibiotic was isolated from the culture filtrate of a strain of Streptomyces. This antibiotic was found to be an antagonist of phenylalanine and identified as L-l,4-cyclohexadiene-lalanine from physico-chemical properties and chromatographic behavior. Although L-l, 4-cyclohexadiene-l-alanine was chemically synthesized by  Snow et  al.l) in 1957, its biological production has not been reported. Producing Organism The morphological and physiological properties of FN 1636 strain which was isol ated from a soil sample collected at Takarazuka are listed in Table 1. Microscopic observation on aerial mycelium revealed that its sporophores branched and bore little open spirals abundantly and sometimes formed clusters. Carbon utilization by strain FN 1636 was studied using the method of Pridham and Gottlieb2). L-Arabinose, D-fructose, D-glucose, rhamnose, sucrose, lactose, trehalose and D-mannitol were well utilized, whereas D-xylose, D-mannose and z-inositol w ere moderately, raffinose and salicin were poorly utilized. Comparison of this cultural properties and sugar utilization with those for known species revealed that the strain resembles Streptomyces diastatochromogenes. However, some minor differences exist between FN 1636 strain and Streptomyces diastatochromogenes. For example, the formation of a new antibiotic, L-l,4-cyclohexadienel-alanine is noteworthy peculiar character of FN 1636 strain. Thus, we designated the strain as Streptomyces diastatochromogenes var. sakaii. This work was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan, F ukuoka, April 2, 1970. * Present address : Department of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Susceptibility, the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

N o coagulation Production and Isolation FN 1636 Strain was inoculated into 500ml shaking flasks containing 100ml of medium consisting of 2.0 % glucose, 2.0 % potato strach, 2.0 % Pharmamedia, and 0.3 % CaCO3. Flasks were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 4 days on a reciprocal shaker. This antibiotic has fungistatic activity against plant-pathogenic fungi, so assay was carried o ut against Ophiobolus miyabeanus on potato dextrose agar by usual paper-disc method. Cultured broth from flasks was filtered with the aid of Gelite 545. The filtrate was absorbed on an anion-exchange resin (Amberlite IR-45) in OH~form at pH 4.5 and eluted with 50% aqueous acetone. The eluate was concentrated in vacuo and added into two volume of acetone, yielding powdery precipitate. The precipitate, after washing with acetone, was further purified on a cellulose column by elution with water-saturated ^-butanol. Active fractions were combined and kept for several days at room temperature to yield coloress plate crystals (FN 1636 substance). Thus, 500mg of crystals was obtained from 10 liters of culture broth. Chemical and Physical Properties Chemical and physical properties of the isolated crystalline substance are listed in Table 2 comparing with that of authentic l-1, 4-cyclohexadiene-l-alanine. The most characteristic property of the new crystalline substance is to give a brick-orange color with ninhydrin reagent on paper or cellulose layer. Chemically synthesized l-1, 4cyclohexadiene-1-alanine also gives similar color with ninhydrin. The fermentation Table 2.

Antimicrobial spectrum of FN 1636 substance of the fermentation substance was tested by the agar dilution streak method and the results are shown in Table  3 . Inhibition of plantpathogenic fungi was noted, and growth of Trichophyton asteroides, Trichophyton rubrum, Sclerotinia arachidis, Helminthosporium sativum, Ophiobolus miyabeanus and Piricularia oryzae was partiallyinhibited at the concentration of 25-50 mcg/ml. The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa IAM 1052 is inhibited at the concentration \u00e0\"of 5 mcg/ml only on synthetic medium. In studies using this bacterial strain the reversal by amino acids of the antibacterial activity of the fermentation substance was examined. Only phenylalanine among 19 amino acids tested reversed the inhibition of growth as shown in Table 4. This suggests that the fermentation substance is an antagonist of phenylalarnine. Also this antibiotic has the same antibacterial activity against Ps. aeruginosa as authentic sample of l-1, 4-cyclohexadiene-lalanine; inhibitory zones of 28 mm at the concontration of 200 mcg/ml by paper-disc assay.
