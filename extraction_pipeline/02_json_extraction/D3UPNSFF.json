  "title": "Blood pressure control by home monitoring: meta-analysis of randomised trials",
  "abstract": "Objective To determine the effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure levels and proportion of people with essential hypertension achieving targets. Design Meta-analysis of 18 randomised controlled trials. Participants 1359 people with essential hypertension allocated to home blood pressure monitoring and 1355 allocated to the \"control\" group seen in the healthcare system for 2-36 months. Main outcome measures Differences in systolic (13 studies), diastolic (16 studies), or mean (3 studies) blood pressures, and proportion of patients achieving targets (6 studies), between intervention and control groups. Results Systolic blood pressure was lower in people with hypertension who had home blood pressure monitoring than in those who had standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system (standardised mean difference 4.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 6.9) mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure was lower by 2.4 (1.2 to 3.5) mm Hg, and mean blood pressure was lower by 4.4 (2.0 to 6.8) mm Hg. The relative risk of blood pressure above predetermined targets was lower in people with home blood pressure monitoring (risk ratio 0.90, 0.80 to 1.00). When publication bias was allowed for, the differences were attenuated: 2.2 ( -0.9 to 5.3) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 1.9 (0.6 to 3.2) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions Blood pressure control in people with hypertension (assessed in the clinic) and the proportion achieving targets are increased when home blood pressure monitoring is used rather than standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system. The reasons for this are not clear. The difference in blood pressure control between the two methods is small but likely to contribute to an important reduction in vascular complications in the hypertensive population.",

      "text": "High blood pressure is one of the most readily preventable causes of stroke and other cardiovascular complications.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4]  It can be easily detected, and most cases have no underlying detectable cause; the most effective way to reduce the associated risk is to reduce the blood pressure. Unlike many other common, chronic conditions, we have very effective ways of treating high blood pressure and we have clear evidence of the benefits of such interventions.  1  However, despite a great deal of time and effort, hypertension is still underdiagnosed and undertreated.  5 Furthermore, losses to follow up are high and are responsible for avoidable vascular deaths.  6 ood pressure is usually measured and monitored in the healthcare system by doctors or nurses in hospital outpatient departments and, increasingly, in primary care settings. New electronic devices have been introduced and validated in the clinical setting to replace the mercury sphygmomanometer and to overcome the large variations in measurement due to variability between observers. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is also being used more often to assess individuals' blood pressures outside the clinical setting.\n\nMeasuring blood pressure at home is becoming increasingly popular with both doctors and patients.  7 8 Some national and international guidelines also recommend home monitoring in certain circumstances.  9 A recent qualitative review of the role of home blood pressure measurement in managing hypertension concluded that no evidence exists as to whether home monitoring leads to better control of high blood pressure.  10 e reviewed the literature on home blood pressure monitoring and did a meta-analysis of the effect of home monitoring on blood pressure levels and the control of hypertension in randomised trials that compared home or \"self \" blood pressure monitoring and usual blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system."

We also searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Clinical Effectiveness, the Health Technology Assessment Database, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, the TRIP database, and the websites of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for reviews of blood pressure monitoring studies. Finally, we examined reference lists of the relevant reviews and all identified studies and reviewed the cited literature. We extended the search to all languages.\n\nWe included studies in which the intervention under test was at least one measurement of blood pressure at home by study participants or their family members, whether the result was recorded by the participant or transmitted to a healthcare provider.  We e luded studies that were not randomised con-trolled trials and those that used \"ambulatory\" blood pressure monitoring rather than \"home\" or \"self\" blood pressure monitoring. When several publications reported aspects of the same study, we chose only one paper to represent the trial data on blood pressure control or on achievement of hypertension targets. Where endpoints were presented at different time points-for example, Earp et al and Stahl et al with endpoints at one and two years of follow up  17 19  -we repeated analyses with the alternative time point.\n\nWe extracted data from text, tables, and graphs. Two reviewers (SMK and LF) independently examined the data. Differences about inclusion of studies and interpretation of data were resolved by arbitration (FPC), and consensus was reached after discussion. We found 253 references. Twenty one studies met the inclusion criteria.  We e luded three of these studies because they did not use blood pressure as an outcome measure  [11] [12] [13]  (fig  1 )."

Where standard deviation of the change was not reported or could not be calculated from the 95% confidence interval, we estimated it. As the standard deviation of the change was approximately the same as the standard deviations of the initial and follow up blood pressures in studies in which these were reported, we estimated the standard deviation of the change as the average of the standard deviations of the initial and follow up pressures where only the standard deviation of the change was missing. If no standard deviations were reported then we used the average standard deviation for all the remaining studies. We used relative risk to estimate the effect of intervention on the percentage of patients with blood pressure above target at follow up.\n\nWe assessed potential publication bias by using a funnel plot and Egger's test.  32 Publication bias is due to small negative studies failing to be accepted for publication, which then causes the funnel plot to display asymmetry. We recalculated the combined estimate after estimating from the asymmetry of the funnel plot the number of \"missing\" studies and their effect sizes and standard errors, a method known as \"trim and fill.\"  33 34 We assessed heterogeneity between trials by using the 2 test."

The size of the difference is rather small from the clinical viewpoint: 2.2/1.9 mm Hg (when allowing for publication bias), with 10% greater proportion on target. However, this may represent an adjunctive useful improvement in management of hypertension likely to contribute to a better outlook for cardiovascular events. The main inclusion criterion in the study was that participants had undertaken blood pressure monitoring at home either by themselves or with the aid of a family member. As this is the likely scenario for implementation in a population setting, the results of our meta-analysis could be applicable to the general population of people with mild to moderate essential hypertension."

Home blood pressure measurements are the most acceptable method to patients and are preferred to either readings in the surgery or ambulatory monitoring.  38 39 hey provide accurate blood pressure measurements in most patients, although some patients of low educational level may have poor reporting accuracy.  39 Finally, blood pressure monitoring at home might help to improve awareness and concordance, and thus overall effective management.\n\nAfter we submitted our manuscript, a multicentre randomised trial was published that compared the use of blood pressure measurements taken in the physician's office and at home and the potential impact on the management of hypertension.  40 After a year, home blood pressure levels were lower than office blood pressures. Adjustment of antihypertensive treatment on the basis of home blood pressure instead of office blood pressure led to less intensive drug treatment and lower costs. Less good blood pressure control as judged by office blood pressure targets was obviously recorded. At variance with this trial, our results indicate that the practice of monitoring blood pressure \"at home\" leads to a better control of blood pressure \"in the clinic.\" Nevertheless, the results of our systematic review and of the latest trial highlight the need for further evidence from prospective studies of outcome to inform potential modifications of treatment guidelines."
