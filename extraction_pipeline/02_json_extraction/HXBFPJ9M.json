      "text": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder; its symptoms have been shown to present in several distinct dimensions  [1] . Common in children and adolescents, OCD has a prevalence rate between 1 and 4%  [2] [3] [4] [5] . Some of the most common co-morbid disorders in pediatric OCD are tic disorders-Tourette disorder, chronic motor or vocal tic disorder, and transient tic disorder-with a prevalence rate in the pediatric OCD population of 20-59% [6-9]. In the general population, the prevalence of tic disorders is between 1 and 5%  [10] , with chronic tic disorder between 1 and 2% while 5% experience transient tic disorders  [11] . OCD is commonly seen as a comorbid disorder in children and adolescents with tic disorders  [12] . In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)  [13] , tic disorder was added as a specifier for OCD, to be given in cases of current or past tic disorders  [14] .\n\nStudies have suggested that OCD and co-morbid tic disorders are more frequently seen in males  [15] . A study by  Lewin et al.  found that 63% of OCD patients with Abstract Some studies have shown that children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and co-morbid tics differ from those without co-morbid tics in terms of several demographic and clinical characteristics. However, not all studies have confirmed these differences. This study examined children and adolescents with OCD and with possible or definite tic specifiers according to the DSM-5 in order to see whether they differ from patients without any tic symptoms regarding clinical presentation and outcome of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The full sample included 269 patients (aged 7-17) with primary DSM-IV OCD who had participated in the Nordic Long-term Treatment Study (NordLOTS). Symptoms of tics were assessed using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL). One or more tic symptoms were found in 29.9% of participants. Those with OCD and co-morbid tic symptoms were more likely male, more likely to have onset of OCD at an earlier age, and differed in terms of OCD symptom presentation. More specifically, such participants also showed more symptoms of OCD-related impairment, externalization, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), social anxiety, and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the two groups showed no difference in terms of OCD severity or outcome co-morbid tic disorder were men, compared to 59% of those without co-morbid tic disorder  [15] . Comparing OCD without tic symptoms to OCD with any tic symptoms (that did not fulfill the criteria for tic disorder) found an even bigger gender difference, 39.6% of males had OCD without tic symptoms versus 53% with OCD with co-morbid symptoms of tics  [16] . In adults, studies have shown that OCD patients with co-morbid tic disorders have obsessive and compulsive symptoms of elevated severity  [17] , but pediatric studies have not confirmed this relationship  [8, 15, 16] . Although children and adolescents with OCD suffer from considerable functional impairment  [18] [19] [20] [21] , and reduced quality of life  [22] , the presence of co-morbid tics has not been shown to aggravate functional impairment in this group  [15] , however, studies in this regard are few and have limited power.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that the type of obsessivecompulsive symptoms among patients with OCD differs between those with and without co-morbid tics. One study found that OCD patients with co-morbid tics have fewer ordering, hoarding, and washing compulsions; however, this study did not report differences in obsessions  [8] , partially resembling findings from an earlier study on adults by Holzer et al.  [23] . Results from another study indicated that children and adolescents with OCD and co-morbid tic disorders had considerably fewer contamination obsessions, sexual obsessions, and counting compulsions  [24] . Both of these studies had limited sample sizes. An epidemiological study found that adolescents with OCD and co-morbid tics had more symptoms of violent images and impulses but fewer sexual symptoms than those having OCD without tics  [25] . In a more recent study, children and adolescents with OCD and co-morbid tic symptoms displayed lower rates of religious obsessions and of washing and ordering compulsions, but this study had the limitation that all participants were partial and/or non-responders to previous SRI treatment  [16] . As the results of these studies vary considerably, we cannot make firm conclusions concerning specific patterns of OCD symptoms. However, the particular symptom, \"doing things until they feel just right,\" also referred to as \"not just right experiences,\" has been shown to occur more frequently in OCD patients of all ages with co-morbid tic disorders and/or autism spectrum disorder  [23, 26, 27] , although in one study \"just right experiences\" were reported to be related to OCD severity but not tics  [28] .\n\nCo-morbidity of OCD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well known, primarily in young populations, but the theoretical account for this connection remains unclear  [29] . Some researchers have suggested that co-morbidity between OCD and ADHD could be mediated by the presence of tic disorders  [30] . Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and autism spectrum traits are more prevalent in child and adolescent OCD than in the general population, and both are linked to co-morbidity of attention/ behavioral disorders and tics  [31, 32] . A recent study found that OCD patients with tics have higher rates of ADHD and ODD/CD but lower rates of anxiety disorders, specifically generalized anxiety and separation anxiety  [15] . However, contrary to this finding, a more recent study found no significant differences in other co-morbidities between young patients with OCD and co-morbid tic symptoms and those with no tic symptoms  [16] . Collectively, prior results are somewhat mixed, but the pattern of co-morbidity does seem to be different for children and adolescents with OCD and co-morbid tics compared to those with OCD and no tics.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for OCD  [33] [34] [35] , resulting in improved quality of life  [36] . It has been suggested that patients with tic-related OCD might benefit less from standard OCD treatment programs, further implying that this subgroup of patients should receive treatment especially modified to target the specific OCDsymptom profile of this group  [37] . Albeit, to our knowledge, this assumption has not been confirmed in any OCD treatment studies on children and adolescents  [8, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . It has been found, however, that children and adolescents with OCD and a co-morbid tic disorder do show reduced benefit from pharmacotherapy with SRI/SSRI compared to CBT  [38, [44] [45] [46] , or no difference at all  [47, 48] . Conversely, one study suggested that non-responders to CBT with OCD and tics derive added benefit from SSRI pharmacotherapy compared to continued CBT  [49] . To our knowledge, only one study has examined broadly defined tic symptoms as a predictor of treatment efficacy, finding no significant differences in the effects of CBT treatment between OCD patients with and without tic symptoms  [16] . Limitations of this study, however, are that patients were not treatment na\u00efve and did not receive standalone CBT but rather received one of medication management, medication management with instructions in CBT, or a combination of medical management and full CBT  [16] .\n\nTaken together, studies of tic symptoms as predictors of treatment outcome are scarce, and, from the only study investigating broadly defined tic symptoms, no conclusions can be drawn regarding youth untreated for OCD, because that study concerned partial responders to SRI treatment. Differences in the clinical presentation of OCD with tic symptoms could give clinicians valuable information about treatment for this group of patients, since tic symptoms are now an OCD specifier according to the DSM-5  [13] .\n\nIn this study, we define tic symptoms widely and in accordance with the DSM-5 in order to embrace a broad group having tic symptoms and OCD. Having a current or past possible, probable, definite or partially remitted diagnosis of a tics disorder and/or Tourette's syndrome was enough to classify a participant into this OCD + tic group.\n\nThis study had two aims:  (1)  to examine (in a non-treated group) whether children and adolescents with OCD and cooccurring, broadly defined tic symptoms compared to children and adolescents with OCD and without co-occurring tics differ with respect to age, gender, age of OCD onset, symptom profile, or co-morbidity, and (2) to evaluate whether the two groups respond differently to CBT.\n\nBased on the literature, we hypothesized that children and adolescents with co-morbid tic symptoms would: (1) be predominantly male with an earlier age of onset, (2) have higher rates of co-morbid behavioral disorders and autism spectrum traits, and (3) have a different profile of OCD symptom presentation. However, we did not expect these groups to differ in terms of: (4) OCD severity, (5) functional impairment, or (6) benefit derived from CBT."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study is, to our knowledge, the largest to date to examine the differences in clinical presentation and CBT treatment efficacy in child and adolescent OCD patients with and without co-morbid tic symptoms. Another advantage of this study is that the sample had not received any treatment for OCD for at least six months before CBT started. This study found, first and foremost, that a large group of children and adolescents with OCD suffer from co-morbid tic symptoms (current or past; 29.85%). In agreement with our hypothesis, tic symptoms were more common in boys and were correlated with earlier age of OCD onset. We saw no differences between groups in respect to initial OCD severity, although the OCD + tics group was more likely to suffer from OCD-related impairment. With respect to the profile of co-morbid symptoms, the OCD + tic group also had more severe autism spectrum symptoms, along with more frequent diagnoses of ADHD and social anxiety disorder. We also found that the OCD + tics group differed in terms of the presentation of OCD symptoms. No difference was found in the efficacy of OCD treatment between groups. As expected, a significant gender difference was found in the group of children and adolescents with OCD and comorbid tic symptoms, where 62.5% were male compared to 43.1% in the OCD-only group. The gender difference found here is even higher than that found in a recent study  [16] , which could in part have resulted from the use of different assessments to measure tic symptoms.\n\nIn line with our hypothesis, we found an age difference in the emergence of OCD between the group having OCD with tic symptoms and the OCD-only group. As measured with CY-BOCS we found no elevated OCD severity in the group having OCD with tic symptoms, in line with our hypothesis and with previous research in this age group  [15, 16] . On the other hand, though functional impairment as measured with COIS was considerable in both groups, contrary to our hypothesis we found the OCD + tic group to be significantly more impaired, indicating that tic symptoms may be a clinical indicator of reduced functioning. As this group also had higher co-morbidity of ADHD and social anxiety disorder, we cannot rule out that these comorbidities could be affecting the impairment level. In clinical samples, impairment has been found to correlate with the severity of OCD symptoms, but our results indicate that this relation is different for OCD subgroups with and without tic symptoms. One possible reason for this difference is that COIS is not good at differentiating between OCDrelated impairment and impairment caused by other factors, possibly including that caused by tics.\n\nWe found that OCD symptom presentation differed between groups, especially regarding compulsions, where the OCD + tic group scored higher for all compulsions except mental compulsions. Hoarding and symmetry obsessions were also more common in this group. Previous results are inconsistent regarding differences in OCD symptom presentation, but generally OCD patients with tic symptoms have lower rates of measured obsessions and  compulsions  [8, 16, 24, 25] , while we found this group to have generally higher rates, primarily in compulsions. The reason for these differences between previous work and our study is unclear, but it could be caused by differences in sample composition. Therefore, caution should be taken before concluding anything based on existing research about differences in OCD symptoms between these subgroups of OCD patients. One consistent pattern across this and previous studies, though, is that tic symptoms correlate with hoarding symptoms, higher rates of impairment, and an earlier age of OCD onset  [64] . Also, in agreement with previous research  [26, 27] , we found that OCD patients with tic symptoms more frequently report having \"not just right experiences\" than those without tic symptoms.\n\nAs for co-morbidity and consistent with the study by Lewin et al. 2010, we found that the OCD group with tic symptoms had significantly higher rates of ADHD than the OCD group without tic symptoms. This association was somewhat expected, as studies have indicated high co-morbidity between tics and ADHD and have suggested that tic disorder could mediate the co-morbidity between OCD and ADHD  [30] . However, a recent study based on SRI nonresponders did not confirm this relationship  [16] . Children and adolescents with OCD and symptoms of tics scored higher on all scales of the ASSQ, measuring subclinical autism spectrum traits, confirming earlier studies connecting autism spectrum traits with tics and ADHD  [31] . The fact that social anxiety disorder was more common in the OCD group with tic symptoms could be related to the finding that this group was more functionally impaired and/or had a higher load of ASD symptoms. Earlier studies, however, do not support these suggestions  [15, 16] .\n\nIn agreement with our hypothesis, we did not identify any difference in response to CBT treatment between groups. CBT seems to be just as effective for children with OCD and co-morbid tic symptoms as it is to those with OCD and no tic symptoms. This is in line with findings in other recent studies comparing treatment efficacy for these groups  [16, 38, 39, 41] . These consistent findings indicate that CBT is equally effective in addressing the OCD symptoms of both groups despite possible phenomenological, neurobiological and genetic differences. However, the possible differential mechanisms involved in the CBT process for the two groups are not clear. It has been suggested that tic-related OCD might require longer treatment sessions of exposure and response prevention due to the elevated \"just right\" compulsions  [37] . It might be that the CBT program in this study have provided adequate time and flexibility for clinicians to ensure individual adaptations to specific symptom profiles. Following this line of reasoning it is possible that different forms of CBT (e.g., shorter duration of sessions, etc.) would result in different outcome of the two groups. Also, methodological limitations regarding a reliable distinction between complex motor tics and compulsions resulting in poorly defined groups, could possibly mask any true difference in treatment outcome.\n\nThe primary strength of this study is the large sample used, along with the comprehensive assessment of OCD symptoms and co-morbid symptoms. Another strength is that the sample received no treatment for OCD for at least six months prior to treatment start as well as CBT is not mediated by other forms of treatment. A limitation to this study is that the dataset used is limited to the summary statistics of the DSM-IV diagnoses included in KSADS, with no distinction between motor and vocal tics. This as well as problems of power do not allow us to examine any differences in co-morbidity and CBT outcome based on the nature of the tic disorders. Another limitation of this study is the homogeneity of the Scandinavian sample, which could limit its generalizability. Furthermore, a limitation is that we used K-SADS to assess tic symptoms, which provides less detailed information than the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).\n\nIn conclusion, children and adolescents with OCD and co-morbid tic symptoms differ from those with OCD and no symptoms of tics in several aspects of clinical presentation but not with respect to response to CBT or to OCD severity. The high rates of co-morbidity with ADHD and higher frequency of autism spectrum traits in this group are especially noteworthy for clinicians, who need to be aware of the greater functional impairment seen in this group even though the group showed no differences in OCD symptom severity."
