  "title": "Natural language processing to evaluate texting conversations between patients and healthcare providers during COVID-19 Home-Based Care in Rwanda at scale",
  "abstract": "Community isolation of patients with communicable infectious diseases limits spread of pathogens but our understanding of isolated patients' needs and challenges is incomplete. Rwanda deployed a digital health service nationally to assist public health clinicians to remotely monitor and support SARS-CoV-2 cases via their mobile phones using daily interactive short message service (SMS) check-ins. We aimed to assess the texting patterns and communicated topics to better understand patient experiences. We extracted data on all COVID-19 cases and exposed contacts who were enrolled in the WelTel text messaging program between March 18, 2020, and March 31, 2022, and linked demographic and clinical data from the national COVID-19 registry. A sample of the text conversation corpus was English-translated and labeled with topics of interest defined by medical experts. Multiple natural language processing (NLP) topic classification models were trained and compared using F1 scores. Best performing models were applied to classify unlabeled conversations. Total 33,081 isolated patients (mean age 33\ufffd9, range 0-100), 44% female, including 30,398 cases and 2,683 contacts) were registered in WelTel. Registered patients generated 12,119 interactive text conversations in Kinyarwanda (n = 8,183, 67%), English (n = 3,069, 25%) and other languages. Sufficiently trained large language models (LLMs) were unavailable for Kinyarwanda. Traditional machine learning (ML) models outperformed fine-tuned transformer architecture language models on the native untranslated language corpus, however, the reverse was observed of models trained on English-only data. The most frequently identified topics discussed included symptoms (69%), diagnostics (38%), social issues (19%),",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The practice of isolating patients with communicable infectious diseases reduces transmission by separating infected individuals from healthy ones, and isolation at home allows healthcare systems to focus on managing severe cases in hospitals  [1] . However, isolated patients may have changes to their condition that require attention from medical professionals and can experience additional social stressors  [2] . Isolation protocols have even been considered a risk factor for mortality  [3] . Understanding the complexity of facility and home-based isolation remains a critical consideration in effective pandemic response planning.\n\nAt the pandemic outset, the Rwanda government COVID-19 Joint Task Force adopted a short message service (SMS)-based digital health service, WelTel, to remotely monitor and support community isolated cases and contacts of SARS-CoV-2 from the centralized national command post. Its use continued throughout the emergency phase of the pandemic as the key to their Home-Based Care (HBC) program  [4] . The WelTel platform was selected based on its history of use in HIV programs, prior clinic evidence, and importantly, its accessibility  [5] [6] [7] . Internet based tools and smartphone apps would have been insufficient since, as a lower-middle income country (LMIC), only 23% of the Rwanda population has internet-access; yet at least 90% of the population has access to cellular phones  [8, 9] . As in other applications of the WelTel platform, throughout the COVID-19 response in Rwanda, automated 'check-in' messages were sent daily to isolated patients, to which they could respond to report on their status and ask questions, presenting a novel data source for evaluating their needs and experiences. A manually performed topic classification of WelTel text messaging conversations with patients during HIV care previously demonstrated that these open-ended text messaging conversations contain wide ranging issues experienced by patients that could be acted upon. There is limited data on the challenges facing patients being monitored in an acute rapidly spreading pandemic such as the case with the recent COVID-19 pandemic  [10] .\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) enables rapid computational topic analysis (classification and modelling) which can delineate large amounts of text into topics of interest  [11] . For example, topic classification models using machine-learning (ML) have been used in clinical settings to label text messages exchanged between healthcare providers and outpatients  [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, such studies have often focused on a narrow list of topics or have been limited to demonstration projects or a single healthcare organization setting. Furthermore, there is an imbalance in healthcare data used to train and develop NLP models that threatens to leave entire continents behind in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare  [16] .\n\nIn this study, we aimed to analyze the complete corpus of SMS conversations between Rwanda's public health clinicians and isolated COVID-19 patients and contacts during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic to get a better understanding of the experiences and needs of COVID-19 cases and contacts under community isolation. We considered a clinical, social, and logistical perspective using topic classification to better delineate the needs and experiences of patients and the advice they were given, during isolation-a large-scale approach that could be used to guide decision-making in future outbreak responses."

      "text": "Rwanda, a Central African nation with a population of 14 million, was internationally recognized for its prompt response to the COVID-19 pandemic  [17] . Their public health command implemented the WelTel text messaging service [ www.weltelhealth.com ] on March 18, 2020, coincident with detecting its first COVID-19 cases. This tool enabled public health staff to remotely monitor and support individuals who tested positive for, or were at high risk of contracting, SARS-CoV-2, and remained operational until the public health emergency was officially declared over.\n\nThe WelTel platform is a secure web-based application that healthcare providers can access from any internet-connected device. It interfaces with cellular networks enabling it to send both pre-set and manually input SMS messages to registered mobile phone users. It features a conversation dashboard that visualizes responses.\n\nFollowing the initial facility-based quarantine of COVID-19 cases identified at border entry points, Rwanda launched its HBC program when community transmission became widespread. Under this program, mild cases and contacts were asked to stay home and be remotely monitored. Patients with significantly worsening clinical status were triaged to hospitals. Individuals were enrolled as 'cases' if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or as 'contacts' if they were deemed high risk due to exposure. Patients without personal cell phone numbers were registered via a household member, friend, or neighbor.\n\nThe messaging protocol for COVID-19 monitoring involved sending bulk automated daily 'check-in' texts in Rwanda's principal languages (Kinyarwanda, English, French) daily to registered patients throughout their isolation period. Patients could respond via text in their own words to indicate their status and/or ask questions. Replies indicating a problem or question were flagged for follow-up. Public health clinicians responded to flagged messages to provide information or advice, forming interactive text conversations. DHIS2-based COVID-19 testing registry to obtain missing demographic or clinical data  [18] . Personal identifiers were removed. For the purposes of our study, a 'conversation' was defined as a text exchange consisting of at least one 'incoming' patient message containing three or more words (filtering out minimal replies e.g., 'doing well'), together with at least one 'outgoing' public health clinician or automated system message (thus being interactive). Patient registration and numbers of conversations and their characteristics (# messages, language used) were quantified. Conversation usage was compared across patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, province of residence, pandemic wave, and COVID-19 status (case vs. contact)) using a multivariable logistic regression model. Odds ratios (OR) are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p<0\ufffd05 was considered significant. Example conversations were selected to illustrate context."

This list was an expansion of a previously published list focused on clinical care and used to develop a conversation analysis and visualization tool, ConVIScope  [12] . The final list of topics and subtopics encompassed perspectives on public health, emergency response, and clinical care. Topic definitions are provided in (S1 Fig).\n\nFor the purpose of labeling a training dataset for topic classification models, a continuous sample of 2,791 text conversations from March 18, 2020, to May 31, 2021, was extracted from the study period corpus during the initial phases of the pandemic in order to start translation to English and begin the labeling process while the pandemic was ongoing and data continued to accrue. These conversations were analyzed for language use with Google's CLD2 language detector. Non-English sample messages were translated into English by a compensated professional healthcare text translator proficient in Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Kiswahili.\n\nThe English-translated conversations were labeled by at least three trained members of the research team using a custom conversation annotation tool. Any conflicts in labeling were resolved by an external team member. The topic labels were then applied back to the corresponding conversations in their original language, where applicable."

Training set sample size constraints limited our classification experiments to topics with \ufffd100 occurrences. We employed the binary relevance strategy, which simplifies performance management by building a separate binary classifier for each topic. We experimented with both traditional ML algorithms and Transformer-based language models for each topic. We explored large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), however, our literature review revealed that, of the three pre-trained with any Kinyarwanda, the pre-training datasets for these models contained minimal Kinyarwanda text (\ufffd0.01%). Investigations of the performance of these LLMs at NLP tasks in Kinyarwanda suggested they were insufficient to include  [19] .\n\nTraditional-ML classification models: For training traditional ML models, we explored five feature sets: binary and non-binary bag of words, TF-IDF (term-frequency inverse document frequency), and character n-gram (with/without TF-IDF). The character n-gram features were tried because Kinyarwanda is an agglutinative language. All combinations of one of these feature sets, and one classification algorithm, were tested. We evaluated logistic regression, ridge classifier, and random forest as classification algorithms. Hyperparameters for each classifier were tuned using random search in five-fold cross validation  [20] ."

Additionally, we incorporated dropout layers (with a probability of 0.0 for the first layer and 0.3 for subsequent layers) for regularization.\n\nWe compared the performance of each model for each topic using the validation set F1-score, with a minimum F1-score cut-off of 0.7. The highest F1-score models were applied to predict topics for the remaining 9,328 unlabeled, untranslated SMS conversations.\n\nAdditional Language experiments: Since our corpus contained a mix of high-and lowresource languages (e.g., English, French, Kinyarwanda) we explored how this might affect performance of the models by conducting identical experiments to above using only the English-translated version of the training corpus.

The numbers of patients registered, and the occurrence of text-message conversations (with at least 3 interactive messages), appeared in waves similar to the COVID-19 incidence reported in the national registry (Fig  1 ). Of those registered, 6,021 patients (18%) used the texting service to generate 12,119 conversations (Table  1 ). Controlled for other demographic and clinical factors, the odds of generating a conversation among females compared to males was 0\ufffd83 (95%CI: 0\ufffd78-0\ufffd89; p<0\ufffd001). Age did not significantly influence the frequency of conversations (OR per year increase in age = 1\ufffd00, 95%CI: 0\ufffd99-1\ufffd00, p = 0\ufffd17). Contacts were more likely to generate conversations than cases (OR 1\ufffd83 95%CI: 1\ufffd63-2\ufffd06, p<0\ufffd001). The proportion registered patients texting conversations varied across waves of the pandemic (Wave one: 12%; two: 37%; three: 25%; and four: 3%).\n\nThe median number of conversations per patient was one (IQR: 1-2, range: 1-18), and the median conversation length (# of discrete text messages) was three (IQR: 2-5, range: 2-44). Most conversations occurred in Kinyarwanda (8,183, 67%) or English (3,069, 25%), however other regional languages (French, Kiswahili, Ganda, Chewa/Nyanja) were also identified (<10%).

Overall, medical topics were discussed more frequently than non-medical topics. The most frequent topic was symptoms (69%), the majority reporting a lack of symptoms (59%). Diagnostic methods (38%, e.g., receiving COVID-19 test results), prevention (18%, including non-pharmaceutical such as how to maintain isolation, and pharmaceutical such as vaccines), healthcare logistics (16%, e.g., asking where to get tested), and treatment (8%, including management of symptoms).

The data underscores the need for holistic support systems for patient isolation programs. Additionally, while our topic classification approach rapidly quantified prevalent topics well, reflecting their relative importance to patients, it also enables the sorting of large datasets into smaller categories for easier manual evaluation by decision-makers. Topics such as food insecurity, even if less common than topics such as reporting symptoms, may still provide actionable targets for public health responders, especially if it can be localized to communities. NLP techniques are rapidly being introduced into health systems to understand unstructured data from large datasets, such as clinical notes in electronic medical records (EMRs), social media posts, or free-text survey responses  [11] . For example, topic classification has been employed to sort unstructured patient feedback from text messages  [15] . Still, manual qualitative analyses dominate. A manually labeled thematic analysis of 1,454 patient portal secure messaging conversations between cancer patients and health professionals in the US during COVID-19 found 26% of conversations were related to COVID-19 and identified topics related to changes in care plans, symptoms, risks, precautions and symptoms  [28] . In Northern Thailand manual topic classification of SMS exchanges with 213 home-isolated patients with diagnosed COVID-19 revealed several complexities of care including discussing"

Manual labeling is resource intensive and generally limited to smaller data sets. One US-based study used NLP techniques to determine if patient-initiated secure messaging via a EMR portal was associated with positive testing, but this was a simple binary classification  [13] . To our knowledge, our study is the first to use NLP techniques to classify patient clinician texts into broad medical, social and logistical topics set by experts, and at a national scale.\n\nOur study compared performance of several ML model approaches. Traditional ML models and transformer-based language models were both effective in classifying text message conversations into the predefined topics. While traditional ML models performed better with untranslated conversations, transformer models had superior performance when trained on English (translated) data, highlighting their limited performance on African languages  [30] . This observation is consistent with the knowledge that transformer architecture language models are likely to underperform on NLP tasks in low-resource languages until sufficient high-quality pre-training data is sourced and leveraged  [31] . Similarly, LLMs, which are also based on transformer architecture, currently contain too little, if any, training on Kinyarwanda and other low-resource languages to be useful in our context  [19] . A brief trial using Google Translate to machine translate Kinyarwanda text into English for our study was inaccurate. This highlights the importance of considering language-specific model performance when analyzing multilingual text data  [32] . Language consideration remains a significant challenge, with over 4,000 written languages worldwide. Pandemics affect everyone and AI tools must account low-resource languages to be equitable.

First, the supervised learning approach required the pre-definition and manual labeling of topics of interest which can be human resource intensive. Furthermore, the training data sample was collected from the initial phases of the pandemic, yet topics of interest or training samples annotated may evolve over time or change in different settings requiring continuously updating training datasets. For example, prevalent discussions of vaccines came later in the pandemic after most of our training data had been annotated. Including unsupervised ML models that discover topics as they emerge could help overcome this bias but have their own flaws. Furthermore, while our dataset was similar in size to those used to train other topic classification models in healthcare, many subtopics of interest were not prevalent enough to develop models. Additionally, the training dataset was translated into English for labelling purposes which could result in nuances of meaning being lost in translation. A professional translator fluent in the languages utilized and knowledgeable in public health was used and the topics of interest were fairly broad, making it less likely that such topics would be missed by slight interpretation variance of translations. The interpretation of the classified data in our study was done manually. However, if using AI to make interpretations or recommendations should continue to be done with caution and requires verification steps. Finally, training the models took time and conducting the NLP analyses afterwards meant the data was not available to decision-makers in real time. Ideally, once models are trained and validated, they could be applied and even updated using active machine learning while an outbreak or pandemic is occurring. Applying these models could then provide insights into patient and population issues that could be responded to while they are occurring and most relevant. Together with location data, this type of analysis could contribute to precision public health responses."
