      "text": "ecent reviews have focused on the effectiveness of health behavior change interventions delivered via telephone  [1] [2] [3] [4]  and the Internet.  [5] [6] 6] [7]  Researchers have suggested exploring other interactive delivery channels, such as mobile telephone short-message service (SMS),  8 -12  but no systematic reviews have been reported to date. The aim of this paper is to review the preliminary evidence of health behavior change interventions delivered via SMS texting.\n\nMobile telephones and SMS are becoming integrated into virtually all aspects of society.  [13] [14] 4] [15] [16]  In the U.S. in 2007, approximately 7,000,000,000 SMS messages were sent every month.  17 In developed countries, use of SMS pervades all age groups,  9, 15, 18, 19  cultures,  16  and socio-economic backgrounds.  9, 15 This service allows for instantaneous delivery of short messages (maximum 160 characters) directly to individuals at any time, place, or setting. These messages are asynchronous, meaning they can be accessed at a time that suits an individual. Customized SMS messages can be tailored to individuals, which is important given that personally tailored messages are more effective for health behavior change than untailored messages.  20 -24 This medium also allows for seamless (and quantifiable) interaction between the participant and the interventionist, so that participant engagement with the intervention can be monitored and compared to exposure. Communication with SMS may also be more cost effective than other telephone or print-based interventions.  19, 25 he potential of SMS may be particularly significant among population groups most likely to use mobile telephones as their primary means of communication. The highest level of mobile telephone use is among adolescents, younger adults, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, less educated young adults, and people who rent or frequently change addresses.  26 -28 urther, a high level of mobile telephone use is associated with lower levels of self-rated health,  28  higher BMI,  29  and engaging in health-compromising behaviors.  30 Therefore, SMS presents a prime delivery channel for health behavior change interventions because it has high penetration in populations of lower sociodemographic position and populations with poorer health.\n\nThe application of SMS for behavioral intervention is new. However, there are established research agendas for using SMS to remind patients of scheduled medical appointments,  [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  coordinate medical staff,  25  deliver medical test results,  36 -38  and monitor patient side effects following treatment.  39 This review analyzes the application of SMS for delivering health behavior change interventions to establish what can be learned from research conducted to date and make recommendations for future research."

      "text": "An electronic database search of MEDLINE, PubMed, ERIC, Web of Science, and PsycINFO was conducted for studies published between January 1990 and March 2008. The search terms included: mobile telephone or cell phone, SMS or text message, health, health intervention, and behavior. The search was limited to English. For inclusion in the review, studies had to evaluate an intervention delivered primarily via SMS to change a health behavior in any population group and have at least a pre-post design, but they were not required to have a control group. Because SMS research is in its early stages and because of the commercial nature of the medium, a number of studies have been published in so-called gray literature, such as magazines, newspapers, commercially funded reports, and editorial columns.  19, 40, 41 This review was limited to critically appraising studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nEligible articles were independently reviewed; any disagreements in review outcomes were discussed until consensus was reached among the three authors. During the independent review process, the following information was extracted from the eligible articles and tabulated: study design, research setting, sample size, participant recruitment process, participant retention rate throughout trial, main outcome, measurement method of main outcome, validity and reliability of measure, duration of intervention, how SMS dialogue was initiated, level of SMS interactivity between participant and researcher, dose of SMS messages received by participant, additional intervention methods, impact evaluation of main outcome, and process evaluation of SMS intervention. This list of study characteristics was based on the requirements of the Quality of Reporting of Meta-Analyses (QUOROM) statement.  42 ach study was rated on the level of SMS interactivity between researcher and participant. These ratings ranged from nil to high and were based on the number of weekly/monthly SMS messages each participant was prescribed to send to researchers. The interactivity ratings were nil (no opportunity for participants to use SMS with researchers); low (\u03fdmonthly SMS interaction); moderate (\u03fdweekly but \u0546monthly SMS interaction); or high (\u0546weekly SMS interaction). Intervention outcomes were assessed as having a positive or neutral impact on behavioral outcomes, and where there was an impact, the study design (between groups or within group) and significance of effects were also assessed. To be able to compare outcomes across studies, effect sizes were calculated for studies that had a control group and reported sufficient data. Effect sizes were calculated based on Cohen's formula  43  and were interpreted according to Cohen's guidelines of \u03fd0.2 for a small effect size, 0.5 for a medium effect size, and \u03fe0.8 for a large effect size.\n\nThirty-three studies  44 -76  used SMS as a delivery channel for health behavior change interventions, and 14  [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76]  met the inclusion criteria for this review (Table  1 ). Reasons for exclusion included lack of pre-post study design,  44 -57  SMS being used as an adjunct but not as the main method of intervention delivery,  58 -60  and publication in languages other than English.  61, 62 Numerous studies reported the development of SMS programs to change health behaviors.  44,48,50 -55 The large number of developmental studies published in the past year indicates that research into behavior change via SMS is increasing in volume. Of the14 studies reviewed, four used SMS for preventive health behavior change (e.g., smoking cessation)  [63] [64] [65] [66]  and ten used SMS to support ongoing clinical care behavior change (e.g., diabetes self-management).

However, both of these studies reported stronger findings for a subgroup of participants who either were more actively engaged in the SMS intervention  67  or received a more intensive complimentary treatment.  69 When effect sizes were calculated for these subgroups, both had effect sizes classified as medium (0.59  67  and 0.56  69  ).\n\nProcess outcomes were poorly evaluated in most studies. Participant retention ranged from 43% to 100% (Table  1 ). There was great variability in participant compliance and acceptance of SMS programs across studies. One study reported that participants wanted to continue the SMS program after the trial had been completed.  69"

      "text": "Mode of intervention initiation varied among studies. Twelve programs  [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76]  were initiated by a face-to-face meeting with a health professional; the others used SMS to initiate the program and gain participant consent,  63  or an interactive website.  64 There were also differences in the initiation of SMS dialogue. In seven studies,  [63] [64] [65] [66] 69, 72, 74  the researchers initiated the SMS dialogue and participants were able to respond (researcher-initiated technique). In the o her seven studies,  67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 75, 76  participants initiated the SMS dialogue and then the researchers responded (participant-initiated technique). There were no clear differences in intervention outcomes based on SMS dialogue initiation. However, all the preventive health behavior studies used researcher-initiated techniques, and most of the tertiarylevel interventions used participant-initiated techniques.\n\nThe frequency of SMS transmission reflected the expected frequency of the targeted behavior (e.g., smoking [5/day], physical activity [5/week]) for all but three studies.  66, 72, 74 Most of the interventions provided personally tailored SMS, except two studies  66, 74  that used bulk, untailored SMS. Tailoring variables included participant's name or nickname, nominated support person's name, age, gender, behavioral history, behavioral preferences, behavioral goals, behavioral barriers, previous SMS responses, and medical status. The two studies  66, 74  that used untailored SMS were in the top three for highest participant attrition.\n\nSome studies supplemented SMS-delivered components with other intervention strategies or materials, such as interactive websites, 64,65,68,71,72 a paper diary to record symptoms,  70, 73  consultation sessions with health professionals,  66, 68, 69, 73  or printed materials.  66, 74 Evaluation and reporting of the uptake and behavioral outcomes of these separate intervention strategies were poor.\n\nMost studies allowed moderate to high SMS interaction between participants and researchers. One study  74  had no SMS interaction with participants. However, it is difficult to compare interaction levels across studies because some interventions offered other channels of interaction (e.g., websites or clinical visits)."

      "text": "This review draws together the preliminary evidence of delivering health behavior change interventions via SMS. Most studies conducted to date have focused on clinical care interventions, using SMS as a reminder to increase adherence to treatment programs among sick individuals. Fewer studies have focused on promoting preventive health behaviors to healthy individuals through SMS. Of the 14 SMS reviewed interventions, 13 demonstrated positive behavior changes, although some studies were too statistically underpowered to show significant results.\n\nIt is important at this early stage of research to acknowledge the limited number of high-quality SMS intervention studies. The broad range of study designs used and the varying use of specific SMS characteristics in interventions limit the conclusions that can be drawn from this review but at the same time highlight the importance of improving the quality and rigor of future research in this area.\n\nFuture studies should use adequate sample sizes to provide sufficient statistical power for detecting hypothesized effects and should explicitly report the calculations performed to estimate power. Although it is recognized that some of the reviewed studies were pilot tests or feasibility studies, positive effects need to be rigorously evaluated in larger follow-up trials that test the efficacy of the intervention in more-representative samples. Assessment of the maintenance of behavioral effects after the intervention period is another important focus for future research. Future studies should also report on process measures associated with intervention delivery, such as number of sent SMS messages, number of SMS replies, how participants treated received SMS messages, and how stored SMS messages are treated. In some reviewed studies, it was also difficult to determine the relative impact of the SMS strategy because it was evaluated as an adjunct rather than as a comprehensive strategy. Future research should explore SMS as a primary means of intervention and report on appropriate process outcomes.\n\nA strength of the current research is the use of objective and validated measures. This is important to ensure that the behavioral outcomes of SMS-delivered interventions are accurately assessed, and this should be maintained in future research. A major evaluation problem in the current literature is the lack of assessment of intervention effects on targeted behaviors. Most clinical care studies failed to measure the behaviors targeted in the intervention, even though these outcomes are more proximal to intervention exposure than health outcomes. This has serious consequences as it prevents assessment of the intervention effects on the targeted behaviors that are hypothesized to cause subsequent health benefits.\n\nFuture studies should explicitly describe the theoretical constructs being targeted in interventions. This will assist further testing and development of behavior change theory as it applies to this new medium. The lack of theory-based interventions in this review may reflect the current focus of SMS interventions on clinical care rather than on preventive health behavior change.\n\nAnother area for future research is the variations in the use of specific SMS characteristics across interventions. Characteristics of SMS of interest in the current literature include mode of intervention initiation, initiation of SMS dialogue, tailoring of SMS content, and the opportunity for SMS interaction between participants and researchers. Because this research field is in the early stages of development and because of the study designs used, it is difficult to determine the impacts that these specific SMS characteristics may have on behavioral outcomes. However, it is important to acknowledge that these issues are specific to SMS interventions, and if this field of research is to progress, the importance of these SMS characteristics needs to be explored further.\n\nIntervention initiation methods differed between clinical care interventions and preventive health behavior interventions. Clinical care interventions involve patients already engaged in the health system because of illness or disease and thus focus on better managing their treatment. As such, clinical care interventions are often initiated face-to-face because patients are consulting with health professionals. In contrast, preventive health behavior interventions require delivery channels that can reach mass populations of healthy individuals who may not be engaged with health professionals. Two of the preventive health behavior studies in this review demonstrated methods of intervention initiation that could be feasible for population-wide dissemination-a registration website  64  and registration SMS.  63 In both cases, these initiation methods provided sufficient communication to allow for informed participant consent, personal information for tailoring SMS, and instructions for how to use the program.\n\nInitiation of the SMS dialogue also differed between clinical care and preventive health behavior interventions. All the preventive health behavior interventions in this review used researcher-initiated SMS dialogue, whereas the majority of the clinical care interventions used participant-initiated techniques. Participants in preventive health behavior interventions may not be motivated to initiate dialogue because they are healthy, unlike participants in need of clinical care intervention who are accustomed to regularly reporting to health professionals about their health status. Initiation methods may play an important role in participants' perceptions of personal invasion and behavioral control, which may affect behavioral outcomes. Therefore, the SMS initiation method may be an important intervention element to explore further in terms of relative behavior change outcomes.\n\nIt is well established that tailored health messages are more engaging and effective at changing behavior than untailored, bulk messages.  [21] [22] 2] [23] [24]  All but two studies in this review used tailored SMS. The two studies  66, 74  using untailored SMS targeted a wide range of behavioral changes (e.g., physical activity, nutrition, medication compliance, smoking, alcohol consumption) and were among the studies with the highest participant attrition. This finding may support the notion that untailored health messages are less engaging for participants. Because participant engagement and retention are critical factors in successful behavior change research, it is important to further investigate the impact of tailoring content in SMS research.\n\nInteractivity and responsiveness to participants' needs, a potential feature of SMS-delivered interventions, may improve the outcomes of behavior change interventions.  11 One reviewed study  74  did not allow interaction with participants, and that study had poor participant retention, which may have been associated with poor participant engagement. Interactivity of interventions was poorly reported and was often difficult to quantify because of the potential influence of other forms of interaction with participants (e.g., websites). The effect of interactivity of SMS-delivered interventions needs to be explored further to determine the optimal level of interaction for successful behavior change.\n\nAlthough first-generation studies have demonstrated the potential of delivering health behavior change interventions via SMS, there is still much to be learned about optimizing and enhancing this intervention channel. Research on the effects of specific SMS characteristics is now required to better understand the potential of this new medium. Consideration of the methodologic issues highlighted in this review is needed to improve the quality of research in this field. These issues need to be considered promptly to allow scientific knowledge to develop at a pace in keeping with the rapid advancement of SMS technologic capabilities and reach."
