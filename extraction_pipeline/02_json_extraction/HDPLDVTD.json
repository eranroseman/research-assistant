With respect to sustained abstinence rates, redeemable deposits and rewards were superior to free cessation aids (P<0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively, with significance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons). Redeemable deposits were superior to free e-cigarettes (P = 0.008). Free e-cigarettes were not superior to usual care (P = 0.20) or to free cessation aids (P = 0.43). Among the 1191 employees (19.8%) who actively participated in the trial (the \"engaged\" cohort), sustained abstinence rates were four to six times as high as those among participants who did not actively engage in the trial, with similar relative effectiveness."

      "text": "A Pr agmatic Trial of Smoking Cessation M ost large U.S. companies offer smoking-cessation programs for their employees, and nearly half of those companies offer financial incentives for employees who successfully stop smoking.  1  These benefit designs are motivated by evidence that smoking remains the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the United States  2, 3  and that employees who smoke cost the companies several thousand dollars more per year than nonsmokers.  4 However, the benefits offered by workplace smoking-cessation programs vary considerably, and there is limited evidence regarding the absolute or comparative effectiveness of these programs.\n\nTwo previous randomized, controlled trials involving employees who were interested in quitting smoking -one that included 878 employees of General Electric 5 and one that included 2538 employees of CVS  6  -showed that financialincentive programs of approximately $800 tripled the rates of abstinence through 6 months as compared with approaches that offered only free access to behavioral-modification programs and informational resources. However, some key questions remained unanswered: How successful would workplace smoking-cessation programs be among all people to whom they were offered (rather than only among smokers who were interested in quitting, as tested in previous trials)? How effective would incentives be when added to free nicotine-replacement therapy and pharmacotherapy (i.e., bupropion or varenicline)? And how effective would free electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or free conventional cessation aids be when added to provision of information on smoking cessation and access to motivational text-messaging programs?\n\nA fourth unanswered question was raised by the CVS trial, in which an $800 reward was compared with an $800 \"deposit contract,\" in which participants deposited $150 that was matched with $650, such that up to $800 was forfeited if the participant did not stop smoking.  6 Among smokers who would have accepted either the reward or deposit contract, the deposit program was more than twice as efficacious as the reward program, probably because it leverages loss aversion.  7, 8 However, because only 13.7% of the participants who were offered deposit contracts chose to participate, the overall effectiveness of this approach was lower than that with standard financial rewards. Might deposit contracts that are funded in advance without participant contributions, but from which money is removed if abstinence milestones are not met, achieve higher engagement and smoking-cessation rates by leveraging loss aversion among a broader pool of participants?  6 We conducted the current trial to address these four key questions."

The trial was designed to be highly pragmatic on the basis of PRECIS-2 criteria.  9 The protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pennsylvania. The first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript and vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. NJOY provided the e-cigarettes (including battery sticks, USB charger, and the full range of flavor chambers) at no cost but had no role in the design or conduct of the trial, the analysis of the data, the writing or review of the manuscript, or the decision to submit it for publication."

Enrollment proceeded in two phases, which differed slightly in the way participants were informed about the trial (Fig.  S1  in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). In the first phase, 2229 eligible participants from 9 companies were identified in October 2014. In the second phase, 3902 eligible participants from 45 companies were identified in November 2015. The second phase was launched because the target sample size was not met in the first phase.\n\nBefore enrollment, potential participants were contacted by email on at least four occasions to disclose that they had been selected for trial participation, to provide them with information on how to opt out (Fig.  S1  in the Supplementary Appendix), and to guide them through enrollment through the Way to Health Web-based research portal.  6, 10, 11 If participants did not opt out by notifying trial staff before the enrollment date, they were enrolled (a design known as \"opt-out consent\") and were randomly assigned to an intervention or to usual care (Fig.  1 ). Participants were then sent brief descriptions of their assigned intervention and were encouraged to sign into the Web portal to learn more about their smoking-cessation intervention, their assigned quit date, the processes for submitting urine and blood samples and receiving compensation for submission of those samples, and, when applicable, the processes for ordering cessation aids and receiving incentives for smoking abstinence."

Randomization probabilities were unbalanced to achieve the best possible power to test the eight betweengroup contrasts of primary interest (see below). At the time of randomization, all participants were notified of usual-care resources that they could access through the wellness websites for their companies, including information regard-ing the health benefits of smoking cessation, strategies to promote cessation, and the opportunity to register for the SmokeFreeTXT program of the National Cancer Institute, a free textmessaging program that gives encouragement, advice, and tips for stopping smoking. All materials were in English.\n\nParticipants in the intervention groups were also notified that they were being offered one of four additional programs: free cessation aids, which included all forms of nicotine-replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline, and -for participants who reported lack of success with initial standard therapy -free NJOY e-cigarettes (including battery sticks, a USB charger, and up to 20 chambers with 1.0 to 1.5% nicotine per week in participants' chosen flavors); free e-cigarettes without the requirement that standard therapies had first been tried; a reward incentive worth $600 for sustained smoking abstinence, plus all options in the free cessation aids group; or a deposit account worth $600, redeemable by participants who become abstinent, plus all free cessation aids. In relevant groups, e-cigarettes and nicotine-replacement therapy (patches, gum, and lozenges) could be ordered directly through the trial website at no cost.

If participants did not report abstinence, they were not instructed to submit samples for biochemical confirmation. Because the definition of the primary outcome was biochemically confirmed sustained abstinence, participants who did not submit samples were coded as not having met the primary outcome.  5, 6 Secondary outcomes included the point prevalence for quitting at 1 month and sustained abstinence rates at 3 months and 12 months (i.e., 6 months after the end of the assigned intervention). Participants were compensated for submitting urine and blood samples as shown in Table  S1  in the Supplementary Appendix."

Because many employers offer cessation aids as part of their benefit designs, we designated the free cessation aids group as the primary comparator against which each of the other four groups was to be compared. We determined a priori that four other between-group contrasts were important; this yielded eight total contrasts (see below). We estimated that enrollment of 6000 participants would provide 80% power to detect an increase of at least 5 percentage points above an assumed abstinence rate of 2.5% in the free cessation aids group. This calculation was based on our prespecified plan to use the Holm method to handle multiple comparisons by sequentially testing the significance of each contrast against progressively less restrictive alpha levels, maintaining the family-wise type I error rate.  18 rimary analyses were conducted with the intention-to-treat approach such that all participants who underwent randomization were included. We also conducted secondary analyses among the \"engaged\" cohort, which was defined as all participants in the intention-to-treat population who accessed the trial website at least once."

This rate is consistent with previous trials of workplace incentive programs that showed cessation rates of 15 to 16% among smokers who enrolled with an opt-in approach.  5, 6 he second major finding of this trial was that among smokers who had access to informa-tion about smoking cessation and the opportunity to sign up for motivational text messages, neither the additional offer of free e-cigarettes nor the additional offer of free first-line cessation aids (plus e-cigarettes if those failed) significantly improved rates of smoking abstinence. The lack of effectiveness of free cessation aids is important, because this practice is a cornerstone of many employers' wellness programs.  21, 22 his trial also provided large-scale, randomized evidence that the offer of free e-cigarettes does not result in higher rates of sustained abstinence than traditional smoking-cessation aids and does not increase abstinence rates among smokers who are also offered information and\n\nComparator Groups Adjusted Difference Raw P Value \u2020 Holm Threshold \u2021 Adjusted P Value \u00a7 Intention-to-treat population \u00b6 Redeemable deposit vs. free cessation aids 2.4\u00b10.5 0.000009 0.00625 <0.001 Rewards vs. free cessation aids 1.5\u00b10.4 0.0008 0.0071 0.006 Redeemable deposit vs. free e-cigarettes 1.9\u00b10.6 0.0013 0.0083 0.008 Free e-cigarettes vs. usual care 0.9\u00b10.3 0.040 0.01 0.20 Rewards vs. free e-cigarettes 1.0\u00b10.5 0.048 0.0125 0.20 Free e-cigarettes vs. free cessation aids 0.5\u00b10.3 0.144 0.0167 0.43 Redeemable deposit vs. rewards 0.9\u00b10.6 0.158 0.025 0.43 Free cessation aids vs. usual care 0.4\u00b10.2 0.165 0.05 0.43 Engaged cohort\u2016 Redeemable deposit vs. free cessation aids 9.8\u00b12.3 0.00009 0.00625 <0.001 Redeemable deposit vs. free e-cigarettes 8.0\u00b12.4 0.0019 0.0071 0.01 Rewards vs. free cessation aids 6.5\u00b12.1 0.0029 0.0083 0.02 Rewards vs. free e-cigarettes 4.7\u00b12.3 0.043 0.01 0.21 Free e-cigarettes vs. usual care 4.0\u00b11.5 0.067 0.0125 0.27 Free cessation aids vs. usual care 2.2\u00b11.3 0.184 0.0167 0.55 Redeemable deposit vs. rewards 3.3\u00b12.7 0.232 0.025 0.55 Free e-cigarettes vs. free cessation aids 1.8\u00b11.7 0.279 0.05 0.55 * Plus-minus values are percentage points \u00b1SE.\n\n\u2020 The reported P values were estimated with the use of contrasts from a single logistic-regression model adjusted for trial phase (1 or 2).

This pragmatic trial, which provided free e-cigarettes or any free cessation aids, did not assess the efficacy of the actual use (as compared with the offer) of these products. However, a study of efficacy would have to ensure that all participants in each group used those products, and would therefore not reflect real-world conditions. The current trial also did not assess the possibility that offering free e-cigarettes may reduce the harms associated with conventional smoking.  23 However, a recent expert report suggested that e-cigarettes would reduce short-term adverse health effects only if they led to complete cessation of the use of combustible cigarettes.  24 hird, this trial showed that financial incentives promoted smoking cessation even when free pharmacologic cessation aids and nicotinereplacement therapies were routinely available. These results, considered alongside those from previous trials,  5, 6  suggest that incentives at least triple cessation rates regardless of whether free cessation aids are offered concomitantly.\n\nFinally, we found that redeemable deposit contracts were not significantly more effective than actuarially equivalent incentive programs structured as pure rewards. This result did not confirm our hypothesis that deposit accounts, in which incentives that have already been granted would be lost if participants continued smoking, would be more effective than an intervention in which the same incentive was portrayed as a pure gain. Nonetheless, the observation that framing the incentives as already earned and at risk of being lost (loss framing) produced nominally higher rates of quitting at nominally lower costs per quit may motivate employers who are planning incentive programs to consider the use of loss framing.\n\nThese findings should be interpreted in the context of the limitations of the trial. First, because of the pragmatic recruitment strategy in which opt-out consent was used across 54 different companies, our characterization of the demographic and smoking-related characteristics of the participants who underwent randomization is limited. For example, unlike the CVS trial,  6  in which we found that the participants' income modified the effects of reward-based and depositbased incentive programs, 25 similar analyses were not possible in the current trial. Second, most participants were considered to be ongoing smokers if they did not respond to surveys asking whether they had quit. This approach was used in previous trials  5, 6  and is unlikely to have biased the comparisons of different interventions, because rates of biochemical confirmation of participant-reported abstinence were similar across groups. Still, it is possible that absolute rates of quitting may have been somewhat higher across groups than reported here. In addition, the response rates to the 1-month survey were higher among participants assigned to the financial-incentives groups than among participants in the other groups. The incentives may have increased the likelihood of survey response among those who had quit smoking, given that a response was necessary for the participant to be eligible for the financial rewards. Third, we did not compare free access to e-cigarettes with free access to conventional cessation aids without any option for e-cigarettes. Nonetheless, the observation of greater e-cigarette use in the free e-cigarette group than in the free cessation aids group (Table  S11  in the Supplementary Appendix), coupled with the absence of benefit of free e-cigarettes versus no intervention, supports the conclusion that offering free e-cigarettes does not promote smoking cessation.\n\nThis trial also had several strengths. In addition to being twice as large as other trials of\n\nTrial Group Average Cost across Participants \u2020 Cost per Successful Quit U.S. $ (95% CI) U.S. $ Usual care \u2021 0.82 (0.29-1.67) 700.00 Free cessation aids 39.55 (26.76-56.30) 7,797.52 Free e-cigarettes 54.01 (36.09-77.82) 5,416.33 Rewards 72.65 (51.94-98.85) 3,623.13 Redeemable deposit 100.96 (76.82-128.80) 3,461.47\n\n* Costs include the prices of incentives disbursed, evaluation of blood and urine samples, payments for samples submitted, and orders for nicotinereplacement therapy, cessation-promoting medications, and e-cigarettes. \u2020 A two-part model was used to estimate average costs. The first part (for participants with zero expenditures) was estimated with the use of a probit model, and the second part (for participants with nonzero expenditures) was estimated with the use of a generalized linear model with a gamma family and log link. The model was adjusted for the trial phase in which the participant was enrolled. Confidence intervals for average costs were generated with the use of bias-corrected bootstrap methods. \u2021 Only one participant in the usual-care group quit smoking.\n\nTable 3.
