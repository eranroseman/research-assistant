  "title": "Use of mobile applications to improve nutrition behaviour: A systematic review",
  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Mobile applications could be effectively used for dietary intake assessment, physical activity monitoring, behavior improvement, and nutrition education. The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness of mobile applications in improving nutrition behaviors through a systematic review of literature. Methods: The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO: registration number CRD42018118809, and followed PRISMA guidelines. We involved original articles including mobile electronic devices for improving dietary intake, physical activity, and weight management in adult populations in this review. Data were retrieved from January 2010 to December 2018 with PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as data sources. Authors individually screened the titles and abstracts, then full articles in order to obtain papers that met inclusion criteria. Results: The database search yielded 2962 records. After removing the duplicates and analyzing the full text papers a total of 8 original articles were reviewed. Two articles showed obvious bias and were not included in our results or discussion. The remaining six articles with low to moderate bias risk were included in this systematic review. Three selected studies were randomized control trials (RCTs) with over 180 participants each. The other three studies were a nested trial, a case-control trial, and a pilot RCT with 36, 162, and 24 participants respectively. All larger RCTs and the small case control trail showed significant improvements in some nutritional-health objectives measured. The other two trials showed insignificant improvements in outcomes measured between groups.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "The introduction of telemedicine services with mobile and personal computing devices has shown great viability and rapid dissemination  [1]  . Advanced technology has allowed users of these devices to monitor their health records and to receive medical advice about healthy lifestyle practices . This has been facilitated by modular development of application programs and their dissemination over the years. Today, it is estimated that more than 5 billion people have mobile devices, and over half of these connections are smartphones  [2]  . Smartphone adoption has increased by almost three-fold in emerging nations from 18% in 2013 to 47% in 2018. Internet usage has also increased from 40% in 2015 to 60% in 2018. Most of the users of smart phone and internet devices have been reported to be between 18-49 years old  [3]  . Increasing number of smartphones users can lead to higher popularity and accessibility of information through application programs. Therefore, there are higher potential apps to be developed for lifestyle behavior change in the community. Mobile application for nutrition is something that many people use to control their diet and maintain their personal ideal weight. A large number of health and nutrition applications available on Google Play and the Apple App Store proves the increasing awareness of community regarding adopting a healthy lifestyle  [4]  . The effectiveness of nutrition apps in behavioral change still needs to be rigorously assessed. The latest review about app nutrition related to the knowledge and behavior was published in 2015  [5]  . The current systematic review aims to provide updated summary on the use of application in altering the knowledge and health behavior. This study examined the effect of nutrition mobile applications in stimulating change in eating behavior and solving nutritional problems. While previous literature has examined technology as a strategy to provide knowledge and promote behavior change  [5]  , this review adds to current body of knowledge by specifically focusing on mobile apps in the context of nutrition to monitor and instruct users in order to choose healthier food options. The use of learning applications needs additional research involving in-application behavior theory."

Studies targeting adults, aged 18 years or above with any health condition, were included to analyze the change of behavior and knowledge related to nutrition after using mobile nutrition applications. Children under 18 years were excluded due to the variations in cognitive and physical development through the age span. There was no restriction on race, ethnicity, geography, and gender to maintain the broadest target group. The intervention had to include nutrition app developed in mobile phone. The intervention must involve nutrition education to change behavior through aiding goal setting, self-monitoring, and environmental or policy level change  [6]  . any app that directly taught users or indirectly changes nutrition-related behavior was regarded as nutrition education for this review. Desired outcomes for this study were either nutrition-related behavior (primary outcome) and nutrition knowledge (secondary outcome)  [5]  ."

      "title": "3.. Results",
      "text": "The study selection process is illustrated in Fig.  1  . The database search yielded 2962 records. After removing the duplicates, the title and abstracts were screened for 2850 records. Full text was reviewed for 15 manuscripts. Of these, six articles were included in final systematic review. We identified studies from Europe, United States, and Asia. The key characteristics are described in Table  1  . Among six studies, three were randomized control trials (RCTs) with over 180 participants (listed first). These three larger RCT studies showed significant improvement in the context either healthy eating behavior or weight change status. The other three studies had smaller patient participant populations and were a nested trial, a case-control trial, and a pilot RCT. The small case control trail showed significant improvements in some nutritionalhealth objectives measured. The other two trials showed insignificant improvements in outcomes measured between groups. In study conducted by Partridge et al.  [7]  , increased vegetable intake and reduced sugar-sweetened beverages, accompanied by physical activity had reported as mediators that considerably improve weight status in participants. Similar result also found in study by Lee et al.  [8]  , usage of mobile app increased the outcome of body composition.The quality assessment of studies included in systematic review is shown in Table  2  . In total, two reviewers (KN, AZ) independently assessed each included study for quality constructs and risk of bias using Quality Criteria Checklist: Primary Research identified in the AHRQ report on Systems to Rate the Strength of Scientific Evidence [9] . This checklist was used to evaluate the risk of bias within the studied papers. All of the studies were deemed to be of low to moderate risk when assessed using Quality Criteria Checklist. However, there was study that had elements of risk. RCT study failed to report their method of assigning subjects to groups and clearly exhibited bias  [10]  . This study did not include the sources of bias as well as limitations in their conclusions.\n\nTable  3  . shows the characteristics of the studies included in this systematic review. The goals were similar among these six studies, for instance, Partridge et al . [7]  , Orlemann et al.  [10]  and Laing et al.  [11]  aimed to prevent weight gain. Another goal of these studies were related to dietary intake and physical activity behavior. Five of six studies used self-assessment for feedback and monitoring  [7 , 8 , 10-12]  , while Dodd et al . used interview methods to obtain variables data  [13]  . Social support appears to be an important determinant of success in changing habits  [14]  , meanwhile this factor was only be included in two studies  [10 , 11]  .\n\nThis systematic review also aimed at finding out the role of apps on increasing knowledge related nutrition. We discovered that 3 of 6 studies provided feature to enhance nutrition knowledge through the apps  [7 , 8 , 11]  . None of the studies used threat for behavior change however reward was used as a method to encourage subjects to change their behavior in two studies  [11 , 15]  ."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "Results of the review indicate that nutrition knowledge can impart favorable dietary and health behavioral changes in app users through short-term nutrition education, health coaching, reminders, and/or diet tracking tools. Four of six studies have reported positive impact for supporting user to increase a healthy diet, to enhance their self-efficacy, and their desire to obtain healthy dietary goals  [7 , 8 , 11 , 15]  . In many studies, the intervention involved multiple modalities of patient contact including app, email, and/or calls from a health coach. In these instances, it is impossible to determine if it was the mobile app alone that yielded the significant health benefits. The studies included in this review also span large differences in patient population sizes, health indications, and desired outcomes. In some studies, the objective was for weight gain, in others it was weight loss, and in another it was to get patients to actively monitor their calorie intake. To be able to definitively compare across methodologies and determine effective strategies for intervention coordinated objectives, standardization of methodology, and/or implementation of multiple intervention arms in the same large RCT would be the most scientific approach.\n\nSeveral systematic reviews have been conducted to examine the use of smartphone applications for the dietary and lifestyle interventions weight loss  [5 , 16 , 17]  . A study by DiFilippo  [5]  concluded that the smartphone apps are associated with increased nutrition knowledge. Stephens et al.  [17]  assessed the impact on reduced weight and increased physical activity. Previous systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Hutchesson et al.  [16]  showed that use of several media platforms such as internet, computer, mobile, and smartphone technologies intervention can promote weight loss. Apparent result was shown in Partridge et al.  [7]  study. The 3-month intervention plus 6-month maintenance program was proven successful to reduce weight gain with weekly personalized calls, text messages and emails. The participant was also facilitated by not only smartphone apps, website, community blog and guideline booklet, so they can remain achieve their goal to obtain ideal body weight. Personalized calls were also proven to be effective way as direct way to communicate the motivational support, provide feedback and also discuss the potential obstacle during intervention. Dodd et al.  [13]  study was specified in pregnant women and showed significant difference of increase in the Healthy Eating Index during pregnancy. Although several weaknesses in this study was low response rate in participant which impact on nonresponse bias and also potential recall bias during 24 hour dietary recall. Nevertheless, this study had no strong evidence to prove the effect of the nutrition app on participants in pregnant women. Orlemann et al.  [10]  study specifically targeted the tumor patients to use the four-week OncoFood app. The study finding demonstrated significant weight and muscle mass increase. However, the analysis failed to explain the insignificant result in reduced of protein and macronutrients. These papers had some drawbacks, including lack of participants, unspecific tumor disease, and involvement in the short period. Nonetheless, the current studies still suggest little evidence about the effectiveness of nutrition apps usage. Nutrition apps may be effective and should be further evaluated in more rigorous studies with standardized outcomes.\n\nTo execute and interpret the good systematic reviews of literature, a risk of bias assessment needed to be performed as a predominant step. Risk of bias has been defined as \"the likelihood of inaccuracy in the estimate of causal effect in that study\"  [18]  . Furthermore, conducting risk of bias assessment in the included primary studies imparts an indication of the quality of available evidence. The tool used in recent review was Quality Criteria Checklist: Primary Research. It provides a domain-based qualitative description of critical areas of potential bias in primary studies. Most studies were considered to be of low to moderate risk when assessed using this tool. In spite of that, a clinical study by Orlemann et al.  [10]  failed to provide method to obtain study participants. Thus, it might incorporate study quality and strength of the evidence  [19]  .\n\nNevertheless, smartphone apps have several advantages. Coughlin et al.  [20]  discovered that smartphone technologies considerably reduced the burden of using paper-based form to record daily intake of nutrition. Study by Hebden et al.  [21]  supported this finding, smartphone apps found to have the potential to improve population health, because of their widespread and increasing use, dynamic technological advancements, and use of existing features (e.g. internet access, geopositioning technology, as well as photo, video, and voice recording capabilities), and the potential for reducing intervention delivery costs. Furthermore, although there are often similarities between apps, particularly focusing on tracking, there are often key differences, including the ways in which nutrition information is presented and when, whether, and how feedback is delivered to the user.\n\nThis review has several strengths, including an inclusive search strategy and using the most recent of Behavior Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of behavioral intervention delivered by smartphone technology. A recent systematic review examined goal setting as a component of behavior strategies specific to weight management, diet, and physical activity. The use of BCT allows future scientists and clinicians to review which mobile apps have useful features for behavioral changing. In addition, BCT also commonly used in study aiming to evaluate the change of behavior, including physical activity and sedentary behavior, as well as nutrition behavior. Conroy et al.  [22]  reported that the information provided in BCT could be utilized for developing apps to optimize lifestyle health behavior modification. Thus, incorporating BCT features could lead to better engagement and long-term use. Meanwhile, in developing apps, researchers need to give consideration to the target population in terms of their access, ability to adopt this form of intervention, and preferences regarding the design  [21]  ."

      "title": "5.. Limitations",
      "text": "The small number of large RCTs was our main limitation in this systematic review. Another limitation is that studies used multiple objectives as their outcome including knowledge acquisition, weight loss/gain, and/or app usage (or other arbitrary behavior changes). Future research should emphasize more in specific population such as cancer patient or pregnant women for clearer evidence. Limited number of participants and participants' diversity needs to be considered in the future studies. Future studies also should include head-to-head comparisons of app versus traditional method such as counseling rather than mixing the two into single intervention group."

    {
      "title": "6.. Conclusion",
      "text": "Since mobile app usage becomes increasingly common in general population, the potential for improving healthy behavior via this medium needs exploration to optimize outcomes. This study showed that mobile app-based interventions can promote various healthy behaviors including diet and physical activity. Most of the app interventions reviewed focused on monitoring health status and behavior change, as well as provide feedback or health-related information. App programs may be more effective when social support is advocated and when entertainment functions or visualization features are included. Future research should address mobile app efficacy for health promotion in developing countries and better assess what features of app design yield significant healthy behavior changes."
