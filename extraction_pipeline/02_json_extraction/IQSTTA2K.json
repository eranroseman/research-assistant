  "title": "My Quest, an Intervention Using Text Messaging to Improve Dietary and Physical Activity Behaviors and Promote Weight Loss in Low-Income Women",
  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate changes in dietary and physical activity behaviors and weight after implementation of a 12-week text messaging initiative (My Quest). Design: The researchers conducted a 1-group, pre-to posttest study design to determine changes after implementation of a text messaging initiative developed using the tenets of the Social Cognitive Theory. Setting: A total of 55 Alabama counties (84% rural) with high rates of poverty, overweight/obesity, and chronic diseases. Participants: Convenience sample of low-income, primarily overweight/obese women (n = 104). Intervention: Short texts (n = 2-3/d) provided health tips, reminders, and goal-setting prompts. Weekly electronic newsletters provided tips and recipes. Participant self-monitored body weight weekly. Main Outcome Measure: Outcomes included goal setting, self-efficacy, behavioral and environmental factors, self-monitoring, and body weight; data collection occurred through text message response and online surveys. Analysis: Analyses were conducted using McNemar test (dichotomous data), Wilcoxon signed rank test (ordinal data), or paired t test (continuous data). Results: Participants significantly (P < .05) improved dietary and physical activity behaviors and food environment; increased dietary and physical activity goal setting; and reduced body weight. Conclusions and Implications: A low-cost, text messaging initiative particularly targeting women residing in rural communities with high rates of poverty and obesity can promote weight loss and improve dietary and physical activity behaviors. Future studies may include a control group and social support component such as group text messaging.",

      "text": "Overweight, obesity, and associated comorbidities affect almost 70% of American adults.  1  The highest rates of obesity occur among low-income, minority women.  1, 2 Interventions promoting weight loss/management in high-risk populations present many challenges.  2  Meeting low-income women where they are by using delivery methods already ingrained in their culture is a crucial first step in weight loss and management efforts.\n\nCell phone ownership is highly integrated into American society, even among individuals with limited resources. In 2015, cell phone ownership was substantial among lower-income households, rural communities, American adult women, and the African American and Hispanic populations.  3 ost cell phone owners use phones to text and send or receive e-mails.  3, 4 exting is the dominant way of communicating for Americans aged <50 years.  4 Therefore, 1 possible intervention delivery method is mobile health (mHealth). mHealth includes the use of cell phones to deliver health information, implement behavior change programs, and collect data. Short messaging service (SMS) or text messaging initiatives have shown promise as a medium for weight loss interventions. These programs are costeffective and convenient, have high adherence rates, and promote behavior change and moderate weight loss.  [5] [6] ] [7] [8] [9]  Messages are short and targeted, increasing the likelihood that recipients read and use the information.\n\nPublic health initiatives aim to promote health and reduce chronic disease risk through healthy lifestyle behaviors and body weight management.  10 Healthy lifestyle behaviors that support these initiatives include increasing fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption and physical activity and reducing sugar intake and sedentary behavior.  10 ecause the majority of lowincome and rural individuals own cell phones, using a text messaging initiative is a feasible way to overcome challenges to reach a population that is female, overweight or obese, and living in rural areas, and that has limited financial resources, transportation, or the ability to access community centers for on-site weight loss intervention programs. Building on the premise that most Americans own cell phones and that using a mHealth text messaging initiative may influence health promotion programs successfully and positively, My Quest was developed to overcome barriers and reach a targeted at-risk population.\n\nThe objective of My Quest, a 12week 1-group, pre-to posttest study, was to evaluate changes in dietary and physical activity behaviors and weight in low-income women residing primarily in rural areas using an easily accessible text messaging initiative based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) constructs.  11 The SCT constructs emphasized goal setting, self-efficacy, behavioral and environmental factors, and self-monitoring. Goal setting and self-efficacy included dietary factors and physical activity. Behavioral and environmental factors included participation in physical activity, intake and availability of FV and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), and sedentary behavior."

      "title": "METHODS Participants",
      "text": "Using a standardized recruitment script, extension agent assistants in 55 Alabama counties (84% rural) recruited a convenience sample of women (n = 159) at the following locations: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) office, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Alabama Food Bank. The Auburn University Institutional Review Board approved this study. At the recruitment location, participants completed an eligibility checklist and Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q)  12  ; and if they were eligible, they provided signed written consent, opted in to the text message program, and weighed themselves. The eligibility checklist indicated that women met study criteria if they were eligible for SNAP, were aged 19-49 years, had a cell phone with text message capability, and had an active e-mail account. In addition, participants had to be at low risk for medical complications, as determined by PAR-Q. If participants were eligible and willing to participate in My Quest, they signed a written consent form. Participants (n = 143) were also prompted to opt in to the text messaging initiative. Finally, they removed shoes and outer garments to weigh themselves on a provided scale ($20 value) and immediately texted their initial body weight to researchers. During recruitment, 4 women were not interested in participating in My Quest and 12 did not meet study criteria. No formal a priori sample size calculation was conducted."

      "text": "Using averaged, self-obtained baseline data for body weight, height, and age (Table  1 ), the MyPlate Checklist Calculator 13 determined a mean calorie intake level for 2 physical activity levels for the total sample. According to the calculator for sedentary and moderate physical activity, a daily intake of 1,800 or 2,000 cal, respectively was needed. To create a small calorie deficit to elicit slow and steady weight loss, a registered dietitian prescribed a 1,600-kcal MyPlate meal plan for all participants. This communitybased calorie level ensured that (1) a variety of foods was included in the diet, (2) there was a balanced food intake from all major food groups, and (3) an attainable and sustainable calorie intake was achieved for lifelong eating habits, unlike low-calorie meal plans. The prescribed calorie level was used while developing text messages and electronic newsletters (eNewsletters).\n\nThe researchers conducted My Quest for 12 weeks. The intervention was based on SCT: specifically, goal setting, self-efficacy, dietary and physical activity behaviors, and environmental factors related to weight loss or management and self-monitoring. In addition to participants monitoring body weight (using a scale) and physical activity (using a pedometer), they all received 2-3 short, daily, identical SMS text messages. The text messages included tips on diet and exercise, Web links, goal-setting prompts, and reminders or questions about exercise or healthy eating that required a response. They also received a weekly eNewsletter that provided tips, reminders, and a low-cost healthy recipe. Each Sunday morning, a selfmonitoring text prompt requested a response for current body weight that participants could obtain at home using the provided scale."

Text messages were scheduled for daily delivery in the morning (between 7 and 8 AM), at lunch (between 11 AM and noon), and at 8:30 PM. Delivery time of the morning and lunch text messages was randomized daily to reduce the likelihood that participants would begin to ignore text messages. The cost of the My Quest text messaging software was $159.00/mo to send a maximum of 50,000 messages."

[14] [15] 5] [16] [17] [18]  The researchers used 3 scales in the My Quest assessment: (1) ordinal data using a 5or 7-point Likert scale; (2) dichotomous data (yes/no); and (3) continuous data using open-ended questions. Identical questions (Table  3 ) were asked at pre-and post-assessment to determine changes in participant engagement in goal setting, nutrition, and health behaviors as well as consumption and availability of FV and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB).\n\nWithin 24 hours of providing signed consent, participants were e-mailed a link to complete the online survey using a computer, tablet, or smart phone. Upon completion of the pre-assessment, participants were mailed a pedometer ($15 value) to measure daily step counts with a daily goal of \u226510,000 steps. At postassessment, additional questions allowed women to provide program feedback and consisted of 12 3-or 5-point Likert scale questions and 1 open-ended question. Feedback was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Participants who completed both preand post-assessments received a $20 check.\n\nBefore administration of the online survey, an expert panel review was conducted with women (n = 49) recruited through social media and e-mail. Participants included 10 nutrition professionals, 12 SNAP caseworkers, 13 extension agent assistants, and 12 community members. The population in the panel was predominantly women who were Caucasian (71.4%; 12.2% African American), middle aged (46.4 \u00b1 12.7 years), educated (34.6%, 2 years/some college; 57%, \u22654-year degree), and of higher income (32.6%, $25,000 to $50,000; 38.8%, >$50,001). Feedback showed that the survey flowed well and questions were easy to read and understand. Analyses showed good reliability and internal consistency (\u03b1 = .6-.8).  19 Scales with lower \u03b1 were corrected by creating like-numbered response scales to ensure consistency among questions. Questions were modified for readability to a lowincome audience. The final assessment tool had a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 4.8 (Microsoft Word 2013, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, 2013)."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in dietary and physical activity behaviors and body weight of low-income women living in primarily rural areas after implementation of a text messaging initiative based on SCT constructs. The novelty of this study is its findings within a vulnerable, limited-resource population. Although other interventions using text messaging reported weight loss, their population was middle-income, highly educated individuals.  [6] [7] ] [8]  My Quest is unique in that it was a completely remote weight loss intervention. All education was delivered through text messaging, and eNewsletter and assessments were completed electronically. After providing signed written consent and receiving a scale, participants had no further requirements to attend face-to-face meetings or weigh-ins. Previous studies using text messaging for weight loss required participants to attend on-site baseline, mid-and postassessments.  [5] [6] ] [7] [8] [9]  Commercially available weight loss programs range from $66 to $204 for 12 weeks (not including costs for weekly meetings or required food).  20, 21 articipant cost of My Quest was limited to the existing cost of cell phone, text messaging, and data service. From a practical standpoint, My Quest had 2 more strengths. First, My Quest was delivered through text messages. Text messaging software is relatively inexpensive, which makes text messages a low-cost modality to deliver nutrition education and reach a high-risk, low-income population residing in rural areas. Second, participants were not obligated to attend classes or weigh-ins, which may be a barrier. Participants were provided a scale and pedometer to self-monitor body weight and physical activity.\n\nHowever, My Quest had limitations. The researchers did not conduct a Bonferroni correction. Retention was slightly lower (64%) than in previ-ously published studies using text messaging to promote behavior change and/or weight loss. This may be because of the lack of face-toface contact, personalized content/ feedback, or social support. Participants in previous successful weight loss programs stated that the provision of social support and personalized feedback were important contributors to motivation and weight loss success.  2, [6] [7] ] [8]  Previous weight loss studies using text messaging reported retention rates between 68% and 96%.  [5] [6] 6] [7] [8] [9]  On-site (inperson) obesity trials and/or weight loss programs may have retention rates varying from 20% to 90%.  [22] [23] ] [24]  My Quest supports using mHealth modalities such as text messaging to deliver targeted education programs such as weight loss and management. Use of My Quest was able to produce modest mean weight loss of 2.3% body weight. This finding was consistent with other mHealth weight loss programs, which ranged from 1.8% to 3.7%.  [5] [6] 6] [7] [8] [9]  Although My Quest participant body weight remained in the overweight/obese category, even modest weight loss such as this can reduce chronic disease risk factors related to obesity.  6 n addition to body weight, My Quest positively influenced physical activity behaviors. This study examined the physical activity behavior of women of limited resources using 2 questions regarding minutes exercised and steps from the previous day. Consistent with other research,  25  My Quest improved participation and selfmonitoring of physical activity. In addition, women reported reducing sedentary behaviors (sitting at work, home, or travel, and screen time) by an average 0.82 h/d. Daily selfmonitoring of physical activity and sedentary behaviors is a strong predictor of weight loss success.  7, 8, 25, 26 y Quest also positively influenced dietary behaviors including fruit and SSB intake. Women reported increasing fruit intake and reducing availability and consumption of SSB. Increasing FV intake and reducing SSB are positively associated with weight loss and management.  13, 27 For 3 of the 12 weeks, My Quest SMS messages focused on FV and SSB; these messages were also spread throughout the remaining 9 weeks. Reducing SSB by 1 serving each day can remove 151 cal and 9.5 teaspoons of added sugar from the diet (based on a 12-oz can of soda).\n\nMy Quest had other limitations, as well. My Quest used a convenience sample of participants located in 1 geographic region. Because of the targeted nature of the study, results may have limited generalizability. Participants self-reported outcome measures, which allowed for bias, including socially desirable responses. Participants were not prescribed a personalized calorie intake; therefore, the calorie intake level may have been too high for some and not sufficient for others."

      "title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE",
      "text": "The My Quest text messaging initiative was able to reach an at-risk population through an integrated modality that was low in cost and convenient to participants and researchers. Inexpensive tools such as a scale and pedometer can be potential motivators for self-monitoring and engaging in behaviors that promote weight loss and management.  28, 29 n addition to personalizing the program, it would be beneficial to include modalities of education. Some of these include easy-to-follow at home physical activity videos, personalized feedback on food and physical activity journals, and monitoring progress toward goals.\n\nThis was a pre-experimental study design; future studies may include a control group. One tenet of SCT is social support; future studies also may include a social support component such as group text messaging. African American participants had the highest attrition. An exit interview to determine specific reasons or barriers that led to this higher dropout rate would have been beneficial. A process evaluation may determine which processes worked well with participants and what modifications can be made to reach the target population better. Future programs may also include individual calorie intake levels and 2-way communication with participants."
