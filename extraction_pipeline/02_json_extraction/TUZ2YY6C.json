  "title": "Physician Attitudes Towards Use of Digital Health Apps for Chronic Disease Self-management in Clinical Practice",
  "abstract": "Background: Despite evidence of effectiveness, few primary care providers (PCPs) are recommending digital health apps to support chronic disease management as part of routine practice. Methods: This study explores factors that influence PCP behaviours in recommending digital apps to patients. Study design included interviews with a deductive analysis, grounded in the Theoretical Domains Framework. PCPs were recruited from across Ontario. Results: Interviews from 15 participants resulted in four key themes. While participant's wanted to use health apps with patients, a lack of knowledge, including knowledge of evidence, the quality of the current evidence and awareness of specific apps limited prescribing. Recommended interventions to increase use including curated lists, integration with the EMR, and peers supports. Conclusions: Our results suggest knowledge gaps are a key barrier to recommending apps, however this could be addressed using targeted interventions. Future work should explore patient attitudes towards the prescribing and use of apps.",

      "title": "Digital Health",
      "text": "Over the last 10 years, health systems have increasingly been looking to leverage digital technology to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Canada Health Infoway, an organization tasked with increasing digital health across Canada defines digital health as \"the use of information technology/electronic communication tools, services and processes to deliver health care services or to facilitate better health\" (Canada Health Infoway, 2021). There is increasing evidence that a strong, integrated digital health ecosystem is essential for achieving the Quadruple Aim of improved population health, improved patient experience, improved provider experience and lower costs across health systems  (Bodenheimer, Thomas, MD & Sinsky, 2014) .\n\nOne area of digital health that has received increasing attention recently is virtual care. Virtual care is defined as \"any interaction between patients and/or members of their circle of care, occurring remotely, using any forms of communication or information technologies, with the aim of facilitating or maximizing the quality and effectiveness of patient care\"  (Jamieson et al., 2015) . Virtual care encompasses a wide variety of technologies and care models including video visits, messaging apps, mobile health apps (mhealth), remote monitoring and others  (Jamieson et al., 2015) . There is recognition of the opportunity to leverage consumer driven technologies, such as ubiquitous internet access, smartphones and connected devices to positively disrupt health services and catalyze innovative new models of care  (Bhatia et al., 2020) . The use of these virtual modalities has only increased since the COVID-19 pandemic, when many health systems switched to a largely virtual first model to deliver care. However, despite much attention and uptake during the pandemic, there remain many questions around how to sustainably and effectively integrate virtual care technologies across large scale health systems to positively impact health  (Bhatia et al., 2020) ."

      "title": "Mobile health: Potential and growth",
      "text": "Often defined as \"the provisioning of medical services using mobile devices\" (WHO Global Observatory for eHealth, 2011), the field of mobile health has developed significantly over the last 25 years. Early work focused on the use of mobile phones to deliver health services in low resource settings  (Kahn, Yang, & Kahn, 2010) . These services often use simple functions such as SMS messaging to reach large, often rural, populations. A systematic review of mobile health in developing countries found these technologies could fill gaps in the system to positively impact health outcomes including chronic disease outcomes  (Beratarrechea et al., 2014) . However, with the introduction of the smartphone and the app store in the mid-2000s  (Boulos, Brewer, Karimkhani, Buller, & Dellavalle, 2014) , the focus shifted to developing more complex mobile health functions. These functions are often developed as a health app, where apps \"refers to a self-contained piece of software coded for a specific purpose and usually optimised to run on a mobile device\"  (Boulos et al., 2014) .\n\nMany believe health apps have the potential to redefine how care is delivered, by providing a feasible, cost-effective method to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction  (Lee, J., 2014; Whitehead & Seaton, 2016) . There is growing evidence mobile apps can provide tangible health benefits through four distinct mechanisms: clinical decision support, behaviour change, digital therapeutics and disease education  (Rowland, Fitzgerald, Holme, Powell, & McGregor, 2020) .\n\nA review of research in higher-income countries found evidence of positive impact on smoking cessation, appointment attendance and asthma control  (Marcolino et al., 2018) . Studies have also found health apps can improve patient experience of care within the health system  (Lu et al., 2018) .\n\nAlong with evolving evidence, patients and the general public have been increasingly excited to try mobile health apps to support their health. One third of Canadians reported using a digital health app in the last three months  (Par\u00e9 & Bourget, 2017) . Another study showed half of all mobile phone users in the US have downloaded a health app  (Krebs & Duncan, 2015) . The most commonly cited reasons for engaging with health apps include monitoring health and progress towards health goals, tracking exercise and support in breaking a bad habit  (Par\u00e9 & Bourget, 2017) . This is similar across other developed countries; the most commonly cited reasons for using a mobile health app were to track exercise (US) and diet (Germany)  (Par\u00e9 & Bourget, 2017) . While many Canadians describe health apps as being easy to use, and express interest in continued use  (Par\u00e9 & Bourget, 2017; Public perspectives: Canadians and digital health, 2017) , commonly cited barriers to ongoing use include burden of data entry, lack of interest and unexpected costs  (Krebs & Duncan, 2015) . Increasingly, jurisdictions including Ontario, have included the support and spread of mobile health apps in their digital health strategies (Ontario health teams: Digital health playbook, 2019)"

      "title": "Mobile health and chronic disease: Review of evidence",
      "text": "Over the last decade, much of the literature on health apps has focused on their potential to address chronic diseases  (Fiordelli, Diviani, & Schulz, 2013) . The growing burden of chronic diseases, including diabetes, mental health and heart disease, remains one of biggest drivers of health costs and poor outcomes  (McPhail, 2016) . For example, in Canada, over 25% of adults live with two or more chronic conditions, while over 60% of deaths can be attributed to a chronic disease  (Feely, Lix, & Reimer, 2017; Roberts, Rao, Bennett, Loukine, & Jayaraman, 2015)  . In response, there has been a global 'call to action', urging health researchers and decision makers to focus on better prevention and treatment of chronic diseases  (Beaglehole, Ebrahim, Reddy, Voute, & Leeder, 2007; Borysiewicz et al., 2007) .\n\nThere is clear evidence that improved support for disease prevention and early treatment, including pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions, can reduce many premature deaths from chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes  (Borysiewicz et al., 2007; Grunfeld et al., 2013) . The widely used Chronic Care Model for chronic disease management highlights the importance of an informed activated patient and support for self-management to address chronic disease across health systems  (Barr et al., 2003) . Recently, health systems including jurisdictions in Ontario have looked to provide patients with online self-management tools for chronic illness such as mental health  (Ministry of Health, 2021) . However, access to these tools varies widely, does not allow for consumer choice, and rarely includes direct support from a patients primary care team.\n\nIncreasingly, mobile apps targeting patients with chronic diseases are hoping to improve health behaviours and self-management through functions including education, self-monitoring and goal setting  (Free et al., 2013; Hamine, Gerth-Guyette, Faulx, Green, & Ginsburg, 2015; Payne, Lister, West, & Bernhardt, 2015) . There is evidence many patients believe chronic disease focused apps can complement their usual care by helping them to be more active participants in their health  (Vo, Auroy, & Sarradon-Eck, 2019) . Studies have shown apps can also effectively impact health behaviour with tailored nudges and cues to action  (O'Reilly & Spruijt-Metz, 2013) . Social support, through online social networks, may also provide a mechanism to encourage desired health behaviours  (Granado-Font et al., 2018) . Tracking of health data through apps, such as blood pressure and blood sugars, may also help patients better understand their disease and facilitate shared decision making with their providers  (Krebs & Duncan, 2015)  To date, the most common targets for health apps, both in the literature and commercial app stores, were chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, asthma and mental health  (Fiordelli, Diviani, & Schulz, 2013b; Gandhi et al., 2017; Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez, Torre-D\u00edez, & L\u00f3pez-Coronado, 2013) . Several clinical guidelines for chronic diseases including diabetes and hypertension endorse using digital health tools as part of a comprehensive self-management approach  (Sherifali, Berard, Gucciardi, MacDonald, & MacNeill, 2018; Tobe et al., 2018) . One systematic review from 2016 found evidence mobile health apps can improve self-management and health outcomes across multiple chronic diseases  (Whitehead & Seaton, 2016) . Other reviews have found evidence of benefit related to medication adherence, smoking cessation, chronic pain management, asthma control and diabetes management  (Marcolino et al., 2018; Thurnheer, Gravestock, Pichierri, Steurer, & Burgstaller, 2018 ) (Thurnheer. Among patients with cardiovascular disease, those that used mobile health apps had better health behaviours , including medication adherence and exercise, with a trend towards improved mortality  (Gandhi et al., 2017)  mobile health interventions may also improve health outcomes among patients with anxiety and depression  (Rathbone & Prescott, 2017) ."

      "title": "3.1. Diabetes and mobile health: A case study",
      "text": "The worldwide burden of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) continues to increase, with almost 9% of the global population expected to have T2DM by 2035  (Guariguata et al., 2014) . This increased prevalence will put tremendous pressure on the health system as those with diabetes use twice the health resources of those without the disease  (Rosella et al., 2016) . Experts predict that total diabetes related health care costs across  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012; Kitsiou, Pare, Jaana, & Gerber, 2017)  in Canada will top 15 billion dollars by 2022  (Anja & Laura, 2017) . Interventions that focus on primary and secondary prevention have the potential to significantly reduce these costs and improve quality of life for those living with T2DM  (Bodenheimer, Thomas, Wagner, & Grumbach, 2002; Stellefson, Dipnarine, & Stopka, 2013) .\n\nCurrent best-practice for management of T2DM follows the principles of the Chronic Care Model which emphasizes the importance of empowering patients to be active participants in the management of their disease  (Bodenheimer et al., 2002; Stellefson et al., 2013) . Canadian guidelines stress the importance of providing self-management supports to those with diabetes to change health behaviours, optimize glycemic control and improve cardiovascular risk factors  (Sherifali, Berard, Gucciardi, MacDonald, & MacNeill, 2018) . Interdisciplinary diabetes education teams have typically been the recommended method to provide self-management support. However, there is growing evidence that apps may provide another modality by which to support self-management. Several meta-analyses have shown a positive impact of mobile health apps on glycemic control among those with T2DM (de Jongh, Gurol-Urganci,  Vodopivec-Jamsek, Car, & Atun, 2012; Free et al., 2013; Holtz & Lauckner, 2012; Kitsiou et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2011; Pal et al., 2013; Wu, X., Guo & Zhang, 2019; Wu, Y. et al., 2017) .\n\nFurther, clinical practice guidelines, including the Canadian Diabetes Guidelines, state that mobile health apps provide an efficient, cost-effective method to support patients and improve health outcomes  (Sherifali et al., 2018) . There is some evidence that when implemented appropriately, mobile apps may help deliver care to those with diabetes that are hardest to reach and may most benefit from self-management support  (Humble et al., 2016) . A study of diabetes focused clinics, found clinicians that used apps with their patients were more likely to provide high quality care, including better adherence to treatment guidelines  (Karduck & Chapman-Novakofski, 2018) .\n\nA global review of apps found over 1000 apps targeting diabetes self-management in the Apple iTunes app store  (Huang, Soljak, Boehm, & Car, 2018) . However, despite this availability of apps to support care of T2DM, barriers to adoption remain  (Boyle, Grainger, Hall, & Krebs, 2017; Conway, Campbell, Forbes, Cunningham, & Wake, 2016; Williams & Schroeder, 2015) .\n\nConcerns about cost, privacy and security and competing health priorities are often cited as reasons for poor usage by patients and providers  (Maniam, Dhillon, & Baghaei, March 2015) .\n\nOther studies have found barriers for adoption include lack of awareness, lack of time and lack of motivation  (Peng, Kanthawala, Yuan, & Hussain, 2016) . Further, older adults, or those with co-morbid disease may be less likely to independently adopt technology for T2DM selfmanagement  (Desveaux et al., 2018; Guo, Han, Zhang, Dang, & Chen, 2015; Humble et al., 2016) . This indicates greater work is needed to better understand how to fully realize the potential of mobile health of all patients with diabetes within a health system."

      "title": "Mobile health use within health systems",
      "text": "While data on app use in Canadian health care systems remain limited, studies from other jurisdictions including the US, the Europe and Australia have had mixed success in integrating mobile health apps into routine clinical care  (Greenhalgh et al., 2017; Gordon, Landman, Zhang, & Bates, 2020) . This may be due in part to ongoing concerns around how to safely and effectively integrate apps into care, to ensure positive benefit for as many patients as possible.\n\nCurrently patients with chronic illness, who may benefit most from health apps, are less likely than others to use these tools  (Desveaux et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2015; Krebs & Duncan, 2015) .\n\nIn addition, many apps frequently downloaded on public app stores are of low quality and may put patients at risk of harm  (Izahar et al., 2017; Steinhubl, Muse, & Topol, 2013) . Commonly described safety concerns include incorrect information, poorly functioning reminders and inappropriate responses to patient health needs  (Akbar, Coiera, & Magrabi, 2020) . Patients often report challenges navigating the quality and effectiveness of thousands of health apps available on the market  (Larsen, Nicholas, & Christensen, 2016; Peng, Kanthawala, Yuan, & Hussain, 2016b) . One study highlights concerns that app descriptions might be misleading consumers and overstate proven benefits of an app  (Larsen, Mark Erik et al., 2019) . Other reported barriers include concerns over accuracy, cost and privacy  (Krebs & Duncan, 2015; Peng, Kanthawala, Yuan, & Hussain, 2016; Vo et al., 2019) . In particular, there are concerns that patients from low socio-economic backgrounds may not own mobile phones or lack adequate internet connectivity  (Fujioka et al., 2020) , limiting their ability to benefit from health apps.\n\nHowever, other studies suggest that these patients are keen to use health apps if barriers can be addressed  (Burke et al., 2015; Martinez, 2015) .\n\nIncreasingly, studies suggest that clinicians can help promote the responsible use of patient facing digital health apps. In particular, they can support patients, particularly those most in need, to navigate the digital health ecosystem to find high quality apps that can best improve their health  (Vo et al., 2019) . Primary care providers (PCPs) are well positioned to support this work as they often provide the majority of support for those with chronic diseases  (Kennedy et al., 2014; Muggah, Graves, Bennett, & Manuel, 2012) . PCPs also have long standing relationships with their patients, and are best positioned to understand the psychosocial factors that impact chronic disease management  (Dennis et al., 2008) . A study of the BlueStar app, designed to support self-management for those with T2DM, found the app did not significantly impact glycemic control in a multi-site randomized control trial. In this study, apps were distributed by diabetes care educators who often did not have an ongoing relationship with patients. The study found lack of involvement of primary care providers significantly limited adoption and impact of the app  (Agarwal, P. et al., 2019) . In contrast, a previous study of the app where implementation included significant integration with primary care, showed significant benefit on glycemic control and experience of care  (Quinn et al., 2008) ."

      "title": "Prescribing mobile health apps",
      "text": "Despite increasing efforts to build and evaluate high quality health apps to support chronic disease management, most clinicians have not incorporated recommendations on mobile health tools into their routine clinical care  (Boyle, Grainger, Hall, & Krebs, 2017; Kayyali et al., 2017) .\n\nA wide reaching survey of Canadian family physicians in 2016 shows only 22% recommend apps to their patients (The College of Family Physicians of Canada, Canadian Medical Association, The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, 2014). Another online Canadian survey in 2017 found 43% of health care providers recommend apps to patients (Public perspectives: Canadians and digital health, 2017). Several studies across other jurisdictions have shown that while many clinicians use health apps personally, significantly less recommend them to patients  (Rowe & Sauls, 2020; Tarricone et al., 2019; Byambasuren, Beller, & Glasziou, 2019; Berkowitz, Zullig, Koontz, & Smith, 2017) . However, there is evidence this may be changing; a more recent survey from the UK, showed over 60% of responding HCPs have previously prescribed a health app to their patients  (Leigh, Ashall-Payne, & Andrews, 2020) .\n\nRecognizing the need to increase the use of health apps, there has been a growing push to better understand the behaviour of 'prescribing' health apps to encourage use of high quality apps among all patients  (Boyle et al., 2017; Gordon, Landman, Zhang, & Bates, 2020; Kao & Liebovitz, 2017; Leigh & Ashall-Payne, 2019) . It is theorized that leveraging existing clinician behaviours and workflows around prescribing could increase use of evidence based apps among patients  (Byambasuren, Sanders, Beller, & Glasziou, 2018; Gordon et al., 2020) . In relation, several apps in the US have received regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration and can be prescribed similar to pharmacotherapy and have experienced greater use and sustainability than most health apps  (Shan, Sarkar, & Martin, 2019) .\n\nWhile much is known about physician behaviour related to prescribing drugs (Remo Ostini, Claire Jackson, Desley Hegney, & Susan E. Tett, 2011;  Spurling et al., 2010) , greater work is needed to better understand the factors that might drive the prescribing of technologies. Unlike pharmacotherapy, regulatory questions regarding the safety and privacy health apps still remain  (Akbar, Coiera, & Magrabi, 2020) . Other considerations including cost, technology integration and clinician decision support remain unclear  (Gordon et al., 2020) . Digital technologies, including apps, are complex interventions whose effects are heavily dependent on patient, clinician and organizational level factors that drive adoption  (Greenhalgh et al., 2017) . Without a full understanding of the digital health tool, the team of people that use it, and the routines that support its adoption and ongoing use, most eHealth tools fail to make an impact despite promising evidence  (Shaw et al., 2018) .\n\nThere have been multiple previous studies looking to assess physician attitudes towards mobile health apps. A systematic review from 2015 found most studies assessing clinicians attitudes in mobile health grouped apps designed for clinician use (eg. clinical decision support, clinician to clinician communication) as well as apps designed primarily for patients use (ie selfmanagement support)  (Gagnon, Ngangue, Payne-Gagnon, & Desmartis, 2015) . Treating these unique use cases of mobile health apps ignores the contextual realities of how an app is intended to be used. Most commonly these studies are grounded in technology adoption theories such as the Technology Acceptance Model  (Gagnon et al., 2015; Lee, Y., Kozar, & Larsen, 2003) . This information systems model focuses on the impact of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness on behavioural intention to use a technology  (Gagnon et al., 2015; Hu, Chau, Sheng, & Tam, 1999) . While these models may give insight into factors that influence a clinician to adopt a mobile health app for their own use  (Okazaki, Casta\u00f1eda, Sanz, & Henseler, 2012; Sezgin, \u00d6zkan-Yildirim, & Yildirim, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) , technology acceptance models are not sufficient to understand the complex cognitive and social factors that impact clinician behaviours towards prescribing mobile health apps for their patients  (Greenhalgh et al., 2017; Zhao, Y., Ni, & Zhou, 2018) . Instead, understanding the adoption of apps should be grouped on the basis of the intended type of user as oppose to relying solely on the disease or health condition targeted. For example, two apps, one that supports patient self-management of diabetes and another related to patient self-management of asthma may have more in common with each other than two diabetes apps, but where one is for patients and one is for physicians Models grounded in knowledge translation, implementation science and physician behaviour change, may likely provide a better understanding of factors that include physician prescribing behaviours to promote adoption of apps intended for patient as the primary end user  (Glasgow, Phillips, & Sanchez, 2013) .\n\nRecently, there have been a few studies that explicitly explored clinician attitudes towards recommending or prescribing apps to patients. A survey of Australian GPs found most GPs were not recommending apps to their patients, with knowledge of apps being the primary barrier  (Byambasuren et al., 2019) . Studies of general practitioners from France, found providers were skeptical around the real-world impact of recommending health apps to patients and required further education and training to increase prescribing  (Sarradon-Eck, Bouchez, Auroy, Schuers, & Darmon, 2021) . A survey of dietitians across three countries found that education and training would improve the low use of apps with patients to drive behaviour change  (Chen, Lieffers, Bauman, Hanning, & Allman-Farinelli, 2017) . A survey of PCPs in the US found providers were open to using mobile apps and tracking devices with patients, particularly to track physical activity, but were concerned over patient level barriers such as cost  (Holtz, Vasold, Cotten, Mackert, & Zhang, 2019) . Interviews with oncologists found they were open to using apps with their patients, but had concerns including app quality, workflow integration and patient access to smartphones  (Berkowitz et al., 2017) . Finally, interviews of a diverse set of health care providers in England found participants were looking for published studies and endorsement from a trusted body when recommending apps  (Leigh & Ashall-Payne, 2019) . To my knowledge, no study to date has used an explicit theoretical framing to explore physician attitudes to recommending health apps. Further, there has been no study looking at views of physicians in Canada."

      "title": "Knowledge action gap",
      "text": "The challenges of impacting clinician behaviors to adopt rapidly evolving new evidence into clinical practice is well documented  (Straus, Tetroe, & Graham, 2013; Shojania et al., 2007)  There are concerns that traditional methods of translating knowledge to clinicians, including systematic reviews do not enable clinical care to keep up with the pace of knowledge generation  (Shojania et al., 2007) . This phenomenon is often referred to as the knowledge to action gap  (Graham et al., 2006) . This is also true for knowledge translation related to mobile health apps, which can evolve at a rapid pace or be replaced or discontinued within months  (Glasgow et al., 2013) . One study suggests it takes over a year for reviews of health apps to be published in medical journals, at which point the reviewed apps have likely changed or become obsolete  (Larsen, M. et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is essential that along with ongoing efforts to develop and evaluate the quality of mobile health technologies, we must understand how we can bridge the \"knowledge-action gap\" and facilitate physicians to rapidly uptake high quality, evidence based, digital health apps for self-management with their patients. Using this principle from integrated knowledge translation, where the needs of the knowledge users are considered as evidence is built, can significantly help uptake of evidence-based practices  (Straus et al., 2013) .\n\nSeveral groups have attempted more innovative approaches to bridge the knowledge-action gap for mobile technology by conveniently presenting reviews and curated lists of health apps on readily available websites. In 2013, the NHS in the UK developed an \"App Library\" which was intended to be a formulary of high quality apps clinicians could recommend to their patient use  (Wicklund, 2018)  . However, the site was closed 2 years later when a study found many recommended apps had privacy and security threats  (Huckvale, Prieto, Tilney, Benghozi, & Car, 2015) . Efforts to rebuild the site, with increased evaluation steps are now underway  (Wicklund, 2018) . In 2016, the Ontario Telemedicine Network launched Practical Apps, a site that aimed to review patient facing apps for chronic disease prevention and management. Primary care providers evaluated apps across 6 dimensions including efficacy, usability, privacy and access.\n\nIt differed from efforts in the UK, in that the reviews were explicitly meant to be a starting point for shared decision-making with patients, and not a formulary guaranteeing the quality of the apps. With Practical Apps, limitations on evaluating the privacy and security of apps were clearly stated. The site was operational for 3 years, until it was ceased due to budgetary constraints. Similarly, in the US, the American Academy of Family Physicians has started a series of reviews of digital health apps that can improve primary practice with topics such as smoking cessation, exercise and blood glucose tracking  (Rebedew, 2018) .\n\nUnfortunately, the impact of these programs on real world use of health apps remains unclear.\n\nOf note, these programs were not designed or evaluated using a theoretical foundation which may limit their ability to provide sustained system wide impact. Future programs may benefit from increased grounding in a theoretical understanding of clinician facilitators and barriers to increased use of patients facing mobile health apps for chronic disease management."

There is significant evidence that building targeted interventions, grounded in a theoretical understanding of behaviour change, can increase the adoption of evidence-based interventions and reduce the knowledge to action gap  (Straus et al., 2013) . However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies to date that use an implementation science lens to understand how to change physician behaviour and improve the use of mobile health apps for chronic disease self-management. To help fill this gap, this qualitative study will explore the following research question:\n\nWhat are the factors that influence primary care provider behaviours to recommend and support the use of evidence-based mobile health apps designed to help patients self-manage chronic disease?\n\nThe results will be analyzed and provide practical theory driven recommendations interventions that can be taken to improve the use of patients facing digital health tools in clinical care."

This has resulted in a field of research, called implementation science which is designed to \"promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other EBPs into routine practice to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and care\"  (Nilsen, 2015) . Its goal is to\" identify the facilitators and barriers to the uptake of evidence-based practice into routine practice\"  (Bauer & Kirchner, 2020) , while also developing specific interventions to address these findings  (Bauer & Kirchner, 2020) .\n\nImplementation science draws from multiple bodies of literature including psychology, behaviour science and organizational studies  (Bauer et al., 2015) . It is closely related to other bodies of work that look to address the knowledge action gap including knowledge translation  (Graham et al., 2006; Grimshaw, Eccles, Lavis, Hill, & Squires, 2012) . Knowledge translation is defined as an \"iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethicallysound application of knowledge to improve the health of Canadians, provide more effective health services and products and strengthen the health care system\" (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 2016). Both bodies of literature commonly descried barriers contributing to the knowledge action gap include organizational structures, competing personal demands and poor external validity of studies. Importantly, implementation science seeks to not only describe barriers and facilitators, but strives to test methods that promote evidence based care, through observation and controlled experimentation  (Bauer et al., 2015) .\n\nMuch of the work in implementation science is grounded in the use of theories, frameworks or models that attempt to explain the variables and relationships that predict the success or failure of a project implementation  (Nilsen, 2015) . Theories usually consist of a set of variables with defined relationships that can explain or predict the world  (Nilsen, 2015; Lynch et al., 2018) .\n\nWhile frameworks also contain a set of descriptive variables, they only describe phenomenon and do not offer explanations or testable hypotheses  (Nilsen, 2015; Lynch et al., 2018) . In contrast, models are often a purposeful simplification of a phenomenon with minimal explanations that are non the less still useful  (Nilsen, 2015; Lynch et al., 2018) . Frameworks and theories range from \"grand theories\" that may be applied to any domain, to those that have a more specific scope  (Nilsen, 2015) . Scope may range from personal behaviours, to organizational structures, to system wide policy drivers  (Nilsen, 2015) . A narrative review of implementation science theories, models and frameworks categorized existing ideas into three broad categories: those focused on the process of implementation, those focused on explaining factors that drive the outcomes of the implementation, and those focused on evaluating an implementation. These were further divided into 5 categories based on their method of development. Table  1  summarized these five areas.\n\nTable 1: Categories of implementation science theories, frameworks and models adapted from Nilsen et. al. (2015) Category Focus Description Examples Process models Describing the process of implementation Often grounded in nursing literature, these modes describes the process of translating research in practice and can be used as a practical guide to implementation Canadian Institutes of Health Research Knowledge Model of Knowledge Translation, K2A (Knowledge-to-Action) Framework, the Ottawa Model Determinant frameworks Explaining the factors that drive implementation outcomes Aim is to understand the domains that act as barriers or facilitators to implementation outcomes, without identifying causal mechanisms.

One process considers factors including 1) who the study is focused on, 2) when the study is being conducted, 3) what the aim of the study is, 4) how the data will be used and 5) what resources are available to support (Lynch et al., 2018). This study aims to understand the individual behaviour of physicians prescribing an app, as opposed to larger groups or organizational change. It is being conducted to plan for the implementation of future interventions, and does not seek to evaluate a current program or test broad hypotheses about health technology adoption by clinicians. Given practical resource constraints, this study is limited to data collection from providers, and not other stakeholders such as patients or system decision makers. The table below highlights several widely used implementation science approaches and its relevance to the aim of the study as described above.\n\nTable 2: Selected Implementation Science approaches and their relevance to current study (Lynch et al., 2018).

      "text": "Reviewing this summary, it was clear the use of a framework focused on explaining factors that drive the behaviour of individual providers was the most appropriate for this study  (Nilsen, 2015) . Given this study was looking to describe behaviours, and was not necessarily concerned with testable hypotheses or explanations, a framework approach was better suited than a theory.\n\nThe Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) is a widely used determinants framework, designed by psychologists and health service researchers, to understand factors that influence clinician adoption of evidence-based practices  (Atkins et al., 2017; Cane, O'Connor, & Michie, 2012; Phillips et al., 2015) . It provides a theoretical grounding to understand cognitive, social and environmental factors that impact behaviour change  (Atkins et al., 2017) . It was developed by mapping constructs from behaviour change and social cognitive theories  (Atkins et al., 2017) .\n\nThis resulted in 12 distinct domains, which were later updated to 14 distinct domains (see Table  2 ). This framework is well matched to understand the factors that impact physician support of self-management apps for their practice. Of note, the TDF is only well suited to research questions where a clear defined behavior of interest is defined at the outset. This is well matched to the research question of this study, which focuses on the specific behaviour of prescribing a health app.\n\nTable 3: Constructs of the Theoretical Domains Framework version 2.

In this model, the domains of the TDF are mapped to the COM-B model (see Figure  1 ), which describes the link between capability, opportunity and motivation in impacting behaviours  (Michie, van Stralen, & West, 2011) . Each of these three domains can then be linked to specific interventions, local and at a policy level, to drive behaviour change  (Cowdell & Dyson, 2019) . Creators of the BCW suggest the 3 distinct steps for development of a behaviour change intervention (see Figure 2).

      "text": "The study will employ qualitative methods to answer the research question described above.\n\nQualitative methods are well suited for understanding the \"what\" and \"why\" of complex phenomenon in health service research including mobile health  (Green & Thorogood, 2018) .\n\nPrevious quantitative studies had documented the low uptake of app prescribing among PCPs, and the aim of this study was to better understand the reasons for this more deeply. Qualitative methods are well suited for answering such questions.\n\nIn building a study design, we first looked to identify our philosophical groundings including understanding the ontological, epistemological and methodological assumptions that informed our work  (Creswell & Poth, 2018) . We employed a critical realist approach, which combines a realist ontology view (belief there is a real world that exists independent of our views) with a constructivist epistemology (belief that our knowledge of the world is our own construct)  (Maxwell, 2012) . This approach was designed in part to better understand adoption and diffusion of innovation  (Maxwell, 2012) . It dictates that that research methods that carefully consider the social, political and historical contexts can help uncover the \"reality\" of the social world, was employed  (Green & Thorogood, 2018) . This philosophical grounding is in contrast to a positivist approach, often used in biomedical research. A positivist approach assumes a stable and generalizable reality and places high important on empiric observation  (Green & Thorogood, 2018; Corry, Porter, & McKenna, 2019)  Despite common use, a positivist approach has been seen as reducing or over-simplifying the complexity of the human experience, and is often critiqued when used in social research  (Green & Thorogood, 2018; Corry, Porter, & McKenna, 2019) . A phenomenology approach was also considered, as it seeks to understand the essence of a concept, often looking at the meaning or experience of participants, but was not as well suited for the research questions.\n\nWhen choosing the primary methods of data collection, interviews were selected as they are a widely accepted method to collect a participants beliefs about the world  (Atkins et al., 2017; Green & Thorogood, 2018) . Observation designs were considered, as they provide rich data collection in a natural context. However, given the infrequency and spontaneous nature of app prescriptions, practically observing such interactions would be challenging. Further, some have suggested that structured observation methods would not be sufficient to explore all domains of the TDF  (Atkins et al., 2017) .\n\nInterviews were chosen over similar methods such as focus groups, as they provide a safe space for participants to discuss their behaviours and avoid common limitations of focus groups including accessing marginal views  (Green & Thorogood, 2018) . However, it is important to note the limitations of interviews, including they cannot quantify health app use across a large group, and rely on participant recollection as opposed to direct observation which may bias results  (Green & Thorogood, 2018) ."

As previously discussed, primary care providers were selected as they are best positioned in the healthcare system to support chronic disease management through improved health behaviours and self-management. Inclusion criteria included clinicians who: 1) are a practicing primary care provider (MD or NP) in Ontario, 2) care for patients with chronic diseases as part of their routine care, 3) speak conversational English and 4) consent to participate in a 45 minute interview. Eligibility criteria was purposely kept broad to ensure a representative sample of primary care providers. Previous use of health apps with patients was not a requirement for eligibility, as their low use across the target population would limit recruitment and excluded the insights from those who considered recommending apps, but then did not adopt the desired behavior.\n\nWe employed a convenience and maximum variation sampling strategy to gain perspective across a range of clinician characteristics, including age, specialty, practice type (rural vs urban)\n\nand self-described comfort with digital health technology, while balancing the practical resource constraints of the project. Maximum variation sampling, which seeks to find common themes from a diverse set of participants, can facilitate insights and programmatic design that cuts across heterogeneous populations  (Patton, 1990) . Initially 10 participants were recruited for initial data analysis, and then new participants were recruited in groups of 2-3 until no new themes emerged  (Francis et al., 2010) ."

Therefore, recruiting through this extensive network provided significant opportunity to build a diverse sample of providers.\n\nSecond, providers were recruited from the network of the Centre for Effective Practice (CEP).\n\nThis organization has a 15-year history working with primary care providers across Ontario to improve the use of evidence in practice. Programs include academic detailing and clinical decision-making tools. The organization has a long history of primary care engagement, and thus has built a robust network across the province (CEP: About, 2021)\n\nThe study principal investigator (PI) sent an invitation email to potential participants identified in the research team's network. The director of CEP sent an email on the PI's behalf to members of their community, particularly those working in rural settings (purposive sampling). The email described the study and potential participants were encouraged to email the PI to indicate if they are or are not interested in the study (See Appendix 1) If a potential participant was interested in the study, they were emailed the consent documents prior to meeting the research team. In most cases, consent was obtained over the telephone using a predetermined script. Alternatively, the PI met with the participant in person to obtain informed consent if that was preferred.\n\nParticipants were given the opportunity to review the documents and ask questions as needed."

      "title": "Data collection",
      "text": "Interviews followed a semi-structured format, using an interview guide influenced by the TDF (see  Appendix 2) . A semi-structure approach promotes a natural, more conversational interview, while still providing guidance to ensure key themes are explored  (Atkins et al., 2017; Patton, 2007) . The guide included open ended questions, followed by probes to gather deeper insights into behaviours impact PCPs behaviours to recommend self-management apps  (Patton, 1990a) . Questions were developed using previously published guidance on how to develop questions based on the TDF  (Tarricone et al., 2019) . Further, interview guides from published studies that used the TDF were reviewed for further insights  (Atkins et al., 2017; Huijg, Gebhardt, Crone, Dusseldorp, & Presseau, 2014; Taylor, Lawton, & Conner, 2013; Taylor, Parveen, Robins, Slater, & Lawton, 2013) . The guide was piloted with two physicians and feedback was reviewed with the research team including experts in implementation science and applying the TDF.\n\nAll interviews were conducted by the PI, who is trained in research ethics and interviewing techniques. Interviews were held in person or on the phone at a time and location that was convenient for the participant. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and deidentified by a transcription service.\n\nParticipants were given a unique identifier which was used throughout data collection. There was a separate document which links participant numbers to each participant and this document will be password protected and only accessible by the principal investigator. Hardcopy participant recruitment data, interview notes, and qualitative observations were securely stored at Women's College Hospital in a locked cabinet. These documents, along with audio recordings of interviews were securely electronically transcribed with inadvertent identifiers removed, and stored in a password-protected internal Women's College Hospital drive until the end of the required data retention period (10 years). All data within this drive was solely accessible to the PI. Audio recordings were stored on the same password-protected internal server. Once all data was collected and analyzed the all hard copy documents, including the document linking participant ID and identifying were destroyed by the PI along with the audio recordings."

This is contrast to primarily inductive methods, where themes are informed solely by the data and do not try to conform to existing theory  (Green & Thorogood, 2018) . A more deductive approach was selected given the availability of research conducted around physician behavior change, and the presence of previous studies which had taken a more inductive approach to similar research questions. Further, a deductive approach has been successfully established for implementation studies using the TDF  (Atkins et al., 2017) .\n\nInitial reflection on the data was conducted in an ongoing fashion throughout the data collection period by the primary researcher. Data saturation was reached when new interviews do not contribute any new ideas to the research question. Thus, the final sample size was informed by the data."

This is contrasted with other methods such as grounded theory which attempts to build generalizable theory and phenomenological analysis which attempts to explain the \"essence\" of an experience  (Creswell, Hanson, Clark Plano, & Morales, 2007) . A directed content analysis approach, which coding is grounded in theory, was utilized, as the TDF provided a strong theoretical underpinning from which to develop the analysis  (Atkins et al., 2017; Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) . However, it is important to note limitations of this approach. In particular, starting from a theoretical framework introduces strong bias, and may lead the researcher to overlook important themes or insights  (Creswell et al., 2007) .\n\nSeveral authors have outlined key steps in a content analysis approach. Elo & Kyng\u00e4s (2008)  outline three overarching steps for a deductive coding analysis: preparation, organizing and reporting. For this study, we followed the four steps outlined by  Green & Thorogood (2018)  including: familiarization with the data, identifying codes and themes, coding and organizing the codes.\n\nThe primary researcher (PA) initially familiarized herself with the data, by reading all transcriptions. A coding guide was then developed based on the TDF and additional salient issues and was reviewed by the full research team (includes members with expertise in using the TDF for qualitative research studies). Transcripts were coded by the study lead (PA), using NVivo, throughout the data collection process. The study PI read participants' answers and was coded into the domains that best reflect key themes. Difficulties applying the coding guide were reviewed with the entire research team and the guide were refined as necessary. The resulting themes were then organized, with statements that centered on the same theme or polar opposites of a theme were grouped together for the ease of further analysis."

While there is some debate over the importance of assessing rigour in qualitative methods ( comparison to quantitative methods), it can still be useful to reflect on the use and impact of these steps in a qualitative analysis  (Barbour, 2001) . Sandelowski (1986)  specifies four domains to assess rigour in qualitative methods including 1) credibility to assess \"truth value\", 2) fittingness to assess applicability, 3) auditability to assess consistency and 4) confirmability to assess neutrality.\n\nCommonly outlined steps to improve rigor include 1) improving auditability by clearly documenting the steps and logic taken by the research, 2) improve credibility and fittingness by utilizing member check-in to reflect on analysis with participants, having multiple researchers conduct the analysis, and conducting triangulation from multiple data sources and 3) improving confirmability by recognizing the subjective nature of qualitative research and being aware of \"reflexivity\" and role of the researcher  (Mays & Pope, 2000; Barbour, 2001; Green & Thorogood, 2018; Sandelowski 1986 ).\n\nSeveral attempts were made to improve rigour of the analysis, however these efforts were limited due to constraints on the project due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on non-COVID related research and redeployment of research staff. The initial analysis was conducted solely by the primary researcher due to these limitations. Further, member check-in was not feasible, as PCPs were very busy responding to the pandemic. However, frequent check ins with the research team and additional researchers with experience in implementation science throughout the research process enhanced the rigour of the results. Analysis was conducted using the computer program NVivo, which provides clear documentation on how the interviews were coded and grouped into themes. The author reflected on personal biases and experiences that may have influenced the analysis as described below. As constraints ease, a second researcher, familiar with qualitative methods will follow the same analysis steps on the data. Resulting themes will be compared, discussed and harmonized to add rigor to the overall analysis."

Confidence in explaining the risks and benefits of apps to patients was mixed, with lack of knowledge being the main driver of low confidence.\n\nWith regard to diabetes, high blood pressure, really none.

Personal motivation to change was also mentioned by many who felt apps had little benefit if the patient was not motivated. Several participants mentioned that their perceptions that older adults do not use technology are likely biased, and some have older patients who have embrace apps. Less likely? Probably, maybe, this is stereotyping, but probably more of a geriatric or private care population, and then just pediatrics. Adolescents, I think, should be okay. They tend to be very mobile-friendly, but \u2026 and then, maybe, depending on the language of the app, too \u2026 some patients that don't speak English, necessarily. -pt 01 Cognitive function would probably be the biggest limitation around it, and if apps had high data requirements, that would be another one that some patients don't have data plans and stuff, and so that would be the only thing. But as to who I would never use it on, I don't think that's an absolute because it depends on the value derived and the risk individually. -pt 02 First of all a patient would have to be motivated to use a health app, secondly that they would have the cognitive language, cultural ability to work with an app. -pt06 And there's always this challenge between, is there ageism in technology recommendations? Is there socioeconomic status indicators that might suggest uptake of technology? \u2026.But I have patients that are across the age spectrum that are willing to use apps. -pt 04\n\nThe patients who don't believe in medications, there are some patients who are like, I don't want to be on these medications, they are motivated. In terms of diabetes, if it's like, okay game on, let's work on your intake, your nutrition, 80% of it is your nutrition and then 20% your exercise. So, if they can use an app to guide them in those principles then that would be a good candidate -pt12\n\nSo, here's the problem with having patients do it, though. So, in the northern town where I am, not everyone has a computer. They've only had cell phone service for about five years, so people have cell phones, but that's a small screen. And it's not necessarily \u2026 not everyone has access to a computer. -pt14"

So, where does this information filter? I'm not sure. -pt11 2.2.2 Quality of current evidence Providers expressed challenges in understanding what core elements of an app provide benefit to patients. Many felt current evidence did not include information on specific app features that they felt were important to understand before recommending an app, such as price and privacy. The ideal would be to play with the app, understand how it works and understand its strengths and weaknesses. Seeing the evidence, that it has been trialled somewhere that's shown clear benefit and minimal if any harm for patients using it, that it's cost-effective for patients to buy, that it's easy for a patient to use and that it does what it says it does. -pt06 But to me, I think it's important for people to know what's happening to your data. In general, I don't think that health information should be made available for commercial use by private companies. -pt 03\n\nThey come and go, and their features change, and they're sometimes available and sometimes not.

Some expressed concerns that were explicitly trying to get their patients to use less technology in their lives, and therefore a health app seemed counterproductive.\n\nI think the big challenge has always been, how does that theory about when an app might be helpful, to actually turn into an app on someone's phone. And that's something that's been very challenging to do. Probably the most common type of tool I recommend is around smoking cessation, but it's often challenging to get people engaged without having access to their phone or things like that. -pt04\n\nThe only thing I really don't like is I find technology is just way too overused, and so that's problematic because then I'm telling patients to use more of it. Especially when it comes to the mental health world, a good chunk of the time I feel that a lot of our problems are associated with too much technology use. I feel almost like a hypocrite suggesting it to them when I think it might help, but at the same time I'm trying to get them off technology, and using apps and things. -pt10\n\nWill they now do something else because I've given too much a burden to think about, a distraction?

And then it's like you're only working digitally. So they can get the blood work and the idea is you're going to get the blood work and then follow up and come in for an actual diabetes visit.

      "title": "Summary of results",
      "text": "By explicitly using an implementation science framework, this study sheds light on the facilitators and barriers of Canadian primary care providers when considering the recommendation of apps to their patients to support chronic disease management. It highlights that primary care providers are interested in recommending apps to patients and feel there are potential benefits related to tracking of health data. Importantly, almost all participants felt supporting chronic disease management was an integral part of their role and using high quality mobile health apps with patients could be a useful tool in these efforts. However, providers did express several concerns with the use of health apps. In particular, providers were concerned over a potential negative impact of apps on their therapeutic relationship with patients. Further, providers expressed concerns over the impact of the private companies who produce most apps on issues such as data privacy and cost.\n\nOne of most commonly expressed barriers to increased use of apps included gaps in knowledge.\n\nThis has three distinct aspects. First, many providers were not aware of current evidence regarding apps for chronic disease management and none were aware of the specific recommendations in the Canadian Diabetes Guidelines to use apps with patients. Second, providers who were aware of the evidence felt it did not provide clear guidance on when apps would provide true health benefits to their patients. Finally, while some providers could identify useful patients facing health apps, most stated challenges in learning about new high quality apps for potential use.\n\nThrough the discussion, participants were able to identify interventions that have or could help them increase how often the recommended health apps to their patients. First, many participants highlighted the need for a curated list of high quality apps. It was important to them that this list be created by physicians or organizations with strong credibility. Interestingly, only a few were aware of previous efforts by OTN to fill this gap through practicalapps.ca. Others suggested that patient-facing resources in the clinic, such as handouts, would be helpful in facilitating patients' use of specific apps. Finally, some suggested that greater EMR integration, both when recommending apps and when reviewing the generated data, would facilitate use.\n\nImportantly, several domains of the TDF were not found to be significant drivers in PCP use of apps with their patients. For example, almost no participants mentioned emotions as a key factor in this behaviour. Further, no one identified explicit reinforcements, such as payment, as being helpful. Few providers had a specific intention to increase current use in their practice. The reasons for these domains being less prominent is unclear. Previous papers have cited physician concerns regarding payment and billing models as a significant barrier to increasing the adoption of virtual care tools  (Bhatia et al., 2020) . It is plausible that participants because participants felt chronic disease management was already part of their role, additional payment was not needed.\n\nHowever, it is also plausible that providers do not have enough experience prescribing apps to quantify the additional time it takes and the additional payment required to support this behaviour."

      "title": "Comparison to Literature",
      "text": "The findings of our study parallels several themes found in other studies looking at physician attitudes toward recommending apps. Several previous studies have identified gaps in knowledge as a key barrier to increased app use  (Berkowitz et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Gagnon et al., 2015; Leigh & Ashall-Payne, 2019) . However, our study is the first to clearly identify 3 different types of gaps in knowledge. This is important as each requires a different approach to resolution, at different points in the Knowledge to Action Cycle  (Graham et al., 2006) . First, our work suggests that greater efforts are needed to ensure knowledge generation, particularly synthesis of evidence surrounding health apps, is tailored to the decision making need of clinicians when recommending an app. More specifically, our participants have echoed previous work which suggests that research should have less focus on understanding effectiveness of individual apps, and instead understand the mechanisms that make apps successful in behaviour change  (Mendiola, Kalnicki, & Lindenauer, 2015; Michie, Yardley, West, Patrick, & Greaves, 2017; Zhao et al., 2016) . Second, challenges with identifying high quality apps for real world clinic use, suggest greater work is needed to adapt knowledge to a local context. Apps appropriate for use in one country or patient population, may not be relevant in another area. For example, one participant mentioned unique barriers to using apps with a rural Canadian population. Therefore, local health systems must create their own mechanisms for making clinicians aware of apps that could be used with their unique patient population  (Boudreaux et al., 2014) . Finally, greater work is needed to identify barriers to knowledge use.\n\nIn particular, participants were not able to identify recommendations in clinical guidelines regarding apps use. While guidelines are often seen as a key tool for knowledge translation, it appears it is not a sufficient mechanism for increasing PCP use of apps with patients.\n\nSimilar to other studies, our participants expressed several concerns with expanding the use of apps with their patients. Concerns related to private vendors developing apps, including pricing, data privacy and information accuracy, have been described in previous studies of health care providers  (Holtz et al., 2019; Leigh & Ashall-Payne, 2019) . Several PCPs also expressed concerns over the potential for apps to have a negative impact on their therapeutic relationship with patients, which has not been previously described by the literature. Interestingly, a previous review shows patients prefer to use apps as an additional tool to care from their providers, and do not wish for it to replace the patient-provider relationship  (Vo, Auroy, & Sarradon-Eck, 2019) . Further exploration in this area would be helpful, with an emphasis on finding a model for app use that supports a mutually beneficial patient-provider relationship. Our participant's concerns about over burdening patients with technology use is supported by previous literature regarding app usage. Studies found that most patients stop using health apps within months of initiation  (Birnbaum, Lewis, Rosen, Ranney, & Miner, 2015) . High burden of data entry was often cited as a reason for disliking or abandoning an app  (Krebs & Duncan, 2015) . Unfortunately, there is currently little guidance for patients or providers to better understand the impact of health app data entry on health.\n\nParticipants in our study frequently cited patient level factors as critical to determining if it was appropriate to recommend an app or not. Many cited age as a factor, as they felt older adults would be less likely to use apps. A few participants did acknowledge that this may be a biased view, and have had older patients that embrace apps. This is consistent with literature on app use among older adults. Studies show that smartphone use among older adults is growing, and they are willing to use health apps that are well designed  (Parker, Jessel, Richardson, & Reid, 2013) .\n\nParticipants also cited patient motivation to use health apps as a key driver of them recommending a health app.\n\nThis highlights the need to better understand how to match the needs of the patients with the features of a health app. In parallel to this work, the research team has also conducted a review of criteria used to measure the quality of an app  (Agarwal et al., 2021) . Our work found that most studies do not evaluate apps for features known to be important to patients with chronic diseases. For example, a review of patient-centered chronic disease management highlighted the importance of \"legitimizing the illness experience\" and \"offering realistic hope\"  (Hudon et al., 2012) . Patients have frequently expressed the need for apps to be tailored to their specific needs  (Vo et al., 2019) . Previous work has shown that patient engagement with apps, and their ultimate clinical impact, are highly influenced by patient characteristics including self-efficacy and beliefs about digital health tools  (Desveaux et al., 2018) . It is possible that highly engaged and motivated patients will be approaching their providers about potential health apps they have found, while others will require more hands on guidance from their PCP. Future work should continue to explore how patient characteristics drive health apps use and how apps can be designed to better meet the unique needs of individual patients. Our study suggests that previous efforts to develop a curated list of apps, such as practicalapps.ca, had some potential to impact behaviour by addressing identified knowledge gaps. However, our results highlight several potential features that might increase impact. First, reviews of apps should more thoroughly explore the underlying mechanisms that make an app effective. Further reviews should highlight how an app might or may not meet the specific needs of a patient. For example, apps may be classified as being appropriate for those new to a disease, those who are highly motivated, or those who are highly concerned about privacy and security."

      "text": "Our study suggests that app reviews or app formularies need to be endorsed by organizations that are already seen as trusted resources for clinical information to increase credibility and impact.\n\nThis includes both disease specific organizations (Ontario Lung Association, Health and Stroke Foundation etc.) and more general clinical groups (College of Family Physicians of Canada etc.).\n\nFinally, our participants in our study felt strongly that app reviews and curated lists should include patient facing components that integrate into clinical workflows. For example, many felt a handout that lists potential apps which physicians can give to their patients would be helpful.\n\nOthers suggested creating a feature that allows patients and providers to explore an app and its functions together, before a patient commits to downloading it on their personal phone.\n\nAdditional suggested interventions to increase the prescribing of apps includes peer supports and EMR integration. Peer supports and clinician champions have been found to be a helpful intervention in increasing the use of other forms of digital technology including EMRs  (Boonstra & Broekhuis, 2010) . Health systems could consider building a team of app experts that can go into the offices of clinicians to review best evidence and integration to workflows to increase the appropriate prescribing of apps with patients. Integration of app data directly into the EMR was seen as important by some study participants, but not others. Some cited concerns that integrating app data directly into EMRs would burden clinicians with too much data that was not clinically helpful. Building automated decision support into EMRs that flags when apps might be useful in the clinical context could be a more acceptable way to leverage EMR workflows to improve app prescribing."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "This study has several key strengths and limitations. It is one of the few studies on the attitudes of physicians towards prescribing medical apps that is grounded in a theoretical framework designed to understand behaviour change among clinicians. However, use of a predetermined framework and deductive coding approach, may have limited insights into areas not covered by the framework or novel themes not previously covered in the literature. Given that several previous studies have explored this topic through an inductive analysis, and the established validity of using the TDF to understand changes in physician behavior, the analysis approach of this study provided unique insights despite limitations.\n\nAlthough our study took an in-depth look at the physician behaviour of prescribing apps, we did not explore the behaviours and supports required to promote ongoing use of apps by patients.\n\nThis is important, as many digital health tools suffer from poor adoption, or discontinuation after a short period of use. Thus, the prescribing of an app in only the first step, and patients will likely need ongoing supports and engagement to drive meaningful use. Future studies should explore facilitators, barriers and possible interventions to promote ongoing use by patients.\n\nRelated to this, our study focused on the behaviours and needs of PCPs and did not interview or explore the needs of patients regarding the prescribing or use of apps.\n\nRecruitment for this study was built on a practical strategy, including both convenience and maximum variability sampling. While convenience sampling allowed for rapid recruitment of participants, it may have introduced some bias, as participants had a prior relationship with the researcher. However, the majority of participants were recruited through the CEP, which has broad reach across the province. This strategy enabled recruitment of a diverse set of physicians with no prior relationship to the research team, thus strengthening the validity of the findings.\n\nThe study only included Ontario based clinicians, so results may not be applicable to other jurisdictions, especially those that have a significantly different health care systems.\n\nGiven the constraints of resourcing and the pandemic, the analysis of this paper only included one researcher who reviewed and coded each transcript, which may lead to bias in the results.\n\nPractical steps to limit this bias included review of coding strategies with experts in implementation science and digital health throughout the coding process. Prior to publication of this work, results will be independently analyzed by a second researcher and discrepancies in resulting themes will be reviewed and resolved as a team."

By mapping the most commonly referenced TDF domains in our interviews to the COM-B model, our study suggests PCPs in Canada have the motivation to prescribe health apps, but require interventions targeting opportunity and capability. A review of behaviour change models suggests targeted interventions to address these domains on both an individual and policy level. Individual level interventions relevant to our findings include providing positive examples clinicians can aspire to, changing the physical and social environment to improve use, increasing knowledge and understanding and using communication to increase positive feelings (Michie, 2014). Participants in our study suggested several interventions they felt would support increased prescribing of apps with their patients. Their suggestions for increasing app use align well with BCW constructs outlined in the theory including: a curated list of apps (increase knowledge), use of peer recommendations (providing positive examples), and improving technology workflow integration (changing physical environment)."

IJINFOMGT.2017.08.006 Appendix 1: Invitation Email Subject: Study about Physician attitudes towards use of digital health apps for chronic disease self management Dear << provider's name>>, I am writing to invite you to participate in a study that aims to understand physician attitudes toward using digital health apps with patients to support self-management of chronic illness. The goal is to use the insights from this project to build interventions that support physicians in adopting evidence-based health apps with their patients. We want to invite providers like you who have experience caring for patients with chronic illness, especially Type 2 Diabetes.\n\nIf you choose to participate, you will be invited to take part in a facilitated 45-minute interview either in person or by phone during which you will provide details on your current experiences and thoughts around digital health apps.\n\nPlease contact the study primary investigator, Payal Agarwal at payal.agarwal@wchospital.ca mailto:marianne.saragosa@wchospital.cano later than August 1 st , 2019 to indicate if you are or are not interested in participating in the study. If you are interested, you will receive an email containing details on the project consent process and scheduling.\n\nThank you for considering this request, and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nBest regards, Dr. Payal Agarwal WCH Family Physician and Innovation Fellow 416-323-6400 x7509 payal.agarwal@wchospital.ca Appendix 2: Interview Guide Introduction: The general aim of the interview is to help us understand how you use mobile based apps to support self-management with your patients. We want to know what might impact your choice to use a mobile app with your patients to help them manage chronic diseases, specifically diabetes. There is no right or wrong answers here; we are trying to understand how different clinicians approach this issue, so please answer frankly. I'd like to start with some basic question about your practice: 1. What type of setting do you practice in? (community vs. academic, solo vs. team) 2. How many years have you practiced? 3. How many patients are in your practice? How many patients do you typically see in a day? 4. How often do you treat someone with type 2 diabetes. How often is supporting selfmanagement part of that treatment? What other people/resources help you with this in your practice? Some questions may seem repetitive, but please bear with me as the questions are derived from different theories of human behaviour and we are trying to figure out which theories best apply in this area. Are you ready to get started? I'll be asking about \"patients you see in your clinic who have Type 2 diabetes and could benefit from increased self-management support\" -I'd like you to think about that for a moment\u2026 When I say self-management apps I am thinking about mobile phone based applications that can support multiple aspects of managing diabetes at home or in the community including medication adherence, blood glucose tracking, as well as exercise and diet. These apps may or may not have integration with clinicians' electronic health records and may or may not integrate with the health system. Knowledge 5. Are you aware of any comments in the Canadian Diabetes guidelines regarding digital health apps for self-management for diabetes? 6. What is your understanding of the evidence regarding digital health apps for self-management for diabetes? 7. Are you aware of any specific apps your patients can use to help them better manage their diabetes? Skills 8. What expertise do you think a clinician needs to effectively recommend self-management apps to patients with diabetes? 9. What experience do you have recommending self-management apps to patients with diabetes?"

      "description": "Our study suggests several opportunities to increase the use of mobile health apps to support patients with chronic diseases. By mapping the most commonly referenced TDF domains in our interviews to the COM-B model, our study suggests PCPs in Canada have the motivation to prescribe health apps, but require interventions targeting opportunity and capability. A review of behaviour change models suggests targeted interventions to address these domains on both an individual and policy level. Individual level interventions relevant to our findings include providing positive examples clinicians can aspire to, changing the physical and social environment to improve use, increasing knowledge and understanding and using communication to increase positive feelings (Michie, 2014). Participants in our study suggested several interventions they felt would support increased prescribing of apps with their patients. Their suggestions for increasing app use align well with BCW constructs outlined in the theory including: a curated list of apps (increase knowledge), use of peer recommendations (providing positive examples), and improving technology workflow integration (changing physical environment)."
