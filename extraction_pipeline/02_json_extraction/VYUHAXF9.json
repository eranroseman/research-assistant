  "abstract": "1) Background: The use of smart devices to better manage diabetes has increased significantly in recent years. These technologies have been introduced in order to make life easier for patients with diabetes by allowing better control of the stability of blood sugar levels and anticipating the occurrence of dangerous events (hypo/hyperglycemia), etc. That being said, the main objectives of the self-management of diabetes is to improve the lifestyle and life quality of patients with diabetes; (2) Methods: We performed a systematic review based on articles that focus on the use of smart devices for the monitoring and better management of diabetes. The search was focused on keywords related to the topic, such as \"Diabetes\", \"Technology\", \"Self-management\", \"Artificial Intelligence\", etc. This was performed using databases, such as Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed; (3) Results: A total of 89 studies, published between 2011 and 2021, were included. The majority of the selected research aims to solve a diabetes management problem (e.g., blood glucose prediction, early detection of risk events, and the automatic adjustment of insulin doses, etc.). In these studies, wearable devices were used in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques; (4) Conclusions: Wearable devices have attracted a great deal of scientific interest in the field of healthcare for people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes. They are capable of assisting in the management of diabetes, as well as preventing complications associated with this condition. Furthermore, the usage of these devices has improved illness management and quality of life.",

      "text": "Diabetes is a persistent disease in which the level of sugar in the blood is high. It can be caused by either a lack or absence of insulin production, or by a loss of insulin effectiveness  [1] . The principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose present in the blood by most cells (muscle and fat cells) is insulin. When insulin is not available in sufficient quantities, glucose can no longer be absorbed by the cells in the body that need it and therefore its normal use is disrupted  [2] .\n\nThis disease is one of the world's fastest growing health problems of the twenty-first century, with the number of diabetics more than tripling in the last 20 years. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), diabetes infected 463 million people globally in 2019, which means that 1 in 11 adults (20-79 years of age) has diabetes. Furthermore, The IDF estimates that 578 million adults will have diabetes by 2030, and 700 million by 2045  [3, 4] .\n\nThe main categories of diabetes are \"type 1 diabetes (T1D)\", \"type 2 diabetes (T2D)\", and \"gestational diabetes (GDM)\". Type 1 diabetes affects around 8% of all patients of this disease. In this type, the body produces little or no insulin. The treatment of type 1 diabetes is insulin injection. T1D can affect people of any age, but it is mainly present in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common and accounts for about 90% of all forms of diabetes, and it is most frequently diagnosed in elderly people. Generally, it is characterized by insulin resistance. Lastly, the type 3 gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that first appears during pregnancy and usually disappears shortly after delivery  [5] [6] [7] .\n\nDiabetes is a disease characterized by fluctuating blood sugar levels that increase or decrease. The persistence of this abnormality over a long period of time increases the likelihood that the patient with diabetes will develop other health problems. Most of these complications commonly occur in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We distinguish chronic diabetic complications into two broad categories: microvascular complications and macrovascular ones, the prevalence of which is much higher in the former than in the latter  [8] . Among the microvascular complications are nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, whereas those of the macrovascular type are coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and stroke  [9] .\n\nOver the last decade, there has been a tremendous increase in consumer contact with technology and artificial intelligence  [10] . Consumers' usage of wearable technology is part of the current technological revolution. Wearable devices, or simply wearables, are defined by Wright et al.  [11]  as smart computers integrated into various accessories, such as clothing, fashion accessories, smartwatches, and other everyday objects worn by customers. The application of these technologies in healthcare is rapidly increasing. This is due to the variety of sensors that these gadgets are equipped with, including those that detect sound, images, body movements, and ambient light levels  [12] .\n\nA process called predictive analytics uses a range of machine learning algorithms, data mining techniques, and statistical approaches to find patterns or signals and predict future occurrences from current and past data. Predictive analytics, when applied to health data, can help make critical choices and predictions. Machine learning and regression techniques are used to perform this predictive analysis. This method aims to diagnose a disease as accurately as possible, to better care for patients, to make the best use of resources, and to achieve better clinical outcomes  [13] . Machine learning is viewed as one of the most important aspects of artificial intelligence, as it allows for the design of computer systems that can learn from previous experience without the need for programming for every situation.\n\nThe combination of artificial intelligence approaches and advanced technologies, such as medical devices, wearable devices, and sensor technologies, could enable the development and implementation of better chronic disease management services  [14] . In this paper, diabetes is the health problem addressed.\n\nIn recent years, new technologies have been created for the management of diabetes and its complications. In this article, in the form of a systematic literature review, we will give an overview and clearer idea of current technologies (smart wearables) as well as AI techniques used to help manage this disease. AI has substantial applications in four primary fields of diabetes care: automated retinopathy detection, clinical decision support, predictive population risk stratification, and patients' self-tools  [15, 16] .\n\nThe accumulated literature about diabetes management with different tools based on artificial intelligence is vast and difficult to grasp. In this article, we aim to classify and review the most relevant works. Our objective is to present in a clear and more relevant way the advancement of science in the field of diabetes management using smart devices and machine learning.\n\nPrevious reviews dealing with the topic of diabetes management (see Table  1 ) have mostly been focused on the use of just mobile applications. We even find, as mentioned in Table  1 , that these reviews cover the subject in less depth. Other studies only focus on a specific type of diabetes or on a specific age group. The fact that we focused on reviewing each of the included studies individually, as well as providing detailed results for each, allows us to provide a more in-depth view, to the point of questioning aspects traditionally taken for granted.\n\nTable 1. Previous reviews dealing with the topic of diabetes management (Published on 2021)."

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that concentrates on developing algorithms capable of learning from data and improving their performances over time without being programmed to do so  [32] .\n\nThe use of AI in healthcare is becoming increasingly more popular, as shown in Figure  4 , based on Google Trends data over the past decade  [33] . Here, the x-axis indicates specific dates, and the y-axis represents the corresponding popularity ranking, which ranges from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum).

The worldwide popularity rating for the term \"ai healthcare\" within a range of 0 (min) to 100 (max) in time, where the x-axis represents the timestamp information and the y-axis shows the corresponding score  [33] .\n\nSupervised Learning: One of the most powerful data analysis approaches in machine learning is the supervised learning model. In this type of learning, the system tries to learn from the labeled data the corresponding function (f ) that maps an input (x) to an output (y) (Figure  6 )  [37] . At the end of the learning process, we will get a function:\n\nwhich the algorithm will use for making predictions on unlabeled data  [34] . The output in this type of learning is obtained by data classification or regression (value prediction).\n\nClassification algorithms, such as the examples given in Figure  5 , are designed to predict distinct classes, while regression algorithms predict numerical values (e.g., the prediction of blood glucose values)  [38] .\n\nFigure  6  is an application of a supervised learning model, which allows a classification of diabetic retinopathy fundus images  [39] . This example is based on images obtained on the Kaggle platform  [40] .\n\nUnsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised machine learning, in unsupervised machine learning, the system attempts to find and discover the hidden data structure or the relationships between variables with no preexisting labels or specifications  [41] . The training data for this method consists of a set of data that is not labeled, categorized, or classified (Figure  7 )  [42] . The output of this type of learning is obtained by using one of the following main ML methods: clustering, association rules, and dimensionality reduction (Figure  5 ). The difference between clustering and classification is that clustering attempts to group a set of objects and determine if there is a relationship between these objects (no pre-defined classes), while classification attempts to classify new simple objects into known classes  [43] .\n\nClustering can be used in healthcare, for example, to identify groups of cohesive and well-separated patients with diabetes who share similar profiles (e.g., age and gender) as well as common clinical histories  [44] .\n\nSemi-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods. The learning in this kind of algorithm uses labeled and unlabeled data (Figure  5 )  [45] . This method is generally used to solve problems where the number of available data is large and only a very limited set of labeled data is present  [46] .\n\nOne of the application areas of semi-supervised learning is in healthcare. To illustrate, Whu et al. developed a diabetic predictive model using semi-supervised learning (the Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM))  [47] ."

The reinforcement learning algorithm (agent) is continually learning by interacting with the environment, aiming to explore the full range of possible states and to make the most proper decisions  [34] . The agent's actions affect the environment's state (Figure  8 ).\n\nThe integration of reinforcement learning in the healthcare industry has often led to better outcomes  [50] . As an example, this type of algorithm is used in people with diabetes to enhance their health and blood sugar control  [51] . Yom-Tov et al.

This application was associated with a learning algorithm, which was able to predict better messages that would encourage patients to exercise."

A set of training samples is provided throughout this procedure, with each sample split into distinct categories. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of machine learning algorithm that is commonly used to solve classification and regression issues  [53] .\n\nBayes Classification: Statistical classifiers are an example of Bayesian classifiers. Based on a given class label, naive Bayes determines the probability of class membership  [54] . It conducts a single scan of data, making categorization simple.\n\nDecision Tree: A decision tree (DT) is a classification method that consists of an internal node and a leaf node that has a class label. The decision tree's (DT) top nodes are referred to as root nodes. This technique is popular because it is simple to construct and does not require any parameters  [55] ."

A key disadvantage of logistic regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent and independent variables. It may be used to solve both classification and regression issues. However, it is most often employed to solve classification problems  [57] .\n\nAdaptive Boosting (AdaBoost): AdaBoost is an ensemble learning technique that uses an iterative strategy to improve weak classifiers by learning from their failures. Adaboost employs \"sequential ensembling\" as opposed to the random forest, which employs \"parallel ensembling\". It generates a strong classifier by assembling multiple low-performing classifiers to get a high-accuracy classifier. AdaBoost is best utilized to improve the performance of decision trees and the base estimator on binary classification tasks  [58] ."

These predicted glucose levels can be used to set early hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia alerts to define adequate insulin doses.

      "text": "This article is about a study conducted with 900 participants to evaluate the performance of the Medios artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm in detecting different types of diabetic retinopathy (DR).\n\nThe technology is a new AI algorithm based on convolutional neural networks using the fundus camera of a smartphone and operating offline. The system shows a high sensitivity (DR: 83.3%; RDR (referable diabetic retinopathy): 93%) and specificity (DR: 95.5%; RDR: 92.5%) for the diagnosis of both referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) and diabetic retinopathy.\n\nThe introduction of new technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, smart wearables (bracelets, smartwatches, smart clothing, and patches, etc.), and artificial pancreas (AP) development, and, arguably, the use of the data collected from these new tools, have revolutionized the overall diabetes management ecosystem over the past decade  [94] . There are powerful AI methods for designing models that aim to prevent events such as hypoglycemia, predict the value of blood glucose levels, and predict the right amount of insulin to administer, all with the goal of improving the quality of life and illness management of people with diabetes, designing personalized management for each patient  [95] , and saving them from complications due to diabetes and early mortality  [75] .\n\nAdvanced tools that are used for diabetes management include continuous glucose monitors (CGM). Nine studies have used this device to collect the data needed for the development of smart systems  [77, 79, 81, 82, 84, 86, 89, 90, 92] . Allam et al.  [79]  collected the inputs for a system that will be able to forecast future glucose concentration levels with prediction horizons (PH) of 15, 30, 45, and 60 min using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device. Similarly, Pustozerov et al.  [84]  employed the CGM to develop a blood glucose prediction model to successfully support women with gestational diabetes (GDM).\n\nNew deep learning algorithms were developed to automate the diagnosis of DR. Retinal screening based on AI is an attainable, precise, and highly accepted method for the detection and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy. A sensitivity (DR: 83.3%, RDR: 93%) and a specificity (DR: 95.5%; DRR: 92.5%) were reported for both the automated screening of referable diabetic retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy, as shown in the study conducted by Sosale et al.  [93] . Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a smartphone fundus camera were used to develop such a system.\n\nArtificial intelligence enables patients with diabetes to make daily decisions about diet and activity. There are many applications designed to analyze the contents of meals and provide detailed information on the nutritional and caloric value of foods. Anthimopoulos et al.  [78]  developed an application for patients to help them assess the quality and caloric value of the food they eat. The management of diabetes is more effective when patients take a picture of their own food and evaluate what they eat.\n\nPhysical exercise has been identified as one of the most effective initial prevention strategies for diabetes in high-risk individuals. With wearable devices that record the number of steps and the duration and intensity of activities, daily activity levels can be tracked. These technologies allow for the monitoring of daily activity and may encourage a person to include activity as part of their routine to better stabilize their blood glucose levels. Yom-Tov et al.  [52]  designed a reinforcement learning algorithm-based system that aims to personalize messages for each patient's situation in order to better encourage them to practice sports activities.\n\nAmong all the articles included, different techniques were employed with the aim of establishing a device that could properly manage or assist in the management of diabetes. By analyzing the results of the different papers, we can find that the most commonly employed function of the smart devices is the \"prediction of blood glucose levels\", with a percentage of (36.84%). We can also see that the most used approach is classification, with a percentage of 52.6% compared to regression, which was used in 47.4% of the studies. However, it is necessary to note that in future clinical applications it will be required to perform longitudinal studies in order to measure both the inter-and intra-subject variability. On the other hand, to conduct such studies can be challenging because the large-scale deployment of wearables can be financially and technically challenging."
