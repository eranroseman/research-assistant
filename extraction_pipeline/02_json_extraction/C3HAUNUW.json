  "title": "The effectiveness of text message delivered interventions for weight loss in developing countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Recent advances in mobile technologies have provided an opportunity to disseminate health information on a variety of health conditions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that text messaging helps people to lose weight, but the effectiveness of interventions varies between studies. Thus, this review aimed to (1) identify RCTs that used text messages for overweight management, (2) identify components of the interventions, and (3) test their effectiveness. PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Quality scores for selected articles were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for interventional studies. The effectiveness of the interventions was tested using random effect models. Twelve studies that met inclusion criteria were included in this review. Ten of the included studies reported that text message interventions had a significant effect on weight loss. The pooled mean difference in body mass index (BMI) change after the intervention was \u00c00.43 kg/m 2 (95% confidence interval, \u00c0 0.63 to -0.23 kg/m 2 ). Synthesis of the included studies provides evidence that (1) regular text messages; (2) interventions targeting weight monitoring, diet habit, and physical activity; and (3) the use of behavior change techniques led to significant weight loss.",

      "title": "| INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "The prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is currently on the rise worldwide, accounting for more than two-thirds of all deaths.  1  Nearly 80% of the deaths due to NCDs occur in developing countries and among adults between the ages of 30 and 70.  1  The everincreasing prevalence of NCDs imposes a disproportionate health and economic burden on developing countries. As well, in lowand middle-income countries (LMICs), the underdiagnosis of conditions like diabetes mellitus  2  often lead to its suboptimal management, adding to a range of challenges affecting the health, social, and economic developments in these settings.  3 However, NCDs can be prevented by reducing risk factors like overweight and obesity and its associated behavioral risk factors, such as physical inactivity, and dietary risks.  1  Overweight and obesity are among the common global risk factors for NCDs and are interlinked with other risk factors including hypertension and insulin resistance.  4 In 2016, nearly two billion adults over the age of 18 years were overweight, and more than a tenth of them were obese,  5  and these conditions were responsible for five million deaths and 148 million disability-adjusted life years.  6 Although obesity is recognized as a major problem in developed settings, obesity-related burden now causes a more severe impact among adults in developing countries. For instance, 60% of obesity-related deaths in Africa occur in people under the age of 60 years, as opposed to the 18% in developed countries.  7 To prevent this, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of simple, accessible, and cost-effective interventions to reduce risk factors, although the relevance and outcome may vary depending on the infrastructure, healthcare setup, and manpower across different countries.  1 bile communication is a rapidly expanding technology not only in developed countries but also in developing regions of the world. It has become the first choice of communication methods due to its easiness, adaptability, accessibility, and user preferences. There are many forms of mobile communications, such as phone calls, text messages, webpages, and social media, but text messaging is most widely used both in high-and low-income countries.  8 Following the rapid proliferation of mobile technologies, researchers have tried to show the acceptability and effectiveness of mobile phone delivered interventions to improve health outcomes, including maternal and child health, medication adherence, chronic disease care, clinic follow-ups, and risk behavior reductions.  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  Mobile health is a cost-effective intervention to change people's behavior and create awareness about health risks. It also helps to easily transmit health information to a wider audience, even in remote areas.  16 Research in developing countries has shown that people are willing to receive text messages related to their health. For example, a feasibility study on short text messaging for chronic disease management indicated that the overwhelming majority of participants were willing to receive messages about their health conditions, such as appointments, test results, and treatments.  17 A systematic review of short message services for disease prevention in the developing countries has also shown that text messages are acceptable to patients.  18 th regard to the effectiveness of text-based delivered interventions for weight loss, published systematic reviews, mostly focused on studies in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, reported that text message interventions are effective for weight loss in adolescents and adults.  [19] [20] 0] [21] [22]  However, the result of these studies cannot be generalized to developing countries due to differences in mobile phone utilization patterns, infrastructure, healthcare systems, and health-seeking behavior. In developing countries, evidence from controlled trials indicate that mobile text interventions led to improved disease-related knowledge, self-efficacy, treatment adherence, and change in health behavior in chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  Although overweight and obesity are manageable and reversible risk factors for NCDs, there is relatively scant evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in developing countries to provide best practices or interventions for overweight management. For instance, a bibliometric review in Africa shows that there have been few intervention studies on NCDs, with only 11 studies conducted over the past 12 years.  28"

Th  current review agrees with findings in previous studies; although people in developed countries have other alternative sources information and better healthcare systems that can easily be used to create awareness about NCDs, text message interventions were effective to help to lose weight, create awareness about overweight and obesity, and decrease level of behavioral problems. Text message delivered interventions could be scalable for overweight and obesity prevention and control by decreasing behavioral risk factors that could lead to excessive weight gain, such as physical inactivity and unhealthy diet including low consumption of fruit and vegetables, high fats, sugar, salt, and processed and fast foods.

This finding is similar with previous reviews on the effectiveness of text delivered messages for overweight management in adolescents  20  and with other similar reviews in adults. 21, 22  This is due to the fact that behavioral theories  55  are effective in transforming behavior and shape interventions from the outset. A theory may not result in significant outcome improvement in and of itself, but it does provide options and explanations for achieving the desired behavior.\n\nBesides, the use of theory would be useful for scientific application to refine or reject the theory.\n\nOn the other hand, the duration and frequency of the interventions were linked with significant weight loss in individuals with overweight and obesity. This finding is in line with previous systematic reviews of overweight and obesity management  [20] [21] [22] 53  and with another systematic review on physical activity  27  that showed longer duration and frequent interventions resulted in a more significant weight loss than interventions that lasted shortly or delivered infrequently. Thi  is understandably because behavior change is a process that requires time and repeated exposure until it becomes a habit and self-efficacy is achieved. 56 Therefore, consistent and frequent delivery of messages would result in improved adherence to physical activity and healthy diet habit, which could, in turn, contribute to significant weight loss. Pe taining to the use of additional adjuvant treatments, RCTs that incorporated combinations of interventions such as phone calls and group meetings resulted in a significant weight loss. This result is also consistent with previous studies 20,22 that most of the interventions that use combinations of treatments tended to increase efficiency of interventions. Using combinations of interventions might increase the adherence of participants to certain behaviors that would not have been realized with a single intervention modality. For instance, combining text messages and phone calls would result in better outcome as one might support or complement the other. However, when we use combination of interventions, it is difficult to identify or tell which part of interventions works best for achieving the desired outcome. Overweight and obesity are on a continuous rise in developing countries and are becoming major risk factors for chronic diseases. 57  Although this can be explained with different theories such as epidemiological,  58  nutritional,  59  and demographic transitions,  60"

Then, included articles were assessed for the availability of weight or BMI measures in their pre-and post-intervention evaluation periods to perform meta-analysis to compare the difference in weight change between the intervention and control groups. BMI was chosen because most of the included studies reported the effect of the intervention based on change in BMI. To conduct meta-analysis, the change in BMI from baseline to post-intervention was extracted from the eligible studies.When measurement choices were available, we chose measured values than self-reported ones; intention-to-treat analysis (that consider the missing values) versus completers was used. The pooled effect size was estimated using a random effect model in Review Manager (RevMan) of the Cochrane Collaboration (Version 5.4.1). The random effect model was chosen to take into account heterogeneity of variables in the intervention. The significance of the estimation was assessed by inspecting the forest plot, confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values. If the estimated effect of intervention did not cross the line of zero effect, CIs did not include zero, and p-value less than 0.05, the intervention was deemed to have significant effect on the outcome."

      "text": "prevention and control programs remain largely inadequate in these countries. Mobile technologies are among rapidly expanding infrastructures in developing countries, but their use for health promotion and diseases prevention has not been well established. The current review suggests that text message interventions can create awareness and thereby result in effective weight management among adults in developing countries. This highlights that text message interventions can be used as an alternative intervention program for overweight and obesity management in these settings. This systematic review showed that text message interventions were effective for weight loss among adults in developing countries; adults who were overweight and supported with text messages lost significantly more weight than who were not supported. Text message interventions helped people to increase their awareness and initiate behavioral changes. Most of the interventions were designed with a priori formative research to determine willingness of participants, contents, and duration of the interventions. Longer duration and more frequent interventions were associated with greater weight loss. This is because behavior change is a process and needs time to establish. Thus, when designing weight loss interventions, considering participants' need, longer duration, and persistence could result in better weight control. Concerning the use of behavior change techniques, studies that involved behavior change options such as physical activity and healthy diet habit with techniques like providing information, self-monitoring, and goal setting resulted in significant weight loss. This demonstrates that weight loss programs and interventions would be more beneficial if they incorporated effective behavior change techniques and theories. Recommendations for future research Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis, the following recommendations are drawn for future RCTs that use text message delivered interventions for overweight and obesity treatment. Most of the included studies were conducted in urban areas and mainly considered people with high literacy level and were relatively close to digital technologies and other health information sources. We do not have evidence on the effectiveness of text-based interventions for weight management in socioeconomically disadvantaged and rural or remote community-dwelling groups. Therefore, we recommend future researchers to test the feasibility and effectiveness of mobilebased text messaging for weight loss in this group of populations. In addition, most of the studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted among people with overweight and/or obesity and those who volunteered to participate. These participants could be relatively more health conscious and might easily adapt the desired behavior, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other people with poorer health awareness. We suggest future RCTs to assess the relative effectiveness of mobile text message interventions by recruiting diverse group of participants using representative sampling techniques for better generalizations. Although some of the published trials reported the effectiveness of text message-based weight loss interventions, they were conducted targeting a relatively small sample size over a short study duration. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusion about the effectiveness of mobile text message interventions for weight loss. Therefore, studies targeting large representative sample sizes with longer duration of follow-ups may provide stronger evidence to better understand the effectiveness of such types of weight loss interventions. Most of the interventions included in this study were supplemented with additional interventions such as telephone calls, guideline/documents, face-to-face coaching, and meetings; therefore, it is difficult to assume that weight loss is caused only due to the text message interventions. This indicates the need for evidence to understand the differential advantage of conducting text message RCTs. In addition, some studies used behavior change theories and were effective. But theories are different among the studies and make it difficult to choose and recommend one effective theory for weight management. Therefore, we recommend future researchers to replicate some of the effective theories used in previous studies to understand the best theoretical foundation for an effective intervention."

      "text": "Strengths and limitationsThis review summarized evidence on text message delivered interventions for overweight management among adults in developing countries. Previous reviews were focused on studies in high-income countries, and their findings might not be equally applicable in people from developing countries due to differences in culture, technology infrastructure, health system, and health-seeking behaviors. It is the strength of this review to present comprehensive evidence on the effectiveness of text message delivered interventions for weight loss among adults in developing countries.The search terms used in this review did not use any limits except to the restriction to studies published in English. Thus, the search strategy is believed to have provided all available RCTs on weight and text messages published in English language. We also used both narrative and quantitative approaches to report the results in a more practical and tangible way. Although the review presented the feasibility of text-based interventions for weight loss among adults in LMICs, most of the included studies were conducted in upper middle-income countries, such as China and India, highlighting the need to cautiously interpret the findings in the lower bracket of the LMIC setting like, for example, parts of the sub-Saharan African region.With regard to the nature of the included studies, some studies involve a priori formative research to develop interventions, some conducted with small sample sizes, some did not use randomization, some were conducted for long duration others for short, and some had had low methodological rigor, which might have affected the meta-analysis result to precisely estimate the mean weight loss achieved by the intervention. Finally, most of the included studies used different forms of behavior change options, including physical activity, diet monitoring, and weight monitoring, and some studies also used different theories. This variation among studies makes it difficult to choose the most effective theory and behavior change options for weight loss in adults from developing settings. Beyond this, measurements of the target behaviors such as physical activity and diet habit were self-reported in some studies, which might have overestimated the effect of the interventions. 5 | CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that text message delivered interventions for weight loss among adults in developing countries are apparently effective given the limited evidence to reach a rough conclusion. From 12 trials, 10 reported significant effect of text message interventions for weight loss. Frequent and extended interventions and use of behavioral theories resulted in a more significant weight reduction in adults with overweight and obesity. This systematic review provides evidence on the use of text message delivered interventions to provide information, to create awareness, to decrease behavioral risks for weight gain such as physical inactivity and poor dietary habits, and to reduce weight, although additional larger RCTs are needed for further conclusion."
