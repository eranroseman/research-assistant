  "title": "Quantifying the benefits of peer support for people with dementia: A Social Return on Investment (SROI) study",
  "abstract": "Objective: Peer support for people with dementia and carers is routinely advocated in national strategies and policy as a post-diagnostic intervention. However there is limited evidence to demonstrate the value these groups offer. This study looked at three dementia peer support groups in South London to evaluate what outcomes they produce and how much social value they create in relation to the cost of investment. Methods: A Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis was undertaken, which involves collecting data on the inputs, outputs and outcomes of an intervention, which are put into a formula, the end result being a SROI ratio showing how much social value is created per \u00bb1 of investment. Results: Findings showed the three groups created social value ranging from \u00bb1.17 to \u00bb5.18 for every pound (\u00bb) of investment, dependent on the design and structure of the group. Key outcomes for people with dementia were mental stimulation and a reduction in loneliness and isolation. Carers reported a reduction in stress and burden of care. Volunteers cited an increased knowledge of dementia. Conclusions: This study has shown that peer groups for people with dementia produce a social value greater than the cost of investment which provides encouraging evidence for those looking to commission, invest, set up or evaluate peer support groups for people with dementia and carers. Beyond the SROI ratio, this study has shown these groups create beneficial",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Dementia is a national priority, particularly in the area of diagnosis and effective postdiagnostic support. The increasing numbers of people with dementia present challenges to the health and social sectors in how best to support people following diagnosis. Peer support is routinely advocated in national strategies and policy, such as the National Dementia Strategy  (Department of Health, 2009) , the Care Act (2014) and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) quality indicators (2013), and is recognised as a worthwhile community intervention for people with dementia and their carers. Several studies  (Clarke et al., 2013; Keyes et al., 2016; Mason, Clare, & Pistrang, 2005)  show that peer support can reduce isolation and loneliness associated with dementia and provide information and support on how to manage the condition to live well. People with dementia and their carers routinely say that they draw significant benefit from being able to talk to other people with dementia and their carers and to share practical advice and emotional support, which is shown to improve their overall wellbeing.\n\nScarcity of public resources means that value-for-money for interventions for people with dementia requires closer scrutiny  (Knapp, Lemmi, & Romeo, 2013) . Studies suggest that peer support may lead to direct healthcare savings by equipping people with coping mechanisms and providing emotional support, which can lessen the risk of crises and subsequent, potentially avoidable and expensive interventions by the statutory sector  (Arksey, 2003; Banerjee & Whittenberg, 2009; Clarke et al., 2013; Hall Long, Moriarty, Mittleman, & Foldes, 2014; Spijker et al., 2009) . Traditionally, cost-effectiveness and costbenefit analyses have been used to assess value-for-money of health and social care interventions. However, the value produced by participating in peer support groups can be subtle and is difficult to measure  (Knapp et al., 2013) . As such there is a scarcity of research on the wider social, economic or environmental value they create."

      "title": "SROI methodology",
      "text": "SROI has been previously described in detail in the literature  (Millar & Hall, 2013) . It is derived from better-known analytical methods such as cost-benefit analysis and social accounting and has become a recognised method of measuring impact, outcomes and value created by interventions or organisations. Briefly, through engaging stakeholders (people who it was thought would experience relevant and significant change from being involved with the group) SROI measures the value an intervention creates against the cost of enabling it to occur. It uses a concept of value that goes beyond what can be captured purely in financial terms by incorporating social, environmental and/or economic elements to calculate the total value, hereafter referred to as 'social value'.\n\nThe authors closely followed established SROI methodology  (Nicholls, Lawlor, Neitzert, & Goodspeed, 2009) . The SROI method involves a mixed methods design. Qualitative methods are used to establish which outcomes (themes) were of most importance and impact on participant's lives and ultimately combine to create social value, followed by a quantitative approach to create a monetary representation of these outcomes and their value.\n\nThis study used unstructured interviews or focus groups with the stakeholders (see Table  2 ). Both the interviews and focus groups used open questioning to encourage the stakeholders to talk spontaneously about how being involved with the group impacted them positively or negatively. By allowing them the flexibility to bring forward their thoughts and opinions the risk of interviewer bias was reduced whilst conversational prompts allowed the interviewer to lead or steer the topics under discussion if needed   (Bowling, 2014; Gerrish & Lacey, 2013) . With the exception of the members themselves, the other two stakeholder groups, the carers and volunteers, were also asked to comment on how they felt the group affected the other stakeholder groups.\n\nThe expectation of sample sizes was modest given the stakeholder population sizes and it was acknowledged that some group members would not be able to be interviewed due to their level of cognitive impairment and that this would reduce the proportion of the member population that could potentially participate. Although a large sample size is not required for qualitative data collection, translation of the qualitative to quantitative data implies that larger sample sizes would have increased the validity of the outcomes for each stakeholder group.\n\nWith the help of the group facilitators participants were approached and invited to participate and despite small sample sizes it was felt a level of saturation was met with the themes reported. Group facilitators and volunteers were present at the focus groups for people with dementia to ensure a comfortable and familiar environment for participants. Sessions and interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were emailed to participants with email addresses to verify the transcriptions. Group facilitators verified focus group transcripts.\n\nThematic analysis akin to the 'framework' data analysis approach  (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994)  identified outcomes for each stakeholder through detecting the key themes in each transcript and charting the number of stakeholders who reported each theme.\n\nSROI makes use of financial proxies to establish the value of themes identified, to enable a market price to be attributed where there is no associated market. We selected proxies that were deemed the closest, most relevant and reflective of a service with a market price. Table  3  shows financial proxies for themes that were evident across all groups. A full list of proxies by each theme is available online  (Health Innovation Network, 2015) .\n\nWhilst identifying the themes reported by stakeholders was an important objective of this study, the primary objective of an SROI analysis is to create and display a ratio showing the cost of investment (\u00bb) of an intervention against the total social value (\u00bb) the intervention creates. To establish overall impact the value of each identified cost or theme was multiplied by the number of people reporting that benefit. To avoid the risk of over-claiming, SROI methodology prescribes that specific factors, or considerations are applied to each theme identified (see Table  4 )."

Full results detailing calculations for the impact ratio are available in the Appendices.\n\nWithout the valued 'cost' of volunteers' time or the venue hire, the ratios would have been much higher. For example, without the volunteer costs group A's social value ratio would be \u00bb1: \u00bb12.99 and group C \u00bb1:1.40. Table 4. Factors considered for calculating SROI impact ratio."

      "text": "This study has shown that peer support groups for people with dementia, regardless of size or structure, provided personal and social value to people with dementia, their carers and volunteers supporting the group, with a social value ranging from \u00bb1.17 to \u00bb5.18 for every pound (\u00bb) invested. Common themes were identified across all three groups. A key finding across all groups is a reduction in isolation and loneliness, which is a common outcome seen in peer support generally and for people with dementia specifically  (Clarke et al., 2013; Nesta & National Voices, 2015) . Our findings show that peer support groups, or having the opportunity to meet others in a similar situation regularly can help people feel less lonely and less isolated and this experience is valued by people with dementia.\n\nThe carers of the group members reported observing that the members were mentally stimulated after attending the group, more so than if they had remained at home. Improving or maintaining cognitive stimulation is a recognised aim of some peer support interventions  (Spagnolo et al., 2015; Woods, Aguirre, Spector, & Orrell, 2012)  to maintain functional ability and quality of life. Studies have shown peer support for people with dementia has a beneficial impact in increasing wellbeing, self-esteem, quality of life and\n\nTable 5. Themes. a"

Our study supports these findings, with reduction in burden of care and stress a universal outcome across all groups, demonstrating the positive impact peer support groups have for carers. Findings from interviews with carers from groups B and C showed that these groups offered respite in terms of carers having some time for themselves and peace of mind that their relative is being stimulated and cared for in their absence, which reduced carer stress and the burden of care. Carers who attended group A also reported a sense of respite whilst participating in the group. Additionally, they reported enjoyment in sharing time together in a positive environment and meeting other carers with similar experiences, findings which are consistent with other studies  (Greenwood, Habibi, Mackenzie, Dreenan, & Easton, 2013) .\n\nFor both people with dementia and their carers, the overall sense of improved wellbeing and a reduction in negative risk factors to health such as loneliness, isolation and stress reinforces findings from previous studies  (Banerjee et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2013; Leung et al., 2015; Nesta & National Voices, 2015 ) that suggest peer support can reduce the risk of reaching a 'crisis point', with people either feeling more able to manage their situation or seek initial support and advice from peers or staff at the group before contacting the GP or emergency services.\n\nVolunteers are not necessarily considered as beneficiaries of a peer support group, but the universal outcome, seen in Group A and C, of an increased sense of wellbeing amongst them is a noteworthy unintentional outcome of these groups. Also of interest is the fact that the volunteers reported an increase in understanding and knowledge of dementia. This outcome could be inadvertently recycled back into the group, potentially leading to improvements in the service being provided at no extra cost and positively influencing the social value produced over time.\n\nAll groups demonstrated a higher social value than the cost of investment. However, analysis of the largest group (A) indicates that a more intensive and frequently held group, involving volunteers and carers who also experience benefit, has a large impact on the overall social value produced by the group.\n\nThe two groups that had lower ratios show that smaller groups (in design or number of participants) still offer a gain in social value, relative to the cost of the service. People with dementia, like those without dementia, have a variety of preferences in terms of support and socialising and what is appealing to one person in terms of peer support will differ from the next. Our findings support the adoption of a mixed model approach to peer support, demonstrating that groups based on similar structure and design to those evaluated in this study are all a worthwhile investment. However, groups should consider ways to increase the value they create, relative to their investment. For instance, using volunteers as a free resource enables a higher number of people to be supported in the group and thus increases a group's social value directly, as well as indirectly through the positive outcomes experienced by the volunteers. Identifying in-kind contributions such as free venue or activities was shown to increase a group's social value. For example, group A used a communal room in an extra care housing home, with residents invited to participate as well."

      "text": "A strength of this study is the fact we evaluated three peer support groups of different designs and structures, using a mixed methods approach consistent with SROI methodology. Our methods and analysis were validated by NEF Consulting which is the expert organisation in SROI analysis. Limitations of the SROI process include the complexity of assigning financial proxies to soft themes, for example wellbeing and confidence and the availability of data to be used in robust calculations, for example displacement and attribution values. There is a risk in SROI analysis to focus solely on the ratio without examining the content behind it, which offers a richer insight to the value produced by groups  (Nicholls et al., 2009) ."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "The aim of this study was to understand and quantify the social value of peer support groups for people with dementia. A lack of robust economic evidence presents difficulties to commissioners or funders in investing in peer support as an intervention, as well as to groups to secure funding to set up and maintain their service. Findings from this study demonstrate peer support to be a worthwhile investment, both for people with dementia and their carers, but also for the volunteers who support the groups. It demonstrates that independent organisations and initiatives by smaller charities are able to produce a positive social return on investment, just as much or even more than groups run by large, more formal organisations. It provides guidance on how groups can increase their wider social value by using in-kind contributions such as volunteers and cost-free meeting space. We hope this study will aid decision making for those looking to commission, invest or set up peer support groups for people with dementia. Furthermore, we hope to have shown how to use SROI for similar community initiatives that are known to provide benefit but where a monetary value of the intervention is not yet known.\n\nLondon.
