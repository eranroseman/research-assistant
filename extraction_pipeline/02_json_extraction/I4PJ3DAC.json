  "title": "Feasibility and acceptability of a parent-child intervention to improve step count in childhood cancer survivors exposed to cardiotoxic therapy: The STEP UP for FAMILIES Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Late morbidity after childhood cancer may be mitigated by healthy lifestyle behaviors. We piloted a game-based, parent-child digital intervention to increase activity in sedentary survivors. Methods: Survivors aged 10-16 treated with cardiotoxic therapy and not meeting US physical activity guidelines were enrolled in a single-arm study with a parent. Following a 14-day run-in, participants chose a prespecified step goal and wore an accelerometer daily for 24 weeks (12-week game-based intervention; 12-week follow-up). Participants completed the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) at 24 weeks; a subset of dyads completed qualitative interviews. Results: Among 129 eligible survivors, 27 enrolled (20.9% participation rate) with a parent. Four dyads were removed during the 14-day run-in period due to noncompliance. Among the 23 dyads who continued to the study, the tracker was worn for 95% of days during the 12-week intervention (95% confidence interval [CI]: 94-96) and 81% during the 12-week follow-up (95% CI: 79-82). Overall, the prespecified step goal was met for 64% (95% CI: 63-66) of days during the intervention and 37% (95% CI: 35-38) during the follow-up. At the end of study, 17/23 dyads responded to AIM; 82% of survivors and 94% of parents reported the intervention as acceptable. During qualitative interviews (n = 5), dyads noted that they liked the accountability of the \"buddy system,\" but would have liked more personalized goal-setting. Conclusions: Despite high ratings of acceptability among participants, difficulties with sustained adherence and retention were encountered in this parent-child gamification intervention. Alternate, tailored designs should be considered in the future.",

      "text": "As survival rates for childhood cancer continue to improve, 1 increased attention must be given to survivors' long-term health outcomes and quality of life. Survivors are at high risk for a variety of treatmentrelated complications  2, 3  that contribute to premature morbidity and mortality,  [4] [5] [6] [7]  including diabetes,  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  hypertension,  15, 16  and cardiovascular disease.  6, [17] [18] 8] [19] [20]  Existing data demonstrate that higher levels of physical activity in childhood cancer survivors are associated with an improved cardiovascular profile  [21] [22] [23]  and lower risk of mortality  7, 24  ; yet survivors remain more sedentary than non-cancer controls.  25 terventions to improve physical activity levels in childhood cancer survivors are thus urgently needed to improve health outcomes in this high-risk cohort.\n\nIn the general population, social or financial incentives have been utilized to motivate behavioral change, such as weight loss or physical activity.  [26] [27] 7] [28] [29] [30]  Specifically, recent data have demonstrated the effectiveness of gamification,  31, 32  or the application of insights from behavioral economics  28, 33, 34  and game design, to increase physical activity. Other work has demonstrated positive outcomes when parents are involved in lifestyle interventions for childhood cancer survivors,  35  as well as the feasibility of employing mobile health (mHealth) technologies to implement lifestyle interventions.  36, 37 This single-arm pilot study leveraged these insights to pilot test a 12-week physical activity intervention that incorporated gamification theory, parental involvement, and mHealth technology, and had previously been effective in adults in the general population,  31  followed by a 12-week follow-up period. We sought to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach, as well as preliminary effects of the intervention, in a cohort of sedentary childhood cancer survivors and their parents."

      "text": "Participants were recruited between August 2020 and November 2021 from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Pediatric Long-Term Follow-Up Clinic, which provides longitudinal care to survivors of childhood cancer. Eligible participants had previously received cardiotoxic therapy (anthracycline and/or chest radiation) and were at least 2 years from the end-of-therapy; English-speaking; between the ages of 10 and 16 at study enrollment with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1  38  ; and self-reported sedentary lifestyle, defined as not meeting national physical activity recommendations for children and adolescents.  39 Participants also had to have a parent or legal guardian willing to participate in the intervention, as well as a mobile device with SMS text messaging capability.\n\nStudy procedures were modeled after the BE FIT trial,  31  which was a randomized controlled trial of a gamification intervention to increase physical activity among sedentary community-dwelling adults and a peer. The Way to Health platform, which incorporates automated inputs from wireless devices to capture behavior and deliver automated feedback to participants in order to motivate behavioral change,  26, 28  was used to deploy the gamification intervention.\n\nTarget enrollment was 30 dyads; enrollment closed early (27 dyads enrolled) due to slower than expected accrual and the end of the funding period."

      "text": "Eligible participants received a study invitation informing them of their eligibility for a new family-based study to increase physical activity, which would require an initial in-person study visit to confirm eligibility, obtain written informed consent/assent, and be followed by 6 months of remote monitoring.\n\nAfter consent/assent, each child-parent dyad was instructed to wear a study-supplied wrist accelerometer (Fitbit Inspire HR), which tracks steps and heart rate, for a 2-week run-in period during which an average daily step count was calculated. Participants were told that not wearing the Fitbit for at least 10/14 days of the run-in would result in study removal.\n\nAt the end of the run-in period, participants were asked to set a step goal that was either 33%, 40%, or 50% higher than their baseline step count, or choose a different goal that was at least 1000 steps greater than their baseline step count. After selecting a goal, participants were asked to sign a precommitment pledge to try their best to achieve the designated goals; these pledges have previously been shown to be an effective motivator of behavioral change.  40, 41 rticipants were informed they could keep their Fitbit, which would otherwise be returned to study staff, if they completed the full 24-week intervention as an incentive.\n\nAll dyads were then entered into a points-based game designed to use social incentives to increase daily step count. At the start of each week, the dyad received 70 points (10 points per day for the upcoming week). Each day, one member of the dyad (parent or child) was randomly selected as the representative for the team as part of the gamification design. If that member (parent or child) achieved their pre-designated step goal, the family kept its daily point allotment; if not, 10 points were deducted. If the team finished the week with at least 50 points (i.e., the selected team representative met the stated goal at least 5 of 7 days), they moved up a level (i.e., Bronze to Silver).\n\nConversely, if the team did not have 50 points at the end of the week, they moved down a level. Dyads were informed of their new level each Monday during the 12-week intervention period.\n\nThe study design, which had been carefully devised and tested by Patel and colleagues in community-dwelling adults,  31  was established specifically to leverage several fundamental psychological principles, including loss aversion, or the cognitive bias to work harder to avoid losses than to pursue gains  42  ; intermittent reinforcement, or the idea that behavior is better reinforced by variable rather than constant rewards  43  ; and the \"fresh start effect,\" which posits that individuals are more motivated to attain their goals around a temporal landmark, such as the start of the week.  44 Additionally, in an effort to allow participants to adhere to their usual schedules without feeling penalized by the rules of the intervention, each participant had five \"lifelines\" during the 12-week intervention to use on days when goal achievement seemed unattainable (such as an exam or business trip), which was then counted as a goal-concordant day.\n\nAt the end of the 12-week intervention, all participants were asked to continue wearing their Fitbit for an additional 12 weeks of followup during which they did not receive additional alerts, feedback, or incentives to mimic \"real-world\" conditions.\n\nAt the end of the 24-week study (12-week intervention and 12week follow-up), all participants were asked to complete a brief questionnaire about their experience with the study and assess the acceptability of the intervention using the four-question Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM),  45  which is a four-item instrument that measures participant perception of the intervention as \"agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory\" on a five-point Likert scale.\n\nA subset of parent-child dyads (n = 5) completed semi-structured qualitative interviews reflecting on their experience with the intervention."

Preliminary effects of the intervention were measured by the proportion of days in which the prespecified step goal was met out of the total number of days in the 12-week intervention and 12-week follow-up periods, reported separately.

RA was conducted in two phases: a \"horizontal\" phase and a \"vertical\" phase.\n\nIn the horizontal phase, the QMS reviewed the individual interview summaries, and significant statements were identified based on a priori constructs from the interview guide. Statements were sorted into categories relating to prior experience with exercise and Fitbit devices;\n\nexperience participating in the study (Fitbit use, logistics, dyad participation); challenges or issues with study participation; impact of study participation and plans for continued engagement; and recommendations for future studies. In the vertical phase, the QMS and a clinical research coordinator trained in qualitative analysis methods reviewed the statements grouped within each category, across all participants, to identify primary themes. The analytic team collaboratively and iteratively reviewed the data to refine categories and identify themes salient across dyad interviews, and to identify illustrative participant quotations. Themes included prominent sentiments both within each category and across categories, and any notable divergences."

Reasons reported included remote school, medical issues that impacted ability to be active, being tired, and lacking motivation.\n\nParticipants reported that the structure of the study provided motivation to be more physically active. Participants also felt account-able to the study and driven to meet their daily goals because they knew someone was monitoring their progress. Participants also reported enjoying the game-based elements of the study, specifically the daily scores and a sense of competition fostered within the dyads.\n\nDuring the study period, participants noted that the dyadic structure of the study functioned like a buddy system and facilitated connections between survivors and their parents. One parent-child dyad noted that they worked out separately, but still went to the park together. Dyads felt accountable to each other and found comfort and motivation in participating together.\n\nIn addition to reporting an increase in physical activity during the study period, participants expressed a desire to continue their new habits, including scheduling regular workouts into their daily routine and participating in physical activity as a family unit."

Specifically, participants noted that they forgot to put the Fitbit device back on after charging and experienced some skin irritation from prolonged use. Participants also felt frustrated that the Fitbit did not recognize their activity when they were walking with their hands full (arms not moving), rowing, or biking. Participants voiced an interest in slower increases in daily goals, which were set immediately after the run-in period for the study duration, and being able to adjust goals on work/school versus off days. Interestingly, multiple participants would have liked additional study reminders, such as a mid-day reminder to complete the specified goals; a \"warning\" text each morning if no steps were logged the prior day; and more frequent reminders to synchronize the device."

      "title": "4. DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this pilot study, we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of deploying a remote game-based parent-child intervention, which had previously been shown to be effective in community-dwelling adults, to increase physical activity in sedentary childhood cancer survivors and a parent. We hypothesized that a remote parent-child intervention would be feasible and acceptable in adolescent survivors of childhood cancer, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City when in-person visits and activities became logistically difficult. We were surprised to encounter significant difficulty with recruitment for this study, with only 21% of eligible patients opting to enroll. However, among those who ultimately participated in the intervention, feasibility, as defined by the proportion of participant-days that the Fitbit Inspire HR was worn during the 12-week intervention and the 12-week follow-up period, exceeded 80% for both study periods. Acceptability of the intervention was also high. Thus, there may be elements of the intervention that require further study and can be incorporated into future trials.\n\nDespite growing evidence that physical activity may mitigate the risk of late morbidity and mortality in childhood cancer survivors,  7, [47] [48] [49]  survivors have repeatedly been shown to be more sedentary than their peers.  50 Promotion of physical activity thus remains a priority area of research among this population. A recent randomized controlled trial of a 1-year partially supervised physical activity intervention in childhood cancer survivors ages \u226516 years in Switzerland showed a significant reduction in a composite cardiovascular disease risk score among participants in the intervention group as compared to controls. 51 While promising, this intensive intervention included face-to-face visits at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months, phone calls at 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10 months, and other study-specific requirements, and thus would be difficult to implement into clinical practice as a sustained method for behavioral change. Given the difficulties associated with intensive in-person interventions, recent studies have explored remote opportunities to increase physical activity among childhood and adolescent survivors. One 6month pilot study of a motivational, accelerometer-based intervention in 19 childhood cancer survivors \u226515 years of age demonstrated feasibility, as well as a nonsignificant increase in total weekly MVPA and V02 max among participants at the end of the intervention, as compared to baseline. 52 Another 6-month, single-center, randomized controlled trial of an internet-delivered physical activity intervention among sedentary survivors (ages 11-14.9) similarly showed a nonsignificant increase in MVPA among individuals in the intervention compared to controls. 53 A 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial involving an accelerometer, a peer-based Facebook support group, step count goal setting, and a self-selected support \"buddy\" among young adult survivors, ages 18-39, showed feasibility and significant change in sedentary time between groups without significant change in MVPA. 54 In this study, which sought to combine elements of prior successful physical activity interventions into a single remote pilot trial, we were surprised to encounter difficulty with the recruitment process, and attrition throughout the study. Evidence suggests that digital, remote health interventions in childhood cancer survivors are generally perceived as a benefit due to accessibility and convenience. 55 However, only 27 of 129 eligible dyads (20.9%) consented to the study. The initial in-person visit, which included consent and assent, may have served as a deterrent for some eligible participants. It is also possible that attitudes toward nontherapeutic research and/or efforts around physical activity 56 shifted due to the unique circumstances of the COVID-19\n\npandemic in our urban center.  57 ill, among parent-child dyads who participated in the study, the tracker was worn for 95% of participant-days during the 12-week intervention and 81% of participant-days during the follow-up. The prespecified step goal was met for 59% of survivors and 70% of parents during the intervention, although these numbers dropped considerably during the follow-up, suggesting that changes in physical activity might not be sustained in the absence of the game-based intervention.\n\nBased on responses to the AIM and the semi-structured interviews, acceptability was high among those who completed the study, and constructive feedback for future studies was elicited.\n\nSeveral limitations must be considered when interpreting the results of this study. Importantly, this was a single-arm study intended\n\n15455017, 2024, 12, Downloaded from  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pbc.31320 by University Of Iowa Libraries -Serials Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [28/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions ( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions ) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nto assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention, and did not include a comparison group of either adolescent survivors or parents. The single-center design, particularly as a single center in an urban area deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, may limit the generalizability of these findings. Study participants represent a convenience sample recruited from our clinic of survivors of childhood cancers; these were patients who were financially, psychologically, and physically able to attend in-person clinic visits during the months after the peak of the COVID pandemic in New York City. The distribution of diagnoses of those who enrolled (i.e., the majority being leukemia survivors) also reflects a certain peculiarity of that time; many of our routine patients with historically difficult-to-treat or rare diagnoses, such as high-risk neuroblastoma, travel from across the United States for survivorship visits, and were unable to travel during this time.\n\nRelatedly, given that enrollment was much slower than anticipated, we did not adequately plan for the accrual of monthly platform hosting charges, which is an important consideration for these types of studies. Importantly, those who were lost-to-follow-up did not respond to requests for semi-structured interviews, and those who declined study participation were not eligible for interviews, and so further work will be required to elucidate the true barriers to initial and sustained participation in this and other physical activity interventions, and perhaps in behavioral modification studies more broadly.\n\nNonetheless, these findings are critical to inform future efforts to improve physical activity and other modifiable risk factors in childhood cancer survivors. Some aspects, such as the game-based design and dyadic structure, may be important to incorporate into future study design. Notably, two 6-month, remote-based, randomized controlled trials aimed at improving physical activity among sedentary survivors are ongoing through the Children's Oncology Group.  58 The first incorporates rewards among survivors aged 8 to younger than 16 years who completed therapy within the past 12 months,  59  and the second combines a wearable physical activity tracker and individualized goal setting to improve physical activity in survivors aged 15-20 years.  58 us, exploration of strategies to improve physical activity levels in childhood cancer survivors remains an active area of research, and will inform future efforts to effect sustained behavioral change in this highrisk population. Tailored, longitudinal interventions will be needed to identify optimal approaches to improve modifiable risk factors and reduce the risk of late effects in survivors of childhood cancer."
