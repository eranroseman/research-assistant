  "title": "Operationalizing Equity: A Rapid-Cycle Innovation Approach to Covid-19 Vaccination in Black Neighborhoods",
  "abstract": "The Covid-19 vaccine rollout has been highly inequitable, with white individuals being vaccinated at higher rates than Black individuals in 38 states. Structural barriers, including Web-based scheduling and the location of vaccine clinics, underlie the inequity. A partnership in Philadelphia sought to overcome these barriers using a rapid-cycle innovation approach to design and implement a multi-health system, communitypartnered rotating vaccination clinic. In just 2 weeks, they designed and launched a community clinic model. As of March 2021, they have run three 7-hour clinics, vaccinating a total of 2,821 people, of whom 85% were Black. Logistical innovations allowed the clinics to operate line-free throughout most of the day and with a Net Promoter score of 94, evidencing outstanding patient satisfaction. Here, the authors describe how they leveraged a novel no/low-tech strategy to enable community engagement toward equitable care delivery.",

      "text": "Penn Medicine (a large academic health system), Mercy Catholic Medical Center (a community teaching hospital), and Black community leaders joined together in an equal partnership to form a Vaccine Collaborative. We leveraged the comparative strengths of each partner including experience mass vaccinating staff and using innovation to solve health care delivery challenges (Penn), a strong community health footprint (Mercy), and deep knowledge of the desires and preferences of residents (Community leaders) to resource and run a weekly free community vaccine clinic.\n\nIn Philadelphia, as of the first week in March, Black residents make up 42% of the population but only 21% of those who have been vaccinated.\"\n\nThe clinic was designed to rotate through different community sites in predominantly Black neighborhoods in West and Southwest Philadelphia. To date, we have operated three first dose Moderna clinics out of a church, a recreation center, and a high school gym, with second dose clinics scheduled in the same locations. While mass vaccination sites are important for vaccinating large numbers of Americans, smaller clinics located in Black communities will remain important for closing the racial vaccination gap.\n\nCommunity faith leaders served a critical role in activating their networks and building a bridge of trust between the health systems and the community around vaccination. Our partnership began with conversations between senior health system leaders and a single pastor, who subsequently facilitated engagement with over 20 pastors from West and Southwest Philadelphia Black churches.\n\nThe team's first priority was to ensure that the pastors themselves felt comfortable recommending the vaccine to their congregations. Initially, health system leaders met virtually with all pastors to answer questions about the vaccine and reach agreement on the vaccine clinic concept, scale, and initial clinic site. All the pastors took the vaccine at the first clinic, at their own suggestion, as a visible demonstration of their endorsement to the community (Figure  1 ).\n\n\" NEJM Catalyst is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Early input from community partners during the design phase informed development of both a text message sign up (Figure  2 ) and a parallel no-tech phone-based strategy. Both platforms allowed patients to self-schedule and encouraged them to schedule on behalf of friends and family who were unable to do so themselves.\n\nNEJM Catalyst is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Individuals then pick a first and second dose appointment time. The phone-based interactive voice recording (IVR) sign up initially required volunteers to call eligible individuals to complete their registration. By the second clinic, the system was fully automated to allow for phone-based self-scheduling. To further ensure inclusivity, we worked closely with community leaders to identify individuals who struggled to sign up on either platform and performed phone-based outreach. The program also delivers automated appointment reminders and post-vaccination side effects guidance."

Patients received an oversized yellow double-sided clinic passport that consolidated all required consent and clinical documentation materials, thus eliminating the need for repeated transcription of patient identifiers. The distinct color and size helped staff across different stations easily document their critical actions, as well as ensured collection of the passport prior to patient departure.\n\nClinicians were provided with preprinted labels of their names, credentials, and vaccine lot numbers to decrease the effort required to repeatedly sign documentation."

While a consenter was engaging a group of patients, a clinic guide would seat, orient, and prepare the next group of patients (i.e., prompt patients to read their consents and take off their jackets in preparation for vaccination). As such, clinicians spent more overall time with patients compared with the 1:1 traditional model and leveraged individual questions to benefit the whole group. All patients had the option for individualized consent.\n\nNEJM Catalyst is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

At our third clinic, in a large and open layout, we were able to group all consent pods in a generalized consent zone, which in turn fed into a consolidated vaccinator zone."

At the recreation center, for example, we faced a lack of accessible entry points for our limited mobility patients. In response, health system employees engaged their networks to create and donate a custom ramp. We resourced and brought all the necessary expertise, equipment, and supplies on site, including refrigeration for vaccines, resuscitation and monitoring equipment, medical supplies, privacy partitions, wheelchairs, stretchers, tarps to protect floors, meals and refreshments for volunteers, tables, and chairs.\n\nOver the course of 3 community clinic days, we experienced a 5%-15% same-day, no-show rate.\n\nWe assessed no-shows every 30 minutes and called in wait-listed individuals to fill those spots. We initially assigned team members to first call the no-shows to ascertain if they were still coming but logged a less than 5% return in the effort.

Eighty percent of patients resided in our target zip codes (Table  1 ).\n\nIn a brief post-vaccination experience survey (n=1609), over half of the respondents (56%) reported that their trust in health care organizers was a factor in deciding to get vaccinated, followed by ease of sign up (37%), proximity to home (26%), and trust in community and faith leaders (21%) (Figure  7 ). Logistical innovations allowed the clinics to operate on time for the entire clinic and line-free throughout most of the day and with a Net Promoter score of 94, evidencing outstanding patient satisfaction.
