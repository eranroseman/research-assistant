  "title": "The cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions: A systematic review of the literature",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital health interventions have significant potential to improve safety, efficacy, and quality of care, reducing waste in healthcare costs. Despite these premises, the evidence regarding cost and effectiveness of digital tools in health is scarce and limited. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions and to assess whether the studies meet the established quality criteria. Methods: We queried PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases for articles in English published from January , to December , that performed economic evaluations of digital health technologies. The methodological rigorousness of studies was assessed with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Results: Search identified , results, of which were selected for abstract and were included in this review. The studies were heterogeneous by country (mostly conducted in upper and upper-middle income countries), type of eHealth intervention, method of implementation, and reporting perspectives. The qualitative analysis identified the economic and effectiveness evaluation of six different types of interventions: ( ) seventeen studies on new video-monitoring service systems; ( ) five studies on text messaging interventions; ( ) five studies on web platforms and digital health portals; ( ) two studies on telephone support; ( ) three studies on new mobile phone-based systems and applications; and ( ) three studies on digital technologies and innovations. Conclusion: Findings on cost-effectiveness of digital interventions showed a growing body of evidence and suggested a generally favorable effect in terms of costs and health outcomes. However, due to the heterogeneity across study methods, the comparison between interventions still remains difficult. Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Gentili et al. . /fpubh. . Further research based on a standardized approach is needed in order to methodically analyze incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, costs, and health benefits.",

      "text": "In a rapidly evolving society, the progress of digital technology used to improve human health and well-being needs to be constantly evaluated, both in its effectiveness and its efficiency. The WHO defines eHealth as \"the cost-effective and secure use of information and communications technologies in support of health and health-related fields, including healthcare services, health surveillance, health literature, and health education, knowledge and research\"  (1) .\n\nDigital technology encompasses many areas of eHealth, such as e-learning, telemedicine, mobile health and health information systems. eHealth also benefits from progress in related fields, such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics and genomics.\n\nDigitized health-related data is easier to store and quickly analyze, especially when structuring a data-driven approach to build analytical models for safety improvement, managing clinical risk and increasing the quality of healthcare organizations  (2) .\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health technologies were successfully implemented to aid contact tracing, isolation management, primary care improvement and communication between citizens and decision makers  (3) .\n\nSouth Korea is a prime example of a country with widespread digital health implementation, where remotely located supercomputers are used to secure and analyze medical big data and about 50% of digitized hospitals already use a paperless and comprehensive health care system. A rapid response and a cutting-edge governmentrun digital contact tracing system allowed South Korea to have early success in flattening the curve during its first wave of COVID-19  (4) .\n\nToday more than 120 countries are prioritizing healthrelated digital progress, with a growing need to systematically implement standards-based interoperable solutions.\n\nDespite the institutional fervor and wide applicability of digital health strategies, healthcare facilities and services are struggling to assess the cost-effectiveness of different solutions. The absence of standards and tools for the comparative assessment of functionality and value of fast-evolving digital health solutions exacerbates the pressing need for quality evidence to navigate normative change  (5) . This systematic review aims to describing the cost effectiveness of digital health interventions by assessing their impact on standardized indicators, such as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Disease Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), on healthcare expenditure by comparing the strategies with the Median-Based Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), and by evaluating the quality of the evidence reported."

After duplicates were removed, titles and abstracts were reviewed by 2 experienced systematic reviewers working independently to determine whether each study met the eligibility criteria. Full-text copies of potentially relevant studies were retrieved and further assessed against inclusion/exclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. At both stages, disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. At the end of the full-text review, the articles that met all predefined criteria were read by two researchers to confirm the inclusion of these articles.\n\nA pilot data extraction was conducted by two of the investigators. Any discrepancy pertinent to data extraction was discussed to reach a consensus. The collected information included the following items: (1) general information (including authors, publication date, title, and country);\n\n(2) study characteristics (including discipline examined and kind of intervention); (3) methodology (including modeling method, time horizon, and perspective); (4) cost-effectiveness information (including cost measurement, consequence measurement, and ICER); and (5) key findings (and conclusion)."

The types of digital health intervention implemented to support citizens and patients and to reduce costs from both societal and health payer perspective, were:\n\n-Video-conferencing system: 17/35, 48.6%  (7, 9, 10, 16-20, 28-31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 41) . -Text messaging intervention: 5/35, 14.3%  (11, 12, 23, 24, 26) . -Web platforms and digital health portals: 5/35, 14.3%  (27, 32, 35, 38, 40) . -Telephone support: 2/35, 5.7%  (8, 21) . -Mobile phone-based systems and applications: 3/35, 8.6%  (13, 22, 39) . -Digital technologies and innovations: 3/35, 8.6%  (14, 15, 25) .\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was a criterion of selection, therefore all the studies included a CEA, whereas a cost-utility analysis (CUA) has been performed in addition to the primary CEA in eight studies (22.9%)  (29-32, 34, 35, 37, 38) .\n\nThe costing perspective was mostly from payer/program/health service provider perspective (24, 68.7%), whereas the costing perspective was societal in 19 studies (54.3%). Only one study did not clearly report the costing perspective (2.9%).\n\nIn order to obtain QALYs, the studies of this review referred to different instruments deriving from the trials of reference. The questionnaires and surveys used to estimate QALYs were: ShortForm-6 Dimensions (32); a multistate body mass table model  (24) ; European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions  (9-11, 19, 29, 30, 33, 34, 37, 41) ;\n\n. /fpubh. .

Digital technologies and innovations The incremental cost per additional TB patient diagnosed in DrOTS was 2,631$ There was a 61.2% (95% CI 58.1-65.2, P < 0.05) increase in case finding and treatment initiation over usual care. With the implementation of digital adherence monitoring technologies, those outcomes were respectively 405 (91.0%) and 40 (9.0%) in DrOTS. This represents a 2.6% (95% CI -1.8 to 7.5, P = 0.47) increase in successful outcomes DrOTS has an ICER value of $177 per DALY averted compared to usual care for diagnosis and treatment of TB Innovative technology packages including drones, digital adherence monitoring technologies, and molecular diagnostics for TB case finding and retention within the cascade of care can be cost effective.

Two out of the three studies in this section found the digital health interventions to be highly cost-effective, resulting in higher QALYs with cost-savings  (15, 25) , while one study reported to be cost-effective but with higher costs  (14) ."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Standardized cost-effectiveness analysis should be used to compare different interventions in terms of their consequences and costs so it can be used as a crucial tool to help decision makers or funders understand if digital health interventions and innovations actually determine an increase of QALYs or DALYs with contained costs  (42) .\n\nIn our systematic review, we opted to exclude studies that utilized digital technologies only to record information without any active participation from healthcare personnel as we wanted to focus on interventions that facilitate the communication between citizen/patient and healthcare staff. However, the number of economic evaluations included in the review is in line with the previous review on cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of telehealth interventions published in 2015, where 35 studies assessed effectiveness, utility and costs  (6) .\n\nStudies show a broad range of digital interventions, reference population, focus disease and discipline interested. The majority included a comparison of a digital health innovation costs and effectiveness in terms of health-related outcomes vs. standard care. However, some did not report all recommended economic and consequence outcome items. The transferability of findings across economic evaluations is based on a rigorous data collection strategy, a coherent methodology, and an explicit description of target population, study design and sample size  (43) . In our review, over half of the studies were randomized controlled trials which are considered to be of high quality and have a low risk of bias in comparison with other study designs, such as expert opinion studies. Sample size varied significantly and ranged from 50 participants in a study where telemedicine was used to monitor patients with pacemakers compared to conventional monitoring (37) to 4.4 million participants where a text messaging intervention promoted weight loss in all of New Zealand's population  (24) . One article missed to indicate the sample size  (14) .\n\nEconomic evaluations conducted from a societal perspective are generally preferred since one of the principal objectives of public health is to improve the health and the quality of life of the general population  (44) . Moreover, economic evaluations based on a fixed budget may lead to suboptimal decisions; they are inconsistent with decisions based on willingness to pay for QALYs and are considered to be of low quality in comparison to societal perspective. Of the 35 studies of the review, 19 articles conducted their economic evaluations from a societal perspective, while only one study did not report the perspective  (20) . On the contrary, articles with a societal perspective took into account all the losses and expenses, direct and indirect, supported by society as a whole, irrespective of who the benefactors were (e.g. production losses, travel costs, absenteeism, presenteeism, premature death, etc.). Articles with a third party payer perspective encompassed intervention costs, outpatient (incl. general practitioners and specialists) and inpatient services, medication and societal service costs.\n\nModeling techniques are generally used to predict the effect and the potential cost (or savings) of a determined technology where it is not feasible to wait for lifetime data to validate the cost-effectiveness  (42) . In our review, several studies used modeling techniques to predict the intervention effect and cost over a long period, or even a lifetime  (14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 31, 36, 40, 41) . In these cases, it became fundamental to clearly express the uncertainty of the analysis described. All studies selected in the review that used predictive models indicated uncertainty (mostly Monte Carlo simulation, but also one-way and multiway sensitivity analyses, threshold analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses).\n\nAccording to previous reviews (6), \"Videoconferencing system\" was the most represented digital health intervention type but it was also the one that had the most discordant results: five studies report that the applied technology is not costeffective or that in any case there is not enough evidence to define the cost-effectiveness  (7, 19, 28, 34, 37) . Vestegard et al.  (19)  found that telehealth care was associated with lower costs but had an insignificant impact on patients' HRQoL. Painter et al.  (28)  underlined effectiveness of the digital measures, but admitted that they did not improve QALYs in the main analysis. Clarke et al.  (7)  could not give a definitive conclusion on the cost-effectiveness as an outcome of their study due to a wide variance on savings and the uncertainty of monitoring cost. Also Lopez-Villegas et al.  (37)  had inconclusive results due to broad confidence intervals with ICER from potential savings to high costs for an additional QALY, with the majority of ICERs being above the usual NHS thresholds for coverage decisions.\n\nWitt Udsen et al.  (34)  through their study revealed that telehealthcare is unlikely to be cost-effective in addition to usual care.\n\nA total of three out of the 35 studies (3/35, 8.6%) were found to not be cost-effective: two studies in the videoconferencing system category  (28, 37)  and one study in the digital technologies and innovations  (14) . Of the remaining articles, 12 studies (12/35, 34.3%) found digital health interventions gained QALYs with a higher cost at an acceptable ICER when compared with a relative national benchmark (six studies in videoconferencing systems, four studies in text messaging, two studies in telephone support)  (8, 10, 11, 19-21, 23, 24, 26, 33, 34, 36) . Finally, a total of 20 out of the 35 studies (20/35, 57.1%) found the digital health interventions gained higher QALYs with cost-savings (nine studies in videoconferencing systems, one study in text messaging, five studies in web platforms and digital health portals, three studies in mobile phone-based systems and applications, two studies in digital health technologies and innovations)  (7, 9, 12, 13, 15-18, 22, 25, 27, 29-32, 35, 38-41) .\n\nVarious benefits of digital tools to rural realities were underlined in different studies  (15, 17, 23, 25, 28, 32, 39) . This is a very important aspect as it could improve and revolutionize the access to care and quality of treatment for a very large number of patients. Video-conferencing systems offered the greatest advantages in reaching rural areas  (17, 23, 28, 36) , followed by digital technologies and innovations  (15, 25) , web platforms and digital health portals  (32) , mobile phone-based systems and applications  (39) . The most significant achievements in reaching rural areas were found in the USA  (17, 28, 32) , followed by India  (25, 39) , China  (36)  and Madagascar  (15) .\n\nIt is known that cost-effectiveness is a subjective concept since it depends on the willingness to pay (WTP) for specific outcomes. The decision makers' WTP threshold to establish the cost-effectiveness of intervention differs in the literature. For example, in studies from the United Kingdom, a threshold range of \u00a320,000-\u00a330,000/QALY gained is normally used  (45) . While in America  (46)  and Australia (47) they use the amount of 50,000/QALY gained, each in their respective currencies  (48) .\n\nSome studies analyzed digital health interventions that exceeded the threshold  (14, 28, 34, 37)  while others had costs that remained below the threshold  (7) . However, it is crucial to consider that interventions are preferable, even with costs over the threshold, if they improve the outcome with minor or the same costs when compared with standard care."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Firstly, due to the heterogeneity of interventions in the included studies, we could not provide synthetic and general conclusions about costs because most costs were expressed in different values and it was not always possible to make systematic comparisons between them. Secondly, by focusing only on articles written in English, our study may be subject to publication bias and the results should be interpreted appropriately. Thirdly, another source of potential biastypical of economic studies -is the systematic tendency of including/excluding cost items in the analysis. Therefore, results are driven toward a specific perspective, i.e., the social perspective rather than the health systems' perspective. Finally, even if extensively used to evaluate the quality of economic studies in systematic review of economic evaluations, the CHEERS checklist has structural limitations (e.g. different aspects of the study have the same importance, so the completeness of the abstract and methodological issues such as the choice of the model, the assumptions and the management of uncertainties are given the same relevance)."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Despite a growing interest in investing in digital tools in healthcare, the evidence regarding cost-effectiveness of digital tools in the health sector remains scarce and limited.\n\nThrough this review it some evidence was found that digital health interventions can affect cost-effectiveness with a favorable effect both in terms of costs and health outcomes. In particular, the findings showed a positive impact especially for studies that implemented a new mobile application or a web portal intervention. We strongly believe that the findings of this research could be used to better inform and orient health policies. More than half of the studies included report that the use of digital health intervention led to the achievement of a better efficiency and outcomes for patients, the optimization of available human and technological resources and the consistent reduction in the costs of the healthcare services provided. Recognized international examples of digital health practices being successful could be the first step to informing and orienting decision makers to structure a new, evidence-based, digital health maturity.\n\nHowever, due to the heterogeneity across study methods, cost perspectives, disciplines and diseases involved, the comparison between interventions still remains difficult. Further research based on a standardized approach is needed in order to methodically analyze incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, costs and health benefits."

Weight change was converted into a health-related quality of life change score. Mean difference in weight change of the intervention and usual CARE arms with regard to baseline approached statistical significance at the 12-month (-1.4 kg [-2.8 to -0.1]) assessment. The difference in weight change across arms was transformed to QoL change scores for Shape participants and usual care participants (+0.009 and +0.005, respectively) In the base case, the ICER was of US $55,264 per QALY gained Shape intervention is cost-effective based on established benchmarks, indicating that it can be a part of a successful strategy to address the nation's growing obesity epidemic in low-income at-risk communities"
