CF&B may be offered as part of a la carte entrees in the cafeteria, in vending machines, school fundraisers and school stores. Policies for CF&B place limits in the amount of sugar, saturated fat, trans fat, calories from fat, and sodium in entr\u00e9es/snacks, ban certain beverages, and/or restrict the sale of those items to certain times of the day and in different venues (e.g., in stores, vending machines).  12, 13 In 2010, as part of a layered strategy to improve school nutrition environments, CF&B policies (so-called \"Smart Snacks in Schools\") were enacted nationwide through the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA).  13 ven local, state, and national policy activities targeting CF&B over the past two decades, corresponding research into CF&B policy effects, and the urgent need to identify effective interventions to reverse the childhood obesity epidemic,  14, 15  reviews of the evidence about the influences of CF&B policies on obesity are critically important. Prior systematic reviews reported mixed findings about CF&B policy associations with child weight status,  [16] [17] [18] [19]  though those reviews summarized evidence among children overall. The evidence has not been synthesized specifically for children of different sociodemographic subgroups, including gender, grade level or age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. A review of the literature is needed about the influences of CF&B policies on obesity within children of different sociodemographic backgrounds. This synthesis of the evidence is especially relevant in the context of the nationwide Smart Snacks policies and has the potential to inform future nutrition policy decisions at the local, state, and national levels, including HHFKA. This is critically important because prior research has shown racial/ethnic and income differences in the availability of CF&B in schools and child-level consumption of CF&B.  [20] [21] 1] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  Evidence also suggests the associations between CF&B policies, children's diet, and obesity may vary by race/ethnicity, gender, grade, or socioeconomic factors.  23, [27] [28] 8] [29] [30]  Thus, the objectives of this study are to (1) describe the scope of this literature and (2) systematically review the evidence of associations between CF&B policies and child weight status by gender, grade level/ age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors or a combination of these characteristics."

      "text": "This review included published articles that investigated the associations between CF&B policies and obesity according to children's sociodemographic factors. The outcome of interest was weight status, based on body mass index (BMI). PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and ERIC databases were systematically searched. The search terms are included in the supplemental materials (Table  S1 ). Studies were included if they (1) assessed associations between CF&B policies and self-reported (SR) or measured (M) weight status; (2) reported findings stratified by a single factor, reported an interaction by a single factor and/or reported findings stratified by multiple factors combined (e.g., by gender, grade/school age, race/ethnicity, and/or socioeconomic characteristics of schools or children); (3) were published between January 1, 2000, and February 28, 2022; (4) were written in English; and (5) used child samples from the United States and Canada. Studies were included if they examined CF&B policy-weight status associations among any of the sociodemographic subgroups, for example, only included boys or elementary school students. Intervention studies, systematic reviews, studies of samples outside the United States and Canada and outside the K-12 grades, and those that did not examine CF&B policy in relation to obesity were excluded.\n\nTwo researchers independently reviewed the search results from all databases. Four reviewers discussed the final list of the articles to be included in the current review. The references of the selected articles were manually checked to identify additional relevant articles not identified in the searches. The following data were extracted by two researchers: year of publication, study design, sample size, age/grade, study location, description of the CF&B policies, definition and measurement of weight status, and effect estimates. Two researchers reviewed the extracted data against the selected published articles and resolved inconsistencies. The quality of the selected articles was assessed using the modified versions of the Quality Assessment Tools for Observational Cohort and Cross Sectional Studies and Before-After (Pre-Post) Studies with no Control Group from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute  31, 32  (Tables  S2/S3 ). Meta-analyses were unfeasible due to heterogeneity in study methodologies. Thus, we present a narrative review of the findings."

      "text": "Of the 24,607 non-duplicative records identified in the initial searches, 37 were eligible for a full-text review (Figure  1 ). Of those papers, 18 met criteria for inclusion (Table  1 ). Two studies used child samples from Canada,  33, 34  while the remaining papers were from the United States, using national samples, or samples from states and/or other localities, including school districts. Of the 18 selected studies, 12 reported results by single sociodemographic factors including gender, age, and/or race/ethnicity, while six studies reported findings jointly stratified by two more sociodemographic subgroups.\n\nTable  2  summarizes the evidence reported separately by a single sociodemographic factor: gender, grade or age, race/ethnicity or socioeconomic indicators. Grade level or age  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  was the most frequently reported demographic (n = 9), whereas four studies reported results by gender,  33, 36, 42, 43  two papers reported findings by race/ethnicity,  29, 36  and two studies displayed results by socioeconomic factors,  36, 44  using eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) as a proxy (Figure  2 ). Six papers reported results jointly stratified by two or more sociodemographic dimensions.  27, 30, 43, [45] [46] 6] [47]  Studies reported different measures of weight status, including body mass index (BMI), BMI z-scores, overweight, obesity, and/or combined overweight/obesity."

      "text": "The evidence of association between CF&B policies and weight status among gender groups is mixed. Using data from Canada, a study reported a dose-response association between years of exposure to the policies and lower BMI and BMI z-scores among both boys and girls (Table  2 ).  33 When the exposure to the policy was categorized in time intervals, the association was significant after 5 years among boys; among girls, policy effects were apparent after 1.5 years of exposure.  33 Two US studies reported favorable-though nonsignificant-policy associations with overweight/obesity combined and/or obesity among boys.  36, 43 Based on California data from seventh-and ninth-grade girls, Bauhoff showed weak evidence of association between CF&B policies and lower overweight/obesity and obesity relative to public school students elsewhere in the state.  43 A study from Minnesota found that each additional school food policy and practice was significantly associated with a 1.0% lower schoollevel obesity prevalence among girls.  36 Using data from Rhode Island and based on bivariate associations, a study observed BMI and BMI z-scores were higher among both genders 1 year after (2007) versus before the policies (2006). Among boys overweight and obesity prevalence where lower in 2007 compared to 2006, but among girls, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was slightly higher in 2007.  42"

      "text": "Nine studies reported results separately by grade or age group or utilized a sample of children of the same age.  [33] [34] 4] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  Among elementary and high school students, the evidence is mixed, whereas findings tend to be more consistent among middle school students. Among children of elementary school age, one of three studies reported CF&B laws were associated with lower odds of obesity. Using a national US sample, Palakshappa et al found that states with two or more strong laws were significantly associated with lower odds of obesity, but not overweight.  39 Riis et al observed generally no clear evidence of impact of policies for cafeteria and vending machines, though policies for other venues such as school stores or canteens were significantly related to higher obesity.  40 In the same study, changes in the strength of the food policy between 2003 and 2006 were not associated with obesity.  40 A study from Canada reported nonsignificantly higher overweight and significantly higher obesity in the post-versus the pre-policy period.  34 ve studies reported findings among children in middle schools.  33, 35, [38] [39] 9] [40]  Of those, three studies reported modest though generally consistent evidence of favorable associations. Using US national data, data from 23 states, or data from six Canadian provinces, three studies found policy exposure was associated with lower weight status-the evidence was strongest for longer duration of exposure and with the number and strength of the CF&B policies.  33, 35, 39 Conversely, one study found no associations between 2006 policy scores for competitive foods and obesity measured in 2007.  40 Using the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), a study observed that children ages 11-14 in states with weak CF&B laws had significantly higher likelihood of overweight/obesity compared with those in states with no laws.  38 On the other hand, the Author/year of publication Country/state: data source Year of data collection Sample size and age/grade and % minority/location Outcome measurement method Study design Subgroups analyzed separately or combined Bauhoff, 2014 State of California, Los Angeles Unified School District, Fitnessgram (2003, 2005; 2001, 2003m and 2005) for LAUSD and other school districts in the state (control group) n = 133,244 and 173,582; 7th and 9th graders M Before and after differencein-difference analysis with a synthetic control group a Gender; gender and grade Datar & Nicosia, 2017 US (23 states): Military Teenagers Environment Exercise and Nutrition Study (M-TEENS) in spring 2013 and winter 2013-2014.

These studies observed associations between CF&B policies and lower rates of increase in overweight/ obesity or plateaus or declines among multiple subgroups, but the strengths of evidence varied and were weaker for some groups especially girls in seventh and ninth grade.\n\nCF&B policies in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)\n\nwere nonsignificantly associated with lower BMI z-scores, overweight/obesity, and obesity among boys in ninth grade, but with higher weight status among girls.  43 Conversely, a separate study found significantly reduced rates of increase in overweight/obesity after versus before the policies took effect, among fifth-grade boys and girls in the LAUSD and among fifth-grade boys and seventhgraders in the rest of California. The evidence of changes in overweight/obesity trends was unclear among seventh-graders in the LAUSD and fifth-grade girls in the rest of California, although annual changes in overweight/obesity prevalence trends slowed, plateaued, or declined among all subgroups studied.  45 Using statewide data from California on American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN), Filipino, Pacific Islander, and White students in fifth and seventh grades, a study found changes in overweight/obesity trends with plateaus or declines in the period after CF&B policies for all subgroups in fifth grade, though evidence of changes was weak among fifth-grade Filipino girls and boys and AI/AN boys.  30 Among seventh graders, overweight/obesity trends changed, where rates of increase were smaller, were no longer evident, or led to decline in overweight/obesity in the period after the CF&B policies took effect across the majority of the race/ethnic-gender subgroups, although nonsignificant findings were seen among Pacific Islander boys and Filipino girls. CF&B policies were not associated with overweight/obesity among seventh-grade Filipino boys.  30 ing statewide data on fifth-grade California students, a study examined whether CF&B policy-overweight/obesity associations varied by school-neighborhood socioeconomic advantage among boys and girls separately.  27 Prior to the CF&B policies, overweight/obesity trends increased significantly among students attending schools located across all school-neighborhood SES levels; after the policies took effect (2006-2010), the trends appeared to level off among students in the lowest and middle SES tertiles and declined among students in the highest neighborhood SES tertiles; findings were similar for girls and boys. 27 A statewide study of seventh graders saw favorable changes in overweight/obesity trends after versus before CF&B policies took effect among boys in rural, suburban, and urban areas, and among girls in all except urban areas, though the strength of the evidence varied and was weak among girls. 47 Using statewide California data, a study found significant changes in overweight/obesity, where trends tended to decline after versus before the CF&B policies among fifth-and seventh-grade Asian, African American, Latino, and White boys.

      "title": "| DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This systematic review revealed a limited number of studies that have reported findings specific to sociodemographic subgroups. The body of evidence we reviewed covered a period of two decades and consisted of cross-sectional or correlational and pre-post study designs with interrupted time series. Grade level or age was the most commonly reported demographic in studies that stratified the analyses by a single factor. The findings varied for elementary and high school age children, with modest and more consistent evidence in the direction of CF&B policies-obesity associations among middle school students.\n\nFurther, among studies that examined multiple demographics combined (e.g., grade, gender, and/or race/ethnicity), the evidence suggests CF&B associations with slower rates of increase or plateaus or declines in obesity among multiple population subgroups in California, though the strengths of evidence varied.\n\nPrevious reviews  [16] [17] [18]  observed mixed findings about the effects of CF&B policies on childhood obesity overall. Building on this work, the present study summarized the evidence from studies reporting results separately by gender, grade or age, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic advantage, or a combination of these factors.\n\nWe identified less than a handful of studies reporting results from stratified analyses by gender, where stronger evidence of associations between CF&B policies and lower body weight appears to be present among boys than girls. Given gender differences in patterns of consumption of competitive food and beverages in schools,  36, 43  research is needed to examine differential obesity effects of policies to regulate food and beverages outside of school meals across gender groups including possible underlying mechanisms for those differences.\n\nWe observed variable findings for elementary and high school students and modest, though more consistent evidence for middle school youth. There were too few studies which reported results by T A B L E 3 (Continued) Several studies included in this review reported results jointly according to more than one demographic factor, for example, by age/grade and gender, race/ethnicity, or school neighborhood income.\n\nThe evidence from these studies, all using data from California, generally suggests CF&B policy associations with weight status, across multiple (though not all) sociodemographic subgroups. Specifically, relative to the period before CF&B policies, after the policies took effect, obesity increased at a slower pace, plateaued, or declined among multiple population subgroups including students in elementary schools located in varying neighborhood SES levels, and boys of many-but not all-racial/ethnic backgrounds in middle schools. The evidence remains unclear as to the potential impact of CF&B policy in some subgroups including Pacific Islander and Filipino boys in middle schools and girls in fifth grade as well as seventh-grade African American, Latino, and Asian girls. This underscores the need for further investigation into why these policies may not have been as effective for those students in California.\n\nMultiple interrelated factors may explain the variable evidence about the obesity influences of CF&B policies across population subgroups. Those factors include differences in the types of CF&B policies the studies evaluated, differences in school or district-level adherence to the policies, variations in study designs, co-occurring obesity prevention interventions, as well as environmental factors.\n\nThe types of CF&B policies in the studies we reviewed varied in terms of strength and scope. For example, in one study, the policy consisted of vending machine removal. Policies to regulate CF&B in vending machines may have limited influence among younger children because vending machines are typically less available in earlier grades.  48 In other studies, CF&B policies set standards for snacks, entrees, and beverages offered in various school venues, such as vending machines, stores, and cafeterias. Moreover, CF&B policies often included food and beverage provisions for elementary, middle, and high schools, which resulted in differences in strengths of standards across grade levels. In one state-level policy, electrolyte replacement beverages were prohibited in elementary schools but were allowed in middle and high schools with size limits unregulated. In the federal Smart Snacks policy, these beverages are banned in elementary and middle schools and allowed in high schools with size limits up to 12 oz.\n\nAdherence to and implementation of CF&B policies may be another explanation. Evidence suggests adherence to CF&B varied across elementary, middle, and high schools though compliance has improved over time in schools and school districts.  [49] [50] 0] [51]  Additionally, the comprehensiveness of policies governing food and beverages has been associated with district level implementation and with reporting, monitoring, and evaluation,  52, 53  underscoring the need for stronger The studies in this review utilized a mix of designs. We observed some positive associations between CF&B laws and overweight/ obesity among some students in some studies. Studies with generally weaker designs, including use of data from a single time point, hamper the ability to disentangle the temporal sequence between policy exposure and obesity. Some or all the observed positive associations suggest the possibility that states may have implemented stronger laws in response to high child obesity prevalence (i.e., reverse causation).\n\n40,44,54-56 Conversely, some national studies found a lack of associations in states or schools with strong laws, which may be related to lower child obesity prevalence in those places. For example, states or schools may have distinct characteristics associated with healthy weight such as higher socioeconomic advantage, healthier eating patterns, and/or better food and physical activity environments. In contrast other studies included in this review used pre-post with interrupted times series designs or a control group. These studies have the advantage of clear temporal sequence between the policy exposure and body weight, thus improving inferences about policy effects. Isolating the effects of CF&B policies on obesity is challenging, because exposure to these policies is typically non-randomized, and because other strategies to prevent childhood obesity may be occurring simultaneously with these policies. Future studies may advance the field by unpacking the obesity influences of CF&B policies over time and in the context of other interventions. For instance, a simulation study estimated nutrition standards for foods and beverages in schools would have the largest effects in preventing childhood obesity in 2025 versus other interventions (e.g., SSB taxes, menu labeling policies, access to adolescent bariatric surgery). 14 Environmental factors could play a role in the heterogeneity of findings across studies. The food environment near schools may enhance or undermine the effectiveness of CF&B policies, especially among children depending on their age/grade level, and food environment near their schools. 57,58 Relative to elementary and middle school children, youth in high schools may be allowed off campus during lunchtime; thus, youth may be more likely to purchase and consume unhealthy foods and beverages from food outlets near high schools. Similarly, children of color often attend schools with greater concentrations of fast food and convenience stores nearby. Future research should assess differential associations between CF&B policies, the food environment near schools, and obesity. This review has limitations. We excluded studies published in languages other than English and studies with samples outside of Canada and the United States. Given the global increase in childhood obesity, it is imperative to incorporate strategies to prevent and mitigate youth obesity epidemics everywhere. One study from China examined policies similar to those studied here in relation to overweight/obesity, reporting mixed associations among girls but not boys, 59 which is consistent with US evidence presented in this review. Studies from non-US countries are needed to provide insights on the effectiveness of policies that regulate food and beverages outside of school meals to determine potential differential policy influences across population subgroups in those countries. This review also did not include studies that stratified samples based on other sociodemographic factors, for example, children with or without special health care needs. 60 Future research is needed to include disaggregated analyses based on children's sexual and gender identity/orientation, immigration status, and other factors that may influence dietary patterns and obesity so that we can identify subgroups who are in most need for interventions and policies to improve diet and nutritional outcomes. The papers included in this review were not assessed in terms of their ability to isolate the impact on obesity of the CF&B policies in the context of other interventions that may have been occurring simultaneously with the policies."

      "title": "| Implications",
      "text": "The present review found that over the period of 22 years, the accumulated body of evidence focused on population subgroups of children is relatively limited. Nevertheless, collectively, the findings have implications for future evaluations on the obesity effects of CF&B policies. While policies to regulate food and beverages in schools were not designed to specifically target reduction of obesity disparities by race and ethnicity, those policies may influence disparities because of differences in children's consumption of CF&B items by gender, racial/ethnic, and/or socioeconomic factors.  21, 29 This, in turn, may influence policy effects on obesity differently across population subgroups. For example, following the California CF&B policy, overweight/obesity disparities slightly narrowed between seventh-grade African American and Latino versus White boys, whereas prior to the policies, disparities between these groups were widening.  46 Moreover, national nutritional environment components similar to the USDA standards for CF&B are associated with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity among non-White high school students, whereas no association was detected among White students.  61 New studies are needed to systematically assess the impact of CF&B policies along with the national Smart Snacks policy on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity. Additionally, varying geographies may affect the nature and characteristics of the child samples such as the racial/ethnic distribution, the baseline obesity prevalence, and the scope and duration of exposure to the policies in those places.\n\nThe studies that examined a combination of various sociodemographic and locational data in the subgroup analyses were from California. There is a need to replicate similar subgroup analyses in other places across the United States and other countries that enact similar school nutrition policies.\n\nIt is perhaps implausible to expect CF&B policies would have the same effects among diverse population subgroups, because of differences in exposure to structural factors including the social determinants of health.  [62] [63] 3] [64]  Children attend schools often located in vastly different neighborhoods of varying income levels and healthpromoting or damaging resources including food outlets  58, 65  that carry healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages. To thoroughly understand reasons for mixed findings in this field, future studies with improved designs are needed that disaggregate analyses by more than one population subgroup, particularly grade, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic markers. Research is warranted to identify population subgroups who may be more likely to benefit from the policies and/or for whom targeted obesity prevention interventions are needed. Increasing and strengthening this body of evidence is necessary to evaluate the degree of consistency in the influences of CF&B policies on obesity across populations, places, and time and to enable thorough assessments of policy effectiveness.\n\nThe presence of the historic national policy for Smart Snacks coupled with the variation in state-level CF&B policies offers analytic opportunities to study the separate and combined effects of those policies on diet and obesity but also other child outcomes. An exemplar study exploited the strength and temporal and geographic differences among the state and national policies to evaluate CF&B policy associations with adolescent consumption of fruit and vegetables.  66 idence suggests significant improvements in the school food environment.  67 Based on data from the School Meal Nutrition Cost study, researchers observed that greater availability of healthy beverages is associated with lower consumption of unhealthy beverages among high schoolers. Further, strong CF&B policies is associated with healthier school food environments, and lower consumption of unhealthy beverages.  51 Using the same dataset, a comprehensive report 68 observed that the vast majority of school breakfast (74%) and lunch (86%) participants consume competitive foods. School This, in turn, will enable thorough assessments of CF&B policy effectiveness in promoting healthy weight across all children and youth."

      "text": "breakfast and lunch participants respectively consumed 125 and 150 cal from competitive foods. A high proportion of these calories comes from low-nutrient, energy-dense foods (68% and 66% for breakfast and lunch participants, respectively). Continued programmatic and policy efforts are needed to implement population-level strategies to improve nutrition quality and prevent obesity among children. While the evidence reviewed here is limited and mixed for current CF&B policies, some of that evidence suggests the strengths of policies could play a role in reducing youth obesity or halting upward trends. Strengthened nutrition policy interventions with provisions to further restrict availability of low-nutrient energy-dense foods and beverages and to allocate resources for schools to support full policy implementation may hold promise in improving population-level children's weight status specifically and health more broadly.5 | CONCLUSIONThis study reviewed evidence over the past two decades and revealed a limited number of studies on the associations between CF&B policies and obesity within gender, grade, or race/ethnicity and socioeconomic subgroups. Many studies have reported findings separately by grade level or age, though there is less evidence by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic factors. The prevalence of childhood obesity remains high and varies across multiple sociodemographic factors, with disproportionately high burden among children of different races and ethnicities and children of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Future studies using stronger designs are needed that disaggregate analyses by more than one demographic subgroup, particularly grade, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic markers, to help understand reasons for the variable findings. Additionally, research is warranted to reveal population subgroups for whom policies may have been more or less effective in preventing childhood obesity. Expanding and strengthening this body of evidence will help evaluate the degree of consistency in the influences of CF&B policies on obesity across populations, places, and time."
