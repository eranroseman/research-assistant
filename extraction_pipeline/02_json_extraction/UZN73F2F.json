      "text": "likely than telephonic options to be used by young people  (Haner & Pepler, 2016; Mokkenstorm et al., 2017) . Young people are also more likely to discuss \"weighty problems,\" like mental health problems and suicide, on an online platform than by telephone  (Haner & Pepler, 2016; Fukkink & Hermanns, 2009) . Calls, texts, or chats to 988 will connect distressed individuals to trained crisis counselors of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Lifeline) network of over 200 certified crisis centers in 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The positive impact of 988 depends upon the effectiveness of the services provided by the U.S. mental health and suicide crisis response system  (Gould & Lake, 2021) .\n\nThe nation's largest provider of crisis counseling via text is Crisis Text Line (CTL) ( https://www.crisi stext line.  org/ ). CTL is a non-profit organization that provides free, 24/7 crisis counseling services via text messaging across the country; their volunteer crisis counselors (CCs) have engaged in nearly 7 million text-based conversations since its 2013 inception  (Crisis Text Line, 2022) . CCs receive 30 h of interactive online training in building rapport using deescalation and good contact techniques; risk assessment; collaborative problem-solving; and action planning. Once on the proprietary platform, they receive close supervision from salaried mental health professionals monitoring the text conversations. Research using CTL anonymized data has contributed to knowledge about texters' presenting psychosocial issues  (Szlyk et al., 2020) , help-seeking behavior by rural adolescents  (Thompson et al., 2018) , and suicide contagion following Netflix's release of 13 Reasons Why  (Sugg et al., 2019) . However, no study has yet focused on texters' perceptions of effectiveness of CTL's service.\n\nNumerous pertinent evaluations have been conducted of the Lifeline (see  Gould & Lake, 2021  for a summary of this evidence). These evaluations bolstered support for establishing the national three-digit crisis number and provided substantial evidence regarding effectiveness for suicidal individuals. Findings include: significant reductions in intent to die, hopelessness, and psychological pain over the course of their crisis call  (Gould et al., 2007) ; post-call follow-ups with callers have a positive impact-80% of interviewed callers indicated that the follow-up intervention stopped them from killing themselves, and 91% reported that it kept them safe  (Gould et al., 2018) ; crisis counselors secure caller collaboration on an intervention on over 75% of imminent risk calls  (Gould et al., 2016) ; and emergency services are involved on 43% of imminent risk calls from the person at risk  (Gould et al., 2016) , and on 58% of calls from concerned third parties (e.g., friends or family members)  (Gould, Lake et al., 2022) . In February 2022, CTL officially became a Lifeline network center.\n\nThe Lifeline Crisis Chat (LCC) network, which serves all ages, has grown extensively since its formal establishment in 2013, answering over 200,000 chats in 2020  (Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021) . A study assessing the effectiveness of LCC employed 13,130 linked preand post-chat surveys  (Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021) . Chatters were significantly less distressed at the end of the chat intervention than the beginning. This is important because the vast majority seeking help from LCC were highly distressed. Moreover, almost 84% of LCC chatters endorsed either current or recent suicidal ideation on the pre-chat survey-markedly higher than the estimated 23% of Lifeline callers identified by silent monitors as suicidal on the day of or day before their calls. Findings aligned with research reporting that crisis chatters reveal higher rates of suicidal ideation than crisis callers  (Fukkink & Hermanns, 2009; Haner & Pepler, 2016; Lake et al., 2022) . By the chat's conclusion, two-thirds of suicidal chatters reported the chat as helpful and nearly half reported being less suicidal, offering empirical evidence for the effectiveness of Lifeline's crisis chat services.\n\nLifeline added crisis text services in 2021; this service has not yet been evaluated. Thus, the current evaluation of CTL is both novel and critically needed. We designed this evaluation to parallel our earlier evaluation of LCC  (Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021) , employing similar measures and methods where feasible, to provide comparable effectiveness information. This study's overarching goal is examining texters' perceptions of the effectiveness of CTL's intervention for the general population of texters and particularly suicidal texters. Specific aims focus on (i) the extent to which texters feel their CCs are genuinely concerned about them; (ii) texters' perceptions of CTL's effectiveness, as assessed by the extent to which texters feel the conversation was helpful and whether they reported feeling more hopeful, less depressed, less overwhelmed, and less suicidal at the text intervention's conclusion; and (iii) the relationship between texters' perceptions of CTL effectiveness and texters' personal characteristics, number of CTL conversations during a 12-month period, and perceptions of CCs' genuine concern. With the imminent transition to 988 as the nationwide number for suicide prevention and mental health crisis response, the role of textbased crisis interventions in the U.S. will increase greatly. The current evaluation of CTL is thus more important and timelier than ever."

CTL provided the research team with anonymized and de-identified CC reports and voluntary texter surveys gathered from all crisis text conversations with 10 or more messages initiated by texters during a 12-month period  (October 12, 2017 -October 11, 2018) . CTL did not provide surveys for conversations with fewer than 10 messages as these are expected to not be meaningfully engaged with the service."

Of 380,850 unique, valid texters who texted on behalf of themselves during the study period, 85,877 (22.5%) responded to at least the texter survey's first item: \"Did you find this conversation helpful?\" We selected each texter's first conversation in which they completed the first item, yielding a dataset wherein one conversation represented each unique texter. The sample's demographic characteristics are described in detail in our companion article  (Pisani et al., 2022) . In brief, 65.6% of the 81,056 texters reporting their age were aged 14-24; the remainder were 13 or younger (10.3%); 25-44 (19.8%); 45-64 (4.1%) and 65 or older (0.2%). The 71,252 texters who responded to the question about their race identified themselves as: White (53.3%); Hispanic/Latinx (13.1%); Black/ African American (8.2%); Asian (3.5%); American Indian/ Alaska Native (1.1%); Middle Eastern/North African/ Arab (0.6%); Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander only (0.4%). An additional 11.9% identified as \"more than one,\" 2.4% responded \"other\" and 5.6% preferred not to answer. Of the 72,310 texters who reported their gender, 77.2% identified as female, 13.4% as male and 7.7% as a gender minority (trans male (2.3%), trans female (0.4%), genderqueer (2.0%), agender (1.0%), \"other\" (2.0%)).

A detailed description of data preparation and the comparison of the texters with a survey to those without are described in  Pisani et al. (2022) . We explored an inverse probability weighting procedure using 237 independent variables from the CC reports, metadata (e.g., time of day, number of messages in a conversation), and counts of word sequences from text messages to adjust for differences. The weighted-and unweighted-point estimates of the covariates used in our analyses were very close, signaling that weights did not add meaningfully to our understanding of the population. Statistics unweighted for texter survey completion were thus generated and reported for all analyses.\n\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for texters' perceptions of their CCs' genuine concern for them, and for all effectiveness outcomes. Descriptive statistics of the suicidal outcome only included responses from texters for whom CCs indicated at least Thoughts of Suicide on the Suicide Risk Ladder. Associations were tested between texters' perceptions of their CCs' genuine concern and the following covariates: age, race, gender, sexual orientation, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, social isolation, suicide risk, topics discussed in the conversation (\"issue tags\"), and conversation frequency. The five texter survey effectiveness outcomes' associations with all aforementioned covariates, including texters' perceptions of their CCs' genuine concern, were tested.\n\nIn the data, missing values occurred in both outcomes and covariates. We handled both types of missingness under the missing at random assumption. Missing values in covariates were adjusted for by including a binary missingness indicator variable corresponding to each covariate with the prevalence of missingness >5%. We deleted observations corresponding to variables with <5% missingness prevalence. The missing values in outcomes were adjusted for using inverse probability of weighting approach. We first fit logistic regressions to predict the missingness in the outcomes, including all covariates and their corresponding missing-indicators as independent variables. We then performed our analyses using individuals with observed outcomes where each individual was weighted by the inverse of their probability of being a complete case (i.e., the outcome being observed). In the inverse probability weighted analyses, weights rebalanced the set of complete cases, such that it represents the whole sample. Weighted proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) or binary logistic regression models were estimated depending on the nature of the dependent variable, with all covariates entered at the same time.\n\nOdds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each outcome and covariate, adjusting for all the other covariates. Reference groups used in the analyses were either the covariates' most prevalent categories or the categories representing the absence or lowest values. Given the large sample size, many statistically significant odds ratios were expected; we, therefore, highlighted statistically significant odds ratios that we considered to be \"clinically meaningful\" using an a priori threshold of 20% higher (or lower) odds ratio (i.e., \u22651.20 [and for lower odds ratios we used the reciprocal, \u22640.83]).\n\nThe study's protocol involving secondary analysis of de-identified data without access to links was considered to meet Federal and University criteria for exemption by the University of Rochester's Institutional Review Board (IRB) and not to meet the definition of Human Subjects research requiring review by the New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Department of Psychiatry's IRB."

However, among the subset of suicidal texters, those younger than 14 also had significantly higher odds than 14-24-year-olds of reporting themselves as more suicidal at the conversation's end (OR = 1.56; CI = 1.39, 1.75).\n\nT A B L E 1 Relationship between texter's perception of crisis counselor's genuine concern and their personal characteristics Texter's perception of counselor's genuine concern? a n (of yes) Row % b OR (95% Cl) c Total (N = 66,912/85,877) d 55,959 83.6/65.2 b -Age 13 or younger (N = 5792) 5145 88.8 1.49 (1.38, 1.63) i 14-24 (N = 42,606) e 35,938 84.3 25-44 (N = 13,463) 10,860 80.7 0.76 (0.72, 0.80) i 45-64 (N = 2517) 2066 82.1 0.78 (0.70, 0.86) 65+ (N = 104) 90 86.5 1.11 (0.64, 1.92) Gender Female (N = 44,499) e 39,260 84.4 Male (N = 7831) 6580 84.0 1.01 (0.959, 1.08) Gender minority (N = 4601) f 3858 83.9 0.99 (0.91, 1.08) Missing (N = 7981) 6261 78.4 0.76 (0.66, 0.87) i Race Asian (N = 2123) 1739 81.9 0.78 (0.70, 0.88) i Black or African American (4975) 4258 85.6 1.08 (1.00, 1.19) Hispanic, Latinx, or Spanish origin (N = 7792) 6736 86.4 1.14 (1.05, 1.21) White (N = 31,814) e 26,802 84.2 Middle Eastern, North African, or Arab + American Indian/Alaska Native + Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (N = 1215) g 1026 84.4 0.98 (0.84, 1.14) More than one (N = 7025) 5993 85.3 1.05 (0.97, 1.12) Other-write in (N = 1258) 1049 83.4 0.91 (0.78, 1.05) Prefer not to answer (N = 3192) 2396 75.1 0.61 (0.56, 0.67) i Missing (N = 14,625) 5960 79.3 0.63 (0.50, 0.78) i Sexual orientation Heterosexual (N = 31,189) e 26,354 84.5 All other sexual identities (N = 28,198) h 23,607 83.7 0.96 (0.91, 1.00) Missing (N = 7525) 5998 79.7 1.47 (1.17, 1.85) i Depression symptoms Below cutoff (N = 13,523) e 11,871 87.8 Above cutoff (N = 51,759) 42,715 82.5 0.78 (0.73, 0.83) i Anxiety symptoms Below cutoff (N = 12,636) e 10,955 86.7 Above cutoff (N = 52,666) 43,659 82.9 0.92 (0.87, 0.98) Social isolation Below cutoff (N = 17,311) e 15,207 87.8 Above cutoff (N = 47,938) 39,355 82.1 0.70 (0.66, 0.74) i Suicide risk ladder None (N = 51,490) e 43,158 83.8 Suicidal thoughts (N = 8955) 7402 82.7 0.94 (0.88, 0.99) Plan (N = 2174) 1795 82.6 0.96 (0.86, 1.07) Accessible means (N = 3387) 2818 83.2 0.97 (0.89, 1.06) Timeframe withing 24 h (N = 906) 786 86.8 1.37 (1.13, 1.66) i\n\nNo associations of gender with outcomes met our criterion of a \"clinically meaningful\" odds ratio; only texters with missing responses had significantly lower odds than female texters of reporting the conversation as helpful (OR = 0.75; CI = 0.65, 0.87). Similarly, regarding sexual orientation, only texters with missing responses had significantly higher odds than heterosexual texters of reporting feeling more overwhelmed at the conversation's conclusion (OR = 1.22; CI = 1.02, 1.46).\n\nFew significant and clinically meaningful associations between race and outcomes emerged: Black/African American texters had higher odds than White texters of reporting being more overwhelmed (OR = 1.21; CI = 1.13, 1.28) or suicidal (OR = 1.23; CI = 1.08, 1.41) at the conversation's conclusion. Hispanic texters had higher odds than White texters of reporting their conversations as helpful (OR = 1.28; CI = 1.18, 1.40). However, absolute differences in the percentages of reported outcomes between White and Black/African or Hispanic texters were small. For example, 8.3% of Black/African texters reported being more overwhelmed at the conversation's conclusion compared to 6.1% of White texters (Table  S4 ). Similarly, 6.8% of Black/African American texters reported being more suicidal at the end of the conversation compared to 4.7% of White texters (Table  S5 ). Of Hispanic texters, 9.4% reported that the conversation was not helpful compared to 12.5% of White texters (Table  S1 ).\n\nTexters who scored above the clinical cutoff on the depression, anxiety, and social isolation scales had significantly lower odds than their less symptomatic counterparts of reporting positive outcomes (i.e., finding the conversation helpful or reporting feeling more hopeful after the text) and significantly higher odds of reporting being more depressed, overwhelmed, or suicidal at the conversation's conclusion (Table  3 ). For example, 49.7% of suicidal texters who also scored above the cutoff for depression reported feeling less suicidal, and 6.1% indicated being more suicidal at the end of\n\nTexter's perception of counselor's genuine concern? a n (of yes) Row % b OR (95% Cl) c\n\nTopics discussed in conversation Depression -No (N = 38,616) e 32,238 83.5 Depression -Yes (N = 28,296) 23,721 83.8 1.10 (1.05, 1.14) Eating problems -No (N = 64,565) e 53,986 83.6 Eating problems -Yes (N = 2347) 1973 84.1 0.96 (0.86, 1.07) Substance problems -No (N = 65,519) e 54,786 83.6 Substance problems -Yes (N = 1393) 1173 84.1 1.10 (0.95, 1.26) Physical abuse -No (N = 65,680) e 54,898 83.6 Physical abuse -Yes (N = 1232) 1061 86.1 1.20 (1.02, 1.41) i Sexual abuse -No (N = 65,120) e 54,413 83.6 Sexual abuse -Yes (N = 1792) 1546 86.3 1.21 (1.06, 1.38) i Conversation frequency 1 Conversation (N = 42,960) e 35,856 83.5 2 to 10 Conversations (N = 22,742) 19,100 84.0 1.01 (0.97, 1.06) More than 10 Conversations (N = 1210) 1003 83.0 0.95 (0.82, 1.12) a\n\nResponses to \"I feel my counselor was genuinely concerned for my well-being\" were dichotomized so that \"somewhat agree\" and \"strongly agree\" were combined (\"agree\") and \"strongly disagree\" \"somewhat disagree,\" and \"neither agree or disagree\" were combined (\"did not agree\") in the analysis. b These are unweighted percentages.\n\nc The ORs are based on weighted analyses, with all covariates included simultaneously in the logistic regression models.\n\nd\n\nThe total number of texters is 85,877, of which 66,912 had non-missing responses on the outcome, \"Texter's Perception of Counselor's Genuine Concern.\" Unlike the Total row, the percentages of \"yes\" responses for each covariate value are based on the N of non-missing responses as the denominator, not the total N.

Crisis counselors' ratings of texters on the Suicide Risk Ladder were statistically significantly associated with outcomes. Suicidal texters had statistically lower odds than non-suicidal texters of reporting the conversation as helpful, or of reporting feeling more hopeful at the end (Table  3 ). They also had higher odds of reporting feeling more depressed, overwhelmed, or suicidal. For example, 9.5% of texters with a suicide plan or accessible means reported being more depressed at the end of the conversation, and approximately 21% of each group reported being less depressed. Among non-suicidal texters, 5.3% reported feeling more depressed and 29% indicated they were less depressed at the end of the conversation (Table  S3 ).\n\nTopics that texters discussed with CCs (depression, eating problems, substance problems, physical abuse, sexual abuse) were not associated with texters' perceptions of their conversations' effectiveness, with the exception of texters who discussed physical abuse. These texters had higher odds of reporting finding conversations helpful (OR = 1.26; CI = 1.04, 1.52), or that they were more hopeful (OR = 1.21; CI = 1.08, 1.36) or less suicidal (OR = 0.75; CI = 0.58, 0.96) at the conversation's conclusion.\n\nTexters' perception of CCs' concern was significantly and meaningfully associated with their perceptions of the text's effectiveness, yielding the largest associations with all outcomes compared to any other covariate. More positive feedback about CCs was found to yield nearly 24 times higher odds of texters reporting their conversations were helpful, and 7.2 times higher odds of feeling more hopeful at the end of the conversation. Moreover, texters who perceived their CCs as having genuine concern for them had lower odds of being more depressed (OR = 0.18; CI = 0.17, 0.18), overwhelmed (OR = 0.22; CI = 0.21, 0.23), or suicidal (OR = 0.16; CI = 0.14, 0.17) at the end of the conversation (Table  3 ). The percentage of texters who reported their conversations to be helpful was 14.5% if they strongly disagreed that their CC was genuinely concerned for their well-being, 34.2% if they somewhat disagreed, 61.3% if they neither agreed or disagreed, 88.4% if they somewhat agreed, and 98.1% if they strongly agreed (Table  S1 ). Similarly, the percentage of texters who reported being more hopeful by the conversation's conclusion was 8.9% if they strongly disagreed that their CC was genuinely concerned for their well-being, 11.5% if they somewhat disagreed, 18.9% if they neither agreed or disagreed, 38.4% if they somewhat agreed, and 62.0% if they strongly agreed (Table  S2 ).\n\nConversation frequency was significantly associated with texters' perceptions of effectiveness, as indicated by the significance and direction of odds ratios for all outcomes. Compared to texters with one conversation, those with 2-10 conversations or >10 had 1.6 and 2.7 times the odds of being more suicidal at the end of the conversation, respectively. Similarly, texters with >10 conversations had higher odds of reporting being more depressed (OR = 1.33; CI = 1.17, 1.50), overwhelmed (OR = 1.26; CI = 1.12, 1.42), or suicidal (OR = 2.72; CI = 2.16, 3.42) at the conversation's conclusion. Conversely, they had lower odds of reporting the conversation as helpful (OR = 0.83; CI = 0.71, 0.98) or feeling more hopeful (OR = 0.75; CI = 0.67, 0.84) (Table  3 ) at the end. Among suicidal texters with >10 conversations, 10.3% reported being more suicidal at the end of the conversation, compared to 6.8% of those with 2-10 conversations and 3.9% of those with only one (Table  S5 ).\n\nT A B L E 2 Texter's perceptions of text's effectiveness Effectiveness outcomes N % a Did you find this conversation helpful?

Most CTL texters (86.5%) found their conversations with a CC helpful, with a substantial minority reporting feeling more hopeful (37.8%), less depressed (27.6%), less overwhelmed (39.5%), and suicidal texters reporting feeling less suicidal (46.1%). A broad theme across our findings was their similarity to results of the evaluation of Lifeline's chat crisis services  (Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021) , which provides a key benchmark due to similarity in measures and setting, something found rarely in this field.

See the Terms and Conditions ( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions ) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | 593\n\nevaluation found that 66.8% of Lifeline chatters reported finding their conversation helpful, 31.5% were more hopeful, 26.8% were less depressed, 37.5% were less overwhelmed, and 45% of suicidal chatters were less suicidal. When interpreting comparisons with the chat evaluation, it should be noted that the CTL sample was 23% suicidal, whereas the Lifeline chat sample was almost 84% suicidal.\n\nAs the current findings note, suicidal texters had somewhat less positive outcomes than non-suicidal texters, which might partially explain the slightly less positive perceptions among Lifeline chatters, most of whom were suicidal, compared to CTL texters-most of whom were not.\n\nTexter perceptions of CCs' genuine concern for them had the strongest associations with perceived effectiveness of the text conversation in the current study. This association is highlighted in earlier studies of crisis interventions. Mishara et al. (2007)  found that counselors' behaviors underlying callers' engagement with counselors were significantly related to positive outcomes for crisis callers. Similarly, an earlier Lifeline evaluation  (Gould et al., 2016)  found that higher levels of engagement enhanced counselors' chances of mitigating imminent suicide risk through collaborative interventions and reduced needing to involve emergency services. Lifeline chatters' engagement with counselors-measured by the feeling that their counselors were genuinely concerned for their well-being and understood them, or that they agreed with the counselor on plans-had the strongest associations with chatters' perceptions that the chat was effective. Counselors' success in engaging callers, chatters, and texters may facilitate \"comforting communication\" to reduce emotional distress  (Caplan & Turner, 2007) . These findings support CTL's emphasis on training volunteer CCs in building rapport using \"good contact\" techniques (Crisis Text Line, 2017) and Lifeline's policy on good contact and active engagement with all callers  (Draper et al., 2015) .\n\nYounger texters were more likely to find the conversation helpful than older texters, despite controlling for younger texters' more favorable perception of the CC's genuine concern and the remaining covariates. Older texters were more likely to be less hopeful, and more depressed, overwhelmed, and suicidal at the end of the conversation. While CTL appears to address the needs of individuals aged 24 years or younger, who represent three-quarters of CTL texters, more attention is needed to appeal to and more effectively intervene with texters across the lifespan. Lifeline's chat services were similarly more effective for minors than older age groups  (Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021) .\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study examining the association of a crisis service's effectiveness with a client's race (although limited information is available regarding association with ethnicity). Thus, the current study addresses a critical knowledge gap about disparities in health care quality in the U.S.  (Fiscella & Sanders, 2016) . Texters who identified as Black or African American had higher odds than White texters of reporting being more overwhelmed or suicidal at the end of the conversation, even after controlling for all covariates. However, the magnitude of the differences in outcomes reported by Black or White texters was relatively small and, importantly, no differences emerged concerning perceptions of CCs' genuine concern, the conversation's overall helpfulness, or their hopefulness or depression at the conversation's conclusion. Texters who identified as Hispanic/Latinx/ of Spanish origin provided more favorable feedback than White texters about the helpfulness of CTL's conversations. This is consistent with findings from an evaluation of Lifeline's crisis center follow-up initiative showing that Hispanic callers had a more positive perception of the intervention-specifically, they had higher odds than non-Hispanic callers of saying that follow-up calls stopped them from killing themselves and kept them safe  (Gould et al., 2018) .\n\nGiven the high prevalence of mental health symptoms among CTL texters and the small proportion who reported receiving professional help  (Pisani et al., 2022) , our findings underscore a need to focus within and beyond CTL on long-term needs of texters with the most severe mental health concerns. Several of the current findings highlight that the most distressed texters (those with high depression, anxiety, social isolation and frequent texting) felt less relieved at the end of their crisis conversation than asymptomatic texters or those who texted only once during the study period. Depressed, anxious and socially isolated texters had lower odds than less symptomatic texters of reporting the conversation as helpful or feeling more hopeful afterward and had significantly higher odds of reporting feeling more depressed, overwhelmed, or suicidal at the end of the conversation. Individuals who frequently texted (i.e., 10 or more times in the one-year study period) had a similar pattern of results as symptomatic texters. Providing relevant and accessible referrals to texters is a key component of CTL's training (Crisis Text Line, 2017); its enhancement is recommended to build more effective ways of connecting the most distressed texters with various kinds of follow-up care and evidence-based interventions.\n\nCrisis Text Line's ability to reduce suicidality in nearly half of suicidal texters can be considered a clinically meaningful accomplishment. This reduction in risk at a moment of crisis can provide texters with an opportunity to seek further help and engage in additional interventions that could save lives and have prolonged impact. Our finding that nearly half of suicidal texters reported feeling less suicidal after the text conversation is comparable to the reduction in suicidal ideation among chatters at the end of Lifeline crisis chat interventions  (Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021) . This level of improvement mirrors the range of improvements reported after psychotherapy  (Strauss et al., 2021) . In contrast to CTL's positive outcomes, yet consistent with Lifeline crisis chat outcomes  (Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021) , a small minority of all texters did not feel their conversations were helpful (13.5%) or felt less hopeful (6.4%), more depressed (5.9%), more overwhelmed (6.3%) or more suicidal (5.1%) after their conversations. While it would be ideal to have all or nearly all texters experiencing an improvement at the end of conversations, this is an unrealistic expectation given this population's distress levels  (Pisani et al., 2022)  and similar findings of worsening symptoms for a small portion of patients following psychotherapy  (Strauss et al., 2021) .\n\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, only 22.5% of texters completed the voluntary post-conversation survey. The survey weighting strategy we explored did not add meaningfully to our understanding of the population  (Pisani et al., 2022) . However, there are likely to be other factors, not measured in this study, that are associated with the completion of the survey and could yield some unknown bias. Second, we defined our sample for the current evaluation based on whether texters answered the first item in the survey. While this choice produced the largest sample size, it introduced a great deal of itemlevel missingness. This was the rationale for conducting weighted analyses to account for missingness in both covariates and outcomes. Third, this evaluation focused on post-conversation surveys from texters who exchanged at least 10 messages in their conversation. Thus, we do not know anything about individuals who disengaged before reaching a CC or abandoned the conversation before exchanging 10 messages. Finally, this evaluation covers short-term self-reported outcomes, and includes no follow-up beyond the immediate post-conversation period.\n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, the study has numerous strengths. This is the first study to estimate the effectiveness of CTL, the largest provider of crisis text-based services in the U.S. Furthermore, the size and diversity of the sample provided enough statistical power to assess the differential effectiveness of the intervention by race-the first such assessment for any crisis intervention. The large sample size also allowed us to examine the relationship of the outcomes with several texter characteristics and their perceived engagement with their CCs, crucial elements to person-centered care.\n\nIn conclusion, our study offers novel empirical evidence for the short-term effectiveness of CTL's services. The vast majority of texters reported that the conversation was helpful, and a sizeable minority reported feeling more hopeful, less depressed, less overwhelmed, and less suicidal after their conversation. The finding that nearly half of suicidal texters reported feeling less suicidal after the intervention aligns with Lifeline crisis chat intervention's reduction of suicidal risk and may represent the level of accomplishment that is feasible in one crisis session. Our findings also provide some empirical evidence for CTL's success in addressing unique needs of racially and ethnically diverse populations. Overall, texters across different races and ethnicities perceived their CTL CCs as having genuine concern for them and the effectiveness of the service was largely similar for all texters. This is a step toward overcoming racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care in the U.S.  (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2015) ."
